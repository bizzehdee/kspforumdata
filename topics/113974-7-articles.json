Slowly, the sun clawed its way into the morning sky, shifting the colors from crimson, to red, to brilliant scarlet, before fading away to unblemished, sparkling white. Snow. Perhaps a shy meter of it had fallen in the night. Little more than a dusting, really, and not a flake of it had been plowed yet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina sat watching, perched high on the roof of the VAB. The light morning breeze pulled long clouds of breath from her lips and numbed her face against the loose lock of hair blowing across it, but she didn\u0027t mind, the cold never bothered her anyway. This... this was her favorite time of all, the morning after the first snowfall. It always seemed like the world had been soothed and refreshed: stains covered over, harsh edges softened, all bathed in muted silence. Before her, all was pure, flowing white as far as she could see, like creation born anew. She knew it wouldn\u0027t last, it never did, but it was here, now. And it was beautiful.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot even footprints broke smooth white sheet below. She thought everyone on the facility must still be sleeping off the consequences of last night\u0027s festivities. Or were simply buried under the snow. Either way, it gave her a welcome moment of peace on this perfect morning to think.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast night\u0027s events had yet to fully sink in.\u00A0It still didn\u0027t seem real. After the ceremony, there was, of course, the bureaucracy. Forms had to be signed, documents initialed, photographs taken, and new docket of paper to be checked, please. Then the interviews, the photographs, the hand-shaking. It had all seemed distant and dream-like. Her parents had been pardoned of all wrongdoing, but she still hadn\u0027t the slightest idea what they\u0027d actually \u003Cem\u003Edone\u003C/em\u003E, and no one could... or would, tell her. There had been a thinly veiled tension in the air. The Empress\u0027s decree seemed to have surprised everyone. \u003Cem\u003EMore\u003C/em\u003E politics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBah, she \u003Cem\u003Ehated\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0politics!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, Valentina suspected, the politics of the Ussari Union were the least of her worries. The voice had continued to twitter and hiss in her mind all night long, but distantly, as if afraid to come near. It had quieted down to nothing in the last few minutes, too. She let out a long breath of cloud, and leaned back against... well, whatever it was she was sitting on up here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts came random and disjointed, and Valentina let her mind meander through them. She\u0027d been to space for the last time again, she realized that. She was lucky to have the gained the short time she did. She also realized with a wince, that was a horrid way to think about it, yet there it was. Up there, despite the gravity of the situation, everything seemed to make sense. Of course, it was easy to look back on it now and think that. They would never let her go near a rocket again, she suspected. But some part of her wanted to stay up there forever.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina gazed out over the perfect, white, unbroken snow. Somewhere under all that, was a shadow. It moved, unseen and unnoticed, like \u00A0subterranean beetles that gnawed on tree roots, and in doing so toppled even the mightiest of them. It was scheming, stalking, corrupting to its own pattern, but... Staring at nothing, her eyes widened just slightly, then narrowed. If it has to work by schemes and shadows, if it cannot simply \u003Cem\u003Etake\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0what it wants, then somehow, it is still weak. It \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be fought.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut how? Blood oaths by M\u00FCnlight were all well and good, but she needed answers, some place to begin. It wouldn\u0027t simply fall into her lap--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething fell into her lap.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I thought I might find you up here,\u0022 Dibella said, pulling herself up onto the equipment box and plopping down next to Valentina in a flurry of snowflakes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina lifted the small, white box, \u0022what is this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella looked at her, a touch of color rising in her cheeks, \u0022with all that happened, I never got a chance to thank you properly... for saving my life...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh no,\u0022 Valentina tried to hand the box back, \u0022you do not have to do that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella didn\u0027t take it, \u0022yes. Yes, I do. Go on, open it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina did so reluctantly, then gasped. She lifted the object reverently from the box and turned it over in her bare hands. It a brilliant red disc-like jewel, with a clasp and chain of thick, iridescent metal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It is beautiful...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The setting is new, I had it made. It\u0027s pure titanium, even \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0can\u0027t break it,\u0022 Dibella said with a wry grin. Valentina shot her a look.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...but the stone has been in my family for generations. The original setting is lost to time, but according to family legend, there used to be an inscription, too. It always changed depending on which uncle I asked and how pickled he was that evening, but usually something about \u0027courage\u0027 and \u0027heart\u0027 and \u0027rare.\u0027 I thought it fit you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stared into the deep crimson disc, mesmerized. In the low morning sunlight, it seemed to be glowing from within.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What on Kerbin is it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s a M\u00FCnstone. No, not from the \u003Cem\u003Eactual\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0M\u00FCn, of course, but they are quite rare. They often pop up in old fairy tales and mythology as sources of great mystical power. Quite understandable, given how they sparkle in the light like that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you,\u0022 Valentina said, slipping the chain over neck and feeling just a bit awkward, \u0022I will treasure it always.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella smiled at her, \u0022you left the party early last night. That\u0027s not easy to do in Ussari, it often comes looking for you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina smirked and rolled her bulging eyes, \u0022I needed some time to think.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 Dibella nodded, \u0022not much thinking going on by that point. But you missed all the announcements.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina raised an eye... bulge.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Everything is changing again. The entire space program is being restructured after all the... anomalies. Restructured, and expanded.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the question plain on Valentina\u0027s face, Dibella continued, \u0022everything is being centralized under a single national space agency. Flight planning, production, mission direction, more like the Foreigners. They\u0027re calling it USKOSMOS. And Sergei Kermanev is to be the new director.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sergei?!\u0022 Valentina shook her head in confusion, \u0022but what about the Academy? The Kommissar?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The everyone will report to the Kommissar, even the Academy. They\u0027re going to build two new launchpads and train nine new Kerbonauts. There was talk of long-term space flights, and probes to Eve and Jool. Launches every couple of weeks even.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina put her head back.\u003Cem\u003E A new nine. So that was it, then.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0But wait, how...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How are they going to maintain such a high launch rate? The factory in Kernobyl is already straining to keep up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s where it gets interesting. There was a representative from this \u0027Layland Heavy Industries\u0027 there. Some Gytepi technology firm as well. They gave a rather \u003Cem\u003Ethrilling\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0speech,\u0022 Dibella rolled her eyes, \u0022lots of nonsense words like \u0027synergy\u0027 and \u0027actualize\u0027 and \u0027authoritatively reintermediate premier initiatives.\u0027 They\u0027re going to build a new factory near the Cosmodrome.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina opened her mouth, then closed it again, and clicked her tongue, \u0022I suppose I should not be surprised. Foreigners running a factory in the Union. They have their hand in everything these days.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Indeed. Some sort of partnership with this \u0027USKOSMOS.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe sighed, shaking her head, \u0022I do not understand politics.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They seemed to have worked in your favor this time, Comrade \u003Cem\u003EKermanova\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 said Dibella with a wink.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I do not really understand that either. It seemed quite... \u0022 she shrugged, \u0022sudden.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sudden, yes. I cannot see the motive beyond the obvious, but it was a very shrewd maneuver on her part.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina looked over at the other Kerbal, \u0022how do you mean?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, obviously, you are a hero deserving of honors for your great service to the State, but...\u0022 Dibella stared thoughtfully out over the world clad in white, \u0022she is very cunning. She has so little power beyond mere ceremony. Only the Imperium can bestow the Medal, but it is a loose tradition for the Throne to grant an honorific at the same time, in remarkable cases.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina nodded her on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now, when an honorific is granted for a great act of service, it\u0027s also traditional for the Throne to grant indulgences, only usually they\u0027re not binding since it\u0027s not by Imperious decree, but with your sudden celebrity,\u0022 she raised an eye... bulge at Valentina, \u0022\u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was there. The Imperium, the Kommissariat heads, regional governors, council leads. Anyone who has any sort of influence used it to get a seat in the Winter Palace.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I still do not follow you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA wry grin crossed Dibella\u0027s face, \u0022it may not have been official, but it still qualifies as \u0027in Union assembled\u0027 under the Fifth Revision of the Agreement. And under Article 19, a proclamation from the Throne delivered in Union assembled is legally binding.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina crinkled her brow more, her eyes darting back and forth in thought, \u0022but... it is the Imperium. Can they not simply undo it if they choose?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They\u0027re the Imperium, they can do whatever they want. Revoking honors granted so publicly to a national hero, by such a well-liked Empress, though... they would lose face. And that might be worse for them. The significance of the Empress\u0027s ploy may \u00A0have been symbolic, but nevertheless, as the Foreigners say, she put one over on them,\u0022 she gave a little wink, \u0022their grip on power is perhaps not quite so strong as they would like us to think, yes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s eyes darted about, lingering on the squat grey rectangle across the roof that marked the Kommissar\u0027s office, \u0022you should not say such things.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What are they going to do, arrest me? Days after giving me the Order of Kermin? They are not such fools. Loosing face, remember?\u0022 Dibella did, however, rub her heavily-mittened hands together nervously.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bah, I will never understand politics,\u0022 said Valentina, trying futility to blow the errant lock of hair out of her face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I pray you never do,\u0022 Dibella said, not unkindly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two friends sat in silence for a few moments, gazing out by dawn\u0027s early light at the brilliant, frosted landscape. They both went to speak at once, then shared an awkward giggle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Valentina,\u0022 Dibella avoided the other\u0027s eyes, \u0022do you ever feel like something is... wrong?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How... do you mean?\u0022 The response was cautious, Valentina\u0027s ears piqued by the use of her full name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022With everything. Something is... not right.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina kept her face blank. Could Dibella know about... well, \u003Cem\u003Eit?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe continued, finding a particularly interesting spot on her mitten to examine as she spoke, \u0022when I was at university, political doctrine was a required path, of course. I read everything Vladimir Kermin ever wrote, even beyond the requirements. I always considered myself a good and loyal Comrade of the Imperium. But, in the old histories, I found things that were... troubling. The professors always had a rationale, of course, made it sound quite reasonable. Yet...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella slowly shook her head, \u0022everything is changing so quickly now. I sometimes wonder if the Imperium really is controlling it all, or if they\u0027re just being dragged along like the rest of us. I wonder if, perhaps, there\u0027s a better way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stared at her, aghast, \u0022you \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0should not say such things. Those are dangerous thoughts!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 Dibella agreed, rubbing her hands again, \u0022perhaps, \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is the problem.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConfused, and scrambling for a response, Valentina\u0027s mind groped at distraction, \u0022your hands... do they still hurt?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What? Oh, no. Not anymore, really,\u0022 she held her mittens up before her, \u0022the doctors all say my fingertips will grow back eventually. We\u0027re a resilient kind, like that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen she turned, with a fragile smile, \u0022besides, I\u0027m Ussari. It takes more than a little frostbite to cow me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment, Valentina returned the smile, then Dibella\u0027s eyes slowly dropped.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There\u0027s another reason I came up here...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I wanted you to be the first to know. I\u0027m leaving the Kerbonaut Corps.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?! No, no you cannot! You said yourself, your hands will heal--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s not because of that, in spite of it, really,\u0022 Dibella gave a reassuring smile, \u0022I\u0027m not leaving the Program, just the Corps.I was never really\u00A0cut out for spaceflight. With all the changes, they wanted a permanent flight director. I guess they figured actual experience might be beneficial to that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina had come up here to clear her thoughts, but now her head was practically swimming, \u0022but... I do not... are you sure?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022My education is more appropriate to administration anyway. This way, I can help make sure we have the best space program we can. And maybe, keep anyone else from having to go through, well, what we went through.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina put a hand to her temples. She could feel a nasty empty-belly headache lurking in there too. At least the P\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI\u00A0voice had finally shut up for a while.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella put a comforting hand on her shoulder, gingerly, \u0022it will all work out for the best. It will be all right, you\u0027ll see.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther discussion was interrupted by a cracking, discordant\u00A0voice that drifted up from far away. What it lacked in any sort of talent, it more than made up for in sheer volume.

The machine rattled and shook, ominous jets of vapor spewing out of unseen places.

It looked not unlike many other doors in the VAB, except that this one was at the top of a long, steep staircase that came up from the third sub basement. No one seemed to know if there was an elevator, even Igor. She was already regretting changing into her heavy winter uniform, but this sounded official. She stared at the door a moment longer, letting her breathing settle, then tucked her hat under her arm and knocked.

After a moment, her eyes began to adjust and balance gradually returned. She was in a long, concrete block room, the walls painted industrial gray, the floor bare concrete. Large portraits of the Imperium hung from the otherwise featureless walls. At the far end was a Kerbal seated at a metal desk, slowly pecking away at a typewriter with a single finger. Behind... him?

The other one kept picking away at the typewriter, their owner not looking up. Or otherwise moving at all. With a twist and a flourish, the finger pointed to a chair against the wall, the arm held unmoving in space. Letting out just a bit of a huff, Valentina clopped to the chair and sat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe shifted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, that was--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe shifted the other way.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUgh, that was even--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe shifted again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP\u0426TI\u0419!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt... it had looked like just an ordinary, institutional, hard plastic chair but... no matter how she... lumps in the seat homed in on her bones, pressure points bit at her nerves making her squirm back and forth seeking relief.

She had to stifle a yelp as a nerve was pinched between bone and chair. The Kerbal at the desk didn\u0027t seem to notice, just kept clacking away with that it irritating arhythmic typing.

It pointed at her, then twisted around at an eye-watering angle towards the door. She flew from the curs\u00E9d seat, cried out, and nearly went sprawling again. Her legs felt like they didn\u0027t exist, it was only every muscle in her body cramping at once that kept her from collapsing. She stumbled stiffly to the wall by the door, fell hard against it. The knot in her back exploded into a wrenching, vibrating flurry of spasms. Sensation returned to her legs, only to be supplanted by thousands of red-hot needles jabbing to her nerve endings.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe forced her way to the door by sheer will, and glanced back toward the fool at the desk.

It was completely blank.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFighting against her rebelling body, she found the door knob, turned it, and disappeared into darkness.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain she staggered to a halt, arms and legs outstretched, just trying to remain upright. And probably looking ridiculous. After the brightness of the other room, it was dark as midnight in here, but mercifully cool. There was no sense trying to bumble about blind, she sensed she was not alone, nothing to do for it but stand here and let her eyes adjust.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis room could not be more different than the other. She felt thick carpet under her feet, smelled the acrid stink of rattail smoke. Slowly, details began to resolve themselves. Walls appeared, covered in warm wood paneling. It was old and weathered, obviously much older than the building its self. There was a single shelf on one wall, it held a glass display case. Inside was a rather common-looking knife that seemed to be missing its point. A pair of brass floor lamps gave off a pleasing glow, placed beside a massive wooden desk in the middle of the room. Comfortable-looking chairs faced it from either side. Ledgers and folders covered the scarred desktop, all meticulously placed and aligned just so. A wide-brimmed hat sat atop one stack, also carefully placed, the emblem of a Kommissar gleaming in the muted lamplight. An ashtray sat near it, a still-smoldering rattail set in the notch. It had burned down, unsmoked, to nearly a nub, leaving a trail of ash and tiny blackened bones. Along the far wall above a large tinted picture window were the expected portraits of the Imperium, and below those...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was enormous. Valentina thought he must be bigger than Igor, even. A dense mat of deep black hair covered his head above his uniform collar. He stood, unmoving, hands folded behind him, staring out the window, blocking the morning light. Valentina gathered herself once more, and strode smartly up to the desk.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe snapped to attention and saluted, \u0022maj--!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know who you are.\u0022 Though soft, the Kommissar\u0027s voice cut through her own like a knife. She could only stand there, holding her salute. Time dragged out for a moment, then he turned and...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina staggered back a step in spite of herself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis \u003Cem\u003Eeyes\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey bored into her like drills, she could \u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0them digging, searching, dissecting her. In an instant, Valentina felt like every fiber of her being had been deconstructed, cataloged, and filed, and then again and again. Those eyes... the Imperium had been cold but this... this was like looking into some distant edge of the universe where warmth had never reached at all. She thought, \u003Cem\u003Ethey made him a Kommissar for a reason.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis arms remained folded behind him, \u0022sit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina swiftly obeyed, the breach of protocol dissipating like breath in the wind. With one hand, the Kommissar opened the ledger in the center of the desk and followed the lines with a finger, never looking down.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Valentina Kermanova, offspring of Vladimir Kerman, Captain, Imperial Army, penal registration number 24601; and Elena Kerman, professor, Kermangrad Imperial University, penal registration number 24897, both sentenced for counterrevolutionary activities and other crimes against the State, records since... expunged.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer breath caught. If she hadn\u0027t already been sitting she surely \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0have collapsed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Remanded to care of Pyotr Kerman, no profession recorded. Residence transfer to Kerberia Oblast. Found living in squalor by truancy inspector some time after Pyotr Kerman\u0027s death.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSqualor.

Volunteered for test pilot corps where you enjoyed a career of... some note.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill those warmthless eyes dug into her. She held their gaze, shock working to dull her fear. Sense slowly began to return, too. The Kommissar spoke Ussari with a heavy accent, his diction perfect but with an odd cadence, his mouth hidden behind a large mustache as thick and dark as his hair.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Chosen for preliminary Kerbonaut selection.

Chosen for First Kebonaut Corps where you have also enjoyed a career of... some note.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe placed his other hand on the desk and leaned on them, looming over Valentina like a mountain.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, Major Kermanova. I know, who you are.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite herself, she swallowed hard.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kommissar sat slowly, retrieved a half-finished pack of rattails from a desk drawer, and offered it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Smoke.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, no, uh, thank you.

That was an odd question. She opened her mouth to speak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I warn you,\u0022 the intensity in the Kommissar\u0027s frigid eyes flared higher, \u0022it is a rare thing that I \u003Cem\u003Eask\u003C/em\u003E... for someone\u0027s opinion. Do choose your words... carefully.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe closed her mouth. His accent, it sounded almost like... no, but that was impossible, not a Kommissar, certainly. She thought for a moment, then pulled her own eyes away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When I saw Sir Kerman rocket into space, I thought, how dare they. How dare they outshine our Star,\u0022 Valentina paused for a breath, \u0022and then I saw Edmund Kerman fall out of the sky. I thought, perhaps... they are not so different from us, then. We are all so focused on being the \u003Cem\u003Efirst\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0when perhaps, we should be focused on being the \u003Cem\u003Ebest\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If we must always be first, then...\u0022 she stared very hard at nothing on his desk, \u0022sooner or later, mistakes will be made. And they will be all the more bitter, because they were made in haste.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think... they are very strange people. I do not know if we can really work together. I have no understanding of such politics, but... perhaps, some sort of...\u0022 Valentina\u0027s distant eyes searched the desktop for an answer, and finding none, returned to the Kommissar\u0027s with difficulty, \u0022...understanding... with this KSA might be beneficial.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose eyes delved into her even deeper, measuring, seeking. Probably had not been a wise thing to say, but she thought lying to this Kerb was probably impossible. And dangerous.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt length, he spoke, \u0022I am pleased to hear you say that, because you are going there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I-- \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWHAT?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u0022 Valentina nearly screamed, then clapped a hand to her mouth.

Valentina held her tongue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You will fly to the Kerbal Space Center in Kleptogart, and remain there for not less than one month, as ambassador and observer. You are particularly to observe anything that involves details of a new KSA spacecraft.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina felt her skin tighten, \u0022you want me to... spy on them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kommissar leaned forward and seemed to swell in size. Valentina thought for a moment she could see her own breath. There must be frost on her eyelashes by now. She tried to disappear into her chair.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You are to be a gracious and respectful \u003Cem\u003Eguest\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0and you will do absolutely \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ethat might compromise the integrity of the Ussari Union.

Her body was still screaming at her, and now her head was, too. The Kommissar took one last long drag on his rattail, then crushed it out in the ashtray, a thin tendril of vaguely organic-smelling smoke rising and contorting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Due to your continued political... situation, your \u003Cem\u003Enablyudatel\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0will accompany you on your flight, but no further. Our laws have no meaning in that place.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe room began to shift and wobble. Valentina gripped the arms of the chair with weak fingers, afraid she might fall out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kommissar leaned in, continuing to twist the snubbed rattail with an awful crunching sound, \u0022but do not think for a moment that he is no longer watching.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina tried desperately to rally and gather her thoughts. So, so many questions. Why...? How...? Still those eyes pierced into her, like they were reading her soul.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You have questions?\u0022 He crushed the butt in his fingers until it disintegrated into powder and bones falling into the ashtray.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I...

And remember...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina returned the salute.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...Glory to Arstotzka!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd with that, once more, he was gone, leaving Valentina feeling quite bewildered. The day had dawned bright and sunny, if frigid, after more than a week of constant, light snow. Great white piles of it could be found on the lee of most buildings, and today the plows were taking advantage of the clear morning to try to get ahead of it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a cleared spot, some distance away from the aircraft hanger, sat a Converter. It had been freshly painted in vivid reds and golds and whites, the paint shining brilliantly in the sunlight. For the umpteenth time, Valentina looked at it and frowned. They could have chosen something just a \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0more... diplomatic... as a diplomatic transport, really. This old thing would surely send the Foreigners running with their ears covered.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore she got that far, however, there was a veritable gauntlet of well-wishers patiently waiting. A long line of handshakes and salutes, \u003Cem\u003Eudachi\u00A0Comrade\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s and \u003Cem\u003Ethe drivers are crazy\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s, and the ever popular \u003Cem\u003Ebring me back something foreign!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Through it all, Valentina kept a polite smile, and somehow resisted the urge to walk down the line with a palm to her face. \u003Cem\u003EAs if there weren\u0027t half a dozen stores just in Kermangrad that sold nothing \u003Cu\u003Ebut\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0something\u00A0foreign now.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this was the new normal now, she supposed. Probably best not to think on it too much, such is just life in the Great Ussari Union... right? And besides, she thought, releasing the hand of a particularly well-built young Kerb with an intoxicating smile, this new-found attention wasn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally she made her way through the crowd, finding Dibella and Tercella near the waiting aircraft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTercella quickly wrapped her in a bear hug, \u0022be careful over there. Do not do anything I would not do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina smirked back, \u0022that would surely get me arrested either way. But I will miss you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I will miss you too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You will not miss me,\u0022 Valentina waved her hand dismissively, still smirking, \u0022you will be too busy with training.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Who would have thought, yes? Assigned to Flight Engineer on Zarya 2 so soon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Who better to put into practice the idea of training for EVA underwater than the one who came up with it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTercella shrugged, \u0022I still say we should use gelatin instead. Combine EVA training with muscle training. Make us all strong like bool, no?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina laughed, and clapped the other Kerbal on the shoulders, \u0022never change.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I had to, the coffee machine exploded on me. It still needs some adjustments.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina blinked for a moment, then just hugged her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do take care of yourself,\u0022 Tercella said more soberly, \u0022and watch what you eat. I hear they have something called a \u0027hot dog\u0027 that is even more horrid than it sounds.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You will do fine. And it\u0027s no worse than a snail,\u0022 Dibella broke in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe gave Valentina a comforting look, \u0022they are just people. Not so different. But watch out for the mosquitoes, I hear they eat you alive.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina laughed again, \u0022I think I can handle a few mosquitoes!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022See? Now that\u0027s the spirit!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut... was that a flash of worry on Dibella\u0027s face? Bah! Just more nerves.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella then wrapped her in a hug that would make any bear proud, \u0022I will miss you as well, Tia. But you are doing a great thing. It \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be worth it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022D\u0424 SVID\u0414\u0419I\u0423\u0414, Dibella. Tercella. I will miss you both. And everyone. But I think it will all be.. all right.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina gave her friends one last hug, then a wave and salute to the small crowd. A quick sigh, then she slung her travel bag over her shoulder, and turned towards the plane. She ran her fingers along the flank as she did, feeling the smooth, slightly soft paint beneath them. It would feel good to fly again. It must have been months ago, now, the last time had climbed into a seat of something only \u003Cem\u003Emoderately\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0likely to explode.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor was waiting by the open hull door. He looked... he looked...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina dropped her bag, \u0022\u003Cem\u003E\u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0419\u042DVS SH\u0424\u0417,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0are afraid to fly?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor studied the stained concrete pavement, it seemed to retreat from his gaze.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Language,\u0022 he said weakly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe put a finger to his chin, lifted his face and looked into his massive, slightly bloodshot eyes. He \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0been looking rather out-of-sorts ever since the announcement, but over \u003Cem\u003Ethis?\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0She sighed, and put a comforting hand on his shoulder. Which wasn\u0027t easy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Get on the airplane,\u0022 she said, perhaps a bit sharper than she intended. Igor, looking crestfallen, did as she said. The large craft listed sideways and its structure creaked as he pulled himself up into the doorway. Then, from inside, Valentina heard a yelp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe deftly swung her small frame through the opening, what could that--?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor had regained his composure, and was staring broadswords at a wide-eyed young Kerbal in a flight suit trying very hard to hide behind the pilot\u0027s seat. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Who are you, now?\u0022 She asked, confused.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022J-J-J-Junior Lieutenant Kerman, ma\u0027am,\u0022 he gave her a trembling salute, \u0022I\u0027ll...

They did not tell me... ugh!\u0022 She put a hand to her face, then turned it into a sloppy salute, \u0022as you were, I suppose.\u0022 Valentina folded down a jump seat from the wall and plopped into it roughly, crossing her arms.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If it\u0027s any consolation, Major, I don\u0027t even \u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to go to the Foreign lands! They\u0027re all a bunch of mindless automatons! I hear...\u0022 he glanced around and lowered his voice, \u0022I hear their leader thinks he\u0027s a jelly donut.\u0022 He nodded solemnly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina just rolled her eyes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor then approached and glowered over him, \u0022you can fly this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying even harder to disappear into the floor, a squeak came out, \u0022I-I-I\u0027m fully type-rated and have a whole five hundred hours--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You crash, I squish head like grape.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022L...like grape?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor bared his teeth, then made a squishing sound deep in the back of his throat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJunior Lieutenant Kerman swallowed hard. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Igor,\u0022 he swung his huge head toward Valentina, \u0022do not eat him, please.\u0022 Igor grunted, then stalked over to the wall opposite her and sank into a pair of jump seats, his glare never leaving the trembling pilot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina leaned her head back against the hull with a thump, trying in vain to blow away the errant lock of hair that had worked its way loose again. Wonderful, several hours in the \u003Cem\u003Eback\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of a noisy aircraft with a kerbling-faced rookie and grumpy behemoth afraid of flying. At least scowling at the newcomer seemed to have distracted Igor for the moment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe let her eyes wander around the inside of the hull while the pilot hesitantly went through his checks. The Ki-24 Converter was a spartan, basic utility craft. Its stubby rectangular hull and enormous tandem wings allowed it carry an impressive load a very long way, as long that load didn\u0027t care much about comfort. Or could be ordered not to. A bizarre design even by Ussari standards, perhaps its most notable feature was the strange setup of its nose. It looked more like the hull of a boat than aircraft, with only a handful of windows and port holes looking up. Looking \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E, however, was a huge expanse of braced plexiglass. The single pilot\u0027s seat was suspended in the center of this, giving him a nearly unimpeded view of the ground. Which, as it turns out, was an eminently practical thing to have on an aircraft that took off and landed vertically. It was said, however, that the Converter couldn\u0027t actually \u003Cem\u003Efly\u003C/em\u003E, it was just so loud and obnoxious that the ground repelled it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething overhead suddenly began making a loud ticking noise.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What that?\u0022 Igor\u0027s head snapped around to it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It is just the secondary fuel pump,\u0022 Valentina said flatly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn alarm began blaring loudly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What that?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Master alarm test, perfectly normal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe entire aircraft then shuddered, swaying back and forth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What \u003Cem\u003Ethat?!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Igor nearly squealed. Which, coming from him, was a truly disturbing sound.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just the landing struts unkneeling!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EST\u0414LI\u0419S ST\u0414CH\u0417\u003C/em\u003E, this was going to be a nightmare! Valentina squeezed her eyes shut. There\u0027d been no mention of a pilot in her briefings, although, she supposed, someone \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0need to fly the Converter back. And Igor. But still, she\u0027d been greatly looking forward to flying again. Nothing to do for it now, after all orders were orders and--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer left eye snapped open.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer right eye followed suit, then her face cracked open into a truly wicked grin as her eyelids came down again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, looooootennant....\u0022 she sang.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe squirmed around, \u0022ma\u0027am?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith effort, the grin became her best winning smile.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Out of the seat, please,\u0022 Valentina said brightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022M-Major?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe smile devolved into a wry smirk.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That is right,\u0022 she said, fingering the golden leaf insignia on her collar, \u0022\u003Cem\u003EMajor\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter all, orders \u003Cem\u003Ewere\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0orders.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Lieutenant\u0027s mouth fell open. Igor rose and frowned at him again. \u00A0His eyes darted rapidly back and forth between the smirk and frown for a moment, then he wisely decided this was one pair he was not about to bet against, and quickly extricated himself from the pilot\u0027s seat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina leapt into it like a beggar at a banquet. Her liquid hands flowed over the myriad knobs, buttons, and switches. In only moments, the engines rumbled, then began their slow, shrill spool from \u0027piercing\u0027 to \u0027obnoxious\u0027 to \u0027painful\u0027 to \u0027\u003Cem\u003Efor the love of all that\u0027s decent please make it stop!\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 before finally settling in to their infamous, nearly ultrasonic whine. With a look, and a gesture, Valentina relieved the good Junior Lieutenant of his kneeboard and paperwork and quickly scanned over the relevant clearances and course. \u00A0She put her flight helmet on, plugged in the audio cord, then motioned Igor to do the same until she realized the silliness of the idea. The way he was gripping the fuselage longerons behind him, and bending them, he seemed fairly secure, anyway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cosmodrome tower, \u003Cem\u003Eavtomat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0four-seven at pad 1-D, requesting take off,\u0022 she radioed, adjusting the mic boom just so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EAvtomat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0four-seven,\u0022 the controller responded, stifling a yawn, \u0022you are cleared for take off, fly heading one-nine-five.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy, cleared for take off.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe laid a hand on the throttles, flexed it, then advanced them a touch, the engines responding in kind. She slid down her tinted sun visor, a pilot\u0027s grin of pure joy now spreading across her face as she nudged the engines slowly on. The ungainly craft wobbled for only a moment as its tires left the concrete. A kiss to the left rudder pedal, and it slowly swung about on its axis. The gathered crowd now came into view through the expansive nose glazing, hands pressed firmly to ears. The look on the Political Officer\u0027s face was really quite priceless. She didn\u0027t let the view linger, but kicked the left rudder pedal again, then just a touch on the right as the nose came to the proper heading. Throttles to full, engine nozzles forward 25 degrees, then the ground began drifting away. She pulled back on the flight yoke that looked more like the wheel of a ship, held it for just a moment, slid the engine nozzles full ahead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs lightly loaded as it was, the Converter was soon speeding over the landscape, speckled with white and brown, light and darkness, barreling into the brilliant blue sky. Valentina\u0027s course would take her south toward Kermangrad and its navigational beacon, then east across the Arm of Nusad, southeast through the Bylian gap, out across the Yaltik sea, then beyond, into \u003Cem\u003Ekerba incognita\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow her, a train cut through the slumbering, snow-covered fields, black smoke oozing away like blood from the gash of the track. Car after car of shrink wrapped rocket cores followed along behind it, seeming to stretch for kilometers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHow much things have changed\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0she thought, \u003Cem\u003Ehas it really only been a few months?\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Not even a year, since those pungent yak pastures ringed by towering mountains. Everything has been so secretive then, so protected, and now, here she was, flying over a train of Foreign rocket parts while bound for the KSC herself. \u00A0She continued to watch it, as it wound through through the harlequined landscape like a worm. Worms destroyed, they undermined the roots of even the mightiest trees and sent them toppling to the ground. And yet, worms also renewed, consuming and recycling that which was \u003Cem\u003Ealready\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0dead, often preserving the living.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the aircraft climbed higher and the air thinned, thoughts flowed and patterns teased. Someone, or some\u003Cem\u003Ething\u003C/em\u003E, killed poor Director Kermanev, Valentina was sure of that now. It killed Sergei Kermanski. It tried to kill Dibella. It moved in the shadows, always hiding, always scheming. And it wanted Valentina, spent so much effort trying to gain her, but why? Was she really that remarkable?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeneath her flightsuit, Dibella\u0027s M\u00FCnstone suddenly went cold against her skin, caught by an errant breeze in the drafty cabin. It did that often, she noticed. The titanium must be a wonderful heat conductor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe turned to find Igor looking at her intently, slightly panicky.

It is not a creation of the Cosmos, which has no need of such frivolity, but rather of certain sapient beings, who have no more than but a handful of senses with which to contemplate the Infinite. Time ebbs and flows, pulling its creators along, dominating their existence, and, like creatures born in a cave who have no comprehension of darkness because they have never known light, ultimately blinds them. They are bound by it, unable to the relate to the reality around them without its crutch, and because \u003Ci\u003Ethey\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0cannot see past it, assume there is nothing past it to see.

It was called Kerbin by some. It had been called many other things. It might be called many others yet. In the northern hemisphere, now clad in white, a nation dominated the vast continent. It was called Ussari by some. It had been called many other things. It might be called many others yet. Perched on the southern border, next to a river, was a sprawling city. It was called Kermangrad by some. It had been called many other things. It might be called many others yet. In the middle of this city, stood a fortress. It was simply called \u003Ci\u003Ethe\u00A0\u003C/i\u003EFortress. It had never been called much else. It might be called other things yet, but \u003Ci\u003Eother things\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Eyet watched it from the wilderness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd they were, indeed, very, very hungry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a palace, within the towering, crenelated walls of this fortress, and for all its grandeur, it still cowered in the shadow of an enormous concrete dome. In a wide tower rising from that palace was a window, and in that window, staring out past the walls at the bustling city beyond, stood a Lady. Her Imperial Majesty Alexandra II, Regent of the Union, First of Ussari and Nihacima, Lady High Vizier of the City of Kerman, and Doge of Erakonia. She, too, had been called many other things, some of them quite impolite, especially of late. There were no bars on the window. \u003Ci\u003EThere was no need\u003C/i\u003E, the Empress thought, raising a hand to crimson M\u00FCnstone on the golden choker around her neck. Everyone in this... peculiar arrangement knew their place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shadow of a smile crept across her serene face. Still... she had certainly put one over on those old goats this time. The punishment had been severe, of course, yet through it all she had just laughed. The damage had already been done. Besides, what were they going to do, kill her? They had surely learned from history by now. The first time, it had quite literally blown up in their faces. They had turned it to their advantage in the end, or so they thought, squeezing their grip into an iron fist. They never knew what had slipped through their fingers. The second time, well... They still had not rebuilt the West Tower. She could just see its charred, crumbling skeleton from her own window.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, she thought, turning away, her family was not so easily disposed of. The old goats would not make the same mistake thrice. Her eyes then fell on the long-empty bassinet in the corner of her bedchamber. No, they would not. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Empress sighed, very unimperially, once more silently cursing what her beloved country had become. Then again... she ran her fingers up one of the solid gold bedposts holding up a silken canopy... the fate of the Empire had not been undeserved.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA century ago, the old Ussari Empire had finally mined the last fleck of gold from the Duchy of Erakonia, leaving the once-prosperous nation a devastated husk, its vassals destitute, its people starving. What had finally happened \u003Ci\u003Ethere\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0while the Troubles raged across the rest of the nascent Union had been inevitable. The rebels had fought like wolverines. It was easy to fight like that, when you had nothing left to loose. They raged with such ferocity that to this day no one would go within ten kilometers of the border that emerged, winning themselves a fragile but lasting peace, and their own little spit of land.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe walked on, her eyes passing over the extravagant trappings of just this room. Rich hardwood paneling that had once been an old-growth forest in Nusad, jade mined from beneath a village in Bylia, a marble statue from a sacred temple in Kerbistan, a tapestry that was all that remained of a country now beneath a lake in Athiland. Trespasses repeated time and time again, going back a thousand years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time of her Grandfather\u0027s reign, these things were all just memories, their perpetrators and observers long departed, but they were \u003Ci\u003Epowerful\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0memories, they fused with and fed the grievances of the day. The fate of the Empire had been an inevitability, then. She knew her Grandfather had been a good Kerb, but what the Empire needed then was a \u003Ci\u003Egreat\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere had been... other concerns, as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeeling the familiar tingle in the back of her head, the Empress smoothed her face, and stepped out into her sitting room. She took her place before the immense door to her apartments, folded her hands, and waited. A moment later there were three loud knocks, and the heavy door swung open. A guard appeared and ran his suspicious eyes over every surface of the room, looking for any sign of attack... or escape. They lingered on the Empress for a moment, then he stepped aside, and a wizened old Kerbal waddled in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe grizzled fellow had no hair on his scalp, but the wild mop on his chin gave the impression that it had all simply migrated south. He stepped smartly up to her, or as smartly as he could at his age, and bowed. The guard\u0027s eyes narrowed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Majesty, I am told, she is away.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Empress nodded in acknowledgement, \u0022very well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Will there be anything else, Majesty?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That will be all, Roland. Thank you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe bowed more deeply this time, the guard\u0027s glare now drawing out into a sneer, then pushed past the hapless ward as he waddled out, mumbling something under his breath.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe thought it sounded something like \u0022step aside, you feckless, beef-witted giglet,\u0022 but wasn\u0027t quite sure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe guard turned his glare back to her, her face passive and serene as ever, before running his eyes over the room once more and slamming the door. There was a loud \u003Ci\u003Ethunk\u003C/i\u003E, as the locking bolt slid home. The Empress raised a hand to her face in a futile attempt to hide the smile that blossomed across it. She did not think there was a Force or Power in this \u0027Verse or any other that could stop Roland from being Roland.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer hand remained, but her smile faded. It seemed wrong to send that remarkable young girl off into the whumper\u0027s den like this, blind and dumb. It had taken every last bit of her finesse to arrange, but in the end... the smile returned... those old goats had thought it was \u003Ci\u003Etheir\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0idea. Her hand dropped down to the golden links around her neck. After all, the chain pulled both ways. The hand fell away, and she turned, her slippered feet moving silently on the thick rugs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat girl... there was still a chance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFutile though it might be, maybe... just maybe... she could find the other. They would have an affinity for each other, she was sure of it. Well, nearly. If they could find each other... maybe it wasn\u0027t too late. Maybe... \u003Ci\u003Eit\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Ecould be stopped.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EBut you know\u003C/i\u003E,\u00A0a voice whispered in her head, \u003Ci\u003Ethere is another way...\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Empress now stopped, standing before an immense case that looked like glass but wasn\u0027t. Towering above it, larger than life, was the Imperial Portrait from her coronation years ago. Herself, the Orb and Scepter gleaming in gold paint, Alexei, the Imperial Consort, looking so strong, and in the same bassinet, little Tatiana. But what was ensconced in the case below far outshone the grand painting. Not merely a king\u0027s ransom, but the ransom of several kings, demanded over the centuries. Gold, jewels, priceless antiquities, and before all of them, the Crown Jewels themselves. The same regalia as the massive painting above. Like so many times before, her eyes fell on the gleaming Scepter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe raised a hand that still trembled, the M\u00FCnstone around her neck turning to ice against her skin as her fingers touched glass that wasn\u0027t glass. Not the Scepter its self, that was only a few kilos of gold, worthless in comparison. But within it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EWith that,\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0she thought, \u003Ci\u003EI could change everything. \u003Cu\u003EFix\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0everything\u003C/i\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven after all these years, the old goats still had no idea what was hiding right under their... beards. Yes, yes she \u003Ci\u003Ecould\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0fix everything... but for how long? A decade? A generation? A century?

He had known all too well. In the end, the knowledge... the temptation... the perverse dilemma, it had driven him mad. What she had done then had been a mercy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s what she still told herself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother chill crawled up her spine. She took an old shawl from the rack and wrapped it around her shoulders against the imagined cold. She had lost her husband and companion, and her infant daughter. But there was always... a price.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EEven that can be undone\u003C/i\u003E,\u00A0the voice pleaded, \u003Ci\u003Eyou know it to be true...\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor an instant, the tear she had never let fall threatened once more, but the old familiar defiance welled up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003ENo...\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe set her jaw.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENO\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe turned from the power, and walked back towards her window.

In places on its surface where the paint had finally flecked away, fragile, tree-like deep sea sponges had begun to grow, feeding on the macabre mana of decay that drifted down from the waters above. Inside, beyond the ragged, gaping hole in the capsule\u0027s flank, blind, spindly-legged crabs, white as porcelain, took shelter, feeding on the morsels too big for the sponges, thriving in this alien place of eternal darkness ever since their ancestors first wandered into it ten thousand eons ago.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs one of the mindless denizens scuttled along its path, it dislodged an air bubble, that by some twist of fate had remained trapped all these many months.

Upwards it went, past the first weak tendrils of inky violet, ignored by the viperfish, frill sharks, and colossal squid that lurked these depths. The bubble expanded as it rose and the pressure decreased, such that when it entered the deep blue domain of towering shoals of gamefish and cruising manta rays, it roiled and churned and flailed like its self a thing alive. Upward, ever upward, rending its self apart into a thousand smaller bubbles, past bluefish and leatherbacks and great sea beasts until at last the bubbles burst through the foamy crest of a wave on the azure sea and became part of the air.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWarmed by the burning equatorial sun overhead, tempered by the cool ocean currents below, the air began to swirl and move. It went west, toward an angular cape jutting out into the sea. Here it came on shore as a gentle tropical breeze, caressing a motley collection of buildings where there had once been only a swamp. It swirled and eddied between them, around sleek aircraft and over bulging metallic spheres, enticing more than one worker to pause in their duties and delight for a moment in its cool kiss upon their sweat-drenched faces.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe breeze blew on, now gathering into a wind, pushed ever inland by the new breeze moving in off the sea. It blew over towering sand dunes, around sparse forests and over thriving fields of vegetables toward the foothills of the central mountains. The wind did not stop here, but was carried ever onward by the pressing mass of air behind it, racing over the verdant foothills then blasting up the rugged flanks of the mountains. Momentum carried it over the peaks, where it churned onward to the west, leaving long rows of lenticular clouds in its wake that mirrored the furrowed farmlands below. Here the wind slowed again, and calmed, playing high above the ocean, so that when it crossed paths with the odd little aircraft making the incredible racket, it was no more than a gentle breeze again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt passed by a small, terrified face staring out a round port hole, then found a tiny gap in the metal hull and was drawn inside. It blustered back and forth, rushing over an enormous lump snoring loudly in the thin air, until at last it brushed the cheek of Valentina Kermanova, who was nervously going over her entry clearances and radio procedures.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeciding she had absorbed as much as she was going to, Valentina keyed the mic, and spoke in the professional, calm, dignified tones of pilots.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Whiskey tango foxtrot, Yankee Doodle dandy, \u003Ci\u003Eavtomat\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Efour-seven inbound at the marker with upchuck uniform.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe cringed.

These people \u003Ci\u003Ewere\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0strange.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio crackled in her ear again, \u0022additionally, four-seven, an escort has been arranged for your convenience to Kleptogart airspace.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Ci\u003EAvtomat\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0four-seven copies,\u0022 an escort? So that\u0027s what the circling radar contact ahead of them was.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJunior Lieutenant Kerman\u0027s trembling voice suddenly cut in, \u0022fuhhhh...fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fighters, yes, I know!\u0022 She frowned, watching the unfamiliar aircraft pull even off her wing tips. \u003Ci\u003EWhirlwinds\u003C/i\u003E, she thought they were called. The Kerblish letters UFPROACG were stenciled prominently on the tails. She thought if they were going to bother with an acronym that long they might as well just write it out, really.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was an unexpected development. Granted, she didn\u0027t really know much about such things, but this hardly seemed a proper greeting for a diplomatic mission. She looked again at the smooth, streamlined warplanes flying next to hers. They did not appear to be armed, but still... you could never tell what a fighter pilot might do if spooked. Their egos were more dangerous than any munition. The one to her left was staring at her intently, impassively. With his helmet and oxygen mask he looked like some sort of bug-eyed alien.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough, she supposed, \u003Ci\u003Eshe\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0was the alien now. The thought still didn\u0027t keep the hackles on the back of her neck from rising. Fighter pilots. She \u003Cem\u003Ehated\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0fighter pilots. Almost as much as politics. And now she had both.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight continued on, turning east and paralleling the coast, then inland and more southerly, the other two jets sticking to Valentina\u0027s wings like parasites. The countryside below looked normal enough, she thought, except for the odd lack of snow. They did have winter in the tropics, right? The grasslands reminded her of the vast open plains of Nusad, and she could see huge herds of... somethings. They didn\u0027t have yaks here, she was fairly sure of that at least.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plains eventually gave way to rolling hills that proceeded to mountains towering in the distance. Moderately sized, widely spaced cities followed the contours of the hills, connected by a web of wide concrete roads. That looked normal enough too, even if it was a \u003Ci\u003Elot\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0of roads. She was relieved to see the occasional train chugging along too, but none of them seemed to produce any smoke.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt length the mountains were looming to her left. Jagged and sharp, they seemed to jut up at impossible angles, giving her the feeling they were somehow \u0027new.\u0027 The steep, rocky slopes were devoid of any hint of snow, which was \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0odd, and there looked to be no vegetation either. Finally the controller directed her eastward over a high pass.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gutrot noodle floppy-disk, \u003Ci\u003Eavtomat\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0four-seven you are now leaving UFPDKO airspace, cleared into Kleptogart airspace at one-zero-delicatessen, contact KSC tower at one-one-three-point-niner, cheerio.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext to the Converter, off to Valentina\u0027s left, the fighter pilot stared at her a moment longer, then snapped a quick salute and banked away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe checked over the paperwork once more, huffed, and switched frequencies, \u0022flapjack paddywhack trombone, \u003Ci\u003Eavtomat\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0four-seven inbound for runway zero-niner.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pyrex pickle blowfish, KSC tower has you on scope, \u003Ci\u003Eavtomat\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0four-seven, uh, confirm you want a \u003Ci\u003Ehelicopter\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0approach?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022D\u0414... yes... request helicopter approach for runway zero-niner,\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419\u003C/em\u003E, this language was frustrating!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If you say so, four-seven.

Um... rinky-dink chipshot potato.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever mind strange, these people were clearly mad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPassing the mountains, she reduced the throttles and let the nose drop, beginning a long, gradual descent. She could just see the space center now, sprawled out on a wide cape jutting out into the ocean beyond. A quick glance behind her confirmed that Igor was still out for the moment. Good. Turning off the oxium to his mask had worked like a charm, they hadn\u0027t been flying \u003Ci\u003Ethat\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0high after all. By the looks of it, the good Junior Lieutenant was panicked enough for the both of them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane cruised down over more rolling hills, passing farms and odd little groves of trees. The cities seemed more sparse, here, but the roads! So many roads! Blackish-gray tracks winding every which way, without a single railroad to be seen. How did these people get around without trains? They surely didn\u0027t \u003Ci\u003Edrive\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0everywhere, that would just be silly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hills soon gave way to meandering sand dunes as the space center grew to fill Valentina\u0027s vision. It looked like quite an impressive facility, and familiar. Oddly familiar. Yet... every space that was not building or roadway seemed to be packed with lots full of... kars. Further consideration would have to wait, however. She began the delicate process of rotating the engine nozzles and gradually transferring the aircraft\u0027s weight from its wings to the four shrieking engines as it slowed. She crossed over the runway threshold exactly where she wanted to, the ungainly craft held rock steady in her hands. A nudge here, a prod there, and the Converter gently settled to a perfect four-point landing the moment the last of its forward speed bled away, just before the turnoff to the second taxiway of the long runway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA smirk curled Valentina\u0027s left lip. She was certain she was going to completely embarrass herself at \u003Ci\u003Esome\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0point on this bizarre excursion, but borking the landing would \u003Ci\u003Enot\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Ebe it! Of course, that had been the \u003Ci\u003Eeasy\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0part, too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe followed the further instructions from the tower and ground control, traveling along the taxiway through a layout that seemed ever more familiar. Behind an enormous hanger, a grimacing crewman directed her with a set of marshaling paddles in the \u003Cem\u003Estrangest\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0shade of yellow towards a fairly small group of Kerbals with their hands pressed firmly to their heads. He scurried away as soon as she was stopped, clutching his own head.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina went mechanically through the shut down procedures, feeling the uncomfortable little ball of nerves begin to grow in the back of her head. They \u003Ci\u003Ewere\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0just people after, all, right? Surely, they couldn\u0027t be \u003Ci\u003Ethat\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0different. Memories of the concert in Crimson Square the past summer bubbled up from somewhere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, yes they could.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina worked her way carefully past the drooling Igor and shivering Junior Lieutenant. With nothing else to do for it, she turned the latch, and slid the side door open.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSomething slammed into her like a fist and wrenched the breath from her lungs. She had a firm grip on the handrail, else she might have tumbled from the doorway. She had to fight for each breath with straining lungs, the sweat suddenly running down her face amplifying the feeling that she was trying to breathe liquid. The humidity! It was beyond words! It felt so thick she could cut it with a knife. And the heat! It must be forty degrees out here! How could these people \u003Ci\u003Elive\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0like this?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419\u003C/i\u003E, they\u0027re coming this way now. With sheer force of will against the onslaught, Valentina composed herself, and tried to smile. Another smiling Kerbal stepped up to her. He wore a headset, which was odd, and a very dapper white vest, which was not.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Major Kermanova, I presume?\u0022 The fellow\u0027s smile widened, \u0022I\u0027m Gene Kerman, the Flight Director here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe paused for just a moment to clear his throat, and took a slip of paper from his pocket, \u0022on behalf of the Kerbal Space Administration, its member states, and partners, in hopes of greater understanding and cooperation among all Kerbals, welcome, to... the.... Kerbal..... Space....... Cen........\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis mouth dropped open. Valentina blinked at him for a moment, then realized he was looking \u003Ci\u003Ebehind\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0her. And \u003Ci\u003Eabove\u003C/i\u003E. The rest of the small crowd, too. She turned to follow their collective gaze, and saw that Igor had appeared in the doorway, and was staring new and ever sharper stabbing implements back at them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe raised her hands, hoping her smile didn\u0027t look as forced as it felt, \u0022is... uh... is just Igor... um... is not staying... he... he is.... ah....\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419S \u0417\u0414\u042FS\u003C/em\u003E what was the word?

It then continued in Kerblish, also strongly accented, \u0022ah\u0027m afraid the word doesn\u0027t really translate all the well into Kerblish, Gene. This tall feller is is something of a body guard... and a monitor.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took only a moment for Valentina to realize why Igor\u0027s glare had no effect on this newcomer. He was so slimy it just slid right off. He was quite tall himself, dressed in a crisp, black suit with thin pinstripes. She had little knowledge of fashion, but could tell it must be expensive. The enormous elliptical belt buckle clad in silver and gold reinforced that. He had what looked like \u003Ci\u003Eanother\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0belt buckle around his neck, also gold and silver, with a big pale blue stone in the center and a pair of decorated leather strings hanging from it. On his head was a truly \u003Ci\u003Eenormous\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Eblack hat, in the same style that was now so popular in Kermangrad, which he now tipped towards her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pleasure to make your acquaintance, ma\u0027am. Name\u0027s John Ross, John Ross Kerman, junior. But, uh, everyone \u0027round here just calls me J.R.\u0022 He replaced his hat, and offered his hand. Valentina took it gingerly. It was soft, smooth, gripped with \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the right pressure. A hand that had shaken many others. She released it, and had to consciously resist the urge to count her fingers.

Oh, right, I\u0027m terribly sorry for any confusion, Mizz Kermanova, we weren\u0027t expecting an, um, entourage, but we\u0027ll work with that. Where was I? Oh...\u0022 He offered his own hand.

She stared at Gene, trying to will her uncooperative mouth into motion. Gene stared at her. Igor stared at everyone. They stared back at him. Then her. Then him again. Some of the faces were scowling now. She thought she heard a cricket somewhere. But she didn\u0027t see--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene sighed, \u0022ok... if our two agencies are going to work together, someone\u0027s going to have to start the ol\u0027 trust train, so let it be me.

Quite dramatically.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene sighed heavily, his face an intriguing mix of different shades of green, \u0022I\u0027m really sorry about that, Mizz Kermanova, I thought he\u0027d behave himself today. Dean\u0027s an excellent pilot but that\u0027s also the only thing he respects, or understands. I\u0027ll see about getting you some flight time with him, maybe bridge the gap.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Valentina, please, um, Gene,\u0022 she smiled, \u0022it would seem some things are quite... universal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey were the same all over the globe, she imagined.

Um, don\u0027t call him sir, he hates that. He, uh, sends his regrets that he couldn\u0027t be here to welcome you in person, he\u0027s a bit tied up at the moment.\u00A0Should be back in a couple of days.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresently, a small bus clad in brilliantly polished aluminum and the emblem of the KSA pulled to a stop nearby. Gene gestured towards it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Here, I\u0027ll help you with your things. We\u0027ve got a room for you in the Kerbonaut center near everyone else. We\u0027ve just finished a major expansion so it\u0027s a bit empty at the moment. There\u0027s a very informal dinner waiting if you\u0027d like, um, I think the chef made something called \u0027borscht.\u0027 Tonight, you can get settled in and relax, no expectation. Bit of a busy day tomorrow, I\u0027m afraid, that\u0027s the official welcoming ceremony, and a public open house to showcase our expansions.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe seemed to catch something in Valentina\u0027s expression, \u0022I know, I\u0027m not much for politics either, but, bare with me and we\u0027ll make this work somehow. I\u0027ll give you the official tour after that, and there\u0027s Burdous\u0027s launch on M\u00FCnday, and if you\u0027d like...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina allowed herself to be led back towards the\u00A0Converter for her bag, suddenly realizing how tired she was. This was going to be an ordeal, all right. This \u0027Dean\u0027 person was a raging \u003Cem\u003EST\u0414LI\u0419S\u041AI\u0423\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Even if he did have dimples. \u003Cem\u003EIncredible \u003C/em\u003Edimples. The others seemed amicable enough, mostly, but she was disappointed about Sir Kerman, she\u0027d been looking forward to talking with him again. Edmund... he had a quick wit, there was more to him than on the surface, she suspected. Speaking with Jorrigh would help her practice her Kerblish without looking like a \u003Cem\u003Ecomplete \u003C/em\u003Efool, and this Jerdous...
