Still, im hoping that EVENTUALLY we will get procedural wings, and procedural fuel tanks that not only allow us to pick a length, but also allow us to choose what fuel we want in it (say pick LFO, LF, XE, Mono, ect). Procedural stuff will kill 2 birds with 1 stone, both cut down part count/lag/loading times, AND give us more customizability in our craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf push comes to shove, you can always edit the .craft files to alter the fuel loadouts to specific tanks anyways. Ive actually done this on a few ion craft as when i decide to spam massless batteries, ill just edit the properties and make higher capacity batteries (its already exploiting when you spam massless batteries, so editing batteries to have more capacity achieves the same exact thing for less part count).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KotDemopan","CreatedById":98561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T00:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know- well, mostly know about you guys, but im just going to keep the 0.90 Round 8 in place of the 1.0 Round 8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAVATARS AND SIGNATURES ARE NOT ENOUGH, WE... ...I HAVE TO TAKE DRASTIC ACTION! ....INCASE THE XENON ROUND 8 WILL BE A THING WITHOUT THE LFO ONE!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T01:51:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KotDemopan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KotDemopan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAVATARS AND SIGNATURES ARE NOT ENOUGH, WE... ...I HAVE TO TAKE DRASTIC ACTION! ....INCASE THE XENON ROUND 8 WILL BE A THING WITHOUT THE LFO ONE!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrastic Actions Engaged: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115778-0-90-The-YPTTBWICFOSHM-Mod-%28AKA-The-ROUND-9-Mod-%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115778-0-90-The-YPTTBWICFOSHM-Mod-%28AKA-The-ROUND-9-Mod-%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T01:52:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwhip\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwhip\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDrastic Actions Engaged: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115778-0-90-The-YPTTBWICFOSHM-Mod-%28AKA-The-ROUND-9-Mod-%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115778-0-90-The-YPTTBWICFOSHM-Mod-%28AKA-The-ROUND-9-Mod-%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EYou guys actually have to engage Reddit in this, Squad doesn\u0027t care about the goings-on around here.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T01:52:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwhip\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwhip\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDrastic Actions Engaged: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115778-0-90-The-YPTTBWICFOSHM-Mod-%28AKA-The-ROUND-9-Mod-%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115778-0-90-The-YPTTBWICFOSHM-Mod-%28AKA-The-ROUND-9-Mod-%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 mods now, this is getting really interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T02:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are at least 4 threads devoted specifically to the toroidal tank, last time I counted.
