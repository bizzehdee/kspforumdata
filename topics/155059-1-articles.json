This will eventually result in the craft being either slung out of\u00A0the system or, in the case of the example, crashing into the body before the rescue craft can reach it. Owing to where the generator places orbits, situations like said example are thankfully rare around Kerbin, but can be\u00A0a major nuisance elsewhere, especially\u00A0around Duna, where parts for retrieval are frequently intercepted by Ike and destroyed or ejected into solar orbits before they can be reached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs such,\u00A0the contract generator should run a basic check on the orbit it is generating\u00A0a craft for retrieval or rescue in and, if the orbit crosses another\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, abort the generation and try another orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atubara","CreatedById":166128,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-15T22:26:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI concur with this idea!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, what a beautiful trajectory.
