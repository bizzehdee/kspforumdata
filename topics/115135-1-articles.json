I have just enough fuel to make it back. (I think) The sun is directly overhead and the Kerbs just finished lunch. So here\u0027s the question: Which is more fuel efficient?; 1. Launch and get into a low Minmus orbit and then wait for the right time to burn for home? or, 2. Just launch straight up, leaving the SOI of Minmus and then burn for home?

So if you want to go straight up, wait until Kerbin is setting in the west, then launch straight up and go all out.

Even on the Mun, the straight up launch only costs about 100 m/s more than the mostly-horizontal launch, assuming a munar TWR in the 5-6 range. Just keep in mind that as you take off from larger bodies (or similar bodies but with a lower TWR), you\u0027ll tend to have a lower TWR and the difference will become greater.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DCWarHound","CreatedById":135609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T07:43:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a cheaty way,point your rocket towards your maneuver node for return.Go EVA and put your kerbal behind your rocket,go to map view and go forward with your kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quite literally returned from Mun orbit with a small lander after not having enough fuel to return.Unfortunately my lander doesn\u0027t have enough drag and i can\u0027t revert to assembly so it can never slow down fast enough (i hit 260ms at about 700m even when coming in from a 60km periapsis and burning though 2x heatshields while aerobraking)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
