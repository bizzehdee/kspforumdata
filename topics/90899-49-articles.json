I may even need to tie top warp speed to the player\u0027s physics increment time. I\u0027m finding that on each physics tick, the distance you travel can be\u00A0far beyond the sphere of influence of anything if warp is high enough (I\u0027m getting this happening even at warp 6). There\u0027s nothing I know of I can do to fix that other than bring warp speeds down or completely re-think\u00A0 how I\u0027m calculating the braking so it always takes into account every body in the system (I\u0027d imagine very CPU intensive especially in something like OPM and I doubt it would work well with multiple star systems).\u00A0Of course on a 1:1 scale system higher warps would work because you have more physics ticks occurring between point\u00A0 A and B.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther option is it doesn\u0027t catch you nicely, but it does help slow you if you use your throttle appropriately and don\u0027t approach Jool at like 8c.

Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence is\u00A084,159 km. So there are 0 physics frames that I can use to slow the ship from\u00A015c\u00A0and that includes if it is headed right at the planet, but you almost never are so it\u0027s really hard to \u0022grab\u0022 the ship. Only needs to be going\u00A060,000 km/s to blow past the entire\u00A0planetary cutoff warping through the planet which is about 5c. I was thinking for Kerbol max warp being around 5c-6c near Jool and and\u00A0hopefully 3c at Kerbin\u0027s orbit (with the braking system doing its thing). For a 1:1 system one could up the warp factor in the cfg. That would hopefully at least give a couple of frames to grab the ship and start slowing it. I\u0027m thinking at this\u00A0moment to require the player to have throttle control but try to\u00A0make it a bit forgiving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a solution that for the stock system, due to the small radii involved it naturally limited to about 6c even though the config had 15 as the top warp factor. If I kept warping away from Kerbol my warp factor continued to climb. It would eventually hit 15 but it was going to take a long while. I abandoned that one thinking about multiple solar systems and 1:1 system as the warp factor wasn\u0027t climbing fast enough as I went away from Kerbol.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRight now I\u0027ve got a braking solution where WarpFactor in the cfg is the absolute top speed and the gravity brake slows from that. I\u0027m wondering if maybe a turbo button or function\u00A0might be a better solution for going between systems (such as brakes come off once some distance away from a central body\u00A0and speed increases to a turbo warp factor value)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-31T11:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/101767-helaeon/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022101767\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/101767-helaeon/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@helaeon\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0- I like the idea of a brake - possibly based on planetary radius, etc. where your max speed ramps up (or more correctly, your speed throttle is eased) as you get further away, so we can get some really fast interstellar speeds for the larger planet packs.\u00A0 So even at max speed, you can\u0027t zip around the Kerbin system, but once a certain distance away (i.e. enough that you can actually slow down), the speed increases.\u00A0 Same for other encounters (can we check the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E for this?\u00A0 i.e. are there any cases where we can blow through an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E in a single tick?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-31T17:02:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might suggest using twice the distance of a star\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E as a \u0022braking zone\u0022 for want of a better term.

The idea is that as your distance from a body becomes very large, your brake becomes very small. Your speed ramps up and down exponentially as you move through the sphere of influence.\u00A0It works quite nicely, but I\u0027m trying to figure out how to best apply them to the speed and put in a braking factor to fine tune things from the cfg (and what that number should be) to fit the most use cases possible so it naturally works well because the math does it on its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I have it doing now is figuring out the brake factor for the object of your current \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, then add the brake factor from the parent body, and then that\u0027s parent body, and so on. This causes your braking factor to stack quite nicely and there are no abrupt jumps in speed when crossing a sphere of influence. This and the other changes I\u0027ve made have things running very nicely. I have a green mission timer the entire time I\u0027m in warp and can use physics warp. As it is an exponential the idea is that you should hit your maximum warp speed (whatever it may be) but when near a planetary body it clamps down on it and ideally very hard as you get closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve blown through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of the Mun quite a few times (as in teleported through the body itself even). Even small warp factors can do\u00A0that, and it may be something we won\u0027t be able to get around because the problem is more pronounced the smaller the body. Interestingly I think this would be a less severe problem with the 1:1 systems even at higher warps because everything is bigger and further apart.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other idea I had, and I\u0027m not sure how to actually implement and I worry about\u00A0performance issues : Have the game tell me what bodies are inside the current \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.

The way warp happens more parts won\u0027t do anything but muck up calculations. It doesn\u0027t add thrust like a normal engine in KSP.\u00A0The distance you move per physics tick is determined entirely in the code based on the values in the part\u0027s cfg. However the chaining multiple parts\u00A0comes up enough I\u0027m noodling over if there is a way to deactivate all but one automagically in the coding (for aesthetic purposes)... or maybe just maybe let multiple drives overlap their warp bubbles... It won\u0027t make you go faster just allow a bigger ship and probably require power and fuel for each part.\u00A0Don\u0027t expect this to happen though and it\u00A0would be way down the line if I have steam left after finishing up what I\u0027m doing now and\u00A0adding in some sort of turbo mode.

If you want a larger warp bubble:\u00A0Change the Model scale for the warp bubble, then in USI_ModuleWarpEngine multiply BubbleSize by the same factor you did the model. If you did 2,2,2 for the model, do 40 for the BubbleSize. Or pretty sure that should work anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso my dev version it matters a lot where you are .
