Someone else mentioned it once, and I admit I just accepted it. The problem seems to stem from seating a Kerbal in a command seat, it does something wonky to wheel colliders. So on a craft with no Kerbals when separating a part balanced on wheels against the main part it works correctly. Put a command seat somewhere and seat a Kerbal and then suddenly the wheel colliders are sinking through. it does this regardless of whether you seat the Kerbal using Take Command or EVA them and walk over to the seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spheniscine","CreatedById":125755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T03:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHm there seems to be a side-effect of this mod, where rescue contracts can sometimes spawn with Kerbals in command seats.
