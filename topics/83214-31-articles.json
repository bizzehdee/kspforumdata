Linux support has been virtually non-existent in ATI, with FireGLX driver (proprietary professional driver) supporting only professional FireGL cards \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E only on very specific distributions \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E specific applications. Compared to Nvidia, ATI was utterly unusable in Linux, to the extent that starting a simple 3d game would crash the OS. There was attempt to write an open working driver, which had only basic support.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnly when AMD bought them, AMD began the opensource driver (called \u0022radeon\u0022) effort. In mere 3 years(2011-2014), from near zero featureset \u0022radeon\u0022 has reached very wide hardware support, OpenGL went from 1.0 to 3.3 (currently nearing OpenGL 4.5), hardware video acceleration and good reclocking was implemented. The old proprietary crash-friendly FireGLX driver was also refactored and started sharing the same team as Windows \u0022Catalyst\u0022 driver (hence, also renamed to \u0022Catalyst for Linux\u0022).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince 2014-2016 the new open driver, based on \u0022radeon\u0022, was introduced (\u0022amdgpu\u0022). The difference is that part of the open driver (\u0022amdgpu\u0022) is used also by proprietary driver (Catalyst name dropped,\u00A0 now \u0022amdgpu\u002B\u0022)- so they share the same (open) codebase in kernel. The only difference is in user space (regular programs), where \u0022amdgpu\u002B\u0022 is a) proprietary b) contains still patented stuff b)designed to support newest cards until base driver catches up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play KSP on \u0022old\u0022 HD5850 Evergreen using open driver \u0022radeon\u0022, which was fully supported since 2013 and continues to be supported.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe proprietary driver even today should be only used if open driver does not work, which can only be the case of very very new card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222706436\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002283214\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470449351\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002243627\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JoelleEmmily\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/6/2016 at 4:09 AM, JoelleEmmily said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, so, what I\u0027ve discovered.

I played with GeForce 256 and then purchased Asus GeForce2 MX400 to compare. The performance of R100 was in same league of MX, although advertized to compete with GeForce2 GTS, it failed. Sum up: ATi to Nvidia ratio was okay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA also had Radeon 8500 (non LE model), which was quite an improvement and similar to GeForce3 series. Sum up: ATi improved to Nvidia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI shortly had hand on ATi 9800Pro, which is truely quite a beast, easily competing with GeForce6800GT (which I later also had, Asus V9999). Unfortunately my card died soon from bad ball soldering and turned out was in need of reballing, so I had to sell it. Sum up: ATi was adequate or even winning to Nvidia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next era Nvidia introduced 8800 GT chip (g80) which was incredibly good scalar chip. It was subsequently \u0022improved\u0022 first in lower nm and then pushed by transistor beef. What does ATi do? It started to push a newer generation literally each year -- which lead to very poor driver quality on MS Doors. I had ownership of 8800, 9800GT and GTX260sp216, which blew the hell of all ATI cards right until and including the HD4xxx series (which were quite impressive) appear. I skipped the whole ATI generation wagon until (and owned) HD4650. I almost purchased HD4850, but got a good deal with GTX260sp216 - so skipped it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem happened between 9800Pro and right through the HD4000. They changed architecture very often, for example 9500/9700/9800, X800, X1800 and HD2xxx were all quite different. The HD3000-4000 were also different, but luckily quite potent. The ATI driver quality became really bad due to constant internal changes and this is very likely because of how they decided to build their cards. Nvidia simply took one chip (G80/8800) and scaled it down as needed. Also its around this time when I started experimenting with Linux for real, and got a taste of their driver support with HD4650.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was only release of Evergreen / HD5xxx series, which turned the favors for ATI -- but they were already near the end and were purchased by AMD. Only Evergreen architecture became powerful enough to maintain status quo and beat Nvidia long enough -- until Nvidia released the Fermi (Thermi, from trollish- \u0022egg cooking on GPU\u0022). Only Fermi caught up and Evergreen, and now AMD stopped the constant generation jump and released improved HD6xxx, and only later went Nvidia route and dropped the VLIW (HD3xxx-HD6xxx).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo right now, you can agree that Nvidia\u0027s hardware is better than of AMD (there are a lot of caveats and faults in some cards), but this is hardly due to AMD policy. Quite opposite, AMD saved ATI and managed to carry them through, although itself experiencing financial troubles in CPU area due to Bulldozer bad performance on low load applications and excessive electricity use on full load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I am still stuck with HD5850 because of how awesome this GPU is - and how awesome the open driver became since end of 2014. I wanted to get HD7950 (instead of RX200/300), but now I wait how good the RX4x0 will hold to the word \u0022best fps bang for the buck\u0022 because currently I simply have no use for the ultra-high FPS load modern GPUs offer in my spare time. Or I am getting old. Eitherway - no denying that Nvidia went the performance route, but so is their price, and last time I checked their driver was still proprietary, where AMD is either open or semi-open (AMDGPU\u002B) upon your choice, so they both have their market segments and the hands of Linux gamer are not tied up, unlike in ATI era.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoelleEmmily","CreatedById":43627,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-12T15:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157058-kerbal101/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157058\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157058-kerbal101/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Kerbal101\u003C/a\u003E My first ATI was the VGA Wonder\u002B, then I might have had a mach, but I can\u0027t remember exactly; then I had two Rages, one of which was the Rage II, the other might have been a Fury but that could have been my boyfriend at the time\u0027s; then an All-in-Wonder Pro, which could have been my other Rage, a 7200 DDR, 9700 Pro, All-in-Wonder 9700 or 9600 Pro, can\u0027t remember which but I ran it for a VERY long time; then one of the first hydravision cards, though I don\u0027t remember which one.
