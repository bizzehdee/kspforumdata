So ideal wheels.\n\nNow sit the airplane on the treadmill and turn the treadmill on. What happens? The airplane just sits there. No matter how fast the treadmill runs, the wheels spin the same speed and no force is transmitted to the plane.\n\nThus you see that the treadmill can not transmit any force to the plane. Period. So it doesn\u0027t matter how fast or slow the treadmill is turning. The only force being transmitted to the plane comes from the engines.

Can the belt make the plane stand still despite the plane\u0027s propulsion being independent of the belt. A remote controlled car can be held in place because the wheels drive the car and that is being countered by the belt. If the drive is external, say a person standing in front of the conveyor belt pulling the  car with a rope, can the belt apply enough force to overcome the force applied by the rope (or the aircraft\u0027s engines)."},{"CreatedByName":"55delta","CreatedById":101735,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-31T01:56:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Wjolcz said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s it.
