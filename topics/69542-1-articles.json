Even if I only use a LFB KR-1x2 in the first stage, all delta-v calculations for the upper stages will disappear and it will look like my rocket has no stages at all. The only way to get the delta-v readings back is to jettison the new parts and reload the rocket from the tracking station. This also happens in the VAB and it makes it very difficult to design efficient rockets. If anybody knows how to fix this or has a patch, please help me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T16:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich version of MechJeb are you using?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firephyz","CreatedById":108357,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T01:07:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using version 2.2 which I\u0027m pretty sure is the latest version.
