Remove most of those canards and add some struts and I think we are in business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may find the initial is wobbly because it is trying to roll the craft on 90 degrees shortly after take off. You can change that by setting rProgram to 180. But yea, Computer controlled rockets are going to be faster than a human controlled one so you may think about giving it less atmospheric control authority. Maybe add a few reaction wheels and reduce the canards. It definitely needs struts. I didn\u0027t add any or change anything because I wanted to be sure it would at least orbit the rocket. That rocket is very much like most kerbal rockets. So I figured it was the perfect test vehicle. It is certainly very close to be being on the edge of what the program is able to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yea the test rocket is wobbly. That is down to how it is constructed more than what the program is doing. I tried it with mech jeb and it is just as wobbly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry the Jebpollo if you haven\u0027t already. I also took the time to write a transfer script. Eccentricity of 1.2E-05 is the lowest I have seen reported after a transfer. And I know how to get the eccentricity of the launch script down even further. Literally, one ten thousandth of that eccentricity is hard coded and can be removed. I had several launches to orbit last night with an \u0022e\u0022 of six hundred thousandths or better. I would say that part of the code is working fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not happy with the way I am doing G-turns right now. Those can be customized for whatever rocket you are launching and it does work well for a variety of standard rockets but it isn\u0027t ideal for all. I am going to have to find a way to replace that part of the script with more dynamic code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TMS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TMS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETried Payload\u0027s script with a few different rockets.

Because that is the new launch to orbit and it should circularize any rocket if you let it. You can\u0027t warp past it\u0027s intended burn start though or it will cause problems. Either way, if the script is having trouble controlling your rocket it\u0027s down to one of two things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour rocket doesn\u0027t have enough control or it has too much.

Straight up. It is not pretty. There seems to be a certain amount of error in the method I am using since it\u0027s not a product of prograde it\u0027s not exactly holding the heading we want. Also the circularization burn was getting jacked up because of that too. So any kind of inclination was causing problems with that as well. I have fixed the circularization by being sure to set the steering to prograde before the burn. I think there might be a way to use a product of up and heading to set a definitive direction. I need to investigate further. Also everyone needs to make sure they upgrade to kOS 0.5 because I\u0027m pretty sure you will need that for the heading thing to function.

I\u0027m struggling to see where the problem lies. It\u0027s not a lack of control authority, as the ship is capable of turning in the gravity turn. Nor does it appear to be too much control authority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?7vye8i0aq4q6nr5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?7vye8i0aq4q6nr5\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe video below is typical of what I\u0027m talking about (view in HD for statistical/navball details). Ignore the circularisation burn as I didn\u0027t have enough dV to get into stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb2zbBpjlAc%5D\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb2zbBpjlAc]\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAway from that, the circularisation script works very well when you do have the fuel in the stage - although the timewarp misses lower apoapses. I suspect you need some sort of logic in there that figures out if the target apoapsis is only a small increment away from the point at which warp can be switched on and, if so, only use the lower warp levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I suspect this is a kOS issue, but physical warp is also enabled if KSP.exe isn\u0027t the active window (I play in windowed fullscreen). Might add that to the Git bug tracker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently you didn\u0027t read about the time warp. The warp logic is already set to be sensible. I also can\u0027t fix the fact that the Physical warp kicks in if you have focus on the kOS window. The best I can do is close the display before it warps. That would have to be an action group that YOU set up. I can\u0027t do it for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Your rocket can\u0027t roll fast enough so it\u0027s wobbling about. According to Kevin, that should be reduced in the new version that is coming \u0022soon TM.\u0022 I have no control over that. I think the major problem is coming from force roll on lift off. I have been able to successfully add roll control back in the test version. You will have to set it so that your rocket doesn\u0027t roll after take off. I have a few things to do this morning but I\u0027ll be back in a few hours and I can post the script with roll control. I bet that solves your take off wobbles. It is trying to roll to 0 right after take off. You just need to tell it not to. Just to be clear. I have no control over the PID for the steering. I can only tell it where to point. Reading Kevin\u0027s latest blog post has me pretty assured we wont have to suffer that problem much longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK just watched your whole video. That rocket is not stable because it is bottom heavy. It also looks like you have FAR installed. I cannot help with a dynamic pressure problem you have caused yourself. Try reducing the TWR limit until it\u0027s stable in lower atmosphere. Next time ask yourself why you think you need all that orange tank and mainsail to launch such a light payload. Look at it driving the steering controls to the limits! How is it supposed to be able to control the rocket if it is at it\u0027s limit? Lose that ridiculous lower stage for something about 30 tons lighter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou guys install all of these things to make flying rockets more real and then you complain to me that it is too real?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-15T14:58:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/15/2013 02:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Payload\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T15:06:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Payload\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Payload\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EApparently you didn\u0027t read about the time warp.
