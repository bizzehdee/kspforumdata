I have perfected the art of airliner landing. I am SO glad I did not have to resort to using lots of struts or COMPLEETLEY resort to the MK 2 program. Launch was as usual. Pull up. The 747 took up half the runway. Then flew high and turned left. Until about 1000 feet, I pulled up. I made it so the altitude went down 1 every 5 seconds. It landed with a soft bump. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/15knoDf.png\u0022 alt=\u002215knoDf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough my flying caused some of it most of it was caused by some overpowered engines, using the turbo jets. I replaced them with the smaller ones. I also landed the A380 but it crashed into the hills. Lesson of the day.
