I\u0027m developing a shuttle system that has a bit more of a futuristic look, (or more sci-fi take your pick) The down side is none of the parts will be able to cleanly mate with the existing parts and add-ons (mainly because I lack skill), but I do plan on remedying this.The main tank\u0027s bottom is 3m, and the boosters are LFTs and LFEs, the decoupler is a cheat to crossfeed the boosters and the main tank. I\u0027m probably going to chop part of the top off and turn that into a decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s a connected and exploded view (no, not that kind of exploded).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj280/salsa100/future_Shuttle.png\u0022 alt=\u0022future_Shuttle.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj280/salsa100/future_Shuttle_exploded.png\u0022 alt=\u0022future_Shuttle_exploded.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bperry","CreatedById":4058,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-08T01:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks impressive.
