Folks, I have a pretty stressful job working with college students that simply believe all life is is who they are and that the world revolves around and is all about them. I visit this particular thread just so I can see there are others out there that truly are not so self centered and have some common sense. I\u0027ve had a great many a laugh (or two) during office hours reading some of the truly great posts on this thread. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAs I often tell my students, your underwear and religion are extremely important and personal. We all know most of us wear underwear and most of us have some sort of opinion on religion and many of us may actually be practitioners in a religion we deem important. However, just as I do not care what type of underwear you wear, I am also not overly concerned with what religion, if any, you subscribe to. It is between you and your chosen deity, just as your underwear is between your body and your clothes (unless you run around the house with your underwear on your head). ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) So, with that said, if you want to talk religion, make it a private message. And if you see the need to talk about underwear, I\u0027d prefer that be within the context of a private message because I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW what type of skivvies you wear. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nSo, with this in mind, I will share with you a facepalm moment from today\u0027s class:\n\nI have a student who only attends one out of four lectures. This afternoon, he came up to my office hours to yell about his grade that is being displayed on Black Board. I make it a habit not to report non-attendance until mid-terms because if I do it before then, it can mess with a student\u0027s financial aid (we are still two weeks away from mid-terms). Anyhow, today he told me that he hated my class, he thought my assignments and grading policy was stupid (four exams, a project paper, and discussion questions on Black Board). He told me that he could pass the class IF I were to do it \u0022old school\u0022 - meaning two exams, no paper, no discussion boards. I told him to come back in an hour and IF he were to pass both exams and average a \u0022C\u0022 I would give him that as his final grade, no questions asked. I then told him that if he made a \u0022D\u0022 or lower, I would immediately report his absences. I even offered to give him five days to prepare for the two exams. His exact words, \u0022I learned it all in high school, I am ready now...\u0022 ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\nWell, after struggling with the first test for an hour and then two hours for the second test, he demanded I grade them right then. He failed the first test (35/100) and failed the second test (22/100) and had the nerve to ask me if we could change the deal to make it easier on him. Nope, I called the financial aid office and reported him as not attending. Never, never make a deal with a college professor you are not prepared to follow through with... ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T02:01:07Z","Content":"Reminder to razark:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\*Do NOT refer to other\u0027s posts on this forum.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-25T02:23:41Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2015 02:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by razark**"},{"CreatedByName":"wx7","CreatedById":151184,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T02:15:00Z","Content":"Here, let\u0027s start a self-moderating movement.\n\nPut this at the end of your posts in this thread.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **\\*NEVER make fun of anyone specifically.
