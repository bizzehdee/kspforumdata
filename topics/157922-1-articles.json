It was possible to achieve such speeds by ultra close Slate and Eeloo flybies, which gave it enough speed. All of them were perfectly planned, unfortunately, close Tekto flyby was impossible.\u00A0During the slingshots, Pathfinder was able to capture stunning firsts of Sarnus system up close. It even found a completely new moon, designated Sarnus IV, the official name is still to come. Here are some of the best captures:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDistant Tekto:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022X2HawBG.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X2HawBG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best quality image we ever made exceedes all the ground and Kerbin based telescope images. Tekto, also designated Sarnus III is an average sized moon, with light green ground and some very dark seas of unknown liquid. An upcoming mission to Sarnus will study it closer, maybe discovering amazing details about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGigantic Slate:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fZGWUho.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fZGWUho.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022775\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlate, Sarnus I, is a very prominent giant moon orbiting Sarnus. It seems to have lots of scars, valleys and mountain ridges. These may have been caused by some liquid, maybe even water, which caused plate tectonics to happen.

It is very bright and less dense than a normal rocky body like Moho, which means it is mostly made of ice.
