Whether or not the physics-less parameter would be carried over is another question entirely, and I would venture that it is not. This shouldn\u0027t present much of an issue because the change to physics-less for those specific parts was due to the fact that you would not normally attach them in a symmetrical manner, but would expect the craft to behave as if there was little to no effect from them being present. When welded to a part that does have mass being applied in the game, you would expect the part to gain a minimal amount of mass, but the part in which mass would be ignored no longer has the same effect since it\u0027s now a part of the other part and won\u0027t be causing any extra pull to one side during flight due to it\u0027s asymmetrical position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea how it would work if you welded a bunch of physics-less parts together without a physical part acting as the base.
