An more failsafe method is to climb to 15km as fast as possible then level off to about 5 degree climb to gain speed. Slowly climb and make sure your doing at least 1000m/s at 20 km altitude. Maintain this climb and acceleration as long as possible, reduce throttle to prevent flame out if you have to. (Jet fuel is cheap, rocket fuel is not.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen climbing gets too difficult or you run out of throttle switch to rockets. Raise your prograde up to about 5 to 10 degrees and increase AP to 70\u002B km. Warp to AP and circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T11:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved thread. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
