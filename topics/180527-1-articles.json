With the shroud in place the drills seem to \u0022magically\u0022 protrude through the underside of the craft. Hey if the game allows it, a little magic is fine. But there is a problem with these components: The explosive doors are staged and therefore at some point have to be jettisoned, which makes attaching parts to them a bit tricky. In fact I just attached said parts (radiators and structural wings in this case) to other parts adjacent to the service module. And the doors are jettisoned in the first stage and the holes covered up by large panel radiators. But I shouldn\u0027t have to be tricky. If fairings can have their staging disabled via advanced tweakables, why can the service modules? And engines should be unstagable too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact every single part that can be staged should have the option to be not staged with advanced tweakabled engaged!

That\u0027\u0027s how I, as an engineer that can\u0027t seem to learn coding, would do it. So it should only be a matter of copying the code sections that allow certain parts that can be de-staged into every other staged part. And even if it isn\u0027t as simple is my ignorant notions say it should be, this is still a better use of the programmers time than changing the color schemes of older parts.
