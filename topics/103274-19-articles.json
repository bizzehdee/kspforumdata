C#/mono is a garbage-collected language so that the developer doesn\u0027t have to manually de-allocate memory, but they still have to kill any reference to it (basically, gc is useless), or it will hang around in memory forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the memory is listed as \u0027allocated\u0027 still, it can\u0027t be used for any other purpose. Thus, you\u0027ll eventually run out of available memory (even in 64-bit systems, it would just take longer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy far the biggest source of crashes in current KSP (0.90) is the out-of-memory crash. Getting rid of any memory leaks would greatly reduce the occurrences of such crashes (especially in a pure-stock install), which in turn would bring the total number of crashes down enormously (for my own KSP, they account for like 85%-ish of the crashes. Maybe 90%?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if it turns out that Unity is causing a significant percentage of the leaks, the effect of Squad\u0027s fixups will have that as a ceiling. Given that, and that there are simple workarounds for avoiding the memory crashes, I\u0027d rank the memory leak fixes as below many of the other features.
