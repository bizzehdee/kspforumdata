First off, incoming speed is a huge factor in aerobraking: a periapsis of 11,000m on Duna will send most ships plowing into the surface if you transfer straight from Kerbin, but if you\u0027re coming in from Eeloo at its furthest point, you\u0027ll end up in a highly elliptical orbit. Also, the mass and drag of the craft have an enormous impact as well, not to mention what control surfaces do to aerodynamics right now (which is, generally speaking, break them).
