Im at the point where I am starting to think of making a space station, but everything I have read looks to be several versions or years old. So a few questions:\n\n- If I build a Orbiting Station with a Lab on it, will it automatically generate science?\n\n- What other things can you do with stations other than use them as fuel depots?\n\nIf need be, are there any good mods for stations that will be worth it to run on stock 1.02?\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T02:53:31Z","Content":"1) not automatically. You need to first load data into the lab (using the \u0027process in lab\u0027 option on experiments), then right click the lab to start researching. Once you have done those two things, then it\u0027ll automatically generate science. [you also need to have at least one scientist in the lab to be able to start researching]\n\n2)\n\n-You can use stations to hold equipment and crew (i.e. ISRU, comms, hitchhiker containers). \n\n-Once you have a station, it also becomes trivial to fill the \u0027science data from space around the \u003C...\u003E\u0027 contracts. (run a experiment on the station, then transmit)\n\n-science labs\n\nI don\u0027t know any good mods focused only on stations, but many mods (i.e. remote tech, interstellar) add more uses for stations.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T02:57:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 02:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reddeyfish**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T02:54:58Z","Content":"- If I build a Orbiting Station with a Lab on it, will it automatically generate science?\n\nNo, you need to put data and scientists in.\n\n- What other things can you do with stations other than use them as fuel depots?\n\nNot much with stock, but you can probably do something with mods, e.g. RemoteTech antenna center.\n\n\u003EIf need be, are there any good mods for stations that will be worth it to run on stock 1.02?\n\nwait for StationScience, probably?"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T03:24:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If need be, are there any good mods for stations that will be worth it to run on stock 1.02?\n\nYou might want to look at the Karbonite mod, which has some nice parts for collecting resources from low orbit. I\u0027m also a huge fan of the USI Kolonization Systems mod, which lets you assemble much more complicated self-sufficient stations."},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T04:27:55Z","Content":"If you\u0027ve got a decent resource infrastructure in place you could use them as switching stations for Kerbals. For example, launch a cheap rocket or SSTO plane to rendezvous with a station in low Kerbin orbit, catch a nuclear powered ship to a Minmus station, then ride a lander down to a surface base. Then you\u0027ve only gotta pay for the first rocket, everything else only costs the time of fuel production."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T06:32:15Z","Content":"[Station Science](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54774-1-0-2-Station-Science-%28v1-5-1-0-2-compatibility%29) is the go-to mod for this kind of thing, but last I checked it hadn\u0027t updated yet...\n\nEDIT: Nevermind, it actually did update when I wasn\u0027t looking!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T07:36:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 07:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"}]}
