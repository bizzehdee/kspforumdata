In this game, you take command of either NASA or the Soviet Space Agency during the space race of the 1960\u0027s with the goal of getting a man on the moon before your opponent does. In December of 2012, Slitherine Games announced that they are working with Buzz Aldrin to make a new game based on BARIS, it has been called \u003Cstrong\u003EBuzz Aldrin\u0027s Space Program Manager\u003C/strong\u003E set for release some time this year. Not much is known about this game yet.
