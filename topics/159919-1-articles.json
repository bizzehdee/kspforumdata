Bill strode through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E looking up at the giant beast of a rocket. The Hercules V was the largest rocket single-handily. It towered over the Hercules 1B and boasted five mainsail engines instead of three. It would be the rocket that would get them to the mun.

He was known as the second best pilot in the KASA, and would have been thought as the best if he wasn\u0027t married, was the LM pilot.

He stood up, dusted himself off as best as he could and\u00A0picked up his scattered supplies.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Son.\u0022 Jeb looked up quickly, not-expecting his father to be here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Y-yes.\u0022 Jeb stuttered fearfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What is this?\u0022 asked his father, looking at his son\u0027s bloody face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nothing.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Son, somebody beat you, I can tell.\u0022 stated his father looking at his messy face, \u0022Did you fight back?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, sir.\u0022 replied Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Son, will you get that bully back, pain for pain.\u0022 asked his father, goading him on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, sir.\u0022 replied Jeb, brightening slightly. He would get that bully back. A small conscience twinged in the back of his brain. \u003Ci\u003EThat bully did break you, it broke you to crave revenge. Not to submission, but to vengeance.\u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Jeb woke up startled in his bed. He had collapsed in bed the day before when he returned from the introduction into the public relations board.That had been an exhausting day, and now he had to do it all over agin.\u00A0He felt lonely, remembering the past. His father had always goaded him on to fight, to face his fears. And he had done so, masking his feelings either under a triumphant attitude or no emotion at all. He had been the coolest kid in school, with a car he had won from a illegal poker match with the bully, which he did strip everything of value off of by catching him cheat. There was a half-a-dozen girls who hung around him during school, all trying to be the coolest girl with the coolest guy. He hardly drank unless there was reason other than to get drunk. Everyday he had to spend time\u00A0building up his emotional mask, telling lies to himself. He felt very lonely, sometimes lonely enough to consider not constructing an emotional barrier. But every-time so far he had instantly purged the thought from his mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe astronaut core did nothing to help, in fact it hurt him. He often sat envious of the guys in class who would be best buddies. He once even considered talking with them, but they were the backwater of the class and \u0027had\u0027 to spend time with the coolest in the school. When he made his first flight, being co-pilot to Thompwell Kerman on China 6 and helping them land safely on Kerbin. This heightened his popularity without end. With each additional flight more and more people joined the fans cheering him on. Except that they weren\u0027t. They were there because it was the best place to get popular. The most popular people were in the Jeb Kerman fan clubs. Jeb could feel that most of them weren\u0027t there because of him, but because of the other people in each club. His real supporters were choked out by the crowd. He could never find somebody who was authentic, but he knew that they must exist.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe must get to work. He stood up and stretched, now that he thought about it, how about one day with an emotional mask? Really, didn\u0027t help anybody except himself. In fact, it hurt him. Everyday now he could feel the kerbality draining from him. Soon, he would be able to go back, to be real with people. No, impossible. He threw it from his mind. He had to play to the crowd\u0027s wishes, he wouldn\u0027t stop being the famous Jebediah Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe fake Jebediah Kerman.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sighed.

It should be noted that through the brave intervention of Jebediah Kerman, they managed to bring the LM under control.

As it is, we still have another twelve years of Mun missions. Then a mission or two to captured asteroids, it would be about fourteen years until we will use your equipment.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I was just getting to that. We think we have an improved LM. It can hold three Kerbals instead of two, it also comes with a new command module with space for five, Two would stay in orbit and the three would go down to the Mun, let\u0027s say to a base there. Stay for a couple Munths, then return to the CM, and come home.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene laughed, \u0022So you are content with pushing me around, telling me what to do?

The commander was Thomski Kerman, Veteran of the Third China flight. The LM pilot/scientist was Erisei Kerman. She had been the scientist on China 7. The CM pilot was Dundan, a newbie. Munory, the physician of the mission, looked over the the crews health records. This was a vital yet obscure part of the mission process, and he was proud to have it.\u00A0He expected everything to be fine. If it wasn\u0027t there was two other backup teams ready to fill any hole. He looked over Erisei\u0027s medical scan, then startled. He dropped his mug of coffee surprised. It fell and shattered on the floor. There was something really wrong with this scan.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the scan was correct. Erisei Kerman had an anomaly on her left arm. This anomaly looked to be where her funny bone used to be, right on her elbow. It would require a lot of extra time to find out what this was, but this ended her assignment to the mission. He sprinted to the telephone and called Gene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello Munory. What happened?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Erisei\u0027s scans don\u0027t check out.

She says that she is Jeb\u0027s older sister, Valentina. She is on reserve team 1. I think she will fly the LM pretty good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, whatever you say Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomski Kerman looked at Valentina in feigned disinterest as she strode across the training room to the fake CM and LM set. The way she carried herself was very similar to Jeb, except more humble. She was pretty, not exceptionally but very nice overall. \u00A0Her eyes caught his attention from the first moment he saw them. They were a grassy green which went well with her black hair and pale green skin. She wore no make-up, but she was still beautiful.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, are you Thomski Kerman.\u0022 she asked him when she crossed the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe Astronaut Corp is NOT a place to fall in love in,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ethe sensible side of his mind argued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes. I am your commander. You might want to meet our CM pilot, Dundan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDundan who had been busy in the fake capsule, crawled out. His eyes opened in astonishment when he saw Val.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I, amm, am Dandun, Dundan.\u0022 He stuttered helplessly. He only being 24, he still hadn\u0027t known how to compose himself around beautiful women, probably the only reason he had a wife.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello, I\u0027m your LM pilot, Valentina, when do we start training?\u0022 Val flashed a brilliant smile\u00A0to the flabbergasted Dundan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We were training, let\u0027s\u00A0restart and try again.\u0022 Thomski replied for Dundan. \u003Ci\u003EWow, she is beautiful,\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Ereplied the more kerbal side of him. He would have to watch himself to make sure he didn\u0027t say anything embarrassing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA week later they were sitting on the pad with the Hercules V. Gene drove up near the launch pad to see a load of reporters and unassigned controllers assembled near a large platform they had constructed.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs he got out of his car, the controllers started chanting, \u0022Speech! Speech! Speech!\u0022 Gene slowly walked to the platform and mounted it. This was the zenith of his life, the week were he would complete the mission given to him personally by John F. Kerman, days before his attempted assassination. All the TV cameras were looking at him when he began his makeshift speech by the Hercules V, five minutes before lift-off.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Friends, employees, reporters, astronauts, dreamers. Here on this launch pad is a rocket, fueled by dreams. The dreams of thousands of hardworking Kerbals \u00A0invested\u00A0in their planet\u0027s future in space exploration. Here is the result of their dreams. The largest piece of machinery ever flown, the record breaker for distance, endurance, perseverance, and boldness. Here, is the Hercules V with Helios 3, now renamed the Extra-ordinary by the crew of Val, Thomski, and Dundan. Now, I believe that we shall run for cover.\u0022 Everyone applauded him, short and to the point, that was how Kerbals like it. After vigorous applauding, everyone sprinted for cover as the loud speaker played The Final Countdown.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00225, 4, 3, main booster ignition, 2, 1.\u0022 Exhaust fumes erupted from the bottom of the beast, and it detached from the pad. Kerbals screamed in delight and terror at the same time, while the crew who had watched Gene make his speech were engulfed in the smoke cloud. They would be fine, a little sooty but still alive.The rocket rose steadily from the pad and started a gentle gravity turn. \u0022And lift-off of the Helios 3 to the Mun and back!\u0022 the speakers finally cried.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd cheered, they were going to land on the Mun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb smirked as he watched the Helios 3 take-off from the launch pad in the Kerman Space Center, \u0022Show them your skills Val. You are one of the best pilots over flown, show them.\u0022 he encouraged the unresponsive screen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was when the first stage exploded and the Helios 3 plummeted to the unforgiving waters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-26T04:51:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2017 04:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Alpha 360\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u0026quot;Kouston, we have several problems, but that doesn\u0026#039;t matter so we want to continue on with the mission.\u0026quot;\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha 360","CreatedById":166007,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-08T17:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EChapter 5: A New Pla\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003En\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, RL has been computer free the last couple days, this will make up for the lack of POA.\u00A0By the way, I am giving Ultimate Steve the credit for coming up\u00A0with\u00A0the story in a spoiler\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 The Extra-ordinary spiraled down, the rocket weighing it down as it tumbled towards the ground.

A minute later the engine cut off. He unbuckled from his seat and drifted up to the LM cockpit. He pointed an accusing finger at Jeb, \u0022You initiated the burn while I was asleep.

After three hours in orbit, we will send you a departure burn. It takes nine days to reach Minmus and nine back. You will be stuck in that tin can for roughly a Munth.

Don\u2019t be choosey about your landing site, remember. Highlands and flats are very easy to land on, lowlands and slopes are usually bad choices, and midlands are mediocre. As soon as you have performed all experiments, leave on a trajectory with the same plane as the Arbitrary cargo station.

When Wensie shook her hand, she almost pulled her hand back as an automatic impulse. That was how cold her hand was. But stronger than any of that, she stepped into their relationship, hers and Jeb\u2019s. She showed no respect for previous love, shallowing up what was between the other astronauts.

I just appeared one day, right next to the road at the mouth of a side-trail. This side-trail, it was spoken of as haunted. That a kraken\u2019s bones lay buried in the bog. I was beautiful from the beginning all the neighbors were amazed at me, for I was a prodigy as well. I quickly made a name for myself, in the mountainous regions up north. One day a man came into town, he was well dressed a spent freely. He said he looked for intelligent children to teach to become the great scientists and engineers. I was ten at the time, but I wanted to go.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, I did so. We left for the journey to the nearest civilized city, which was a few hundred kilometers south, Kouston. I stayed with the man, he was friendly and quickly found out that I was a natural engineer. Through the years, I was trained personally by him. There were a few others who we also trained. I remember one of them was Gene Kerman. We referred to him as the Teacher. He was a strange kerbal, but the strangest thing about him is that he thought that he had scientifically proven that there were deities, a divine. He thing that caught his attention most was the dark side of these deities. There was one that represented all things evil, a Kraken. When I was twenty years old, about two years ago, He sent me to a fledgling space program along with a few others, Gene included. They worked hard and managed to send up a little space station, that was a year ago. I voted to man the station for a little while, I was promised only for a month, I believed them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey sent me up to that same space station that you found me in. I ran it for about a month when I started to protest being sent back down. They refused to do it. I was trapped up in that space station. I started to weep as soon as they broke the news. Then, then the Kraken appeared. The station turned black, lights shut off. I figured out soon why they sent me up there, I was a slave to the Kraken. I played with me, turning lights on and off, making rockets appear out of nothing, ready to take me home except that when I reached them I couldn\u2019t find them. I couldn\u2019t make any distress calls. I longed for any kerbal interaction, just a wave or a hello. Then after a year I refused to do anything. The crops were untended, the solar panels not dusted. Nothing. Soon the kraken lost its interest there. When it left I made the distress call. You then found me, I\u2019m sorry if I had in anyway interfered with your lives. I\u2019m sorry.\u201D She broke down weeping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u201CGene kept you up there?\u201D asked Jeb. Wensie shook her head, \u201CNo, the one who called me was Corkin.

Suddenly light-headedness struck Jeb. He floated, his mind frozen. He struggled to wake up. He was alone in the command module, he couldn\u2019t cry out or move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb! Come down here! The Mystery Goo is going crazy. Its floating out of the container and it turns all shades of color!\u201D cried Agagy, almost hypnotized by the floating Goo. Jeb wanted to cry out, but he could do nothing. His eyes went to the clock, it was almost time for the maneuver node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStelta wrenched herself from the display, Jeb still hadn\u2019t come. She climbed the ladder up to the CM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb, are you coming?\u201D she asked. Jeb lay there floating, his eyes flashing back and forth fearfully. He opened his mouth and no words came out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb, are you okay?\u201D Stelta floated over to Jeb. Jeb moved his mouth, but nothing came out. \u201CJeb! Answer me!\u201D She shook him. His eyes glazed over, his eyelids straining to stay open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGuys! Quick! Jeb\u2019s not well!\u201D Stelta nearly screamed down the ladder. Kenski and Agagy came up, when they saw Jeb they quickly dispersed looking for medical supplies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb was breathing, his chest fell up and down, but no sound came from him. His chest was rising and falling faster. Stelta felt his pulse, it was slowing down, then speeding up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb, answer me!\u201D She shook him, then he coughed, but no sound came from him. A red globe exited his mouth, followed by a larger behind it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKenski came back with some medical supplies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D he asked rapidly, Stelta replied, \u201CHis lungs and heart are failing. I think his lungs are the issue.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKenski pulled out a stethoscope and listened to Jeb\u2019s pulse, \u201CHe must have had a heart attack, it\u2019s so irregular.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWensie came upstairs, an acute fear in her face, \u201CThe Kraken has come. He distracted us while he infected Jeb with, with something. We must complete the maneuver node, its coming in eight minutes. It\u2019s what Jeb would have wanted.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb wake up. Jeb, we need you now!\u201D cried Stelta, she started to weep. Jeb\u2019s breath was getting shorter and shorter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStelta, you\u2019re our only pilot. You will have to do the burn.\u201D Wensie stated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t give a crap to what you say. Kenski help me.\u201D Stelta struggled to open Jeb\u2019s flight suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStelta, the artificial gravity will help. Do the maneuver node at full thrust, it will dislodge anything in his throat.\u201D Kenski reasoned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe need to get Jeb back to Kerbin NOW. The Kraken infected him with something, and we need to cure it.\u201D argued Stelta, not giving up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe need to do what Jeb would want us to do. Now, as Jeb\u2019s second in command, I order you to complete the maneuver node.\u201D ordered Kenski.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStelta looked at Jeb\u2019s chest. There was a large purple bruise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDid the Kraken just punch him?\u201D wondered Agagy. \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWensie looked at it, \u201CHe must have. He\u2026\u2026.\u201D Wensie stopped talking, her face full of fear. Her eyes started to glaze over like Jeb\u2019s, this time the eyelids fell shut. She floated towards the window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStelta started screaming. Kenski grabbed Wensie and pushed her downstairs, \u201CQuick! I\u2019ll get Jeb strapped in there as well.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStelta cried, her tears mixing in with the blood bubbles floating around Jeb\u2019s head. She pushed him over to Kenski who took him downstairs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgagy looked frightened, \u201CDon\u2019t, don\u2019t do it at full thrust. Do it at a constant third of a G. That should help them get any blood out of their lungs.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStelta nodded, then burst into a new wave of tears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CQuick! Get to the controls. Do this for Jeb.\u201D Agagy pushed Stelta towards the controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStelta obeyed, doing everything slowly. It felt like a dream when she started the engine. It felt like a dream when she shut-off the engines. She came alive when screams of pain erupted from the downstairs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe unbuckled, startled to find that Agagy wasn\u2019t there. She pushed herself down the ladder. Jeb\u2019s eyes were wild, almost insane. But, they weren\u2019t glazed over. He was back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe floated towards him, then he gave a screech of pain. Blood spilled from his mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb?\u201D she asked, her voice seeming very small.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKenski drifted up right next to her, his eyes downcast, \u201CIts, Its been hell. Jeb, Jeb.\u201D He started crying, \u201CJeb is insane.\u201D He embraced her, shaking. Not in love, but in fear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere\u2019s Agagy?\u201D asked Stelta.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe\u2019s outside. The fuel tank\u2019s leaking so she need to patch it up since I\u2019m the only one with medical experience.\u201D She entered through the airlock in the floor below them as if on que.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFuel tank\u2019s patched. Also had to replace a fuel pump.\u201D She said, her shoulders sagging. She looked at Kenski hugging Stelta, and shrugged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship started groaning like some great weight was upon it, then it started to turn and flip. Stelta shot herself towards the ladder and hit the wall. Groaning, she aimed again and pushed off colliding with the mystery goo container. Agagy had put the goo back inside, but it inexplicably opened and her body sucked in the goo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStelta!\u201D cried Kenski. He launched himself at her, and missed. He rebounded towards her. The flipping was accelerating. He grabbed her by the waist and launched himself over to the ladder. He hit his head on the ladder, but managed to grab on to one rung. He pushed himself and Stelta up through the hole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kraken greeted them. The room was pitch black. She couldn\u2019t see anything. Nothing but the Kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe didn\u2019t speak. He existed in that room, but wasn\u2019t physically there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStelta coughed, her body starting to spasm. Kenski opened his mouth an exhaled, it looked like he was yelling. He flung Stelta towards where he thought the controls where and moved in towards the center of the room. Stelta hit a chair, and managed to grip it. Her left hand no didn\u2019t respond to her commands. It was like a horror flick she watched before, where the heroin slowly lost control of her emotions and her actions. She strained into the seat and buckled in. Suddenly the engine fired in an unpredictable way, giving one G to her right which sent her sideways. She felt the straps digging into her body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe fumbled in the dark with her right arm, finding herself in Jeb\u2019s seat. She envisioned the room in light, remembering where each switch and button was. She pushed a button, the rotation started slowing down. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on, what else? She moved her arm over and flicked a switch. The lights below turned on, slowly drifting up to the CM. She could just hear Kenski screaming the most hideous of oaths at the Kraken. The Kraken feeds on hate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKenski! The Kraken feeds on hate! Use Love!\u201D cried Stelta with all her spare lung power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe waited. Kenski\u2019s voice was slowly cracking, \u201CI Love Wensie. I love my mother and father. I love Jeb as my best friend.\u201D\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHe rambled on. But it was doing something. His voice was slowly coming through the darkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI love Jeb as my future husband! I love Kenski as one of my closest friends!\u201D Stelta yelled alongside Kenski.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe darkness slowly subsided. Suddenly it disappeared in a flash. The hiss of oxygen leaving filled the room. The Kraken would have its revenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly Jeb floated up through the hatch, looking very tired. The sickness was gone, his eyes weren\u0027t glazed, everything was back to normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb!\u0022 cried Stelta hugging him. He was knocked off his balance and hit the wall softly. They kissed, savoring it for what seemed like hours, Jeb grinned at her, \u0022Thank you, It was Hell.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-30T13:47:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2017 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Alpha 360\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
