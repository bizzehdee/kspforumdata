They are staggering downloads so just because it is the 29th doesn\u0027t mean you can have it right now.

Just remember to perform the first install before July 29th 2016 or you\u0027ll have to buy a licence.\n\nAlso, Microsoft has released the ISO installers. Get the media creation tool at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10). The tool will download the ISO and create a bootable DVD or USB.

If someone decides to download it, please confirm.\n\nE2: After some googling, it seems that the first installation **must** be done through Windows Update in order to associate your Win7/8.1 product key with your Win10 licence. **You will not be able to activate it if you perform the first installation from the ISO**.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T08:33:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainKorhonen**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T08:21:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Correct.

The Windows Update window\u0027s \u0022checking for updates\u0022 progress box should change into \u0022Downloading Windows 10\u0022. You may have to do this multiple times if it doesn\u0027t.
