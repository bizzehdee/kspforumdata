If we abort this flight, it will be a mission failure guys. Before we do that lets just calm down, and take a deep breath and think about\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00E2\u20AC Jeb mashed the large red Ignition button with a gloved fist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe entire rocket roared into life. Several ground crew personnel, taken unaware by the premature launch, leaped to safety from the plume of the exhaust. The pinnacle of Kerbol science, assembled from four of the largest fuel tanks they could find\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 as scrap (A cost cutting measure. Jeb wanted me to remind you.) and the most powerful, most advanced, and most untested rocket engine ever designed by Earl\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s Hardware and Plumbing Company rose off the pad mounting a terrible tower of smoke and fire. What was slowly ascending quickly accelerated to rapidly flinging as it gained altitude. The entire capsule shook like the interior of a paint mixer, thereby proving that Bob\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s suggestion to train at the paint section should not have been dismissed as rapidly as it had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut the small, somewhat foggy window just to Jeb\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s left, he could see the sky begin to darken from a pristine blue to the darkest black of night. Checking his navigational scribbles written next to the bubbly navigational thingy, Jeb tilted the capsule gently over and toward the horizon. Eventually Bill started yelling something at Jeb, but he couldn\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t hear him over the sound from the engine and Bob\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s screaming. Jeb throttled back with the red dangly lever until the engine shut down and then shut Bob\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s visor to muffle his screams. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Yes Bill?\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153I was trying to tell you to shut down the engine, we\u00E2\u20AC\u2122re in orbit.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Oh, I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ll do that right away then.\u00E2\u20AC Jeb immediately shoved the throttle all the way back up and hit the not quite as red as the Ignition button, but still fairly red, engine shutdown button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Why did you do that?\u00E2\u20AC Asked Bill as he began recalculating the orbit\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Because otherwise I wouldn\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t have gotten to hit the other button!\u00E2\u20AC Jeb said though a toothy grin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was an eerie silence as the Kerbals undid the ropes that served as seat belts. Bolts and nuts and duct tape rolls floated around the capsule in the microgravity of orbit. Jeb floated over to the porthole and looked through. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Look at that, no one has ever been able to see Kerbin like this.\u00E2\u20AC Their magnificent blue and green planet rolled lazily below them. Despite going faster than any Kerbal before, the entire craft felt still. Jeb looked around, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153This is boring.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill looked up from his calculations, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Why don\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t you turn on the radio? I need to confirm our telemetry anyway.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob piped up, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Oh I can do that!

Jeb floated over and gave it a swift thwack with his fist. The box promptly buzzed and voices started to crackle through the speaker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122m telling you they\u00E2\u20AC\u2122re dead!

Over.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radio quickly issued a cheer in the background as an annoyed CAPCOM responded, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153What? Oh Darn, you guys cost be 100 bucks!\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153But why would anyone want that much deer?\u00E2\u20AC voiced Bob. The two stares from his fellow capsule-mates told him he should probably stay silent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Anyway,\u00E2\u20AC Bill said while rolling his eyes, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153I want to confirm these numbers I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122m getting from internal guidance.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Uh\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Mission control?\u00E2\u20AC Bill asked with a concerned look on his face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Well\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 nobody but Gregvey thought that you\u00E2\u20AC\u2122d actually get off the pad\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 so\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 we don\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t have any telemetry up yet.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153But what about the tracking station?\u00E2\u20AC Bill shouted to the radio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Yeah\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 we were using that for storage.

Jeb nonchalantly said, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Whelp\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ll just turn off the radio for you,\u0027 and he gently pressed a small unmarked red button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmediately the sound of a claxon filled the small confines of the cabin and the whole craft began to spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153What going on?\u00E2\u20AC Bob cried out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153What did you do now?\u00E2\u20AC Bill gripped his brother and shook him violently and the craft continued to spin faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153I don\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t know!

The whole space capsule was spinning around its axis, the three of them pinned up against the wall by the light forces at work. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Well that\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s better\u00E2\u20AC Bob smiled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill quickly scanned the cardboard console and found one gage flashing red.

Bill let go of Jeb to close Bobs visor once more, but rather than returning to pummeling Jeb, he floated dejectedly in the capsule, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153You\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ve killed us all.

The radio had once more fizzled out of a working condition and Bill had insisted that Jeb go nowhere near the switch panel anymore. Jeb was bored out of his skull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Ugh! How much longer!

He had often wondered why this was but none of the engineers could give him a straight answer. The capsule thudded and the decoupler let go, letting the empty fuel tanks float away. The capsule slowly tumbled in the vacuum of space. Jeb signaled to him for close his visor and keep pointing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill closed his visor letting the sound of his own breath take over. Halfheartedly, he continued pointing in the general direction of retro.

Cardboard rolls and all the loose debris pelted Jeb as he dangled from his improvised tether. Although Bill could not hear him, he could clearly see Jeb shouting excitedly as a child would on a rollercoaster. Soon, the capsule was once again still as it too was as void as space. Jeb pulled himself back to them and began talking but Bill could not hear him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy his pointing at the console, Bill relized he wanted to know if his mad scheme had worked. Bill looked and checked his calculations. As he completed his sums, his eyes went wide. Jeb had done it! Periapsis of 50 km! They were going to reenter!

He had often wondered why this was but none of the engineers could give him a straight answer. The capsule thudded and the decoupler let go, letting the empty fuel tanks float away. The capsule slowly tumbled in the vacuum of space. Jeb signaled to him for close his visor and keep pointing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill closed his visor letting the sound of his own breath take over.
