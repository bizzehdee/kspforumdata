I also wanted it to be forgiving, so to maintain the current performance i would have to lower both the ISP and thrust, which would increase the burn times, which could be problematic for some orbital insertion maneuvers.  If you want to play around with the numbers, that\u0027s perfectly fine.\n\nAs for the SAW, did the original mass values cause the station to explode on touching?  Also, where is the approximate center-of-mass in relation to the SAWs?  The SAW is scaled with the 2.5m ISS station modules, so I can\u0027t really scale them down without scaling down the rest of truss segment and docking ports.  The ISS SAWs are exceptionally large, especially when compared to Skylab\u0027s and Salyut/Mir arrays.

I had a read of your description and photos and decided to download your mod. When It had finished downloading I clicked on the zip folder and then the file appeared. I then put the zip folder into the bin and deleted it. Then I opened KSP\\_osx and opened gamedata. I then put your mod folder ( without the zip code folder.) Into the gamedata. I then open KSP and none of your parts are there.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think this is classed as troubleshooting because I get very upset when I download a mod and it does not work. Now that I am on the KSP forums I can ask question about how to do things in KSP. The same thing happens with Raster Prop Monitor. I download the mod and a lot more buttons are there but the little television screen or monitors are not there. I keep thinking it is something to do with downloading it or if there is a bug. Or maybe the file did not completely load. I don\u0027t know but I would like to ask you if you have any tips on downloading your mod for KSP 1.0.5.

You said that you un-zipped the download and then placed the resultant folder into your \u0022KSP\\_osx/GameData\u0022 folder, if I\u0027m understanding you correctly.  If that is the case then after you un-zipped the download you ended up with a folder entitled \u0022ShadowWorks\\_Stockalike\\_SLS\\_1\\_3\\_1\u0022, and that is the folder that you placed in your \u0022KSP\\_osx/GameData\u0022 folder, which is why the parts aren\u0027t showing up correctly.  I\u0027ll list the steps to properly install the mod.\n\n1. Un-zip the downloaded file, if OS X did not automatically do so.\n2. Open the resultant folder \u0022ShadowWorks\\_Stockalike\\_SLS\\_1\\_3\\_1\u0022.  There will be three folders (\u0022AlternateSLSWhiteTextues\u0022, \u0022GameData\u0022, \u0022Ships\u0022) and three \u0022.txt\u0022 files (\u0022Intallation.txt\u0022, \u0022PartsList.txt\u0022, and \u0022Readme \u0026 License.txt\u0022).\n3. Open the \u0022ShadowWorks\\_Stockalike\\_SLS\\_1\\_3\\_1/GameData\u0022 folder and place the \u0022ShadowWorks\u0022 folder into your \u0022KSP\\_osx/GameData\u0022 folder.  This is the basic installation of the parts.\n4. To get the craft files open the \u0022ShadowWorks\\_Stockalike\\_SLS\\_1\\_3\\_1/Ships/VAB\u0022 folder all of those .craft files can be placed either in your save\u0027s \u0022Ships/VAB\u0022 folder, or the master \u0022KSP\\_osx/Ships/VAB\u0022 folder if you so wish.  I will note that the Setesh craft files, OrionCM LAS.craft, ET and SRBs.craft, Orion SM.craft, and SLS Core.craft may be best used as sub-assemblies\n\nThe \u0022AlternateSLSWhiteTextures\u0022 folder contains the SLS black and white tank textures if you prefer those over the now default orange, you only need to replace the textures in their regular locations with those alternate textures.  I hope that helps get you up and running, but if you have any other troubles I\u0027ll do what I can to help."},{"CreatedByName":"Dr.K Kerbal","CreatedById":156864,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T00:12:10Z","Content":"OMG THANK YOU SOOOOOOOOO MUCH! ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif \u0022:kiss:\u0022)![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)"}]}
