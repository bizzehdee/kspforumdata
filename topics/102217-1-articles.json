Larger the better. Ill turn this into a showcase thread as soon as I find a pic.\n\nI\u0027m just looking for ideas people have come up with for transporting through thr atmosphere heavy loads. Our gaming group has a need for one, so craft files would be appreciated.\n\nHere is what I made on the gaming server before .90:\n\nCargo Airlifter III\n\n![fK8PKE2.png](http://i.imgur.com/fK8PKE2.png)\n\nI used it to transport anything I could winch to it. Winched above is the UtilityCat truck I designed. Very useful truck. The airlifter was even more so. I could carry a large tonnage with it winched in, which I used to transport various bases, and modules, and Karbonite mining rigs with. Beautiful and capable drone cargo plane, but ugly as all get out. I know I can do better. I just need ideas to uh... borrow.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T23:08:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by inigma**"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T21:12:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ![tmZqoj2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tmZqoj2.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![bAPazMx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bAPazMx.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![wek9zVy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wek9zVy.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nNot sure I have the craft files for these, but maybe they\u0027ll give ya some ideas!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T21:15:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T22:25:45Z","Content":"For all the SSTO needs:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

All they need is an airstrip to land on and a KAS winch inside of their bellies.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T22:59:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"}]}
