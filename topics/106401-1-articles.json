After this issue appeared I removed all of my mods installed, deleted the Squad and KSP\\_Data folder for Steam to re-acquire them, and the issue consists.\n\nI guess I\u0027ll have to completely delete my KSP folder and re-install from scratch, but I\u0027m really afraid of re-adding mods. I don\u0027t know which mod caused the issue. \n\nMods used when I noticed the issue:\n\n-Kerbal Construction Time\n\n-Final Frontier\n\n-Waypoint Manager\n\n-Kerbal Alarm Clock\n\n-Ubra Life Support mod\n\n-Kerbal Joint Reinforcment\n\n-Navball Docking Alignment Indicator\n\n-Crowd Sourced Science Logs\n\n-Landing Height\n\nNone of these mods should make any changes to this texture. If anyone knows where the data for this texture is located, please let me know. I really don\u0027t know what to do.\n\n![sGaKwhE.png](http://i.imgur.com/sGaKwhE.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Pingonaut","CreatedById":15723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T06:49:03Z","Content":"Anyone?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tahib","CreatedById":111243,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:49:16Z","Content":"try ksp 1.0.2, seems like stock texture got changed by something"},{"CreatedByName":"Pingonaut","CreatedById":15723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T02:05:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E try ksp 1.0.2, seems like stock texture got changed by something\n\nI had this issue in .90, though.
