It\u0027s built with a Drill-o-matic miner and an ISRU Converter. My mission was to try and land on all of the major islands on Laythe, and use the Drill-o-matic and ISRU to produce more fuel between each island jump. I managed to jump 3 islands and place down flags with no problem, but the 4th time now when im trying to take off, the plane loses controll a few seconds after take off, and it seems like it wants to point the right wing downwards, which forces me to my death due to the heavy plane have low manouvrability. It is almost like someone is holding down the \u0022E\u0022 button so that it tries to roll right after take off, and holding the opposite \u0022Q\u0022 counteracts it slightly, but its quickly overpowered. The wings are not trimmed in any way, and using alt-x to reset trim does nothing. However, when i go to the debug menu and hack gravity, this problem dissapears suddenly, and it no longer forces me to the ground. But as soon as i turn gravity back on, the plane loses control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis only happens with this particular plane thats stuck on Laythe, spaceplanes on Kerbin flies just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously i have tried to verify the game integrity on steam with no problems here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running the game pretty unmodded, at least nothing that should affect this situation. The plane itself has no modded parts except for the crew carrying a couple of KIS/KAS items.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere you can see a picture i took earlier of the plane in all its working glory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495312531\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495312531\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope for some suggestions on what i could try and why this is happening \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
