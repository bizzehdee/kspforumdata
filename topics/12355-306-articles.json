Rockets should have a start TWR of 1.30 and have a TWR of about 2.0 by the time it gets to 20km. The TWR should not exceed 7.5 at any time lest you risk breaking something. So you need to set your thrusts to max TWR (7.5 at empty tank weight) and then load up as much fuel as you can until TWR is at 1.3 for lift-off. That the first stage, other stages you can get by on less starting TWR but you do need to get moving once you get into space, I personally like TWR \u0026gt; 1.0 climbing to 7.0 for upper stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T16:16:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bothersome\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bothersome\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYet when MJ 308 is running on \u0022use stock SAS\u0022 it\u0027s some kind of terrible.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen \u0022use stock SAS\u0022 MJ does not do anything about attitude.

It tells the stock SAS to \u0022go that way\u0022 and nothing more. The stock SAS is a bit better inside the atmo but you can tune MJ to do as well.\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with MJ in atmo is that Tf gets too low and the controls become over reactive. I need a function that increase the lower limit of Tf when dynamic pressure increase. Not exactly hard to code but hard to tune.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I\u0027ve discovered this as well. Although for me, it\u0027s fairly straightforward: When flying a spaceplane in the atmosphere, I can just select \u0027Use Stock SAS\u0027 and the plane flies beautifully. Then when I get out into the vacuum of space, I unclick that and use either \u0027Tf auto \u003Cstrong\u003Etunning\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027 (note the bold text, that\u0027s a typo that\u0027s STILL in MechJeb ever since you introduced the auto-\u003Cstrong\u003Etuning \u003C/strong\u003Eoption, btw.

Here is my most complicated rocket so far that MJ can put into orbit for me. I\u0027m using RO (FAR, RSS, DRE, etc). The payload is a 15 ton module from Station Science. The rocket started out very spegetti like, wanting to wobble even sitting on the launch clamps. After securing the rocket more, and adding some fins at the top to help push the nose into the desired location, MJ had no more problems with getting it to orbit. The rocket is a bit under powered below 45km and it starts sliding in the wind a bit.
