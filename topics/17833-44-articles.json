The important bit is that the parts are missing and the flight PartModule has changed name. The flight engineer should also use a KSPAddon rather than a PartModule and the \u0022dummy\u0022 FlightEngineer could easily be made to be the only way to make it visible (e.g. it would only add the toolbar buttons if there is a part with the module on the ship). There is also a nasty 0.24 bug that messes things up when a saved part has a different set of PartModules to the currently installed state, so, while that will probably be fixed in a 0.24.1 patch, it is another reason to avoid changing the PartModules in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-24T14:31:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2014 02:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Padishar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T16:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cybutek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cybutek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MADTJ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MADTJ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t like the new KER 1.0. too many button and big button blocked my toolbar on top left of screen. back to old 0.6.2.7.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to move it onto the stock toolbar soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcellent.

It almost seems like you are supposed to install both the 6.2.x mod and then the modified dlls. But at the same time it seemed odd to install a mod then replace both of it\u0027s only dlls. So I was considerable confused. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe also change the names to make more sense instead of just kerdlls maybe kerdlls_patch_0627 or something to give people a clue that it is to only be applied to the 0.6.2.7 KER. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe even put it under another heading instead of directly below the 0.6.2.8 link which also made me think it was to be applied to the the 0.6.2.8 release. I appreciate the work and just wanted to make some suggestions to make the link page more clear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DasValdez","CreatedById":112650,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T19:33:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Creat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Creat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have another small suggestion: When you toggle the engineering window in the VAB from extended/normal to \u0027Compact\u0027 mode, could you keep it aligned to the right if it\u0027s close to the right window border? This would allow placing the window to the right and switching between normal and compact mode without dragging it around every time. This is especially useful since the left border isn\u0027t fixed, as the width depends on the open tab. Action groups and Crew are significantly wider than the part selection, which is why I would prefer the window on the right side if I could still toggle the compact mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeh, this is one of my only annoyances with KER.... I second this. Even as a quick/easier fix, it would be nice if the \u0022Compact\u0022 button was the first button in the top window button list... so when you clicked it, the \u0022compact\u0022 button would stay under the mouse, not be pushed out to the right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DasValdez","CreatedById":112650,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T20:03:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like you have a lot going on with the 1.0 migration, but I wanted to toss in a feature idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStage/Chute landing m/s estimation displayed in the VAB\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be useful for determining whether or not you have enough chutes on your lander/booster stage to arrive alive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA single new column could be added to the KER window stage table, labelled Parachute Estimate, displaying the expected m/s of each stage with all chutes attached to that stage deployed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could use the various planetary body atmo stats (different density/pressure on Duna, Laythe, etc) using the selector buttons at the bottom of the window... much like the ISP calculation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would need to assume that all stage fuel tanks were dry, or alternatively show wet/dry separated by a /. Dry is useful for Kerbin based boosters that are intended for recovery/refit, and wet (full) would be useful for landers that anticipate taking off again. Of course, your tanks wouldn\u0027t be perfectly full after your deorbit or landing retrofire burns... hence the \u0022estimate\u0022 label. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also need to assume you\u0027re landing at \u0022sea\u0022 level... landings at higher altitudes would have less efficient chute performance due to lower atmo density. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor planets with no atmo, it could just display \u0022-\u0022 or \u0022n/a\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for all the work on KER!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
