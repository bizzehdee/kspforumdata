I appreciate the hard work and dedication of IG when\u00A0some of the player base (myself included) \u00A0went from not just critical, but skeptical that we would even see the promised features. The science update proved that skepticism wrong, and I want to sincerely thank the IG team for their persistence. I say this because while part of this post may sound negative, it\u2019s coming from someone who\u2019s genuinely a fan of the game, wants the game to succeed, and appreciates the massive step forward this last update was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, after playing it long enough where I feel I can give a solid opinion, I must say For Science! still hasn\u2019t reached the tipping point of being fun to play for fun\u2019s sake yet. As a tester, and an EA player seeing the game grow, yes. But KSP1 remains more fun at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really would like to share my feedback on the game, but it\u2019s hard to do with the specifics of future features still largely unknown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance, how much are resources going to affect the early, mid, and late game restrictions of exploration mode, if at all? There\u2019s a lot of feedback I can give here, but without details on the roadmap beyond just the highest level concepts, most of that feedback is meaningless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP1 had a lot of janky complexity. I loved it dearly but career mode was hodgepodged together for sure. KSP2 (seemingly so far) didn\u2019t so much streamline the complexity as outright remove it. It\u2019s rather simple to get to anywhere in the system without unlocking any tech nodes as there\u2019s no restrictions on size, part count, or funds/resources. (I personally prefer no funds and the limiting factor to be resources, as I believe to be the plan.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow I feel those restrictions could be added in an engaging game play loop is something I\u2019d love to talk about, but currently it\u2019s unclear if any such limitations are even being considered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new and zombie bugs did also sadly affect my gameplay, both with the resurgence of the orbital decay and the loss of orbital lines. Those I see have been clearly communicated to the devs and it is clear they are a priority. I would personally, at this point in development with a \u201Cgame\u201D now in the sandbox game, rather they focus on bugs for a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy larger point with this thought though is that bugs can be clearly communicated, and then addressed. Larger framework decisions and feedback much less so without knowing exactly the plan for interstellar, colonies, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. The devs have clearly asked for feedback, and I\u2019m happy to provide it. I just feel it\u2019s hard to give good, actionable or even considerable feedback with so many unknowns for the player community.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHad KSP2 launched in this state into EA I feel there would\u2019ve been much less criticism. The game, while buggy and feature lacking, has clear potential, details of quality in the surfaces of the planet, audio design and other areas. Most EA games are very clear about the development process, and I fully understand why they went so quiet with the harsh criticism they were receiving.\u00A0They knew the only way to win back trust was to deliver, and while there\u2019s still a ways to go for me personally they delivered a great update that won my trust. Now that we have that trust, I feel like it is the time to open up more about the specifics, and then recieve, consider, and implement as they see best fit player feedback. This would include the plans changing slightly as the game progresses and in response to the feedback, and trusting the community to be understanding of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, I don\u2019t want to be too negative. My pessimistic outlook was solidly proven wrong, I\u2019m excited and passionate about KSP and am way happier now having my pessimism be proven wrong and having a fun KSP2. I just please ask that now that trust has been rebuilt some thought is put into how much of the specifics of the coming features can be shared with the community so we can give quality feedback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-28T14:01:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2023 02:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 28\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by moeggz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EImproperly posted early\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-28T05:34:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224353024\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222219\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221703740816\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107035\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022moeggz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, moeggz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst off, I would like to say that For Science! has made the game massively more playable, fun, and performant.

Players want to play the game early, get it cheap, and have their specific concerns heard and incorporated into the game. Developers and publishers want word-of-mouth, aggregate data, to find edge cases triggered by specific hardware they may not be testing for, community building, and a constant revenue stream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this case, EA has given IG and PD all of this. For example, the bugfix and performance updates up to and including 0.1.5 failed to produce a sustained increase in player count or turn around sentiment. This tells them that even though bugs and performance were clearly responsible for bad word-of-mouth, poor sentiment, and poor review scores, that clearly wasn\u0027t what was stopping players from playing. Then when 0.2.0 landed and did produce a sustained bump, that told them that even a pretty simple gameplay loop is enough to keep and retain players, and that they\u0027re on the right track. The black-dotted-cloud bug was an example of something triggered by specific hardware that QA might not catch. The noise about specific bugs gives valuable info on what\u0027s bothering people the most. The clamor about pixelated fonts and accessibility will likely get them to shift that. And so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to feedback specifically on science, for sure it\u0027s useful. Just tell them what you think and why. They know what their plans are and they\u0027ll be able to filter and adjust what you\u0027re saying to that. Your feedback would be much less valuable if it was colored by your expectations of future features, since those expectations will likely only have a fairly tenuous relationship with what\u0027s actually coming down the turnpike, for all kinds of reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moeggz","CreatedById":107035,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-28T16:25:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/225622-periple/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022225622\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/225622-periple/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Periple\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe incongruence between what players expect to get out of EA and what devs expect to get out is I think the central point Im \u00A0trying to make.

Having a better sense of the role kerbals might play down the road helps inform feedback on balance between different experiments and playstyles.

It doesn\u2019t need to be every week, maybe every 2 weeks digging into a bit more detail on how colonies will work, what the thinking is, how they will relate to expanding the science system, etc. We have been getting a bit of that but its been a bit scattershot and unstructured.

For instance much of the feedback on the science update has been about the lack of constraints on part cost, which might be solved down the road by resources but we have no clear idea how. \u00A0Will resources even matter at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or just at colonies? Having a broad idea how this will be tackled helps focus the discussion on the released content and probably helps give a bit of clarity on tech tree balance as well (like what is the role of solid boosters and why are they on the main-line tech path rather than on their own branch?) Having a better sense of the role kerbals might play down the road helps inform feedback on balance between different experiments and playstyles. Certainly having a clearer picture of how future features will treat time as a factor has deep implications for how experiments could and should work and how progress down the tech tree relates to launch windows and overall exploration pacing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example Im really enjoying the Factorio Friday Facts as Wube leads up to 2.0. Each week they put together a bit of a dive on an upcoming feature, some small, some large. Many have been well received and others have been controversial and sparked debate among fans. These are long-time experienced players and content creators with the background and intuition to extrapolate the implications of a given change. Those discussions then spurred follow-up clarifications by the devs and Im sure a bit of recalculation here and there.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI kind of agree that previous to 0.2 KSP may have been in too rocky a state for that kind of generous approach to be received well but it really does feel like we\u2019ve turned a corner. (I also agree that if IG had kept their powder dry and released what we have now this process might have gone much more smoothly, but water under the bridge.) But given that things are performing much better with many fewer showstopper bugs and something close to feature parity with KSP1 Id love to see that more transparent, open and excited-to-share approach return. It doesn\u2019t need to be every week, maybe every 2 weeks digging into a bit more detail on how colonies will work, what the thinking is, how they will relate to expanding the science system, etc. We have been getting a bit of that but its been a bit scattershot and unstructured. We only got deep dives on science after it had been locked in without any real way to weigh in before we had our hands on it. Despite the risks I think gathering feedback earlier in the process might be informative and give players a greater sense of buy-in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI support this and agree with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/105624-pthigrivi/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105624\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pthigrivi\u003C/a\u003E.

I don\u0027t always agree with him though when it comes to gameplay. I think efficiency and simplicity are really important but I\u0027ll return again and again to the chess vs checkers example. What makes good gameplay is not absolute simplicity, but maximizing the ratio between input rule complexity and total output creative gamespace. Sometimes a very large investment in dev work results in a very small increase in creative gameplay. Sometimes a modest investment in dev work results in a HUGE increase in creative gameplay. Every smart developer is playing these odds. I happen to think there were some decisions in KSP1 like instant scanning on polar orbit and not incorporating biome maps that were huge missed opportunities, and across the board when you talk to folks who used SCANsat the verdict is pretty unanimous that the mod did it better. Thats because it hit that sweet spot leveraging a bit more complexity in design to capture a much more robust gameplay experience. I think avoiding LoS, real-time mapping, time-based mechanics, and life support are similar kinds of missed opportunities where a modest investment in development time could leverage a much more dynamic set of design, planning, and navigation puzzles for the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-29T03:13:23Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2023 03:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 29\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moeggz","CreatedById":107035,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-30T19:13:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224353379\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222219\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221703819503\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/28/2023 at 8:11 PM, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think avoiding LoS, real-time mapping, time-based mechanics, and life support are similar kinds of missed opportunities where a modest investment in development time could leverage a much more dynamic set of design, planning, and navigation puzzles for the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where I\u2019m at too.
