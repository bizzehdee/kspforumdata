Since you already have a fighter, I think it will either be Ground-Attack or Tactical/Strategic Bomber.

Do you really think that Jeb would go along with an idea to construct such a small and slow vehicle? And with no boosters? ridiculous. I will say this about to give you guys some help since you have earned some favor with the UKSAF by being finalists. Is will not be a small aircraft. It will instead be a large commercial jet sized aircraft. That is all I will say for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBig plane? Bomber. Strategic.
