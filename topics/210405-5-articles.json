Pthigrivi brought up productivity as an impact of life support, and I think that\u0027s a great idea.

Kerbals who have been given proper life support for the entirety of their journey, on the other hand, could give bonuses in these fields, making science collection and colony building much more efficient. This encourages players to put in the work and planning ahead of time, but still allows them plenty of leeway if they underestimate what they need, or even overlook it altogether. Personally I wouldn\u0027t even support the hibernation idea, except possibly on hard difficulty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of the actual form the life support system would take, I like the idea of players striving towards a perfect closed loop system, but realistically settling on something that can maintain full life support for a long time without needing huge stores of some life support resource. These systems could also require a significant amount of power, encouraging the need for things like nuclear reactors on long-term missions, as electricity in KSP1 is mostly just needed during actual maneuvers rather than passively during long periods on the float. Personally I think most life support should be self-contained in crew modules, rather than requiring external parts. Crew modules could have various levels of life support that can be toggled on the fly, in case a craft needs to conserve power or has a greater life support capacity than is necessary for the mission. Crew capsules on their own would provide sufficient life support for missions within Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, while interplanetary missions and beyond may require larger or additional crew modules. Some modules, such as the centrifuge we\u0027ve seen in older KSP2 videos, could be significantly more efficient, to encourage their use for long-term and interstellar missions. This could also potentially lend itself well to hydroponics modules and the like. I feel like there aren\u0027t many reasons to need lots of crew space in KSP1, and I\u0027d love to see more benefit for large craft with more than just a single crew capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-04T22:26:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224195422\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210405\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221667600151\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr if you truly think that death is better than hibernation under all contexts, then why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) it makes the game more challenging and adds a touch of drama\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) nothing and no one is really dying as it is just a game\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224195422\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210405\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221667600151\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with this, and I don\u2019t think there is a single best way to do anything; it always depends on the context.

The reality is that it\u0027s almost impossible to live in space indefinitely, but we don\u0027t want to have to acknowledge that because this is a video game and we want to put boots on the surface of a planet orbiting another star. So something has to give, and that \u0022something\u0022 is how realistic and complicated the life support system is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for mortality or tourist or stasis or what have you, let\u0027s not focus on that right yet.

We\u0027ll probably need to also have a way to create that resource with things we can find on most if not all planets, and for sure in every solar system.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd maybe a way to recycle it, so that we can have mostly-closed-cycle life support which will be absolutely essential for journeys\u00A0 as long as that needed to travel to another solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the main thing that it will have to do is REWARD you for doing the life support right, it can\u0027t ONLY give you game overs.

Draws don\u0027t count towards wins OR losses, and the human mind doesn\u0027t get any satisfaction from \u0022just surviving\u0022 something usually, unless that mind has already been abused.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have to \u0022win\u0022 the game, you can\u0027t just \u0022draw\u0022 your way to victory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd because literally every time I use the \u0022reward me instead of just punishing me\u0022 argument, someone says it, I\u0027m going to say it right here:\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo, you can\u0027t use the same argument against orbital mechanics.
