It seems very unstable, being hard to control as it gets into less atmosphere the higher it gets. I did a complete 180 turn and went back to the drawing board at that point lol. For some reason it as well rotates wierd(and so did my single capsule rocket), and I have to constantly use the e and q keys to keep it from rotating. I looked through tutorials and didn\u0027t see much explaining rocket design and how to stop such problems so I thought I would ask here. This may be a bit much rocket power/fuel just to get it into orbit around Kerbin, but I wanted to make sure lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few key questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does the center of gravity in the space center effect my rocket design? It is really low(on the floor) and not centered and I am not sure why. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does the center of mass effect it? It is centered on the fuel tanks a bit lower than the station core which I think seems alright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does the center of thrust effect it? It is centered on the center engine(2-stage rocket design).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere is it best to put the ASAS module(if I need one this will just go into orbit and stay)? I am still not sure the difference between ASAS and SAS or when they are needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure about the fuel lines or if they benefit at all here, but I watched some youtube videos where the guy put them between these tanks on a similar rocket design for a heavy load. Are they beneficial here at all to do what I did?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA picture of my current design:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9m2zYwF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229m2zYwF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any information!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-13T02:16:33Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2013 02:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MaGicBush\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dangerous_Beans","CreatedById":78059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T01:33:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethere is a tutorial on sas here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/41941-New-SAS-functionality-and-You\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/41941-New-SAS-functionality-and-You\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egenerally you want them around the centre of mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou want the centre of mass and the centre of thrust aligned on the long axis of the craft. if either are significantly off then the engines will produce a rotational force around the centre of mass, and it will spin out of control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe benefit of the fuel lines is you can make the engine in the centre stage drain from the outer stage tanks, so you can use all the engines from the start, and when you dump the boosters you still have a full tank in the centre. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe spinning seems to come from struts not being exactly symmetrical. put a reaction wheel on the top of each booster if it is too bad, or tail fins, otherwise it doesn\u0027t matter too much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaGicBush","CreatedById":71139,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T02:00:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dangerous_Beans\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dangerous_Beans\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethere is a tutorial on sas here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/41941-New-SAS-functionality-and-You\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/41941-New-SAS-functionality-and-You\u003C/a\u003E!\u003Cp\u003Egenerally you want them around the centre of mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou want the centre of mass and the centre of thrust aligned on the long axis of the craft. if either are significantly off then the engines will produce a rotational force around the centre of mass, and it will spin out of control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe benefit of the fuel lines is you can make the engine in the centre stage drain from the outer stage tanks, so you can use all the engines from the start, and when you dump the boosters you still have a full tank in the centre. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe spinning seems to come from struts not being exactly symmetrical. put a reaction wheel on the top of each booster if it is too bad, or tail fins, otherwise it doesn\u0027t matter too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright thanks, I got my station into orbit finally at 199AP and 196PE with plenty of fuel to spare on the middle engine!
