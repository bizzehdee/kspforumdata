You want your final return stage as small and light as possible, especially for your first try you should work around the possible minimum - if you feel you require Mainsails you are propably trying to bring back too much stuff, so check if you cannot make it lighter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the landing leg design you can always work around with octagonal struts and radial decouplers - attach the radial decoupler where your legs are now, and connect down from there with struts and finally attach the legs to the struts. You can get as far down as you want and can also decopule the legs at launch so you don\u0027t have to carry the extra mass. As a side note, additionally to tweaking the legs make sure that your ladders reach all the way to the bottom, otherwise your EVA Kerbals will not get back into the lander...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s really all there is to tell until we see some images to give more specific advice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-04T12:25:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2015 12:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketPropelledGiraffe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T16:29:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few things to bear in mind about an Eve return lander:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, it\u0027s going to be big.\u00A0 Really big, much bigger than any other lander you\u0027re used to.\u00A0 So you\u0027re going to run into structural problems that you\u0027re not used to encountering.\u00A0 For example, if you have radial tanks attached to your central stack (which seems likely, since you need to \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E pack enough dV to get back to orbit, \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E be squat enough that you don\u0027t tip over on landing), it\u0027s pretty easy for them to actually snap off when you land, causing your ship to tumble apart like a pile of jackstraws.\u00A0 This can happen even if you land at only 4-5 m/s.\u00A0 Or let\u0027s say you\u0027ve got a Mammoth under you and you come down and land on that (no legs), since it has a nice high impact tolerance-- if you\u0027re not landing on a perfectly flat surface, your ship could actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eslide off the engine\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E and snap it off sideways.\u00A0 So be prepared to put more struts on your craft than you\u0027re used to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParachutes are your friend.\u00A0 They work really, really well on Eve, and you don\u0027t need to mess with drogues.\u00A0 However, if you\u0027ve got an enormous massive lander and it\u0027s falling fast and you pop the chutes all at once, the gee-forces have the potential to snap off bits of your ship, depending on how you have your design arranged.\u00A0 You can work around this by tweaking your chutes so that they activate at slightly different heights above ground level, so they don\u0027t all go off at once.\u00A0 (I like to attach my chutes to radial decouplers, so that I can pop \u0027em off after landing-- no point in lugging all that parachute mass back into orbit.\u00A0 You can fit three of the radial chutes onto a single radial decoupler, if you mount \u0027em sideways.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a ship that\u0027s prone to self-disassembly on touchdown, consider using a brief burst of retro-thrust to slow just before impact.\u00A0 A ship that falls apart when it hits ground at 5 m/s may do just fine at 3 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe aware that the atmosphere on Eve is a real killer, the atmosphere losses on takeoff are \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Those first 10 km of altitude will eat up a stupidly large amount of your dV.\u00A0 So if you have a ship that\u0027s borderline in terms of being able to get back to orbit, consider landing somewhere at higher elevation, rather than at sea level.\u00A0 Taking off from 5000m instead of 0m makes a big difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that solar panels have much reduced output from Eve\u0027s surface; the atmosphere blocks a lot of sunlight. So make sure that you have enough electrical supply and/or storage.\u00A0 If you\u0027re planning a mining operation (which needs lots of electrical power), fuel cells can come in really handy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve isn\u0027t especially mountainous, but it\u0027s quite hilly and there\u0027s a high likelihood that you\u0027ll come down on a mild slope.\u00A0 Perfectly flat landing sites are scarce, and Eve\u0027s high gravity makes even a mild slope a significantly bigger deal than it would be on Kerbin.\u00A0 So be sure that you design your craft so that it can handle landing on a bit of a slope.\u00A0 Tipping over is one concern, of course, but another big one has to do with having big huge landers:\u00A0 if you land on a slope, the chance of encountering structural problems (such as sliding sideways off your engines and snapping them) gets bigger.\u00A0 Bear in mind that the uphill side of your ship will hit the ground slightly before the downhill side, and will therefore take the brunt of the landing shock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(Apropos of this, my most comical Eve mission failure:\u00A0 I designed a ship that used the long skinny girders as landing gear, since they have a really high impact tolerance.\u00A0 Needed to put two girders end-to-end so they\u0027d be long enough to reach the ground past my Mammoths.\u00A0 There were a dozen of these girder-legs around the rim of my lander, rotated slightly outward so that it had a \u0022splayed\u0022 stance.\u00A0 So I landed on a mild slope, touched down without a problem, settled down onto the slope.\u00A0 Thought I was home free.\u00A0 Then the weight of the ship came down on the downhill leg, bending it at the knee joint between the two girders.\u00A0 It slowly bent... and bent... until the \u0022foot\u0022 popped loose and the leg snapped straight and lifted the foot off the ground.\u00A0 Which put the weight of the ship on the next legs, which did the same thing, bend, bend, pop.\u00A0 Repeat this process, in agonizingly slow but gradually accelerating motion.\u00A0 Pretty soon the entire ship is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Escuttling\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E downhill like some sort of deranged three-hundred-ton space crab.
