If you have fuel tanks above the docking port, they will be drained first. Imagine the look on my face when I \u0027decoupled\u0027, saw the booster stage drift away slowly and then realized I had 0 fuel in my spacecraft left. Needless to say this craft landed on RCS thrusters without accomplishing its mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. On the next flight, I \u0027cleverly\u0027 disabled cross feed manually to preserve my fuel before detaching. However, my craft had radial rocket engines attached to the docking port. Guess what; with cross feed disabled they won\u0027t get fuel. And after detaching there is no way to re-enable cross feed (without docking again, presumably). The flight after that I carefully re-enabled cross feed after shutting down the engines before undocking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
