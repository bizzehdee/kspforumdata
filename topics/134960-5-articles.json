Squad has really gone beyond the call of duty on this update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s got so many little nice touches in it that really enhance the game, I am amazed how much better the game is for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from the massive performance boost for multi part ships, parts have more tweakable options, landing gear has been updated and now can ALL STEER and ALL HAVE LIGHTS.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can tweak engine pitch yaw roll settings.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn cockpit overlay was something I scoffed at when it was revealed but I immediately retract that statement now because of what I THINK they will be doing with this feature in the future. To be able to see your crew INSIDE the crew pods is something I\u0027ve been asking for since the beginning and now we have the seeds of that feature beginning to be implemented.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew textures for ground, water etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still get lag when looking at Kerbin during launches etc BUT overall I\u0027m very impressed. Now I can\u0027t wait to see what they do next (fingers crossed for audio/visual overhaul).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T03:10:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease discuss 1.1 performance \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/135248-11-performance/\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E in the pre-release branch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
