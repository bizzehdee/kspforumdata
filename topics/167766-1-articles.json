Ultimately it just boils down to me thinking that X will work with Y, while it actually works with Z and not realizing X requires W to work. All I\u0027m asking for is some kind of chart/guide depicting what parts you need for both transmitting and recieving power, and for different wavelengths; perhaps even adding additional info as to which wavelength is better for atmosphere vs vaccum etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
