Making a mode with more potential complexity and orienting it also to help modders make advanced features for it could make a very nice game mode. If they do a nice basis and make it easier for modders to both add their items and make them less likely to conflict through proper design and some basic in game organizational features they could make a simpel streamlined and basically endlessly adaptable world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recomend alot of pull down menues and the ability to load everything in game. And not have it all load on start of the game so you can load it to memory as you play or need it. In fact I would recommend that to start with. why does it all load at the start menu instead of loading as you use it somehow. There must be a million ways to organize the ram use besides dumping it all in immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T07:49:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 07:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T08:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh there\u0027s plenty of \u0022hard mode\u0022 mods already.
