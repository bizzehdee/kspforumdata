It\u0027s fun for the most part. I\u0027ve got three characters; my main, max level Federation captain (Human) who has a ridiculous number of ships that I barely know what to do with. Then I have a Gorn in the Klingon Empire, not at a particularly high level, and a Romulan who is in the same position as the Gorn, level-wise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip combat is pretty cool (and is the main allure), but the ground combat is rather poor. The missions are all practically identical, too; warp in, blow up some enemy ships, beam down, kill some people, reach your objective, beam up, blow up enemy ships, victory. Rinse and repeat. I just gave up on the storyline missions, instead focusing on PvE games that are generally more interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got 8 ships and 1 shuttle, but these two are my most loved:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUSS \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHalcyon\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E - Tier 2 Science vessel\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery well equipped considering its diminutive size.
