The only other things I\u0027ve used action groups for are for spaceplanes and toggling a bunch of jets, but that\u0027s a bit of an edge-case and it could be argued that limiting that is just arbitrary. Besides, once you have that many jets, you\u0027ve already upgraded your hangar to have less part limitations, which gives you action groups, so it\u0027s not even a problem..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, what\u0027s preventing you from just using the Abort action group for solar panels? That way you don\u0027t even need to unlock the custom ones, which is the problem with limiting controls; there\u0027s a different workaround, but that workaround probably isn\u0027t fun and you\u0027d probably want to use the action group anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only that but action group limiting/unlocking is shoddily implemented as others have mentioned; if you just import a craft from a Sandbox save then you can already use action groups.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough, a similar argument could be made for the pilot controls, prograde and retrograde holding are mostly quality-of-life controls (at least, they would be, if they worked well), so that may be the kind of thing SQUAD wants in their game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
