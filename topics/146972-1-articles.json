So for such missions I use a large wing jet plane with an additional rocket engine mounted. I climb up to 10-12 km and proceed to the target at that altitude using jet. That saves me a lot of fuel. Usually it takes about 1-1.5 game hours to get there, so 4x warp is a thing to use. At about 40 km to waypoint I enable the rocket engine and it lets me to get to 20\u002B km altitude but it eats its fuel pretty fast, that\u0027s why I set my throttle as low as possible but still to be able to keep my plane stable at those altitudes.

Instead of going to orbit, you do a suborbital jump into the vicinity of the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) for the land-based ones, a rover on board will be a good idea. Possibly droppable on a parachute from the cargo bay. (fly low and slow amd do a few circles until the rover lands, not to move out of its physics bubble. Then land at a more convenient location, recover, and switch to the rover from tracking station.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace planes may not be the wisest choice. They are usually numb to fly. In those type of missions you usually have to land. A fast an manoeuvrable dedicated plane is better. It\u0027s mandatory that the plane fly steadily at x4 warp (planes tend to nose down at higher warp).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven though, as other said, those missions are a waste of time, but they can be worth it at the very begining if you choose some easy mission around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. On the other hand, those missions are good flying practice, for beginner players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there are worse missions that observe on Earth : observe on other planetary bodies. They usually cost a lot of fuel are very very little reward for a very long an tedious trip.
