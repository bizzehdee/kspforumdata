I would be willing to bet money they are only playing it because they could get it for free. If they couldn\u0027t they wouldnt go out of their way to buy it. They would just find something else. I know many people with this mentality. You wont see one increase in sales by coming up with a way to prevent people like that from playing. They just wont play. Be it because they dont have the money or because they dont feel the product is worth their money. (has nothing to do with what you or I feel the product is worth.)\u003Cp\u003EThe average pirate wont spend even 1 penny on the software they pirate if that meant they could get it legit. They pirate it because they want to pirate it not because of any other reason.

I doubt they account for this phenomenon, which i can testify for myself in my much younger years: I never ever could have attained a full disc box of c64-games if it hadnt been for schoolyard-piracy and it would be rediculous to chalk every copy i had back then up as \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4loss to the economy\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4. Plus, i probably wouldnt have gotten the hardware in the first place, if the software hadnt been known to be \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4free\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, beforehand. That was a major selling point of home computers back then, over the consoles (and even let to the tempory demise of the later - but that was an extremity). Plus the empty discs, the disc boxes... I wonder what made tapes so popular in the 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s (esp. 2x tape-decks)... or a bit later: What did people need all those CD-burners and empty CDs for? All private photo collections? And TB-discs, today contain tons of privately generated, or ligitely purchased media, and nothing else, of course...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDont get me wrong - i am not trying to advocate pro-pricacy at all. I just doubt that the damage done overall by it is highly overestimated. Pirates do the wrong thing - no doubt - and thus i wont support them getting medals for what they do, but it remains a fact, that the whole media industry probably wouldnt quite be where it is today, without them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
