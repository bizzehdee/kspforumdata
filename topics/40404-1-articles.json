I have a rocket design I use a lot in which there\u0027s a Saturn V - styled escape tower for the capsule in case something goes wrong on the launchpad. I hit the abort action group and the tower takes off. And then I hit a second (ALT-1) action group later to do the parachutes. It would make sense to just have that be under one button: decouple, fire, wait 15 seconds, parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is right now, when it comes time to get rid of the escape tower because the early stage of the launch is over and its now on the 2nd or 3rd stage on the way up, I can\u0027t hit a single stage to jettison the tower because if I activate its engines at the same time as I decouple it, the decoupling seems to happen \u0022first\u0022 even though they\u0027re in the same stage, and that makes the engines then unresponsive since they\u0027re no longer attached to the main command module, so the second half of the stages\u0027 instructions - to activate the engines on the tower, never executes. Then the tower just sits there being disconnected but still jammed into the nose of the rocket anyway because the rocket is still accelerating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nodrokov","CreatedById":68622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T16:36:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, sorry, I didn\u0027t search for other suggestions, I just checked in the do not suggest list and list of planned features.
