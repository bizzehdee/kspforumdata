I will try to make them less britter and smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) There is already an atmosphere, but it does not render realy well. I need to make it bigger and brighter.

I used a night Earth map, I know how it looks like. I just need time to create a night version of the Kerbin map. Oh, by the way, do you know if there is a 4k or 8k version of it? The bigger one I could find was a 2k and it could be sooooo much better with a bigger one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I like the tilt, even if it is not realistic for Kerbin, it is for science. Very few planets have 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 tilt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) I agree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big KSP and \u0027\u0027Kerbin by Momo3773 will be remplaced by a smaller dark writting at the bottom of the picture.
