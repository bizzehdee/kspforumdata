It would likely require the construction of new bombs to match the requirements of space flight and to get the best results. \u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are enough security hazards regarding nuclear weapons out there that have been traded on the black market and somehow ended up in very instable nations. That\u0026#39;s already a huge concern as we can\u0026#39;t keep an eye on or even know about all of them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo even if I\u0026#39;d trust some of the space agencies with keeping an eye on their nukes and taking care of a fully enclosed and safe production line, there is still the question about what might happen if it\u0026#39;s not just NASA that starts using nukes for their missions. If one agency uses this conceot, others might follow for prestige or whatever reasons. And even if they all intend to only use them for peacefull missions in the name of science, I still think this is like opening pandora\u0026#39;s box. \u003Cbr\u003E\nThe production and storage of new nukes in certain countries that repeatedly \u0026#39;lost\u0026#39; some of their warheads during political instable periodes is the stuff that most goverment\u0026#39;s nightmaes are made of. \u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is not just about baseless paranoya, it\u0026#39;s about avoiding unpredictable situations with potentially dangerous results.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problems and concerns with those concepts don\u0026#39;t start once the nukes are in orbit.
