Falling around an eccentric orbit does not change the total orbital energy of the vessel, so by my understanding no losses are occurring.

If a vessel can accelerate at 10m/s^2 and is ascending straight up against 4m/s^2 of gravity, then net acceleration is 6m/s every second even though the vessel is spending 10m/s of delta-V. So every second of such a maneuver results in 4m/s of gravity losses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T15:11:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am going to have to agree with Red here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso you have to equate energy i am guessing but unforunitly dV does not convert to energy without knowing how it was spent.
