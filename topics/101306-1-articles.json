Steering losses are not delta-v losses. No delta-v is lost, as I said in my first post.\n\nImagine this scenario. My rocket has a stability problem. Instead of pointing prograde when commanded to point prograde, it precesses around prograde like a top. On average it points prograde, but it never actually points prograde. I don\u0027t lose any delta-v, but I do uselessly spend some of my delta-v budget by not pointing where I want the rocket to point. That is a steering loss. You need to expend more delta-v to perform a maneuver than a rocket with better attitude control would have to expend.\n\nAnyone who\u0027s ever built a floppy rocket in KSP has experienced steering losses, and anyone who played KSP before the improvements to ASAS has experienced steering losses.\n\nIf you want to say that intentional non-prograde burns are not steering losses because those burns were intentional use of delta-v in the non-prograde direction, I would argue that you are redefining the standard definition of steering loss. Is it the word \u0022loss\u0022 that you object to? In this case (intentional non-prograde burns) I would agree that you don\u0027t \u0022take\u0022 a loss. You don\u0027t lose anything.
