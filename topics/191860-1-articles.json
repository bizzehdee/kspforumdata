Despite an economy still recovering from war, it is felt \u201Cvery important\u201D that the UK joins the space race, with\u00A0assistance from members of The Commonwealth who are willing to let the British government build launch sites in their territory.

As this mission is to be recovered, it is decided to aim the rocket north, avoiding potential areas of population and to make for land-based recovery, rather than potentially having to fish the rocket out of the sea. The motor is purposefully cut early to avoid going too high and suffering overheating during re-entry.

Kerman steers the craft to a 45 degree angle not long after launch, with the aim being to break multiple speed records, rather than go too high. In fact UKSA engineers advise that he doesn\u2019t go above 30km as his definitely-not-an-airplane-cockpit isn\u2019t rated for any greater height. The flight tops out at just above 30km but all is fine.\u00A0Some say that this is UKSA\u0027s crowning achievement so far.
