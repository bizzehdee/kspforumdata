This appears to be bringing the final landing position to match the selected position, but the AP is jerking the thrust vector around erratically and this never stabilizes. Lander is otherwise free-falling and is accelerating from gravity.

At Moho, this means the lander is now screaming toward the surface at over 800 m/s. Near the 1 Km altitude, the lander lowers the gear, and flips into a heads-up attitude, but there is no possibility to slow down and the lander hits the ground at better than 600 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot exactly what I expected...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EADDENDUM:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking now at the KSP.log file...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not finding anything in the way of an exception being thrown \u003Cstrong\u003Eprior\u003C/strong\u003E to impact, but exceptions-a-plenty afterward.
