(SpaceX drops its first stage at about V = 1.8 km/s; Ariane 5 keeps the main stage running until about 7 km/s). That makes the main stage engine big, expensive and worth recovering, BUT it means that the mass of your recovery hardware (wings, landing gear, propellers) has a much bigger impact on payload, since it must be carried almost all the way to space. In addition, re-entry is a lot harsher at this speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means there are a bunch of possible showstoppers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Turboprop and turbofan engines are very heavy compared to rocket engines with similar thrust. Often, that doesn\u0027t matter because the savings in fuel and tank mass makes the engine mass negligible, but the plan here is to ditch the tanks, so engine mass matters. (Especially given the flight profile of Ariane 5, see above.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The turboprop engines are going into space, so you\u0027re going to need to design them to be vacuum tolerant. A space-rated jet turbine is not exactly off-the-shelf technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The wings on this thing are very short and stubby, and the payload (a ginormous rocket engine) is pretty heavy. Also, the wings have to be flat boards rather than a classic asymmetric airfoil shape, or they\u0027ll throw off the rocket during launch. Odds are good it\u0027s going to fly like a brick, with a high stall speed that will make landing an exciting challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The video shows folding propellers that deploy in flight. Designing props that fold when you want them to and not when you don\u0027t is a challenge. There are a few aircraft (motor gliders) that do this, but they operate under much less stressful flight conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) The nose of the return vehicle needs a heat shield to protect it during re-entry. But the nose also needs to have ginormous pipes and clamps running through it to mate the engine unit to the fuel tank during launch. This is doable: the Space Shuttle has a bunch of doors in its heat shield to solve this problem. But I think we can all agree that the ideal number of holes you want in your heat shield is zero. And none of this is shown in the video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upshot: this may be doable, and hell, it might work better than SpaceX\u0027s plan. But the final design would involve a lot more careful design than the \u0022strap some wings onto the side of an Ariane 5 engine\u0022 concept shown in the video. Which makes me suspect they haven\u0027t even started doing their homework yet.
