Look, its simple really, this forum is most likely the first and ONLY contact with KSP that people have with Squad, and rely 100% on this site. Heck, I learned of this game thanks to my family and steam before I knew of this website. I like a goodly portion of the users rely strictly on this forum for information pertaining to the game.

We are feeling by and large I would wager, that this forum is an after thought. I would posit to you the following question: Would you expect say, Marvel to post to this website first about progress being made on the Deadpool movie?
