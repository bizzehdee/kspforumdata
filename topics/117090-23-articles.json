So the higher thrust, the more mass and then lower isp. Most of engines were quite balanced. Also you might consider adding delay to thrust change; I also liked this thing in KW rocketry - the biggest engines had helluva delay so they couldn\u0027t be used efficiently for vac operations, also the delay meant that they used a bit of fuel before getting to 100% thrust and lift off thus further reducing their effective isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t take KR-2L, or the biggest engine as isp point of reference; for me their isp is weird and they are too op; so I would expect that squad might nerf them sooner or later.

In this way every engine had its purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother (maybe future), more complicated approach would be to divide engines into RP-1/LOX and LH2/LOX (and CH4/LOX?). Then introduce new fuel tanks for that engines (LH2 being much bigger/heavier for the same amount mass of fuel etc), or add another fuel config (LH2/LH2\u002BOx)for your existing tanks. You can see what Nertea did in his LH2/LOX cryogenic engines mod; from what I remember at least for vacuum engines, the higher isps were offset by higher tank mass so in the end vac engines were maybe 5-7% better dV-wise than their counterparts. I think that for SL engines LH2 and LF engines have similar performance so I think personally I wouldn\u0027t bother using them since it meant higher, more unstable rockets (with bigger 1st stage) with the same performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to hit me up sometime, am more than willing to share whatever tips/tricks/techniques that I can.

Would love to set these engines and such up in a bit more realistic manner (at least in regards to fuel/ISP). I still have some problems with the way others\u0027 have balanced fuel tanks for LH2 though, which is one of the main things keeping me from supporting that as a fuel at all (mostly the ........ mass fractions... 30-50% by mass; where real mass fractions for LH2 are LOWER than for the RP1 tanks (3.5%-10%), not triple to quadruple the value).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine delay - easy enough to add in through a patch. Not sure if I want it as the default behaviour (as it is not the stock behaviour), but is something that could be looked into at some point. I suppose I\u0027ve already slightly set precedence by setting all the gimbals to be not-instant, so will probably do something similar for the larger engines (mostly just the lifters / multipurpose engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that note.... should I include stock based full-range engine throttling, or something a bit more realistic?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VenomousRequiem\u0022 data-cite=\u0022VenomousRequiem\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHopefully the RS-68?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022davidy12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022davidy12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah, sorry.

For hydrolox, RealFuels has a conversion factor of 1.3 at sea level and 1.27 in vacuum.

So maybe give them a thrust boost to compensate for this ... the RF conversions give about 1.33 but this might be a bit low ... maybe more like 1.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETWR\u003C/strong\u003E - I\u0027d say just start with the RL TWR and multiply by a constant.
