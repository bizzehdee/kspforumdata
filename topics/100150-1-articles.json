I\u0027m not sure what would be useful but still within the understanding of a complete beginner.\n\nI am currently thinking chapter 6 should just be a walkthrough of the building tools in practice and then launch/flight to examine the flight \u0026 map modes in the same way the previous screens are shown; pointing out what all the instruments are. Hence, it will only have one ship and one flight (I think; it could change by the time I feel like typing again) - a tech-0 straight-to-orbit flight seems best as it will a) work in any game mode, ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) go further and demonstrate more than the flight basics tutorial, c) provide the \u0027standard\u0027 (10km then turn right) newbie instructions for orbit, d) really DO something, without doing too much. Even with such a restricted definition it might need to be split into two chapters but, no, I\u0027m not going to be building planes or doing more than mentioning dV and TWR, since those aren\u0027t displayed in-game and jets/wings are well along in the tech tree.\n\nThe whole thing is definitely intended to be \u0027book 1\u0027, just so people can find their way around the programme interface without being completely confused. Yes, I am intending to do other guides on orbital manoeuvres, docking, the maths etc., but I\u0027m not in a hurry because I think they\u0027re all covered pretty comprehensively by other guides already.
