In hindsight, not a great idea. Also if anyone knows the reason for KSP deleting crafts on physics load please tell me. The amount of times I load in a craft and 3 others disappear... probably the kraken but maybe someone else has a different idea.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPlease give a vote on what to do next if you can, it makes things clearer on what to build next. Also any extra ideas are good! Next week I will build a bomber but you get to choose the payload.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E1. An automated drop pod that will drop down on the enemy and (hopefully) shooting all the way down.\u003Cbr\u003E2. Masses of nuclear bombs, civilian casualties to hell.\n"}]}
