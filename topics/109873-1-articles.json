MOST WANTED\n\n=============\n\nKerbal Space Program\n\n2. NEXT BEST\n\n==========\n\nCrusader Kings 2\n\nDemocracy 3\n\nReus\n\nThe Walking Dead 1\n\nXCOM\n\n3. GOOD\n\n========\n\nFTL\n\nOutlast\n\nPlague\n\nPrison Architect\n\nProject Zomboid\n\nSid Meiers Civilizaton V\n\nSid Meires Beyond Earth\n\nSpace Hulk\n\n4. OTHER\n\n=========================\n\nAI : War Fleet Command\n\nChainsaw Warrior\n\nDont Starve\n\nDying Light\n\nEuropa Univalis IV\n\nForest Of Doom\n\nGame Dev Tycoon\n\nGauntlet\n\nGods Will Be Watching \n\nGratuitous Space Battles\n\nKilling Floor\n\nOrgan Trail\n\nPayday 1\n\nPayday 2\n\nSang Foid : Tales of Werewolves\n\nSid Meiers Ace Patrol\n\nSurgeon Simulator\n\nTalisman\n\nThe Escapists\n\nThe Ship\n\nThis War of Mine\n\nTropico 4\n\nTropico 5\n\nUniverse Sandbox\n\nLOW VALUE\n\n===========\n\nA Valley Without Wind\n\nAntichamber\n\nBattle vs Chess\n\nDead State\n\nDeadlight\n\nDeadnaut\n\nFrozen Synapse\n\nJagged Alliance - Back In Action\n\nKrater\n\nLunar Flight\n\nMonaco\n\nNeo Scavenger\n\nOmerta - City of Gangsters\n\nPaper\u0027s Please\n\nSid Meier\u0027s Ace Patrol : Pacific Skies\n\nSir You Are Being Hunted\n\nTrapped Dead\n\nWar For The Overworld\n\nWorms Revolution\n\nNOTE1 : Low value cards are approximately worth (to me) about 40% of a KSP card. Assume its pretty linear from there ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) I would appreciate a selection of cards, rather then all from one game. Also FOIL\u0027s will be given extra value depending on the set they are from (generally from 2 - 5 depending on the game). GEM\u0027s are worth approximately 200-400 a card.\n\nNOTE2 : I always hate it when someone posts a trade request but does not give you any idea of a ballpark figure. So I will do my best to avoid this mistake. For me, if the cards were all high value I would say about 25-35 cards. This is just a ballpark figure as it does depend on the trade. Hope it helps.\n\nFinally I am a card collector, not a card trader, so I am only interested in cards/gems. I am looking for a fair trade, not one that disadvantages either side.\n\nThanks for reading. All the best.\n\nADDENDUM : Please respond to this thread if you are interested and we can \u0022negotiate\u0022 on steam.
