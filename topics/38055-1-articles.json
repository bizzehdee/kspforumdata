As I looked at my orbit I thought Dres doesn\u0027t seem that far (relatively) I think I might try and go there. I managed to get an orbit that merged with Dres\u0027s and I elected to wait it out to save fuel. After 1 and a half years drifting I decided to try and alter the orbit and try again which also failed. Broken, I decided to make a break for Eve with the fuel I had left, of which I didn\u0027t have enough of. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Does anyone know a decent plan to get to Dres?

That\u0027s the easiest way. Other than that, just try and read the interplanetary guides. You need to do a plane change to meet Dres usually, so read about that as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T22:04:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s important to make sure the phase angles are correct, because it\u0027s unlikely that you would be able to successfully encounter Dres just like that. Do what Vanamonde suggested and use that website to plan your mission. Alternatively, you could play around with maneuver nodes while in solar orbit and if you can\u0027t get an intersect, warp forward and try again, although that\u0027s not nearly as time-efficient as getting it right the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T17:37:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should notice, that Dres have inclined orbit.
