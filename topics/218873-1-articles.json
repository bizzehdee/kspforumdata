It\u0027s nice to see.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know if anyone has discovered this yet, so I just decided I should share it here just in case. If you wanna see for yourself, either head to the coordinates of the original smiley face (At least I think it\u0027s in the same place), or use some sort of texture extracter like I did to reveal the bump map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
