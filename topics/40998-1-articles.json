The more complex ships are sometimes too laggy to notice what\u0027s going on in time of linkage failures (or after, 100 of messages in the same second isn\u0027t helpful), so the option to enable marking parts in flight with colours describing their stress will be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know, something like that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[stretching] purple \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; blue \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; light blue \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; green [normal] \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; yellow \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; orange \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; red [compressing]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow it looks like (screenshot from a bridge building simulator I used to play some years ago):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.pontifex2.com/pontifex2/pfx2manual/images/basic04.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022basic04.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that option could really be helpful and save a lot of Kerbals. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for taking it into consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T15:50:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, sometimes when the ship falls apart, you can\u0027t tell where it fell apart, so this would be fairly useful, as I end up just putting a dozen more struts on, which may be ten more than I really need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s that sim called?
