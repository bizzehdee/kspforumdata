Unity\u0027s ambient light is global, it can\u0027t be filtered by layers - so if there\u0027s ambient light on the surface of Kerbin (which there ought to be, because it has an atmosphere), it lights up the entirety of the rest of the universe, among which is the dark side of the mun (heh), so you always can see it a bit.
