Moderators moderate. Senior moderators help train new people. Lead moderators break ties when the team is undecided about how to respond to something. There\u0027s only one emeritus, which is an honorary title for a person who has left the forum to pursue other interests, but who we wanted to remember because he did unbelievable amounts of work for the forum during his tenure. \n\n2. Necroposting is, on most of the internet, posting in a thread which is no longer active. People really get their knickers in a twist over it, for reasons I\u0027ve never understood. At any rate, this forum only considers it a problem if the thread in question has been made obsolete due to changes in the game. Necromoaning is when someone complains about necroposts under the impression that this is clever or impresses others. Necromoaning is frowned upon around these parts. \n\n3. There is no simple way to determine this. The forum software does not keep track of such things.
