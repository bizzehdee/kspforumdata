be landing, correct?\u00A0 In that case... the NERV is an excellent choice for interplanetary mothership types of craft, because of its extremely high fuel efficiency (Isp 800).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it has quite a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 But \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t matter (much) for orbital-only craft.\u00A0 A \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 0.36 is

important is for \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Elanders\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E, because the engine has to fight against gravity.\u00A0 Low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E = lots of fuel wasted due to gravity losses.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EToo\u003C/em\u003E low, and you can\u0027t even lift off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if your ship won\u0027t be landing, you\u0027re doing just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a side note (unrelated to your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E question, but you need to know this if you\u0027re using the NERV):\u00A0 One thing to make sure of (this is an easy mistake to make, if you\u0027re new to KSP).\u00A0 The NERV engine, unlike all the other rocket engines, runs on \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eliquid fuel only\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E-- it doesn\u0027t use oxidizer at all.\u00A0 So if you\u0027re putting \u0022normal\u0022 fuel tanks on there, you\u0027re wasting huge amounts of useless dead weight and you\u0027ll get abysmal performance.\u00A0 It\u0027s also bad if you use regular fuel tanks and just set the oxidizer to empty, because then you\u0027re still lugging too much dead weight in the form of half-empty fuel tanks that are twice as big as they need to be.\u00A0 So be sure that you\u0027re using liquid-fuel-only tanks (like the ones that airplanes use) to supply your NERV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Palaceviking","CreatedById":166883,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-19T15:31:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t panic!, \u00A0in space no one can hear

title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (typically much lower than you are using) is to split the burn to Duna into multiple sections. \u00A0You could split the Kerbin-\u0026gt;Duna burn into two bits of delta-v ~2000m/s apiece. \u00A0Just set up an encounter with Duna (so the manuever node tells you when to begin) and fire for a burn of 2000 m/s (the easiest and most effective way would be to have a 2000m/s fuel stage). \u00A0Then set up another maneuver node all over again to tell you how long to burn (the node\u00A0should be at your new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E). \u00A0I wouldn\u0027t do this with your rocket (interplanetary maneuver nodes are tricky, and you actually have quite a bit of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for interplanetary travel), but keep it in mind if you want to build a bigger rocket and need the efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis trick is often called the\u00A0Mangalyaan maneuver after the Indian spacecraft that first did it. \u00A0For Duna, gains are limited after 8 burns (I think\u00A0Mangalyaan did more) since that last burn is going to be at least 130m/s or so out of a total ~1080m/s. \u00A0But until you get out to the Mun (which is pretty close to escape velocity anyway) your orbits will be pretty fast (similar to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E) and shouldn\u0027t change your Duna trajectory all that much. \u00A0Sometime on the forums it is called \u0022periapsis
