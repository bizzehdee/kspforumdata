I stuck on a 2 manned lander on the top and fired off. The rocket flew quite slow, but once it reaches the second part of the atmosphere (12km), it was like a cheetah on steroids. It blasted out the atmosphere quickly, the launch stage still had a bit of fuel left, so I used the remaining fuel to finish off the orbit, I detached, and flew the transfer stage into the SOI of the Mun, I was nervous. During the 2 years I\u0027ve played KSP for, I failed multiple times trying to land on the moon. This time, I went for it, I burned retrograde and landed on a crater, I planted my flag and launched back towards Kerbin. Now that I landed on the Mun, the next place was obvious, Minmus. Due to the large amounts of fuel left when I orbited the moon, I knew that it can easily reach Minmus. I stuck a lander probe on it, knowing that my Kerbals will have a really high chance of dying. I launched at night time, I did the usual in orbit, however, Minmus doesn\u0027t have a flat orbit unlike the Mun, so I used the Maneuver Node to adjust my orbit. I flew to Minmus, landed and took this screenshot (On my old computer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IuZ1vjK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IuZ1vjK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter landing on Minmus, I had to do it again, only this time, a manned mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI felt like the Jool I should have a successor, the Jool II. I went to the VAB and basically removed the NASA liquid fuel boosters and replaced it with more solid fuel boosters as the Jool I had a problem of the liquid fuel boosters colliding into the engine when separated, it would even worse than the Jool I, it failed miserably, couldn\u0027t even get out of the atmosphere. So I went back to the Jool I and used a modified version of the Mun Lander I made for the Mun mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched it into orbit, separated the launch stage and landed on Minmus again. I planted a flag down (again, still on my old computer, which explains the horrible quality) and headed home. This was the screenshot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oW08XcT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oW08XcT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s it, hope you\u0027ve enjoyed it.
