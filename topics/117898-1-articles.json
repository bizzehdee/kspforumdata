Here is a tip I noticed to reduce unlucky tipping.\n\nThe obvious : If fuel is drawn fuel from lower tank first (fuel conduits), lock the lower tanks or transfer fuel from the top to the bottom to lower you center of mass before landing.\n\nThe less obvious : When you locate the orientation of the slope, \u0022Lock suspension\u0022 on the landing struts down the slope. That way, your ship will bounce less when you cut engine. \n\nIn any case : land slower than on flat land. Try to get lower than 1m. Of course activate SAS.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T21:19:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 09:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Warzouz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T20:43:53Z","Content":"I might add, \u0022Have your landing points be widely spaced apart.\u0022 \n\nUnfortunately, that makes a lander hard to fit in a fairing."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T20:49:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The obvious : Engines draw fuel from the lower tank first.

A slope means you are landing off vertical. Even just 6 degrees of slope means you have 10% horizontal thrust. Worse, that thrust takes you away from the ground.\n\nA better bet is to hover a meter above land, then touch down with .4-.7 TWR and stability SAS. The minimal thrust will relax thrust cutoff timing requirements and a hover before touchdown reduces the forces that make landing on a slope hard. This method does waste fuel though. Your often better avoiding slopes period."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T21:14:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t believe this is correct.

The more conventional lander design of engine at the bottom with fuel tanks above will drain from top to bottom.\n\nMore generally, engines will draw from the furthest fuel tank first, if that makes sense.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T21:33:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 09:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T21:23:13Z","Content":"You\u0027re using LV-Ns on a lander, there\u0027s your problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T21:33:24Z","Content":"It looks like it\u0027s a heavy lander meant to be used repeated on a low gravity vacuum world, LV-Ns are a perfectly reasonable choice for such a role."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T21:46:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It looks like it\u0027s a heavy lander meant to be used repeated on a low gravity vacuum world, LV-Ns are a perfectly reasonable choice for such a role.\n\nYes this heavy lander is design to bring back 2 big tanks of Ore to a space station.

Probably a different story on places like Tylo...\n\n\\*edit\\* doing the math back-of-the-envelope...\n\n A ship with fully loaded tanks exactly equal to the mass of the payload/ engines would have a Rwd of 1.89. Even at 300s Isp, this would translate to about 1,900 m/sec DV. Much higher than would be necessary on almost all moons, and even then the tanks would weigh less than the payload at the moment of touchdown.\n\n So yeah... tanks should be on top.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T15:23:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 03:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T15:24:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Starhawk,\n\u003E  So far, on all the bodies I\u0027ve visited the tanks are a good deal lighter than the payload.
