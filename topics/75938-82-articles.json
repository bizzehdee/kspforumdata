Mainly for docking multiple vehicles / freight cars together. The usual problem is that you can\u0027t dock two vehicles since docking ports are on different heights:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- different weights -\u0026gt; spring/dampener actions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- it\u0027s hard to attach wheels / tracks on the side so they are aligned and touch ground evenly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etop mount and fixed height solves those 2 problems:)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LFKLIwW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LFKLIwW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-23T14:38:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2015 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T14:49:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can adjust the height of sets of wheels using the right click menu to make this easier.
