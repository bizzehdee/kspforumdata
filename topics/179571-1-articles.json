I know it\u0027s a pain that you can\u0027t see what parts i have but at least now you know my nodes in the tree that is useable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, mainly I want to know about the drilling machine. I plan on going to Minmus first since it\u0027s really easy. I could use any tips or information at all because I got no clue how this drilling works. I need to know how I should build my ship, and what do i exactly do with it? I know you can make fuel out of ore. So do I just land the drill on Minmus, and when I have ore that can be made into fuel I can fly my drilling machine up to orbit and dock with whatever other ship and just re fuel it, for the sake of an interplanetary flight further from minmus for example? And also how exactly do you re fuel and what parts do I need for that? Thanks for all tips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-05T23:24:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrilling is not science, it\u0027s a way to get fuel from other planets and asteroids.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a pretty complicated subject, actually, so Instead of detailing it I\u0027ll point you to a couple relevant Wiki pages:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Resource_harvester\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Resource_harvester\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Ore\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Ore\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Convert-O-Tron_250\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Convert-O-Tron_250\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/M700_Survey_Scanner\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/M700_Survey_Scanner\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-05T23:34:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave a drill, a refinary, an ore tank, a semi empty fuel tank, solar panels, and a bunch of radiators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomehow attach all those together, make sure the drill touches the surface, start drilling, and use the refinery to make fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-06T17:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou really don\u0027t need to mine at all in KSP to visit any of the planets.
