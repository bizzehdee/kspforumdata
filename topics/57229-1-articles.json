If there are none of those available, there is another way: you basically use your planet like a precision micrometer. You align your view such that the circle at the center of the planet lines up with both your orbit and the plane of the ecliptic, and also such that both your orbit and the plane of the ecliptic are both viewed side-on, such that they both look like lines. If you can manage this, the axis of convergence as you look through will cross over both your ascending and descending nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtip: you can also use this method to align with any other orbit that is around a body other than the one you are orbiting.
