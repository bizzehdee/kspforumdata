Measuring is always the best way of finding out where the problem lies. You could download GPU-Z, a measuring tool for your GPU. After downloading and installing it, you can start it up before starting your game. Also open up Windows Task Manager before starting your game. After playing for a little while you can see whether your GPU or CPU is loaded a 100%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to deal with that without buying new hardware is fiddling around with the settings. Try to find a mix of settings that look as good as possible, without bogging down your machine too much. There is often quite a lot to gain with some tweaking - just plunking a game on Medium or High often does not lead to optimal results. Personally I prefer a smooth running game to a good looking but lagging game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause 2.66GHz, that\u0027s why.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is indeed what someone would say who does not know what he is talking about. Just a GHz number does not say anything at all, as with every generation it pretty much means something else. The Core2\u0027s are actually quite capable processors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
