I noticed that recently my navball started showing antimaneuver nodes. I don\u0027t have this mod installed, unless it is now bundled with another but, at least the navball in my IVA (rasterprop screen navball not the game stock navball) and I have to say.... now that I have them....I don\u0027t know why anyone thought they were a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far the only difference between having them and not, is that, about 1/4 of the time, I start my burn 180degrees offset from where I intend to because I forget that the meaningless marker exists. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, I get normal and antinormal, I get radial and antiradial, but why would I want to move my trajectory away from a maneuver? I only ever want to get closer to it, or make a new one. Is there some situation I am failing to imagine where it helps? About the only benefit I can see is it makes it easier to find the maneuver direction since there are now two indicators so if you turn the wrong way you will still \u0022see it\u0022 (and hopefully not line your burn up to it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Easide from that, love the extra markers, I may install this anyway when I get home even if just for (anti-)normal/radial\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
