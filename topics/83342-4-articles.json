Also, if it doesn\u0027t work out, I have been considering completely redoing how stock KSP handles funds. I have been considering making it so you pay once for a part and then never again as long as you reuse the part. Then you\u0027d be able to sell things from your inventory (at a reduced rate) and it gives you even more reason to reuse parts. With an inventory of parts this makes WAY more sense, but I\u0027m interested in your opinions on the idea.

The pod only has 18 hours worth of food, water, and oxygen. No way to get the life support supplies from the separated section, even with KAS. No docking ports, so can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t re-attach in any way. Kerbal will die in 18 hours.

Nearly bankrupted my space program by buying as many construction time upgrades as possible. Unlocked new science just for the construction time boosts.

It is NOT manned and I do NOT have satellite signal at Mun. I desperately wanted to do a manned rescue, but it just plain couldn\u0027t be built in time. This means that I am going to have to do the transfer burn and then pre-plan a Mun circularization burn that perfectly rendezvouses with the stranded craft, ALL FROM KERBIN ORBIT. The margin or error on maneuver nodes that far away is typically too high to go without corrections, but I have no choice. Once this probe leaves satellite range, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to do what I told the flight computer to do with no way to adjust.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI did it.

So back before version 1.0 (aka the 7 months of pre-releases) KCT only took into account the price of a full tank (aka, the price in the part\u0027s config file). In order to support tweakscale, which changes prices of individual parts in the editor (but not in their configs) I had to start taking into account the cost of fuel, which means that times didn\u0027t change at all, but you can make them shorter by removing fuel (which wasn\u0027t something I liked). The cost of resources is pretty minuscule and you\u0027re already paying less time than you would be if I didn\u0027t include them, but I can see about reducing the build time of resources (mind you, they also work with the part inventory, so if a part is in the inventory its fuel has almost no effective cost) and seeing if that makes any noticeable change at all. I don\u0027t really want to base it on the empty cost, but I can see how well that would work too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to point out that it takes time to fuel up a vessel. The Saturn V\u0027s longest individual fuel type filling appears to be the LOX at over 45 minutes, but the whole filling process starts at T-13 hours and is pretty much continually doing something until T-72 seconds (usually just keeping things topped off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for \u0022quickbuilding\u0022, I\u0027ll think about it. I personally would rather have part failure than increased cost, but that\u0027s not something I\u0027m going to implement (though there is a part failure mod that reduces costs for less quality parts, which would work perfectly here I imagine). I like exponential cost changes, meaning 2x is 4x cost, 3x is 9x cost, etc. Maybe shutting down all other lines (VAB or SPH) while that craft is in the build list. Doing a quick build should be an absolute last resort. I\u0027d rather see things like OverloadUT\u0027s story than people just doing a quickbuild to mount a rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FiiZzioN\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FiiZzioN\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be something else I think most people that use this mod would love to have incorporated sometime down the line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf people show enough interest I can add it.
