It is almost like those of us who chose to support Squad by buying KSP directly from them are being ostracized for choosing to support the developer instead of a third party software provider.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t another thread concerning whether the pre-release should have been released to all by any means necessary as doing the pre-release through Steam was the best option available to Squad at this time given the options available to them. However, having challenges posted involving the 1.1 pre-release on the KSP forums could be viewed as a direct insult to those of us who refuse to use steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would ask that we not turn this into another \u0027salty tears\u0027 thread but rather use this thread to make our voices heard by the members of the community who have decided to not respect the fact that 1.1 was in pre-release which was done to further testing and finding bugs ...
