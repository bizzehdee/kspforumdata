Sorry if this has been asked before but i wasn\u0027t able to dig it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure some things are obvious but i\u0027d expect that there are features which are easily missed.

For now i\u0027d suggest having headlines with a \u0022feature name\u0022 followed by a description and some indication of the importance. Maybe like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize 3 for headings and a \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E (cool) smiley in the title to indicate that the feature would be important to you.

Maybe on an additional \u0022tab\u0022 again so you get the latest version by just clicking download and do have the option to get a previous version from an additional dialog.

At this point I\u0027m not sure whether it was even scrapped or still a WIP. The whole daily kerbal thing has become drab and seemingly as useful as mainstream media, just throwing random crap out there. I know people enjoy it, and that is their prerogative, but I actually like \u0027Useful\u0027 information. So yea, any word on the progress of Spaceport 2.0? I seriously doubt I will get a response as I\u0027ve tried before to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: In response to above, I believe Squad sent out a questionnaire on this subject of preference. It was basically a \u0027choose from this list\u0027 sort of poll as to what \u0027we\u0027 would like to see changed. Don\u0027t remember exactly when that was but that is about all I\u0027ve seen or heard on the subject since. For some reason they don\u0027t seem to deem progress updates on Spaceport 2 important either. And according to Rob, the guy (I\u0027m assuming) building the new Spaceport, said in a Devnote back in NOVEMBER that it was so close to finished he could smell it. 2 months later and nada, he must have a nose of a dog to smell it from that far away.

Data is synced. This has several benefits. Minimal modifications for mods to deploy. Centralized repository without the need to have a centralized data storage point. On top of that the mods would no longer have to be manually installed, and KSP would be able to enable and disable mods that aren\u0027t compatible after an update, as well as being able to update the mods when they become available.

Also this would inhibit new mods. \u0022Casual\u0022 Players probably would only look at the gold tier and that would leave everything else in the dust.

The advantage for N\u002B\u002B is that they don\u0027t have thousands of updates/plugins. Especially since TextFX isn\u0027t maintained anymore. But expanding on this it might be possible to either have a simple interface with lots of filters or maybe have something like the steam workshop subscriptions. So you\u0027d be able to navigate a site, click a link and add it to your \u0022personal stash\u0022 of mods. On the other hand this might just be an enhancement to the service instead of an alternative if you do it this way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fronbow","CreatedById":95397,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T19:42:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see SpacePort 2 more integrated with the forum, particularly for the feedback from users and also to cut down on redundant data that only needs to be in one place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m surprised there isn\u0027t a mod for VBulletin that does something like this already; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drupal.org/project/project_module\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edrupal\u0027s project page\u003C/a\u003E would be a suitable fit in my opinion and could be extended for additional features, and I\u0027m pretty certain a bridge between VB and drupal could be created (if it\u0027s not already available). drupal also has a better way of dealing with file uploads than WordPress (I\u0027ve developed for both platforms!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like to see some sort of version control or broadcast so that addon managers can do a better job of keeping installed mods up to date (curse do a really good job as far as WoW addons go!!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a dependency check to show mods/plugins that are required - rather than allowing mod authors to incorporate others\u0027 plugins, just have a way of either downloading the latest as part of the mod or showing links to the dependencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 for Modpack bundles - there\u0027s a lot of creative use of these on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/addon-packs/wow\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecurse\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gendalf","CreatedById":17407,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T02:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Erequire from mod dev to write which versions of KSP are compatible with which versions of mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
