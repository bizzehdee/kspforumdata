(It spawns with 35dV for some reason, I\u0027m not sure why but whatever. That\u0027s within my budget.) \u00A0I start mouse-wheeling on various parts of it to see what effect it will have on the encounter periapsis... \u00A0none. \u00A0After about ten minutes of this, I yank REAL hard on various bits trying to provoke ANY reaction out of the encounter periapsis. \u00A0The orbit goes crazy... but the encounter track remains entirely unmoved.... o.O\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI decide the encounter might be an error in the tracking and advance time to see if the encounter is real... and that\u0027s when I realize that I can slap nodes on the purple orbit, but not the blue one. \u00A0(The purple orbit is my Kerbol orbit AFTER the encounter.) \u00A0Nothing I do seems to let me add a node to the track I\u0027m CURRENTLY on. \u00A0Is there a hotkey for this? Am I just missing with the mouse? I don\u0027t even get a mouse-over indication that my current trajectory is interactable...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-27T03:10:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni have this problem alot, what i do sometimes as a work around is view duna in patched conics and place a node within dunas \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. since itll tend to let you place one there. \u00A0 if you then reset view to your ship, you should be able to drag it back towards you to where you wanna do your manuever\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qoonpooka","CreatedById":134904,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-27T03:30:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222731839\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146627\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472267456\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164906\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DD_bwest\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, DD_bwest said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni have this problem alot, what i do sometimes as a work around is view duna in patched conics and place a node within dunas \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. since itll tend to let you place one there. \u00A0 if you then reset view to your ship, you should be able to drag it back towards you to where you wanna do your manuever\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll give this a try.
