Since I\u0027ve always been a docking advocate I got to see the development in this area first hand. Let\u0027s see what happened over the versions and how it mirrors real life:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the beginning - there was no persistence or tracking station, so you\u0027re stuck with just the active flight you\u0027re running. The closet thing to rendezvous you could do in those bad old days where to just turn around the capsule after separation from the booster rocket and track the spent booster behind you. This is exactly what happened during NASA\u0027s Mercury program. The Mercury spacecraft was primitive and didn\u0027t have the ability to translate, only row pitch and yaw. So one of the thing that Mercury flights did was spin the spacecraft around and look at the booster behind it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 0.11 - RCS system introduced to allow translation control, spacecraft control system greatly improved with the introduction of ASAS and orbital view. This mirrors the Gemini 3 flight with the introduction of a much improved spacecraft with both translation and rotation control, paving the way for fine manoeuvres on orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 0.14 - major break through with introduction of spacecraft persistence and tracking station, allowing multiple flights at once, thus first opening up the theoretical possibility of rendezvous. However there is very little experience with rendezvous in the community at that time and little guide available, so most players are in the dark as to how to do this. This mirror\u0027s the situation on Gemini 4 where the spacecraft attempted to rendezvous with its spent booster but failed because simply pointing the nose at the target and thrusting didn\u0027t work. Like KSP players around this time NASA staff have not worked out all the nuances of orbital mechanics yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 0.14.4 - when this thread was first posted. No technical improvement in the game but people have played with persistence long enough that the first rendezvous guide started showing up on youtube. Rendezvous was still very difficult because there was no select target or closest approach. And in any case where you get there there was no way to dock. Yours truly cut his teeth on rendezvous around this time and as you can see tried to come up with primitive ways to connect the spacecrafts. This mirrors the situation with the Gemini 6A and Gemini 7 rendezvous where two spacecrafts launched separately where able to meet up to as close as 30cm. However lack of docking port mean that Gemini 6A and Gemini 7 couldn\u0027t actually physically join as one craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven without working docking ports, the fact that I managed to briefly get two spacecrafts to grab each other fired my imagination and filled my head with ideas of propellant depots and tanker rockets and colossal interplanetary motherships:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i50.tinypic.com/34ovrja.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002234ovrja.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 0.17 - around this time the first docking mods became available. I remember back there the two were ORDA and warp claws, each with their strength and weaknesses. They didn\u0027t actually merge two crafts like modern docking, but rather the parts would pull on each other with massive force once they are close enough. Me, being Dr Rendezvous was busy promoting the possibilities opened up by docking and came up with a system that used both ORDA and warp claws at the same time on the same craft and performed the first big \u0022mothership style\u0022 interplanetary mission with my Duna/Ike double landing and return:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i50.tinypic.com/2hzh4oz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222hzh4oz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mirrors Gemini 10, where primitive docking ports where first introduced and used to dock Gemini 10 with an Agena Target Vehicle. Test shows that it\u0027s possible to use engines on one spacecraft to boost the combination to other orbits. Thereby paving the way for Apollo\u0027s lunar orbit rendezvous mission plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 0.18 - stock docking, much joy all around from the community. Stock docking turns out to be much more reliable than the mods and all the rage at the time was Apollo-style lunar landing mission. I was also caught up and shared one such craft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/2d6tnqp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222d6tnqp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mirrors the Apollo fights, where docking became mature technology and allowed much more delta-V efficient mission profiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 0.19 - rovers where introduced, introducing theoretical possibility of docking on the surface of a body. At the time I was working on docking with multiple ports at once to allow heavy duty space construction which resulted in this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://103.imagebam.com/download/Hrl_snQoHS2ORunn_LapyQ/24990/249891975/screenshot361.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot361.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24990-0-19-1-Orbital-Propellant-Depot-Olympus-II\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOrbital Propellant Depot Olympus II\u003C/a\u003E. Of course this then become obsolete with the release of large docking port in 0.20. But I wasn\u0027t too bothered since wide spread heavy docking meant the explosion of heavy construction in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mirrors the development of modular space stations such as Mir and ISS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 0.21 - After a long break I came back to KSP to continue to work on the modular surface base idea.

The first docking was Gemini 8 to the Agena Target Vehicle (Neil Armstrong, commanding, and David Scott, pilot). There was a Gemini RCS malfunction almost immediately after docking and the mission had to be aborted after an uncontrollable roll developed. Armstrong saved the lives of himself and Scott by thinking quickly and making the right calls to save the spacecraft using the re-entry RCS system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, otherwise I loved seeing this \u0022ancient\u0022 thread come to life, necro or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sporkafife","CreatedById":38208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T15:22:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhoah!!
