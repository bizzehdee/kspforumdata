Where did all my science go? I did load from a quicksave a few times, would that have anything to do with it? The KSP version I have is 1.0.4.861 and I am running on Windows 8.1 64 bit. the only mods I have installed are the particle cloud effects and TextureReplacer.

You either need to return the sci equipment or perform an EVA and right click each sci part and take the data back to the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TomG117","CreatedById":148933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T07:15:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eactually as at turns out I was in fact collecting all the science, it only listed the return of a vessel after I recovered the craft, but all the other science was added.
