This mod was created as a \u0022more extensive\u0022 version of Rejector. I used to use Rejector but found it had little problems and annoying windows to it. So I created this!\n\nWhat Contract Filter allows you as the user to do, is to configure how you want each type of contract to be when you accept it or reject it.\n\nFor example, if you need 60 science to get that next node, and you know there\u0027s going to be contracts with a reward of 60 science, then you can click on the type of contract you want to receive, whether it\u0027s Part Testing, Collecting Science, ISRU contracts, Body Surveys, or Science Gatherings, then you scroll to the textbox for minScienceComplete and put that from 0 to 60. Now after you save that up, you can start sorting your contracts!\n\nWhen it sorts the contracts, it\u0027ll check all the conditions of the contract to match all the numbers and letters you gave it. So since you had a minimum requirement of 60 science upon completion, all those little contracts with 12 science and 5 science go poof. But all the 60\u002B science ones stay ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nYou can do this for funds, science, reputation, contract parameters, bodies, and strings!\n\nIf you don\u0027t like those pesky Part testing while flying over a planet contracts, it\u0027s simple! Just click on PartTest tab, then go to Blacklist Strings, then type into the box \u0022flying over\u0022 (be careful, it\u0027s case sensitive!) and then add in the string to the blacklist. Save your settings, then start the sorting, and now all of those \u0022flying over\u0022 contracts will vanish!\n\nAs another handy feature, you can just not get part test contracts at all! When you click on a contract type, just click the \u0022Reject\u0022 button, and it will turn into an \u0022Accept\u0022 button, letting you know that the type is now rejected, and you have the ability to accept the type again at any time.\n\nWARNING: NOT SAVING YOUR SETTINGS CAN RESULT IN SETTINGS LOSS IF YOU CLOSE YOUR GAME, ALWAYS REMEMBER TO SAVE!\n\nPictures:\n\n![GkA6eCT.png](http://i.imgur.com/GkA6eCT.png)\n\nAs you can see above, I don\u0027t want any Science collecting, Base making, or Planting of the flag contracts. Also, when I get my Explore x body contracts, I don\u0027t want to get them for Eve, Laythe, or the Sun.\n\n![17dSbjx.png](http://i.imgur.com/17dSbjx.png)\n\nNow with a newly added Edit All button! You can edit all the type preferences at once!\n\nLike here I\u0027m telling every type of contract to be declined if it\u0027s for Kerbin.\n\n(and a new toolbar icon thanks to BadSector/Luca!)\n\nDownload: [http://spacedock.info/mod/696/Contract%20Filter](http://spacedock.info/mod/696/Contract%20Filter)\n\n**ALL PROBLEMS/ISSUES MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A SETTINGS FILE AND OUTPUT LOG!!**\n\nChangelog:\n\nv1.5.2:\n\n-Fixed OutofSync exception when closing EditAll window.
