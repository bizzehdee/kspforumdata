So therefore, this should be my 300th post. (I never did a thread for 100 or 200, so let\u0027s go.) First of all, thanks to the wonderful Kerbal Kommunity that has been helping me since late October 2014. It\u0027s been a wild ride to 300 posts and nearly 200 rep, and you guys were willing to stick with me through it all. Next, a personal thanks to Starwhip and zekes, who were (and Starship still is) the people I communicated with the most. Last of all but definitely not least, thank you HarvesteR and Squad as a whole for dreaming up the game, and getting it all the way to 1.0, ***and*** letting me interact with many amazing people. Thank you to all, and have a good time.\n\u003E Cheers, RAINCRAFTER.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nWow. I can\u0027t believe I wrote that at the end of May. So long ago... yet just yesterday... \n\nMy post activity ramped up a lot around June of 2015. \n\nI went from one-two posts per day to TEN posts per day around that time, and my posts are becoming a lot more useful because of my company. \n\nI now have 321 rep points, largely due to my company giving me a lot more rep. \n\nI have the same thanks to give as my old post, and as well as that, I have to thank the mods for keeping this forum a happy place, Astrogamer for being awesome and releasing an awesome mod, Zoo Named Games for chatting with me on Steam, playing TF2 with me, helping my company, and Roleplaying on other forums, the rest of the devs for the work they\u0027ve done, the VBulletin devs for making an awesome frame for this forum, Rune for giving feedback on one of my company crafts, everyone on my friends list, every owner of every company I am sponsoring, and just everyone who lights up my day here. Thank you all so much, I can\u0027t say it enough. Cheers, RAINCRAFTER.\n\n![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T18:00:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 06:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RAINCRAFTER**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T15:54:21Z","Content":"Star**s**hip?
