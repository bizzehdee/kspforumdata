Does anyone have a clue about how to solve this issue as nothing I do prevents this.\n\n I\u0027ve tried: Adding counterweights to the tail, tilting the wings to give them more lift, moving the wings forward until it looked stupid.

All your elevators are located on the lagging surface of the wings- very close to the Center of Mass. You want your control surfaces to ideally be as far from the Center of Mass as possible in order to maximize control-authority.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t suggest removing those control surfaces- they\u0027re actually well-positioned to make great flaps or spoilers (they\u0027re close to the Center of Mass and Center of Lift, so they won\u0027t significantly destabilize your pitch-moment while being used to increase or decrease lift).\n\nBut if you want to actually control your plane\u0027s Angle of Attack, you need to place control-surfaces oriented to control pitch on either the very front or the very rear of your aircraft. I suggest the front (canards) because they will be less likely to cause the tail to rip off at excessively high dynamic pressures there, and will shift your Center of Mass slightly forward (the canards have mass, after all). But if you want an airplane that looks more like a commercial airliner, place the elevators on the tail instead...\n\nRegards,\n\nNorthstar"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T21:59:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...just hyperediting it into the air.\n\nAdd wheels and take off from the runway like a normal plane."},{"CreatedByName":"Lhathron the Elf","CreatedById":118706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T23:02:24Z","Content":"If I may, where are the engines?

I think part of it is that the Mk3 parts are so much more massive the pitch surfaces just don\u0027t scale up large enough. On smaller planes, the cockpit torque can compensate for bad aerodynamics: mk3 cockpit just doesn\u0027t have the same amount or relative torque.\n\nMy solution has been to do what real airliners do and have an all moving tail for trim (attach the horizontal stabilizaer to the empennage with a IR rototron or the like) and then I can use the rototron to trim for speed/alt and use the elevator for fine control."},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T23:48:44Z","Content":"Canards usually seem to fix control issues... unfortunately, they look ugly.
