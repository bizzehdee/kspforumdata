Otherwise it\u0027s a dead probe...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, I was thinking of three tiers of communication. 1 is Low Kerbin Orbit, 2 is Kerbin\u0027s Sphere of Influence, and 3 is everywhere else in the solar system. The Communotron 16 would serve for LKO, the Comms DTS-M1 for Kerbin\u0027s SOI, and the Communotron 88-88 for everywhere else. Of course, this doesn\u0027t mean that you absolutely have to use the communotron for LKO, you could use the 88-88 for LKO. PS. There would be no light speed delay, for the sake of convenience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts, suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Yes I know about Remote Tech, just saying a very limited version of it could be pretty cool for stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-11T19:41:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2014 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Daddy Cecil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T19:25:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemote Tech Mod is for you than\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T19:47:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought this was about having to use comm satellites but, since it\u0027s not, I actually like the idea. It\u0027s a good halfway point between useless craft (as in, I\u0027m never going to fly them again but for some reason I need them in orbit) and nothing. Given sufficient variation between the antenna it might also be nice to allow \u0022relay\u0022 craft with larger antenna act as focal points for craft with smaller antenna. So a lander could use a smaller, lighter, less power-intensive antenna while the orbiter carries the heavy, power-intensive long-range antenna. In this way all the relays and such can be mission-specific (if desired), they don\u0027t require extensive networks to provide line-of-sight, and they provide a satisfying mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T19:53:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn theory, KSP probe cores could function independently as they have the very same thing that controls them as Kerbals do.

The extra weight is pretty trivial since even the umbrella antenna is very light but a mechanic that rewarded you for having a relay satellite around Duna, so that your tiny lander probe could bounce signals off it, would be very satisfying to me.

Additionally, it also takes into account signal delay (negligible within Kerbin SoI) and differentiates between two kinds of antennas: omni-directional have short range but can communicate with any other omni-directional antenna in range while dish antenna must be targeted at a specific direction (Active Vessel, Kerbin, that probe, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1rml0r/tutorial_complete_novices_guide_to_remotetech_2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1rml0r/tutorial_complete_novices_guide_to_remotetech_2/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T13:52:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Luis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Luis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d like line of sight calculations to take into account whether the signal is blocked by a planet, but I\u0027d settle for a simple range check.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like that because you end up with extensive arrays of craft whose sole purpose is allowing you to fly another.

Three is better as it allows you to have them regularly spaced and to cover all the surface (for allowing connections to KSC for example). For the design, you just put one omni-directional antenna for communications with the surface, between the satellite of the planet and close ships, and as many dish antennas as you want targets. For instance, you could just put one dish antenna to track your active vessel; I usually put two so that my probes can target the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-12T20:11:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2014 08:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Yoha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T21:01:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see some data (like temperature readings and gravity scans) have the ability to be moved between vessels using using antennae \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther data (Materials, goo, surface samples) would still have to be moved manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolitic","CreatedById":79738,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T22:01:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe probes already have built in signalling, hence why we dont need antennas.
