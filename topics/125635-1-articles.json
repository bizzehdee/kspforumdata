Laptop CPUs are a lot slower... even with the turbo (at least in my experience). to give you an idea of my next machine, I\u0026#39;m buying it from a friend of mine who\u0026#39;s got his own company.

I\u0026#39;m a programmer myself and I have no clue how he does that, I did buy a machine from him a few years ago, and I swear I\u0026#39;ve never had a machine that fast for the price I paid! If you think you know everything about overclocking, well he stills knows more lol. That guy is litterally a magician!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe are in canada so keep in mind his prices are in canadian dollars... so that 2600$ machine is like what... 2000 USD? And you get a 4.6 GHz quad core CPU, 16 Gbs of killer ram, overclocked to 3000MHz (yes, you can overclock RAM!!!), and a GTX 970... overclocked as well of course! Everything being watercooled as well to make sure everything runs cool and silent... This thing is gonna rock! (water cooling nowadays isn\u0026#39;t that much better than fans as far as temperature goes as fans are getting extremely performant, byt the water cooling is more quiet. You have much fewer fans, and if you put the radiator outside the case, its easy to keep clean, and clean fans means silent fans! The watercooling to me is all about noise reduction. Systems using fans are silent at first but gets noisy over time as fans gets dirty... With a water cooled system its easy to keep cleaner as there are fewer of them and its easy to make a watercooling system where the fans are super easy to access, and even replace once in a while if they get more noisy)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI understand that gaming laptops are fun... but in my experience, its a pain in the backside more than anything. They are expensive, they get outdated extremely fast, they tend to break (they are super bad with heat, they have super powerfull parts, in a very, very limited space, everything gets hot, and hot parts wear out fast. As a matter of fact, my laptop ws suposed to have a GTX 675M, but it blew up after 2 years, they replaced it with a 770M, and I\u0026#39;ll be dead honest, it hasn\u0026#39;t even been a year since I had the card replaced, the 770M is starting to do free games, I think its gonna blow up soon... I also had to have 2 memory DIMMs that also blew up...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the end its your descision, I understand why you\u0026#39;d want gaming laptop, as 3 years ago I really wanted one too... But now I really regret it. If I had gotten a desktop back then, I wouldn\u0026#39;t be swearing at my computer every single day, and it would still be good for a few months to a year or two... But now I can\u0026#39;t get newer games because it just won\u0026#39;t play them... I lag a bit in GTA V because my GPU isn\u0026#39;t powerfull enough, I lag in KSP cause my CPU isn\u0026#39;t fast enough...
