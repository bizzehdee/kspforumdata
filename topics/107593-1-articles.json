The new heating mechanic is very simple. If your stuff gets too hot, KSP crashes in despair. It\u0027s not a bug. It\u0027s a feature. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T15:17:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I was slightly puzzled myself when they first showed up, oblivious to what they meant.

I don\u0027t know, perhaps they should make it look like a thermometer (and make it vertical) instead of making it horizontal bar that by default appears green?\n\nI fully understand your confusion. The fact that a first time you see it is pretty much always an ascend phase of the flight doesn\u0027t really help."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T16:05:06Z","Content":"I think I figured out what it was when I first saw it, since I was messing around with the re-entry heat with HyperEdit.
