Everyone starts in their own solar system, gradually building their way up to interstellar travel. People can send trading envoys, and establish relations, working together to build up a galactic civilization. No one \u003Ci\u003Ehas\u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0to join, it just makes your journey easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe people you can communicate with (i.e chat) are people inside your antenna range. You can have colonies anywhere and spread your kerbals out, but in a race or in coordination with fellow players.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I see it as this. The best players would slowly gravitate toward the center, either naturally or by quests and other incentives, while the old systems are cleaned and used for newer server members. People could join, and send out their broadcasts into interstellar space, inviting people, sending them away, or just yelling into the void. Then as they got experience they would join the cycle of civilizations. The planets would have variable resources, encouraging trade for rare materials and energy sources. The people could trade with each other, you could work together on ambitious projects, or just fly around and have a good time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how well\u00A0this would actually work, and I don\u0027t have any answer for the main multiplayer problems, but I will say that the idea is very interesting and would be very fun to try out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-17T20:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not Elite Dangerous, interstellar travel is not an easy feat should require adequate planning and a proper build up gameplay-wise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably it will be far past end-game content for a sizable chunk of the community and too slow for any multiplayer interaction to be based on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re basically condemning most of the player to a solitary single player experience with a tiny probability of being visited by some other player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerminator K-100","CreatedById":204357,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-17T20:47:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223927886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200438\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221613594639\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268648\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Master39\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, Master39 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not Elite Dangerous, interstellar travel is not an easy feat should require adequate planning and a proper build up gameplay-wise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably it will be far past end-game content for a sizable chunk of the community and too slow for any multiplayer interaction to be based on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re basically condemning most of the player to a solitary single player experience with a tiny probability of being visited by some other player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess I was thinking more along the lines of a MMO space \u0022simulator\u0022 that is just a ridiculous si-fi multiplayer game.
