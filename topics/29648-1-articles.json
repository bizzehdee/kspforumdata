If it faced the Sun with the same side all the time, there wouldn\u0027t really be much of weather at all. Just tremendous winds blowing along the surface across the day/night terminator. The sun-ward side would be close to 150\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C generating major thermal updrafts. Most of the water would be accumulated as mountains of ice on the night side. Liquid water would only exist underneath all that ice due to tremendous pressure. Atmosphere would be a mix of carbon dioxide and nitrogen and quite a bit thinner than it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the Earth really had zero angular momentum, then it would have a 1 year long day-night cycle. That wouldn\u0027t be quite as bad, but pretty close. The most interesting consequence is that you\u0027d have liquid water on the surface. Water released from melting ice on the \u0022morning side\u0022 would be blown to the day side by the aforementioned winds. Now, there is not enough energy in sun light released over the year to boil away all of that water. So the temperatures will only reach boiling in a very small region if at all. This means the temperatures well under 100\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 through most of the day side, and that means atmospheric pressure would probably be much closer to what we have now, with composition dominated by nitrogen gas. Water vapor carried by upper atmosphere to he night side would also form quite fantastic clouds and rather powerful blizzards once all that moisture is brought down. This I might actually call weather.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we can look at one more possibility. Suppose, Earth orbited a much colder Sun at such a close proximity that it had a \u0022year\u0022 that is comparable to our day in duration. Then it could have day-night cycle comparable to ours without rotating. Of course, this situation can\u0027t last very long, as an object orbiting that close to a star would quickly become tidally locked, but until that happens, such a planet would have weather patterns very similar to our own. The only effect that\u0027s missing is the Coriolis effect, and it\u0027s not that important for the weather. Mostly, you\u0027d lose prevailing winds. So no Westerlies or Trade winds. Coriolis effect also helps form cyclones. Note that we\u0027d still have these. We\u0027d just end up having about an equal number of clockwise and counter-clockwise cyclones in both hemispheres. That can lead to some interesting phenomena whenever two cyclones rotating in opposite directions would happen to collide. But otherwise, the weather would be much the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Note, I\u0027m not saying the climate would be the same. GROOV3ST3R\u0027s note is valid for that last scenario.

Such a planet would have a single Hadley cell per hemisphere in the north-south direction carrying the hot air that rises at the equator to the poles. The return flow of the cooler, denser air from the poles will cause the surface winds to go from pole to equator. Venus exhibits this effect due to its very slow rotation. On Earth, the air that rises at the equator does not make it all the way to the poles because the coriolis force breaks the meridional flow up into multiple Hadley cells, and we get the zonal surface winds shown in the diagram above.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-28T06:44:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2013 06:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed names\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WestAir","CreatedById":59115,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T06:01:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so I now have three people telling me that I\u0027m wrong.

On Earth at least, the one true source of the wind will always be the Sun. This is why you have a semi-permanent low pressure at the equator known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ICZ), where the southeasterly winds from the Tropic of Capricorn converge with the northeasterly winds from the Tropic of Cancer. Since Coriolis is strongest at the equator, this is where the cyclonic turning of pressure systems is going to be the strongest and most frequent, hence tropical storms, hurricanes, typhoons, etc. What direction does the tropics flow?

So, the poles are now covered by water/ice and the equator is now all bare land. This means the poles would be moderately warm (as the massive body of water would significantly moderate the temperature) with whipping winds always toward the direction of the sun-lit side of the planet (factoring in surface friction with topography, vegetation etc.).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003ESo, with all this given information, I think I can deduce some conclusions:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E1) Latitudes, in reference to a geographic equator, likely won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t matter to anyone anymore with regard to weather.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E2) I believe, one of the most notable differences would be, since the Sun has easterly ecliptic movement across celestial sphere, the Sun would appear to traverse the sky from west to east at about 1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 every 24 hours as perceived from any given point on the Earth\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface near the orbital plane.
