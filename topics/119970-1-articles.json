I turned on physics warp and let it climb to 500 Kelvin. Not super hot, but \u0022hot enough\u0022. The int flux value in the debug menu was 2.4 million. It took about 5 - 10 minutes to reach this temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I throttled down the engine to zero. The int flux went to zero (not negative?). I turned on 4x physics warp and left it for an hour. Cond flux was negative 740-odd during this phase. When I came back the part had only dropped 0.3 degrees. Now, that seems odd to me. That\u0027s essentially four hours passing in \u0022real time\u0022, and yet the engine has barely cooled down at all. Just from every day experience I think people would agree that doesn\u0027t seem right, think about your stovetop, your car engine, etc. Your car engine might get to ~400K and it\u0027s trapped in an enclosed space, but turn off your car (which will obviously also stop any active cooling from the radiator fan and pump) and it will probably drop 20 to 30 degrees in half an hour.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-02T16:07:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2015 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T16:11:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, if you change things without knowing what\u0027s going on it\u0027s going to do some odd things \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s all Dutch to me, but I do know this isn\u0027t suited to Support, moved to development discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T16:26:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure what you mean by \u0022without knowing what\u0027s going on\u0022. In the sense that I don\u0027t have the source code? True, no idea. In the sense that I understand that something 200 degrees above ambient should be radiating heat pretty damn quickly into the environment, and I\u0027ve done tertiary physics? That would be a different answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bumped the conductivity of both the engine and its parent up to 0.5. Now the cond flux of the engine went to about -35000 at ~500K. But the rate at which the temperature of the part increased did not noticeably change from the previous test, nor did the rate of heating change as the part temperature rose (rate of heating should have slowed as the temperature rose relative to its surroundings). Also curious is that conv flux was \u002B3 and rad flux was only -1. That\u0027 can\u0027t be right... the atmosphere should be convecting heat away rather a lot more than 1/10000th (and with the wrong sign?) as quickly as the connected part is conducting it away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo doubt the game is not modelling convection from air currents, such as wind (there isn\u0027t any!) or the movement of air generated by the hot part itself.
