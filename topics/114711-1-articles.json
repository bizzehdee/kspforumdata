I know I was. Why should we be limited to having our bases near ore? Well my friends, those scenarios are no longer a problem. Now you can build your bases on mountains, the ocean, or just hanging in the middle of the sky without being limited by the presence of ore! Once we decided to just slam all that silly mining stuff up into a plane, a whole new world opened up for potential base locations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is the single greatest idea ever green lit by the Kerbal engineers\u0022 -Bill Kerman probably\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis fully fueled and ore\u0027d 100 ton behemoth provides long range stable flight and the ability to convert ore into fuel or just carry ore back home. It also has a large cargo bay which allows you to add lights to the inside, making it pretty with various colors. It also comes equipped with a Mk3 to Mk2 adapter with fuel and a mainsail on that badboy, to allow for shorter take off during instances of runway scarcity. 6 large fuel cells and 8 large solar panels allow for maximum power generation to allow you to run drills and the ISRU converter simultaneously. Just be sure to land facing east or west to let your panels follow Kerbol all day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/2u7t5Lo.png\u0022 alt=\u00222u7t5Lo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few eagle eye\u0027d users might notice the location of the Narrow Band Scanner. Keep in mind to not have it active as you deploy your drills as it could make your flight suddenly \u0022interesting\u0022 by Firefly standards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally you can build that aircraft carrier for your ocean base so that you can land your brand new mining plane on it!
