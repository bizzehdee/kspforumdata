The face is on the Eastern slope of that hill, facing the canyon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you draw an imaginary line from the mouth of the canyon to the hill, the face is approximately somewhere along that line, about half way (ish) up that hill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The face is very small, it is object-sized, not mountain-sized. It is darkly colored. You\u0027re looking for a dark speck as you pan around. Just a speck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I think you have to actually be landed on the surface near it, and panning around with the camera, to be able to see it. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s visible from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
