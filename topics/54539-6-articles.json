The 13 ton payload capability is for LEO, which means that it\u0027s coming down, which means that you need to provide a controlled way for it to come down, which means that you need comms to tell it when to come down, a deorbit motor to bring it down, and attitude control to make sure it\u0027s pointing the right way when you fire the deorbit burn.

There are rules, regulations, approvals, licenses, as well as governments and corporations who have huge investments in space infrastructure. The ISS orbit for example is protected by international agreements. You don\u0027t get to approach it in any way without proper authorization and certification. GEO activities are governed by the International Telecommunication Union. Anything that goes up or comes down in the USA must meet FAA regulations.

Modifications will definitely be necessary, I mean the first modification we proposed was to strap a several ton, 56 million dollar rocket onto the back of it. And for another analogy, if our goal was to cross the English Channel in a bus, we would start by adding things boats need, like floats and a motor.

First off, I suspect that once the Falcon Heavy is available, launching a bus into a graveyard orbit would be feasible, allowing you to bill it as an Orbiting Time Capsule. In fact, you might be able to interest SpaceX into using your bus payload as a \u0022mass simulator\u0022 for an early Falcon Heavy test flight, a cheap ballast payload that simulates the mass of a normal spacecraft to confirm the booster\u0027s performance, but isn\u0027t anything to worry about if the booster blows up. (Normally, tanks of water are used as mass simulators, but anything heavy and nonvaluable can be used.) Indeed, that might get a reduced cost, since you\u0027d be providing them with a mass simulator without their having to pay to fabricate and fill water tanks, and they have to fly the launch anyway. But I wouldn\u0027t bet on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the reason that Reliant Robin Space Shuttle launch was permitted by the British government is that it was intended from the start to be a suborbital flight on a Ministry of Defence artillery firing range, where all the parts would come down in an existing impact area, so they wouldn\u0027t have to worry about liability (the maximum distance that it could fly even at the longest-range angle was less than the distance to the edge of the impact area), and closing the airspace over it was something routine. (Additionally, they already knew it was likely to fail; during the final prelaunch checks the night before, they found that there were wiring issues with the explosive bolts for jettisoning the external tank. They knew it was about a 50-50 chance of each of the two bolts firing correctly, making for about a 25% chance that it\u0027d jettison successfully, but they went ahead with launch anyway, partly because the drop-dead date for completing the filming in time to make air didn\u0027t allow the full day of rewiring needed, and partly because the BBC knew that even if it crashed, it\u0027d still make good TV.
