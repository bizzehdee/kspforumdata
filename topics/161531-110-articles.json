I really hope my performance improves vastly with KSP 1.1 and using Windows instead of Linux. I can\u0027t dock with my space station anymore since I am getting like 2 FPS but even worse is that the game timer is almost constantly red making it take like an hour to dock from 50 m away. I think my performance issues mostly stem from Linux and OpenGL.
