Work","CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-06T16:31:52Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-06T16:31:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game has become unplayable for me in its current state for the following reasons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLoss of control during flight while thrust is on.\u00A0 Gravity turns generally start at 100 m/s (turn to 80 degrees), then get a bit aggressive at 4000 meters altitude (turn to 65 degrees), and then get to about 45 degrees at around 15-20km above ground.\u00A0 During gravity turns, I\u0027m seeing uncontrollable spinning of the craft, which is a loss of control during flight.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLoss of control after killing thrust.\u00A0 There are times where you shut the throttle off and the craft starts to spin, slowly at first, but gradually getting faster and faster.\u00A0 And you cannot get control of the craft again.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Hold does not work.\u00A0 When you set a maneuver, you generally click the Node button to point your craft in the right direction for the burn.\u00A0 Unfortunately, when you start the burn, whether you hold the node or not, the craft starts to veer away from the node marker, pushing your trajectory into a direction you did not want it to go.\u00A0 This forces you to either:\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse multiple small burns, reorienting your craft every few seconds, which then leads to an undesired final trajectory; OR\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRevert to launch or your last save because you are unable to reorient your craft during the multiple small burns.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of these are included in the video below I made this morning.\u00A0 For posterity, the craft was a small HECS2 probe with an antenna and some solar panels on it, with fairing for aerodynamics and an asparagus-staged rocket to get into orbit and then, I hoped, to Duna.\u00A0 Unfortunately, due to all of the issues presented, I cannot even get into orbit with this craft.\u00A0 I also want to point out that I can take a similar build of this craft and not only get it into orbit in KSP1, but I can get it all the way into Duna orbit.\u00A0 With no problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, this is the #1 thing - apart from performance - that needs to be fixed in the first patch.\u00A0 I simply cannot play this game having to fight the flight controls the whole way, and I\u0027m not the only one experiencing this.\u00A0 Please, Devs, fix this.\u00A0 ASAP.\u00A0 When you are holding \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, the craft should not drift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv
