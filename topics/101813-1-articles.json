I hooked two engines up with two suggested nuclear power plants and built a huge lifter to test. In closed cycle mode at about 75k altitude, heading into orbit, the whole lifter just zoomed out of the camera range and was just a blue speck far in the distance...was this a glitch? I didnt get a chance to do a screenshot. It just accelerated away so fast, it was crazy... Just wondering. I can post some pictures of the lifter when I get home from work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I tried many times to get the engines to repeat the strange event, with no luck, I guess it was just a one time thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T12:24:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 12:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vixr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T20:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a glitch, unrelated to B9...
