And good games tend to provide plenty of entertainment in between the story/plot points. I would even go so far as to say that\u0027s a large part of what makes them good. If anything KSP and other sandboxey type games are proof of that - if what you can do is fascinating or entertaining enough in itself, you don\u0027t even need any story or game plot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea if Squad is like that though, never heard of it.
