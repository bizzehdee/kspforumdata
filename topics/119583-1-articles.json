It\u0027s an attempt to do \u003Cstrong\u003Eturn-based stealth\u003C/strong\u003E, and in my opinion, it succeeds spectacularly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to infiltrate various megacorporations and get out with enough technical capability to take on the Big Bad at the end of the game. And they made it so that getting detected is \u003Cstrong\u003Ebad\u003C/strong\u003E, but not \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe end\u003C/strong\u003E, so you always have room to make desperate strategies and try to get out alive even when it seems like all might be lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd in a constantly-rising alarm level (with rising risks along with it) and even though it\u0027s turn-based, you have a genuinely tense experience. Everything\u0027s mapped out and predictable, so that when you screw up, you have no one to blame but yourself; it\u0027s just how effectively you make plans and carry them out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t have much of a story/plot, but it\u0027s a strategy game, and (IMHO) as such doesn\u0027t really need one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t get enough of it.

I think that what they \u003Cstrong\u003Edid\u003C/strong\u003E include is evocative, intriguing, and really slick. I just mean to say that I don\u0027t think the game suffers for having a sketch of a story rather than something more detailed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for the sequel -- yes, please! (I didn\u0027t want to give any spoilers.) There\u0027s some DLC coming out in the fall, but as I understand it, it\u0027s going to cover events \u003Cstrong\u003Eprior to\u003C/strong\u003E what we see in the game we have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
