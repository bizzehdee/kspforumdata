It\u0027s flight is simple:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: turn on SAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: set engines to full\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: activate the engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: once liftoff is achieved, tip forward to start forward flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding is preformed simply by lowering the output of the engines a bit, and letting it slowly lower too the ground. Adjusting the thrust is how you control \u0022lift\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Sea Hoppers top stable flight speed is around 64m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurning is done by tipping the craft in the direction you want it to move. forwards, backwards, sideways, up, and down are all possible directions this craft can go. The left/right controls rotate the whole craft around it\u0027s center of mass. Up/Down, change it\u0027s direction forwards or backwards, and change the speed it travels in these directions. Roll is used to angle the craft so it can slide left and right without changing the direction it is facing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Sea Hopper can land and take off from water as easily as it does from land. It is highly recommended to reduce it\u0027s speed down to at most, 10 m/s while landing on water. ground landings can be survivable at speeds in excess of 20m/s if the craft is orintated horizontally. It can still be moving during landing but should be moving either forwards or backwards. Sideways motion during landing can be a bit dangerous with it\u0027s narrow landing gear and low ground clearance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tail on the craft is only for added roll stability so it has all other controls turned off. Also, the rear engine has it\u0027s thrust turned down so that the combined thrust of the three engines is perfectly aligned under the center of mass. note: the water picture was taken of the craft before I added the tail. In fact, that landing was why I added the tail, it helps measurably with keeping the craft stable during flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/seahopper2_zps5gen56yx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022seahopper2_zps5gen56yx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/seahopper3_zpsfvrdvzf5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022seahopper3_zpsfvrdvzf5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Sky Hopper MK.1 is the non-amphibious varient of the Sea Hopper. Without the \u0022floats\u0022, the craft is a bit lighter and a lot more maneuverable. This varient is a lot easier to land in those unusual spots where you normally wouldn\u0027t dare land an aircraft. The Sky Hopper has a more respectable stable top speed of around 93m/s. Both these craft have unusual aerodynamics that tend to pull the craft back to the vertical if too much aerodynamic force is applied too their frames aka: high speed dives. Their stability is pretty good for what they are, experimental craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/skyhopper1_zpsxsinejlv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022skyhopper1_zpsxsinejlv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth these two craft are experimental craft and are made for nothing more then to play around with vertical flight. I hope you also enjoy playing around with them. Be sure to try different engines, like the RamJet, on them to see how the craft responds to different amounts of thrust. And be sure to adjust the thrust limiter on the rear engine, when you change it out, so that the center of thrust is once again, directly under the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your really wanting to try something interesting. Try adding RSC to this craft, and some mono propellant tanks. It will increase the maneuverability of the craft greatly, possibly making it uncontrollable, but in the fun way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-24T19:21:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/24/2015 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-25T16:42:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey very nice.

That, and adding aerodynamic surfaces actually hiders it\u0027s flight performance, other then the single tail surface. You don\u0027t want anything wing like on a purely VTOL only craft like this.
