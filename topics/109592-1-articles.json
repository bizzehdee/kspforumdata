If I just click on a part as usual then immediately move my mouse off of it, I won\u0027t get the part. I have to leave my mouse hovering over it for about a second. It\u0027s not always like this though. This gets gradually worse after launching a few rockets.

I think there was something about the wasteHeat and those radiators.\n\nThe more radiators (from KSPI, not the 1.04 stocks) i added (to radiate WASTEHEAT), the more stuttering it became.\n\nSo, if you use them, just give it a try and save your craft without radiators and check again."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-16T18:13:13Z","Content":"Hey guys, I think I\u0027ve narrowed it down to one mod.  KIS. \n\nI removed a bunch of mods which add more complex functionality (ScanSat, Infernal Robotics and its extension packs, and USI mods).  (using CKAN to manage mods).  Then launched and reverted a 50 part stock craft 4 times and checked if the problem remained.  It was still there.  \n\nI then removed both KAS and KIS (as I suspected KIS might be the culprit).  With those two removed I was able to launch and revert the same craft over 10 times and there was no problem when selecting parts.  So I reinstalled the other mods and re-tested, without KAS and KIS the problem seems to have gone.\n\nI then installed a fresh copy of KSP (taking only my settings.cfg from my current install and the craft I\u0027d been testing with) and installed just KIS.  After reverting the craft 4 times the delay in response to a click on the part list was back.  \n\nKIS being the problem makes sense as it adds functionality to the parts list (so you can drag parts into part inventories).  I\u0027ll go and report my findings on the KIS thread in a bit.  Would be helpful if you guys could also test if having just KIS installed is sufficient to replicate the problem.\n\n[@Speadge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145302-speadge/) I don\u0027t have interstellar in my setup so I\u0027ve not tried that.  Maybe both KIS and interstellar use a common component that causes this?
