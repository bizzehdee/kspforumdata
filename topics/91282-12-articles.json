A planet composed largely of volatlie matter ( given that everythig is volatile at some point) but some molecules will vaporize lower the density of the atmospere by thermal expansion which can be blown away. I suspect when they say blown away they mean a combination of thermal degassing reducing the planet to a rocky fraction of itself, alterations of it orbit due to the loss of mass in the central mass, and destabilzation of the orbit by a gravitational wave as well as kinetic effects of the blast. The fact the see neutron stars in orbit of each other suggest something can survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI forgot to add that as neutron stars collapse thier surface angular momentum can be partially brought tobthe new surafce, this can cause them to spin rapidly creating a pulsar, this can have a very disruptive effect on nearby matter, as it is essentially a high potential thermal osscilator.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T09:11:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 09:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T09:49:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the bit of ocean called in between the KSC and the Island runway?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T14:09:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022this time you failed to take off\u0022, it could at least ; ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(may be a little wood panel at the very end of the runaway close to the shore could be added just for fun ; )\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/panneau-routier-en-bois-tr%C3%A8s-vieux-de-fl%C3%A8ches-34472098.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/panneau-routier-en-bois-tr%C3%A8s-vieux-de-fl%C3%A8ches-34472098.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T14:11:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 02:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T14:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/new-spectroscopy-technique-provides-unprecedented-insights-about-the-reactions-powering-fuel-cells\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/new-spectroscopy-technique-provides-unprecedented-insights-about-the-reactions-powering-fuel-cells\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bigger problem is converting electricity into power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/new-technology-halves-cost-lithium-ion-batteries/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/new-technology-halves-cost-lithium-ion-batteries/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like an exaggeration, what they need is a new lithium Ion battery that is almost efficient but uses less lithium and uses more cheaper materials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise what we need is a cheaper way to extract lithium from Sea Water.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T14:58:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 02:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T20:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.)
