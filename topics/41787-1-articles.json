The anti-target marker looks like a triangle cross-hairs. It\u0027s useful to understand when you burn your engines, you are going to \u0022pull\u0022 your prograde marker toward where you\u0027re pointing and \u0022push\u0022 your retrograde marker away from where you\u0027re pointing. To rendezvous:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) First get an intercept to within 20 km or so. To do this, first get into an orbit that is the same as your target\u0027s, most importantly with the same orbital inclination. Then, if your target is \u0022ahead\u0022 (counter-clockwise) of you, you need to go faster to catch up, so lower one side of your orbit slightly. Conversely, if your target is behind you, raise one side slightly. You\u0027re looking to get those closest approach markers to within 20km. It might take a few orbits, but you\u0027ll get there. Be careful not to dip into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Once you\u0027ve approached within 20 km or so, make sure your NavBall is in target mode and check your relative speed. I use the 100x rule as well, so relative speed at 20km should be 200 m/s. If you\u0027re going too slow, you should point near prograde to speed up and if you\u0027re going too fast you should point near retrograde to slow down. Note that after you establish the initial speed, you\u0027ll probably be slowing down for the rest of the approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) What you want to do is either \u0022pull\u0022 your prograde marker onto the pro-target marker or \u0022push\u0022 your retrograde marker onto the anti-target marker. You\u0027ll have to continuously adjust as you approach because orbits are round.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If you get going too fast or the rendezvous gets out of control, just point directly at your retrograde marker and fire your engines until your target relative velocity is zero.
