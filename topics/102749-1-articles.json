(Image that with less drag you will open it at faster speed i.e. on Duna deorbit)\n\nAnd for you guys, what do you think? A sort of \u0022lite\u0022 version of Real Chute would be nice in stock game?"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T23:10:35Z","Content":"Agreed. The parachute in v0.7.3 opened more smoothly and realistically than they do now, but even so it was still rather sudden.\n\n(Incidentally the parachute in v0.7.3 is one of two original parts which still look the same. The other is the AV-R8 winglet. I\u0027m a bit of an expert on things like that, see my signature.)"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T01:43:41Z","Content":"The existing parachute module can do this, I\u0027m not sure why it isn\u0027t used, or rather, why its value is set so high\n\nIf you want to test this for yourself you can go into your parachute configs and change deploymentSpeed = 1 to deploymentSpeed = 0.01 [Or get the [SlowChutes MM patch](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103348)]"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T02:51:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The existing parachute module can do this, I\u0027m not sure why it isn\u0027t used, or rather, why its value is set so high\n\u003E If you want to test this for yourself you can go into your parachute configs and change deploymentSpeed = 1 to deploymentSpeed = 0.01 [Or get the [SlowChutes MM patch](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103348)]\n\n...and here I thought it hadn\u0027t been fixed because it required more than ten minutes of development time."},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T03:04:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...and here I thought it hadn\u0027t been fixed because it required more than ten minutes of development time.\n\nIt\u0027s possible that neither the parachute parts nor the module{} have been looked at since 0.16\n\nHopefully they\u0027re part of the aero/balance review that\u0027s currently happening"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T06:56:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...and here I thought it hadn\u0027t been fixed because it required more than ten minutes of development time.\n\nExactly, it\u0027s a shame that Squad is looking every time on new feauture but never re-do the old one since they think that if it was good 2 yrs ago it\u0027s still good"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T07:13:42Z","Content":"Stock EVA parachutes would also be nice to see.
