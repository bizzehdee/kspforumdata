I disable the front wheel motors and use S to put reverse power to the rear motors to control speed going downhill. If I could siable the front wheel brakes I could use them to stop without flipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven better would be setting the wheel motors to unidirectional. Set the front wheels to only work going forward and the back ones to only work going in reverse. That would prevent popping wheelies and flipping in either direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
