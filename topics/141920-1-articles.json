I\u0027m not suggesting a new KSC on the mun or wherever. Whatever it could be, it shouldn\u0027t make the game easier.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI want hotspots on any terrestial body other then kerbin. A area where you would want to visit, besides the currently existing monoliths. Add more of those through modding.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr create ancients alien ruins. I think the mun would be the best target as it\u0027s closest to home. but Duna would be a good candidate to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it\u0027s possible to even create something like a cave. Maybe one hotspot per Biome for the mun, so you\u0027ll be wired and motivated to visit every place on the Munar surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe add traps on the munar sites or on any other world, or extraterrestial spots where you can use your rod to go ice fishing on the poles of the Mun or Duna. Beware, you may catch the kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake the hotspot more beautifull with textures that accomodate the area.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEventually such spots would look based on the creativity of the modder, but besides there being any spirit for the idea at all, maybe other users can share ideas about what to add and what world would be best suited. I leave the imagination to myself and everybody else.
