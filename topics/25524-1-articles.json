This thread is to share your fun stories of some crafts that you had to do trial/error in order for it to function. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had the hardest time building a ship that could get me to the Mun. I finally got it but landing was easy task. From numerous of quicksaves i finally landed on the mun with my lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img62/9524/screenshot6j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot6j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then Tried to attach my own version of a rover for him to ride around. Not the prettiest thing but it was fun making it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img12/1919/screenshot7ih.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot7ih.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think this thread shouldn\u0027t be here or is annoying then sorry for wasting your time. But as a newbie to the forum and Ksp I just wanted to throw in my look at it through how much fun the game gives us.

It has an orbiter section and a lander section, and I could dock as many of the fuel tank segments as it needed for the current target destination. But it turned out it was completely unsteerable with the engines at the front in a puller configuration, but I couldn\u0027t dock the fuel tanks to the orbiter part of the probe at the front because the strain would crush it. So my solution was to turn the engines backwards, launch it, turn it around, \u0022control from here\u0022 the formerly-back-facing docking ring, and add the fuel tanks. It wasn\u0027t easy to fly, but it successful put a lander/orbiter team of probes around every world. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ignition","CreatedById":60982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T23:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy longest running project:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i291.photobucket.com/albums/ll309/terryabrahamson/KerblantisSTSTakeoff2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KerblantisSTSTakeoff2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve forgotten how many hours and weekends of testing and prototyping...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo many, but its been worth it no doubt.
