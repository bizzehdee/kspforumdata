The way that system will work, when colonies are in place, is I can set up a colony using prefabricated parts I\u0027ve brought to a site on a vehicle, and then the colony can bootstrap itself by constructing its own vehicles, including resource-extraction rovers. I can automate those missions: I can drive a resource extractor out to a resource deposit, drill for it, extract it, drive it back, and then turn that into a repeating delivery so that I\u0027d continue to receive that resource over time. The colony gets the ability to utilize those resources to expand itself. Then the delivery route system does something even cooler: you can automate the transportation of resources from one colony to another colony. Once you have that capability you can set up orbital colonies that are functionally hubs, to which you\u0027re ferrying resources from multiple star systems, even. It almost becomes like you\u0027re building a trade network. That\u0027s pretty exciting for me. Maybe most importantly, colonies are pretty fun to build. It\u0027s still Kerbal, right? If you build a tower too tall, it\u0027s still physical\u2014it\u0027ll fall over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stage after colonies is \u003Cstrong\u003Einterstellar travel\u003C/strong\u003E. That order makes sense, because you\u0027ll essentially have to have colonies to construct the massive vehicles needed to go interstellar. You\u0027ll need to build interstellar ships in orbit, and they\u0027ll be much more complicated than the ships needed to reach the Mun or another planet in the Kerbol system. Simpson mentioned the \u0022mothership concept\u0022 as an example: building multiple landers and attaching them to a larger vessel, which has to travel vast distances over a period of years and years. This will require a new scale of parts not available at the start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Debdeb system is the first (and so far only named) star system that\u0027ll be added to KSP2 as interstellar travel enters the game. And then, finally, we\u0027ll get multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce interstellar travel is in place, KSP2 will have the \u0022fundamental underpinnings for our complete career-equivalent mode,\u0022 Simpson says, which is now called \u003Cstrong\u003Eexploration mode\u003C/strong\u003E. Currency is out, and resources are in\u2014the key driving force for exploration campaigns will be the resources you collect and transport between colonies and use to build new vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EThe mature game involves a lot of locating, extracting, processing resources at colonies, which then unlocks new capabilities\u003C/strong\u003E,\u0022 Simpson says. \u0022New resources can be used to develop new kinds of technology. Then there will be a delivery route system.\u003Cstrong\u003E Once we have all those things together we\u0027re going to wrap it up with a nice big bow and deliver multiplayer\u003C/strong\u003E, which I think a lot of us are very eager to experience.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-17T22:49:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2022 10:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Vl3d\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-17T22:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProof of function delivery system was confirmed.

But on the off chance that you really want to like this game and you are willing to look at the game to decide whether you like it or not, this forum has lots of photo and video evidence of work that the team has done beyond UI.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can check the Show and Tell and Dev Diaries subforms (within the KSP 2 section that this subform is in) to see some examples of this. The UI has indeed ben overhauled in all scenes, from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E to flight to map mode, but there is a lot more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe physics and collisions systems have also been overhauled, making collisions consistent even at very high speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe terrain, atmospheric, and other visual systems have also been revamped, bringing KSP 2\u0027s base visuals up to par with visual mods, and implementing technical features that enable modders to make the next generation of visual mods even more spectacular.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA plethora of new parts, many procedural, have been added which will make building and flying craft much nicer, even without the UI improvements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are tired of the bugs and annoyances that KSP 1 is filled with, KSP 2 has already shown that it fixes many of those - something that I would pay for on that fulfilled promise alone. The remaining ones, such as kraken attacks and lag, are either not provable until we get our hands on the game (I haven\u0027t seen any unintended behavior yet, so I\u0027ll have to test it for myself) or not able to be determined at this stage in development.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of that is at release. If that is not enough for you that is fine. But, if you are making your decision based on the assumption that the remaining features will take decades or more to implement, then I would advise you to look at some of the evidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, we have been shown assets for interstellar scale parts, along with related engine effects and interaction with other parts. We have also seen assets for other star systems, which pretty much means they are done since the planets don\u0027t have complex machinery going on in them. And we have seen assets for colony parts, including animation for a crane part that could be scrapped by now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that visual evidence, members of the team talking about progress on the game have mentioned that multiplayer has been working in various states for a while now, and have talked about testing various systems that are not there on release. You might wonder, \u0022if the assets and coding for these systems are done, why not release them right away?\u0022 Well, once again there is evidence to help inform our decisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe conclusion I\u0027ve reached is that these systems are not done, mostly because of a few lines in the latest feature video. The team needs more time to focus on polishing individual sections rather than releasing all of it in an unbalanced mess. We have seen they have the assets, we can be reasonably certain the technical foundations for multiplayer are there, the only thing left is optimizing and balancing the half-finished systems. Coding takes a long time, but certainly not decades long from this point in development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-20T01:47:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224200615\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210669\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221668902668\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe conclusion I\u0027ve reached is that these systems are not done, mostly because of a few lines in the latest feature video.
