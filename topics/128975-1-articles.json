In that time it will rotate once around its own axis. In one complete rotation you will pass under your mothership\u0027s orbit exactly twice. However that does not mean that at that exact moment your ship will actually be directly overhead, it might be on the other side.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour mothership being on the other side does not need to mean you can not launch and rendezvous. Simply launch when you pass underneath the orbital path, make sure you launch in the correct direction. You do not want to orbit at 180degrees with your target.
