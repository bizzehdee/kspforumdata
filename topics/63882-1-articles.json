What would be an estimated optimal value for that? The Craft to bring to orbit is around 8t(without any tanks or engines, there is a decoupler so it can be picked up by a transfer craft), so my lander is in the multiple 1000 tonnes class if it matters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreetings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBen\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T14:50:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb displays dV relative to Kerbin.

I have a TWR of 1.9 - ~2.1 on each stage on kerbin, so 1,1 - ~1,25 on eve. I have a total of 12800 atmospheric deltav.
