Here is the information he provided (I took some notes, but I apologize if my posting ends up a bit disjointed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter explaining our goal to him, Luis surprised me by stating that he had actually been quietly working on the preparatory stages of a project such as this for some time. He knew that he didn\u0027t have a chance at getting the funding for an ISS mission so it had mostly been just a thought exercise. He is quite enthusiastic about trying to help out with this project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, we had asked him about what model species of moss was used as the model species. He provided me with three.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArabidopsis Thaliana - Actual Model species, 2nd choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhyscomitrella Patens - Actual Model species, 1st choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECeratodon Purpureus - On the verge of becoming a model species within the next several years, 3rd choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt a base level (before any modification to the strain) the Purpureus tends to grow faster and with more extreme gravitometric responses (it grows with relation to gravity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, one thing Luis brought up that was quite fascinating was that in all three of the above species it is possible to quickly selectively breed for mutations in the mosses gravitometric response. In effect three different strains can be created. One that grows upwards away from gravity, one that grows downwards towards gravity, and one that tends not to react to gravities presence at all. There was a scientist that had put work on the space shuttles way back utilizing these mutations before, but they had not done \u0026gt;0 gravity experiments with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith these mosses it is possible to visually determine a lot about the characteristics of the mosses growth as the features are large enough that for the basic level of detail we only need a microscope with a 5-10x zoom lens. If we want to look within the cells themselves we would need something more powerful (I failed to write this one down but I think it was on the order of 25-50x zoom, could be wrong though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally Luis informed me that with respect to gravitometric responses it has been known that mosses are more heavily influenced by gravity (in terms of growth patterns and such) when they do NOT have access to sunlight. I believe the theory is that in darkness the moss assumes it has been covered in dirt and so it relies upon its gravity sensing in the hopes of growing towards light. In absence of sunlight the moss can break down sucrose to produce energy, though in an interesting turn of events, for this method of growth the moss tends to burn oxygen and not carbon dioxide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuis recommends that the experiment take place in a dark enclosed environment where we either use IR LEDs for light (we can remove the IR filter off a webcam or normal camera in order to see these wavelengths. It is a hack I\u0027ve done before that makes for an interesting set of night vision cameras) as the infrared light is largely ignored by the plants, or we can turn on normal light whenever taking images. Leaving the growth chamber enclosed in darkness simplifies a lot for us as we no longer need to worry about the exposure to direct sunlight or hatch covers, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe had asked about text and such dealing with similar experiments and he was able to provide me with these two links. He is able to provide us with PDF extracts from those locations if we require.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17080959\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17080959\u003C/a\u003E \u0022Agravitropic mutants of the moss Ceratodon Purpureus do not complement mutants having a reversed gravitropic response.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15660206\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15660206\u003C/a\u003E \u0022Gravitropic moss cells default to spiral growth on the clinostat and in microgravity during spaceflight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we cannot recover the samples, he recommends that our sensors focus on the following: Humidity, temperature, gasses (O2 and CO2 primarily, but if the sensor can detect others, so much the better), and visual (camera/microscope).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the issues we had all been worried about was of the moss eating away the atmosphere and starving/poisoning itself to death. However, with the samples in question (they are quite small) with the volume that he showed me in the enclosed petri dishes (think maybe 1.5-2.0 times as long as a quarter and 5-10 mm thick) the sample has enough air to live and grow for 2-3 weeks. Given that our flight window is a somewhat unreliable 1-6 weeks and that we may have the sample dishes open to a common atmosphere of \u0022large\u0022, we probably don\u0027t actually need to care about providing a system for controlling the air quality unless we really want to. Additionally through the use of a mesh netting referred to as a phytoagar keeping the samples moist will likely not be a problem as well. The phytoagar allows the free flow of air, but effectively prevents the passage of moisture. If the moss samples were to start with some water and the phytoagar started wet, we likely would not need to worry about watering the moss over our mission time. Providing sucrose to the moss in the required amounts for our mission time is similarly easy (just a matter of how much we stick on any dish). So really all we have to worry about for the most part is keeping the temperature stable to something roughly approximating room temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we talked, Luis brought up something that I thought was a pretty excellent break for us if we decide to go with the moss route. As soon as we have a mockup growth chamber (sealed environment, dark, IR lighting, etc) he can provide me (for free) samples to begin growing in the controlled environment here on Earth for test purposes. The moment we begin performing tests like this, he can take that data to his contacts at NASA and believes strongly that he would be able to obtain funding to have at least one grad student working full time on engineering specific strains of the mosses in question for our experiment specifically. So we would be able to launch with multiple strains of heavily selected gravitometric responses (up, down, doesn\u0027t care). These strains would also have a measured history of how they normally perform in an Earth based gravity environment. These strains, the dishes, and other plant gear (phytoagar, sucrose, etc) would likely be able to be provided to the project free or at heavily discounted rates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing he brought up that we may want to do, is see if it is possible for us to try and determine at what G level the gravitometric responses of the moss kicks in. This is actually pretty important data as quite a few plants grow away from gravity rather than specifically toward sunlight. If we can determine at what G level is required before the moss \u0027knows\u0027 which way is up/down this can be applied towards other plants and would allow NASA and others data on conditions they will have to plan for. Imagine if it turns out that the gravity of the moon is insufficient for plants to determine a growth direction (thought to be unlikely), this would have some interesting problems for any colony that is trying to build up there. This experiment for the most part is an extension of the idea that we first spin up to Moon gravity, then spin up to Mars gravity. We would just operate perhaps a bit slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, something that he brought up as an interesting experiment to try if we end up having the ability to do so, but is sort of on the low side of the list considering what could be the difficulties in doing so with a 1U cubesat. Venting the atmosphere, letting it sit for several days or so, then putting back in an atmosphere and moisture to see if the moss will continue to germinate. The reason he brings this up is that at some point a creature he referred to as a mossbear (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade\u003C/a\u003E) was exposed to the vacuum and radiation of space for several days and survived quite happily. Mossbears tend to eat mosses like our samples. Considering the very basic needs of mosses, if we could prove that mosses (to some extent) can survive the rigors of empty space just as the mossbear did, then it is possible to provide a bit more data to the Panspermia theory (that life on Earth or elsewhere may have been seeded by a minute amount of living matter from another planet). Effectively if you managed to have a rock with some hibernating moss and mossbears touch down on a planet that can support them to some extent, then you have a self-sustaining ecosystem in the making.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuite a lot of info!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally my vote lies with the moss considering everything we can leverage through Luis\u0027 lab and also the ease of use (we effectively only need to control the temperature, which we were already going to be doing). For those that may dislike not having a view outside the cubesat for pictures, we can always put a webcam on the hull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anybody has any further questions for me to pass towards Luis, let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Creature","CreatedById":106457,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T15:06:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty amazing.
