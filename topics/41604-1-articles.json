All it does is add a bunch of tools while creating ships(like what you need here: TAB switches between symmetry modes of VAB and SPH). Basically more symmetry options, ability to place anything attached radially(toggled option, so you can simply disable it when not needed).

There\u0027s probably a simple edit you can do to the craft file to fix this but I\u0027ve never bothered. Just leave the SPH, go to the VAB, and the ship should still be standing there ready to edit. If not, load its file.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
