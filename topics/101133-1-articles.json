Lately I\u0027m missing a lot of notification emails from thread I\u0027m subscribed. You know, the email you get when there\u0027s a new post or even PM. I get them most of the time, but sometimes I just don\u0027t.\n\nI was wondering if it\u0027s just me or this happens to everybody?"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T10:03:25Z","Content":"Nope, works for me. Try PM\u0027ing yourself."},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T14:34:23Z","Content":"Hm. You might want to check your settings for the thread.\n\nI know I\u0027ve stopped receiving emails for the number war (thank kraken!), but I don\u0027t know what happened."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T14:58:38Z","Content":"My subscriptions mess up from time to time, too. Not sure what causes it, but it is frustrating as I rely on them heavily to keep up with threads in which I\u0027m interested. As a workaround I check my list of subscribed threads and see which ones have updated since last I was online; it\u0027s imperfect but better than nothing."},{"CreatedByName":"TaranisElsu","CreatedById":57742,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T03:02:38Z","Content":"I have also experienced this. Some of the threads that I am subscribed to get changed to a Subscription Type of \u0022None\u0022 instead of Daily. Clicking \u0022Thread Tools\u0022 at the top of the thread shows me as subscribed, i.e. only gives the option to unsubscribe, but when I go to Settings-\u003ESubscriptions, the type is wrong. I have fixed it several times, but it changes a seemingly random amount of time later. This has happened multiple times, and on multiple threads.\n\nThis is really frustrating because I rely on the daily e-mails to keep up with my mod threads, like [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40667-TAC-Life-Support](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40667-TAC-Life-Support)."}]}
