One of the more interesting parts coming up is the Claw, a part that allows us to \u0022dock\u0022 with docking-port-free objects like asteroids, but also other craft. I fully recognize its function, necessity and general coolness. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, one of the features of the claw does make me a bit concerned: the fuel transfer thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a game standpoint it follows quite naturally: Fuel can be transferred from any two tanks in the same craft, when two craft dock they merge into one craft, and as the Claw allows us to \u0022dock\u0022 this follows. This creates a few issues/raises some questions in my opinion. The way I see it, these issues/questions can be grouped into two categories: gameplay and realism. From the realism perspective you have the fact that having a grappling object that grapples onto another crafts\u0027 fuel tank, punctures it and sucks the fuel out seems unrealistic. The importance of realism varies from person to person, so the importance/validity of this complaint is subjective. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion the more important question has to do with gameplay balance. Does The Claw render docking ports obsolete? Is it overpowered? I personally subscribe to the idea that any part that is significantly superior to similar parts in a certain way should be countered by being significantly worse in another way. For example, The Claw could be excessively heavy (say 10 to 20 times heavier) compared to the regular docking ports, be exclusively radial attached, require large amounts of power, be fragile, have no docking magnetism, be highly asymmetrical, or a combination of some or all of these flaws. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis line of thinking got me to look at the way fuel transfer works in KSP at the moment. The fact is that if you have a craft with a fuel tank attached to an I-beam attached to another fuel tank, then the transfer between the tanks works perfectly fine, despite it having to go through a solid block of metal with no transfer capability. I would like to see this system altered. What I propose is a different type of fuel line. The regular fuel line is directional, indicating to an engine that it needs to take fuel from a tank not stacked on top of it. This new fuel line would be a \u0022transfer fuel line, imagine it looking like the regular fuel line but a different colour and without the arrows on. In the previous example of TankA=\u0026gt;I-beam=\u0026gt;TankB, placing the \u0022transfer\u0022 line on TankA and attaching it to TankB would allow fuel transfer between the two, but not act like a regular line otherwise. So if we had Engine=\u0026gt;TankA=\u0026gt;I-beam=\u0026gt;TankB with a transfer line between the tanks, then the engine wouldn\u0027t use fuel from TankB unless there was a yellow fuel line as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it, this would only have an effect with regards to using parts that can\u0027t let fuel flow pass, like I-beams, structural panels and the like, but could also mean that we could have a Claw that could attach and \u0022merge\u0022 with a craft, but not siphon off its fuel, which I think would be a good alternative to what we are expecting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T15:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am also concerned what will the Claw do with fuel transfer, but in a different way.

Arguments like this which aim to dance around the core issue by making excuses like \u0022Well just use your imagination\u0022. Erm, no. KSP is a product. It\u0027s a game specifically, i.e. something designed for escapism. Why in hell should any reasonable person have to put effort into maintaining the illusion?

There\u0027s something to be said for robust code. It seems to me that this whole Claw debacle smacks of either laziness or poor object design (in a programming sense). Seriously it just seems like they took the docking port code and added surface attachment behaviour. For gods sake, KAS has a much more reasonable grappler, and it\u0027s made by a fan! I ranted about this in the latest asteroid article comments so I wont go on.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s a bit premature to call it a \u0022debacle\u0022. I\u0027m inclined to at least wait and see how it\u0027s actually implemented before criticizing it too harshly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is unusual in that it doesn\u0027t fit any of the \u0022standard\u0022 game types very well. If Squad was making a first person shooter, for example, there are many existing examples of that sort of game with varying features, and players\u0027 expectations of how those games should work are pretty clearly defined. A sandbox spacecraft building game is different; there\u0027s no modern precedent to compare it to, and players\u0027 expectations of how things should work vary greatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has evolved as it has developed, sometimes in directions that I suspect the developers hadn\u0027t imagined or planned for. And they\u0027ve had to wrestle the Unity engine into performing in a style of game which I think the engine\u0027s designers hadn\u0027t anticipated (distances in gigameters!?). So I think we should cut them a bit of slack if their early release versions aren\u0027t as polished or perfect as we wish they were. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that\u0027s not to say that they\u0027re above criticism, or that we should hold back negative feedback when part of the game doesn\u0027t work well or the way we think it should. That\u0027s part of the deal with early release software. But accusing the devs of laziness or bad programming practices without evidence is poor form, and is likely to get your suggestions ignored.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T23:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dodgey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dodgey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk.
