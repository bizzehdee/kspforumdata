Its awesome that you came to join us! You\u0027ll be visiting every planet in one launch with your eyes closed before you know it. As for your parachute, you could try falling without it for a while, then deploy it once the air has slowed you down enough. That should keep it from getting messed up.

I will give you some useful advice that took me a really long time to figure out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA. In the bottom right of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E screen (at least on computer version) is the staging. It goes from bottom to top and you can drag its components\u00A0around to change the staging order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB. When you are at a maneuver, start the burn at half of the predicted burn time\u00A0from the point at which your maneuver is scheduled. Like if it says it should take 22 seconds, start the burn 11 seconds before the maneuver says to start. That way the burn is centred on its scheduled time and is about the most accurate (since the mass of the ship changes as fuel is burnt and leaves it, it\u0027s not 100% exact, but whatever).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC.
