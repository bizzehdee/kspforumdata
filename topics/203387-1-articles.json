I would like to have\u00A0 Day-1 mods available for KSP 2 skyboxes. I need to know the supported and preferred formats\u00A0 of the skyboxes in KSP 2. I assume that the home solar system has a set skybox which I would like to replace directly. And\u00A0 there are other (maybe infinite) solar systems with different skyboxes. My plan is create a milky way skybox for the Kerbin system and then generate skyboxes for other systems based upon their proximity to the Kerbin system and each other, thus creating a cohesive galactic sky-map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-27T22:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think multiple skyboxes make sense. It\u0027d be a pain to blend them as you travel from one star system to another. It seems far more likely that there would be a single sky box with \u0022distant\u0022 stars/galaxies painted into it and any of the reachable stars, which are the only ones that would likely have appreciable parallax, be rendered directly - similar to how moons and planets are handled in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is, potentially, a world where skybox is generated procedurally by rendering all the stars from a database. That can be split between frames to keep cost to an absolute minimum while still providing realistic parallax and giving a bit more room to expanding the star systems in the future, but it seems unlikely that it\u0027d be considered worth the trouble, so my money would still be on a single skybox texture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that, so long as you keep your work in a lossless format, I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll have trouble converting it. Just make sure it has high enough resolution. Something that looks good in 4K at 60\u00B0FoV should be sufficient. So I would keep your source work for the cube map as six 4096x4096 textures, and if the actual cube map will end up a bit smaller in resolution, you\u0027ll be able to downsample to whatever the game actually expects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jack Mcslay","CreatedById":208257,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-29T18:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone were to mod in wormholes to very distant stars additional skyboxes makes perfect sense. Also, I think it would be neat if nearby stars are to be implemented using particles and have the skybox only deal with the galactic ring. It would look far better, specially if there are individually flickering stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-29T18:33:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2021 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Jack Mcslay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
