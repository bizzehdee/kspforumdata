I\u0027m really not surprised that things explode. Even without large structures docked together with KAS attachments or clamp-o-trons, things can twitch and shudder quite violently when coming out of timewarp - even more so if they\u0027re landed. This seems to increase exponentially the larger the structures get. The physics engine needs time to settle things down after unpacking, BEFORE something new gets spawned and docked onto it all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny time I let EL cancel timewarp, or do it myself just a little too late and it constructs the new craft while things are jerking about, I seem to have a good 50% chance of my whole damn base exploding as soon as I release the craft. But if I slow it down early and wait out the last 20 seconds at 1x, I have yet to have any issues. Except, paradoxically, with constructing very light items on an orbital dock, such as lone KAS containers full of goodies - they apparently count as slightly too close to the dock, and on release, they spontaneously combust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaniwha: With progressive builds enabled, would it be very difficult to add one more button click between completion and the actual construction of the craft? So, when the last .01 rocket part is consumed, it kills timewarp - but intead of instantly trying to assemble the project, the \u0022pause build\u0022 button becomes a \u0022Finish Assembly\u0022 button, which can only be clicked when at 1x time and the situation is stable (like, you can right click on solar panels and extend/retract them - which you can\u0027t do in the first few seconds after exiting timewarp). I believe this would significantly reduce the frequency and severity of problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to comment on Rocket Parts as a resource. I think they should stay. You don\u0027t assemble a ship out of raw metal, after all - nor do you hand-craft every screw, washer, panel, and hose. Many common components and materials are mass-produced, and then processed further into specific part designs, and I think RP are a good representation of that intermediate stage. The way I see it, the Kerbals working in the workshop are turning the common, mass-produced components, sheet metal, plastic, wire, transistors (or perhaps vacuum tubes?!), and so on into the actual \u0022parts\u0022 (in the KSP VAB sense) used in whatever is being built, and then, finally, assembling those parts into the complete ship out on the launchpad or construction dock (That\u0027s the step I suggested adding the new button for).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone: One thing I\u0027ve discovered is that it really helps to keep the bottom-most collidable component of whatever you\u0027re building separated from the launchpad or construction dock using pre-extended landing legs, ladders, even antennas, or rover wheels. All of the above shift the \u0022bottom\u0022 of the craft down below the real \u0022solid\u0022 parts of it, making sure (okay, 99%) that they don\u0027t clip into the dock/pad and explode when released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally: Hooray for launching half a dozen small lander-probes from Ike and setting them down on Duna, each one leaving a tiny sub-probe in orbit, then raining them down for massive seismometer science points.

Maybe it\u0027s the edge of the big impact crater?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d honestly prefer the extra button-pushing to having it spawn automatically - what if I\u0027d switched from the base to something else in the area while waiting for it to finish, and was in the middle of hovering some previously built heavy station module into position, and suddenly my computer (already getting only a couple FPS at that base shown in those pictures) freezes up to spawn the next thing, or the appearance of it causes the pad to shift and make the base jitter, or... who knows what could go wrong?

And you could always add a config option to use or not use the extra button. Yeah, I know, it\u0027s more work for what might not seem like much of an improvement. It\u0027s up to you, of course. But I, for one, would really appreciate that option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually did get my whole base exploding once* tonight even though I\u0027d slowed it down half a minute before the craft spawned, on one of my tiny little lander probes even. I think I may have clicked \u0022release\u0022 too soon, though. And like I mentioned, my old Core 2 Duo is only giving me a scant few frames per second at that base. The transition when those landers launch and get past the 2.3km mark is startling - it feels like suddenly zipping to 10x timewarp. I\u0027ve seriously overshot my intended AP at least twice because of that transition. XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(* So far I\u0027ve had two, maybe three base explosions, promptly quickloading, for some eleven successful builds there - mostly shooting off those science lander probes. Amazingly, I built the pictured 18\u002B ton smelter module on that pad with no problems.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest advice: Pause build, quicksave, resume. Do it before starting, do it near the end (around 2/3 to 80% depending on how long a build it is), then do it again with 2-5 rocket parts left to consume. Don\u0027t leave the scene with it running and expect it to be done when you return (if it is, it\u0027ll try to spawn instantly, while the scene is still unstable). Don\u0027t leave the area while anything is on the pad un-released (I\u0027ve had it \u0022lose\u0022 the unreleased craft and the pad stop responding several times while testing various things). If you have to leave the scene, pause build first. Try not to let TAC Fuel Balancer or Kethane processing or anything else cram resources into the \u0022docked ship\u0022 before hitting release, the CoM shifts might throw things off. And don\u0027t forget the landing legs, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just thought of a really good reason to have that extra button. Hypothetical yet very plausible situation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just completed a build and released it. Craft is sitting on the pad just fine. Before taking control of it I start a new build (I know I just said don\u0027t do that, but ideally this is something you\u0027d want to be able to leave running in the background). Then I switch to it and take off. Before the next point at which the game can write the persistence file, KSP crashes. I get fed up and go to bed. The next day I come back and head to the VAB to design something new, entirely forgetting about the ship I\u0027d queued up.
