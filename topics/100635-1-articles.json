Rebels have risen and have seized much of the world. If left unchecked, the rebels will cause anarchy and the collapse of the government. The government has enlisted the help of the Kerbal Space Program to aid in the war. KSP was reluctant to join until the rebels blew KSP\u0027s main orbital station out of the sky and sending it hurdling into a city, killing hundreds of innocent citizens. KSP has decided to begin a weapon construction program. KSP is also devoting much of its resources to coordinate military attacks and communication. This is the story of KSP operations and missions throughout the war.\n\nAlso, for the readers:\n\nYou may suggest mission ideas\n\nYou may criticize my writing and tell me how to improve\n\nNO SWEARING!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T22:05:04Z","Content":"Question, is this going to be a youtube series, or a picture-based series? might be interesting in either way.
