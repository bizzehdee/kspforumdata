I toyed with the idea of having a drill to extract the resources, or a new claw (which I modeled really badly) to convert asteroids into resources and got it all working but in the end I decided that the extraction process doesn\u0027t really fit so I have stripped it back and created a partless mod that fills loaded asteroids with resources while keeping the same mass like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qmhfVsQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qmhfVsQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rzvWQ0f.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rzvWQ0f.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking for some feedback and maybe some discussion around balance. At the moment the asteroid yield can be from 60% \u0026gt; 99% which is a lot of fuel. This was set high for testing but I have left it like that for the initial release to see what people think. The mod will handle any resource that KSP supports you just need to white list it in the config file. By default LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, MonoPropellant, Kethane and Ore are enabled and will show up (Kethane and Ore will only show up if you have the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/23979-Kethane-Pack-0-8-5-Find-it-mine-it-burn-it%21-0-23-5-%28ARM%29-compatibility-update\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecorrect\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35217-0-22-Extraplanetary-Launchpads-Legacy-Thread\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emods\u003C/a\u003E installed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo install, just download from here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5wuQoB1aV_SYnBEUlpSOXpPRWM/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAsteroidResources_0.0.3.zip\u003C/a\u003E and extract to the \u0026lt;KSP\u0026gt;/GameData/ directory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWarning, this will pertinently add resources to your asteroids the first time they are loaded (sort of...), this can not be reversed by uninstalled the mod.

This is how I will use it mostly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment each asteroid has a chance to get a random number of a random quantity of resources. A percentage is left over (about 1-40% for this first build) of just pure asteroid mass. As you drain those resources out of the asteroid it will get lighter as there is less fuel mass left over.
