IIRC, you only had 64MB of physical RAM on that card, with more being offered via memory sharing. That doesn\u0027t say good things about the card\u0027s probable capability for 3D applications.\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I wish I had some miracle cure to offer, but it seems like you\u0027re running right at the very edge of that system\u0027s performance envelope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is, however, some tweaking you can try! Go check out Razer Game Booster (yes, *that* Razer).

I may be missing a few items on this list, though very few of my deigns include parts from all mods at once. Mostly I build stock and use mods to fill the gaps in parts/functionality.

The local grid around here is a bit dated, and I doubt I\u0027m getting anywhere near a constant 110-115 VAC at the wall.

Not a huge boost in numbers, but we ARE talking about something that\u0027s happening x-times per second. Much like that huge difference between one NERVA and two on a ship\u0027s acceleration.
