It\u0027s a quiz about space. Intended to be a short (between five to ten minutes) quiz containing a mix of basic, intermediate, and hard questions about space related topics, Space Quiz is meant to gather data on just how much the average person knows about space. Space Quiz is currently still in its rough draft stages, so comments and constructive criticism on how to improve it are requested. The eventual goal is to have something I can give to a bunch of test subjects volunteers and ask them to fill out, so that I can make statistically significant conclusions somewhat educated guesses about what people know about space. And shiny graphs.\n\nHere is the current version of Space Quiz.\n\n    Space History1. What was the first man made object in space?A. Sputnik 1B. A V2 missileC. The X-15D. Explorer 12.

But that\u0027s not a bell curve. Bell curving is a method of manipulating the graph in such a way as to give you a pre-determined line, i.e. 50% of the scores are Cs, 20% are Bs, etc... Wikipedia has some more info on it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_on_a_curve). This isn\u0027t a test, so I don\u0027t want to manipulate the line into a pre-defined shape. In fact, one of the points of the entire quiz is to find out what shape that line would actually be. As you said, to do this accurately, we need lots of questions, and lots of people.\n\nMy plan is to eventually distribute this to various people within my college and workplace. Probably at least 100 people. Hopefully more. If other forum members want to distribute the final quiz and report the results, we could probably gather even more data points.\n\nEdit: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ooh, ooh! I love quizzes!
