This is of course inspired by a Nassault video, in which he depicted Eve with violent (acid) rain and thunderstorms. I mean, it would be great, if the atmospheres would not only be characterized by density, pressures and thickness, but also by some sort of procedurally generated climate, consisting of randomized wind and precipitation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin could be the calm idyllic planet with the odd storm, Eve would be with violent (thunder) storms and excessive rain (which reduces visibility). Jool would have very high wind speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWadda you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T16:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe it was on the What Not To Suggest list, though the new Common Suggestions links only mentions clouds...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, nevermind, it\u0027s not going to happen any time soon.
