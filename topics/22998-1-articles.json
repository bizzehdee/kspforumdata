I have read the CFG part in the wiki, yet when i change the \u0022rescale = X\u0022 number ( I changed by x2 for all the parts of that mod) things dont seem to work out quite right. In the VAB/SPH all parts are size proportionate and fit together nicely, yet when i Launch the ship large gaps appear in between all the parts. Also the stabilizer fins seem to be way more powerful/ touchy than they were before. How do I edit the cfg file correctly to only make the model twice as big with all parts working correctly? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zaeo","CreatedById":52597,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T01:11:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe new form is rescaleFactor = X\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sleipnir","CreatedById":58380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T01:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zaeo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zaeo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe new form is rescaleFactor = X\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats is what I meant sorry.

Everything for it is sitting right here, would not take me long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason the rescaling does not work as intended is because all the parts were scaled up by 2 already, which in turn messed the original nodes up due to the size, which as Hooji said gave me issues with the joints. When you have alot of animations, the colliders for those animations can sometimes play havoc when they are animating. What doesn\u0027t collide when its open, is not the same as what collides when it\u0027s closed, and in the case of a cargo bay you want it to be a collider, but not convex so you can actually get stuff inside BUT it still needs a convex base so it doesnt fall through the floor.
