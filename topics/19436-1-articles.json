But When I want to adjust my Apo- and Periapsis I always miss the point where I want to be because I\u0027m looking at the map, betting close, and then I have to cut the thrust, so I have to SWITCH BACK to normal mode and hit my keyboard very hard to cut the engines... yeah so I normally miss the point for (for example) 100 km about kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any tips how to cirumvent this problem? Maybe a possibility to steer and control throttle or is there a nifty tool to calculate my speed for orbit (so I don\u0027t have to change to map view)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you can help me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJonathan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-16T09:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGoto your map view and click on the little triangle in the bottom middle of the screen, it will bring up the navball and you can control the ship from there for everything but starting a new stage!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow you can physical watch the AP and PE!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkoRagnos","CreatedById":28181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-16T10:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, remember the X key to cut throttle to 0 immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-16T12:37:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you only need to tap X to set throttle to 0 rather than holding down control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"angeldust","CreatedById":49069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-16T13:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much, guys!
