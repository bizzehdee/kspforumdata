Maybe you need to have an antenna to transmit back data.

Is there a chance you have change display settings ? I\u0027m not sure about the small map, but the big one can be set to display other bodies, Mun for the instance (and if you have no map data form Mun yet it shows gray). It could be also set to display either altimetry, slope, and biomes. If you have it set do display biome and have only data from altimetry scanner then it would show gray as there is no biome data. \n\nI think that it could be set do display altimetry data by default, and if you have used multispectral sensor right away, without using altimetry sensor before, you may have to change settings to display biome data. Altimetry sensor marks anomalies as well so you can try to use it to find their locations."},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T11:55:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E sussed it! man i feel like an idiot lol, however i wasnt hitting the scan choice to see in-flight doh! thanks again my man ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOh lol, glad you fixed it XD"}]}
