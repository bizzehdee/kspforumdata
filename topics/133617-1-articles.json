I usually tend to build big landers. The reason is, when I can I like to take most science tools, a crew of 3 and sometimes I take drills converters,etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play with mods, like life support, MKS, KAS\u002BKIS, RT2, and many others to add a bit more difficulty to my game and to make it a bit more realistic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy problem is in the earlier tech tree, with no probes, no scans for resources to convert to fuel, I have a hard time to land my monsters landders and return them to kerbin from places like the Mun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of my problems is solved after I get the nuclear engines. My lander have 2 engines on the side, each with is own fuel tank that are feed from the main tank (a rockmax) with fuel lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome mods I use also add several type of engines, in the beginning I start using the 909\u0027s 2 of them on each side. But I have a problem regarding fuel, I endup with no fuel after trying to leave the SOI of the mun on the return to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat should I consider? ISP on vacuum or Trust on Vacuum? The 909 have about (cant remember now) 345 isp on vacuum but trust of 60kn. I have other engine, with about 500 ISP but only around 6 trust Kn. All this on vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould I consider isp or trust in a engine regarding travel time, burn time, and enough force to take off from the mun (in this case) and return home?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Nerva Nuclear engine have 60 Kn and 800 Vacuum ISP if a remember correctly, but I need another option better then the 909 considering that I have to use 2 engines. 1 engine, for example is the bottom of my lander is not a option, since I play with stage recover mod, and my lander has 3 stages that deploy on Kerbin entry to recover everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny tips on this would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Veskenapper","CreatedById":142626,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-06T18:11:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case you\u0027re not familiar with it, I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0tells you\u00A0how much power (delta-V, if you\u0027re familiar with the extremely helpful MechJeb panel for that)\u00A0you\u0027ll get for each unit of fuel the engine burns.

They get big cause I need to drill kerbonite, convert to LFO to keep going.

I favour reusability so like to use Nukes where I can as in the long run I have to lift a lot less fuel.\u00A0 I have a 2 seater science lander that was able to all science on Minmus with only 2

Small, light, doesn\u0027t require super-high tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main thing is to make sure you\u0027re comfortable with the \u0022delayed command\u0022 functionality of RemoteTech\u0027s flight computer, so that you can handle Eve reentry without getting the antenna ripped off.\u00A0 You close the antenna (thus going \u0022dead\u0022 and having no comms) just before hitting atmosphere, but before you close it you set it up so that it\u0027ll open itself again a few minutes later after your probe is safely drifting down on its parachute.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Note, to be able to do this, you\u0027ll need some finagling, since there\u0027s no way to send a delayed \u0022open\u0022 command to an antenna while it\u0027s already open.\u00A0 A couple ways to do this:\u00A0 one is to have the antenna\u0027s \u0022toggle\u0022 action in an action group, and send a delayed \u0022toggle\u0022 action.\u00A0 The other is to have two antennas, and send a delayed \u0022open\u0022 command to the closed one.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApologies if you already know all this stuff, just thought I\u0027d

I know a bit how to work with RT but never did anything outside of Kerbin. A few hours ago, I forgot that I did not have Protractor Mod, I installed and lol.... Eve is over 400 days interception, closest in Mohoo with 15 days. I made a probe but I mess it up since I forgot to add a Satellite on Kerbin with enough range to reach the probe out of Kerbin SOI. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe learn with the mistakes. Also, since I never made transfers to another planet, I used Mechjeb for that. It is not very accurate. Also I made something wrong when I gave the command to the probe to execute the node, it dind\u00B4t . I guess I have much more study to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to Scott Manley space school \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, thanks alot for the help Snark and all of you. You guys gave me many new cool ideas to work on in my career game. I just have to be more carefully planing. I tend to get a bit lost and try to do everything at the same time lol.
