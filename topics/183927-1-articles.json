My main problems are first that the lander needs to be quite big and so I need big rockets to haul them into orbit. Sometimes they are not light enough to get into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. The second issue is that I am trying to at least land on actual land and not the ocean so Jeb can plant a flag and the rocket can stay upright on landing legs. The problem with that is mainly that I don\u0027t know how to do atmospheric precision landings on Eve.

This will get you to within 10km after three or four saveloading iterations. Using tools like the Trajectories mod will speed this up so you can get to within a few km on the first try. However, I find that precision under 1km is pretty hard to achieve merely by timing the burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut! After all the reentry fire effects stop, you\u0027ve still got a minute or three of falling through the atmosphere, which is getting dense and denser. At this stage, even a small amount of airbrakes or control surfaces (which you probably carry anyway) will allow you to steer a quite bit.

It\u0027s from the Eve-3000 challenge, i don\u0027t think it will spoil you in any way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can already achieve similar effects by deploying a single airbrake (so it doesn\u0027t fall quite straight), and rolling your vessel to control the direction of the drift. This allows for pinpoint precision, though i usually need several tries for every new vessel just to get the hang of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
