Very few packs I\u0027m aware of use asset synonomy to it\u0027s full potential, which would straight up eliminate potentially dozens of models and texture sheets from memory. Also KSP does very little to use memory in an optimal way, loading all textures regardless of format into memory as uncompressed bitmaps, the largest possible way to do it without inventing junk. I\u0027ve seen several modders over the last few weeks looking into changing that, but I haven\u0027t seen anything come of it yet. this is exacerbated performance wise by how KSP does not appear to apply any mipmapping to part textures at all, meaning your GPU is trying to render every part using it\u0027s highest resolution textures, even if that part ends up as a single pixel. Finally, and arguably the biggest complaint, KSP loads Everything on boot, instead of using any system of partial loading like say recording icons for use in the VAB and only loading parts that exist in flight or for handling in the editors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein my experience most mods, with a few exceptions, use about an appropriat amount of texture, certainly moreso than Squad\u0027s parts (love you Squad, but your folder is my first top for culling parts).
