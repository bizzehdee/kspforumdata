I\u0027ve often thought about setting up a dual-boot system with KSP running exclusively under Linux on its own partition or drive. I\u0027ve read that KSP runs better under Linux and is able to utilise more if not all of the installed memory. Are there any Linux KSP users on here who could verify this? Do you still get memory crashes? Is it still limited to using 3.5GB of available RAM before it crashes? Which version of Linux do you recommend for KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried the 64-bit version of KSP a while ago, but it seemed too unstable; I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s been improved since. I\u0027ve also tried the \u0027-forceopengl\u0027 command switch - it seemed to work a little better but was still glitchy. I suppose I could go back to vanilla KSP, but once you start using mods (I have 21 installed) that add so much more to the game you find it hard to go back. Besides, I have more than enough RAM, I shouldn\u0027t have to! Blasted Windows! It\u0027s so annoying when your PC far exceeds all specifications for a game yet your stupid OS\u0027s architecture ties your hands and prevents you from fully exploiting your PC\u0027s power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Esme","CreatedById":107436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T21:43:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood heavens, that\u0027s a meaty PC you have (at least compared to mine it is)! Personally, I don\u0027t find unmodded KSP crashy at all. I use 64 bit Linux Mint on a PC with 6GB of RAM, AMD Phenom 9500 Quad-Core Processor (4420.11 bogomips) and an Nvidia graphics card with 256MB of video RAM and a 540Mhz GPU. It\u0027s a refurbed PC, old kit. Oh, I use Xfce as my desktop, in case that matters. With mods, it depends very much on the individual mods and sometimes the combination of mods you use that causes crashes. For instance, I;ve used Firespitter before without problems, but when I tried using it alongside MKS and visual enhancement mods, it seemed to be Firespitter that was causing crashiness (the others simply slowed things down). I\u0027m not saying there\u0027s anything wrong with Firespitter, mind, just that in combination with the other mods I was using then my PC wasn;t a happy bunny :-( Your mileage may vary.
