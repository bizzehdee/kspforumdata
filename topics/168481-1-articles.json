It uses the vacuum values as \u0022standard\u0022 for the thrust calculations, and modifies the thrust of the atmospheric values. Usually this means an engine develops its maximum thrust in a vacuum, and atmospheric thrust is reduced. The way you have it now, maximum thrust is increased in the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d guess its by a factor of 10200/800, which is close to the 10x value that you mention. I don\u0027t think its realistic to scale Isp by air density anyway, but certainly by velocity (which the game isn\u0027t really set up for, but the old jet engines did have a way to do it... I wonder if the old velocity curves would still work)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022700px-Specific-impulse-kk-20090105.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022487\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Specific-impulse-kk-20090105.png/700px-Specific-impulse-kk-20090105.png\u0022 width=\u0022700\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taquarinha","CreatedById":47685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-15T02:52:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIve found the problem, the game doesn\u0027t handle well isp change on jet engines, by fixing the isp value the problem was solved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
