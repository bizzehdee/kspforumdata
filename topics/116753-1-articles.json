It also has the highest temp rating of the parts, so is a good thing to stick out front. And it protects a bunch of parts from heating up in the airflow. Basically the craft is unflyable at high speed without it."},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T04:18:13Z","Content":"What the payload?"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T08:31:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What the payload?\n\n17 crew and 120t to orbit...Or maybe a bit less. \n\nSeriously though, I think I\u0027ll see if I can squeeze a Kerbal on board somewhere - along with a change of underwear."},{"CreatedByName":"Logan.Darklighter","CreatedById":7375,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T18:52:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 17 crew and 120t to orbit...Or maybe a bit less. \n\u003E Seriously though, I think I\u0027ll see if I can squeeze a Kerbal on board somewhere - along with a change of underwear.\n\n**JEB: \u0022Bill?
