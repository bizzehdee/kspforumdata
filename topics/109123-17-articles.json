A small problem that led to explosive first stage separations in the earlier flights had been fixed. Once in Orbit the crew spent just 30 minutes on system checks before Commander Valentina received a go for Trans-Munar Injection. At T\u002B37 minutes the S-VIB stage fired and put the craft on a free return trajectory to the Mun. Shortly after TMI the CSM turned around to dock with the MEM and pull it away from spent the S-IVB stage. \n\nAfter their voyage to the Mun the Service Propulsion System fired while the craft passed behind the Mun and injected it into a almost circular 60kmx55km orbit around our grey companion. \n\nThe Kerbonauts spent serveral orbits around the Mun with system checks, they also spent time eating snacks and taking a nap. Once rested Commander Valentina and Munar Module Pilot Bob Kerman entered the MEM and prepared it for the munar landing. A short while after they undocked und lowered their orbit, leaving Command Module Pilot Bill Kerman behind.\n\nOne hour later the MEM entered the final stage of it\u0027s decent. After tipping upright Commander Valentina lead the MEM to a safe landing location since the original location turned out to be on a slope.\n\nA few minutes later Bob and Valentina donned their spacesuits. Valentina left the MEM first, slowly climbing down it\u0027s ladder to the munar soil. With the words \u0022*One small step for a woman, but a giant leap for Kerbalkind*\u0022 she stepped onto the Mun. \n\nBob follower shortly thereafter. Together they first set up the Odin Program flag near to the MEM and then set up the [EOSEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Surface_Experiments_Package#Apollo_11_.28EASEP.29). EVA continued for over two hours before Val and Bob returned to the MEM. They enjoyed another nap time before they fired up the asecent stage, returning them to the Command Module. \n\nAfter just one orbit they redocked with the CSM and transfered back into their old craft. They then jettisoned the ascend stage and fired up the SPS to return them to Kerbin. One day later the Service Module was separated as they approached the Kerbin atmosphere. The command capsule\u0027s heatshied protected the crew as they were engulfed by hot plasma.\n\nFour days and 39 minutes after launch the Odin XI CM splashed down, return it\u0027s crew safely back home.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Once in orbit the crew jettisoned the S-II stage and started system checks on the remaining space craft. Since the crew is by now well versed in their procedures, they could initiate the trans-munar injection after about an hour in orbit. A few minutes after the burn the crew extracted the MEM and pulled it away from the S-IVB stage. Time for a nap and a few snacks while drifting toward the Mun.\n\nAlmost exactly one day after launch the Crew fired the SPS to inject the spacecraft into munar orbit. A few minor course corrections were necessary during the munar approach as the Seer III probe landed at a higher latitude than the guys at Mission Planning remembered. Once again Val and Bob entered the MEM to decent to the munar surface. They lowered the MEMs orbit, therefore they were soon speeding a low altitude above the munar ground at incredible speed. Using the descent engine Val and Bob decelerated the MEM on it\u0027s final approach to the midland crater. Thanks to careful timing and Valentinas flying skills they touched down softy and within walking distance of the Seer III probe just a few minute later.\n\nThe crew used their time on the Mun for two EVAs. During the first one, immediately after landing, Val first set up the Flag while Bob started deploying the OMSEP. Once done with the flag Val helped with the second experiments package. Both then went to the Seer III probe to inspect it and take some parts back to the MEM for later analysis on Kerbin. Time was late by now, so they both went back into the MEM for a little nap. On their second EVA Bob and Val studied several of the surrounding rocks, taking probes and pictures. After finishing their second trip it was almost time for liftoff - the Sun on the Mun was about to set. \n\nAfter almost one day on the munar surface Val fired the ascend engine of the MEM and headed back for orbit. Since the landing site was nowhere near the munar equator a few maneuvers where needed to match the CSM\u0027s orbital plane and to catch up with it. Nonetheless the crew was united again a little later. After committing the ascend stage to a crash on the munar surface, the SPS was fired up again and the crew returned back to Kerbin. Four days and one hour after liftoff the crew splashed down safely in the kerbin ocean. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Five minutes after launch the Odin spacecraft had entered 99.5 km x 92.3 km orbit around Kerbin. The experienced crew started system checks to make sure that everything was ready for their trans-munar injection. After three orbits all checks where completed and Odin XIII was go for TMI. The S-IVB engine fired and put the crew on the desired trajectory. Once the burn was completed the crew started preparations for the transposition and docking maneuver. The CSM separated from the remaining craft, turned around and docked with the MEM. The CSM used it\u0027s RCS to extract the MEM and to put a safe distance between the spent stage and itself.\n\nFour hours into the flight and well on their way to the Mun the crew heard a loud bang accompanied by fluctuations in electrical power during their snack break. The crew initially thought that a meteoroid might have struck the MEM. While the Crew was still trying to find out what happened, Bill Kerman saw the spacecraft\u0027s main energy source, it\u0027s twin fuel cells, it\u0027s main battery and RCS-Fuel supply floating past his window. After making sure that KSC had *not* sent a spare pair of fuel cells the crew was forced to shut down the CM completely to save it for re-entry, and to power up the MEM to use as a \u0022lifeboat.\u0022 However, as the MEM has only place for two Kerbals, Bill had to don his spacesuit and cling to the ladder.\n\nIt seems however, that Bill was mesmerized by the sight of the approaching Mun an soon let go of the ladder. Thankfully the craft and Bill where already on a free return trajectory to the Mun. The craft passed behind the Mun and some time afterwards Bill was responsive again. He reapproached the Spacecraft and entered the shut down Command Module to refill his RCS reserves before clinging back onto the ladder. Now that Bill was holding on to the craft again the crew could use the MEM\u0027s descent engine for some course corrections. \n\nAfter two days the craft finally came close to Kerbin again. The first step of reentry preparations was to separated the service module, using the MEM\u0027S RCS to pull away from it. The crew entered the capsule and started a complete power-up from scratch of the completely shut-down Command Module, something never intended to be done in-flight. Once this was completed, the MEM was undocked and the crew was ready for reentry. \n\nTwo days, one hour and three minutes after liftoff the capsule splashed down in the seas of Kerbin. The crew was safely back home on their beloved home planet.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Six minutes after launch, the Odin spacecraft had entered a 102.6 km x 99.9 km orbit around Kerbin and the crew started system checks, readying everything for the trans-munar injection. After one hour in space the crew was done with checks and fired the S-IVB stage to put them on their way to the Mun. Ten minutes after finishing the burn, it was time for the transposition and docking maneuver. The CSM seperated from the remaining craft, turned 180 degress and docked with the MEM. Command Module Pilot Bill Kerman performed the maneuver. He then used the RCS to pull the two docked spacecraft away from the spent S-IVB stage. Now everything was set up for their coast to the Mun - time for a nap and some snacks.\n\nAfter the usual one day trip to the Mun the SPS fired over the it\u0027s fars side, slowing down the spacecraft in order to enter a munar orbit. After a few hours around the Mun Valentina and Bob enter the MEM and ready it up for its trip. They soon undock and lower their orbit. After 26 minutes they start the main breaking maneuver and slowly decended into the giant midland crater. Because of a new decend profile fuel started to become crital soon. However Valentina expertly steered the MEM to a precission landing with the last drops of fuel. The engine ceased working just one meter over the munar surface and the MEM set down safely although a bit rougher than usual. \n\nAfter completing their landing checklist Valentina an Bob donned their space suits. It was time to once again step one the Mun. Right after egress Valentina planted the obligatory flag and went on a small mun stroll while Bob set up the two OMSEP stations. On his way back to the MEM Bob collected a few samples and the first EVA had to be concluded. \n\nAfter a little nap and some snack in the MEM, the two kerbonauts where ready for their second EVA. They once again exited the MEM and went on a walk to the nearby crater where they examined it\u0027s rim. It was decided to name the crater \u0022Jebediah\u0022 in honour of the famous pilot who lost his life in the Odin I accident. Valentina climbed down into the crater to collect more samples while Bob stayed behind on the rim, watching her. After returning to Bob they examined several more rocks and finally returned to the MEM.\n\nOnce inside they took another nap, sorted and bagged their samples and prepared for liftoff. After spending a whole day on the munar surface, Val fired the ascend engine to return to the CSM. After about one hour the two spacecraft docked in munar orbit. Bob and Val transfered back to the CSM with their collected samples and. The ascend stage was jettisoned and left to crash onto the Mun while the now reunited crew fired up the SPS to return them back to Kerbin.\n\nThe trip home was uneventfull, only disturbed by a small midcourse correction. 126 km above Kerbin the Service Module was jettisoned, the crew was commited for reentry. Protected by the heat shield they hurtled through the atmosphere before splashing down safely, four days, three hours and three minutes after launch.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Even with the naked eye you could see that something was different. The shoud of the mighty Sleipnir V had to be altered to accomodate the Munar Rover, the most exiting technical innovation on this mission. But the booster had no problem with the increased weight. When the countdown reached zero, the cluster of Mainsail engines fired, creating a fiery inferno beneath the rocket that slowly started to move upwards.\n\nEven if the acceleration was small in the beginning, the rocket soon reached high speeds. Two minutes after liftoff, when the first stage separates, the rocket is moving at over three times the speed of sound. The sky turns black and the curvature of Kerbin becomes visible when looking out the window. Five minutes into the flight, after a short cruise phase, the S-II stage reignites to circularize the orbit. Once the burn is completed, the spent stage is separed and the shroud is ejected. But this time there was a small problem: Some of the charges to blow the shroud did not fire. So while the shroud was fractured it did not fly off as intended. However the spacecraft was able to \u0022break free of it\u0027s cocoon\u0022 using a bit of thrust. \n\nAfter a one hour period of system checks in orbit it was time to go to the Mun. The S-IVB stage fired and put the crew on its course to our distant companion. Ten minutes after the burn was concluded it was time for the docking and transposition maneuver. The CSM separated and turned around. Bill Kerman, the command module pilot, docked the two crafts and pulled them away from the spent S-IVB stage. With this last hurdle gone, the crew relaxed, ate some snacks and took a nap while they cruised toward the Mun.\n\nAbout one day later the crew fired up the SPS while passing behind the backside of the Mun to decelerated the spacecraft and enter a munar orbit. Bob and Val, giddy to test out their new equipment, soon board the MEM and undock. Leaving Bill behind in the CSM while they descent down to the Plait Plateau. Because of the increased weight, Val has to set down the lander softly. A rough landing like on Odin XIV could tip the lander an potentially strand both of them on the Mun. But the seasoned pilot she is, Val gently sets down the MEM on the ground, right in the target zone and with four seconds of fuel to spare.\n\nLooking out the window, they can both see the munar arch aswell as mons matterhorn. This will be a few interesting days.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Once both were awake, they ate some snacks and then donned their space suits. After egress one of the big innovations on this mission was deployed: the munar rover. During the flight it was attached to the side of the MEM and was now separated and paced in a upright position next to the lander. Val checked out the fuel tank, the batteries and the fuel cell before both kerbonauts got onto the rover. \n\nThe commander took the helm and the two kerbonauts headed to the Riley rille, about two kilometers to the north. Val accelerated to [10.4 m/s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10.4\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bkm%2Fh%2C\u002B10.4\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bmph\u0026dataset=), which seemed like a reasonable speed. With a few breakes to collect samples and to recharge the batteries they arrived at the Riley rille and stopped at it\u0027s edge. Val and Bob exited the rover and collected a few samples of the sorrounding area before getting back on the rover to head straight into the rille. They followed the rille eastwards, stopping now and then for more samples. \n\nOnce the sides of the rille got more even they exited the rille, back to the plateau. Having spent so much time collecting samples Val puts the pedal to the metal to get back to the Lander, since they still had to set up the OMSEPs during their first EVA. Val accelerated to [41.4 m/s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=41.4\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bkm%2Fh\u002Band\u002B41.4\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bmph\u0026dataset=) while Bob started to quiver. The flight surgeon in ground control suspected Bob of having a heart attack when the two Kerbonauts hit a small bump and lifted off the munar surface for a few meters.\n\nOnce back at the lander Bob seperated the OMSEPs while Val took care of the rover, making sure nothing hat broken. They then deployed the OMSEPs together, carrying them to their location about a hunded meters of the MEM. At this point it was time for another Nap, as physical activities in spacesuits are quite taxing. So they headed back into the MEM, munched a few snacks and hung out for a bit.\n\nWell rested, they donned their spacesuits a second time and, after some persuasion on Vals part, they both got on the munar rover and headed for the \u0022von\u0022 and \u0022Kerman\u0022 twin craters. They are obviously named for Wernher von Kerman (whose ego is so inflated he needed two craters named for him). Up to now, they were on schedule but the way to the ridge of \u0022von\u0022 was steeper that it appeared from a distance, so the two kerbonauts lost some time while crawling up the slope at a snail\u0027s pace. Bob was happy. Once on the ridge Val stopped for a few quick samples before heading straight into the crater and up it\u0027s westward flank. While geologically interesting this side also provided a nice downward slope to accelerate toward the bridge between the two craters. Bob did not know that Val had bet fifty funds that she could jump from one crater to the other without touching the ground between them.\n\nSadly Val lost her bet as they set down rather hard on the munar surface between the craters. Since the remaining flat surface was to short to break, Val instead accelerated and they hurtled on straight into the Kerman crater. When hitting the ground inside the crater one of the rovers tires blew. So Val brought the rover to a halt near a nice rock and, while Bob calmed his nerves collecting samples, Val replaced the tire. Once again late on ther schedule, they headed back to the MEM as soon as the rover was fixed. A small stop at Kermans ridge to collect a few samples and straight then straight to the lander. During the trip to the lander Val checked the new tire and the rovers reaction wheel by driving on only two wheels. Bob was no amused.\n\nOne last this was planned for the ende of EVA2: setting up the Flag. So Val retrieved it from the MEM and placed it nearby. Both kerbonauts took a few PR shots with the flag before climbing back into the MEM. Time to relax before they set out for EVA3, the most extensive EVA ever attempted.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

At first the terrain was nice and even but the closer they got to the arch, the steeper it got. Soon enough Val had to revert to a zig-zag pattern to get up the hill. The rovers limited torque really made this a tedious climb. But on the plus side, the zig-zag pattern lead them to the edge of the St. George crater where they could pick up a few samples. This way they wouldn\u0027t have to stop later.\n\nWhen approaching the arch Bob and Val realized its incredible size. They stopped at it\u0027s eastern base, where Val got of the rover and collected a few samples before activating her personal RCS to get up the arch. Once ontop Val collected several more samples and made pictures of the sorrounding terrain and the arch itself. They should keep the scientists at Kerbin busy for some time. Even though Val wanted to spent more time ontop of the arch, it was time to move on. After her descent Valentina got back on the rover and buckled up. Now was the time to really test the rover.\n\nVal put the pedal to the metal and headed for St. George crater. At [24.8 m/s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=24.8\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bkm%2Fh\u002Band\u002B24.8\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bmph) the Kerbonauts jumped into the crater, a [300 meter](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=300\u002Bmeter) drop. They were airborne for about 20 seconds, before hitting the ground and blowing one tire. But this time Val would not break to replace the tire but continue accelerating, heading straight into the Atreides crater. She got up to [41.1 m/s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=41.1\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bkm%2Fh\u002Band\u002B41.1\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bmph) before the ground dropped away below them.\n\nAlmost one minute later and 1000 meter below they hit the ground in the Atreides crater. On impact the munar rover converted into a munar sled, meaning all tires blow and leaving Val without any way to steer. Hoping they stop before the drop into the Leto crater, Bob and Val slid through Atreides. Thankfully they stop within time. While Val was still high on adrenaline Bob started to replace the tires. It was time to collect a few samples from the Atreides crater before heading back. They headed up the western flank of the crater and then get the rover up to speed, crossing the crater and jumping of the north-east ridge off it into the fringe of the Riley rille.\n\nThe Riley rille was their way back. They head up the rille, onto to the Plait plateau. Once again the steep terrain pushed the rover to it\u0027s limits. Val and Bob had to stop several times to recharge the batteries, as the fuell cell did not supply enough energy to keep them charged while driving. After almost 40 minutes the Kerbonauts were back on the Plait plateau and approached the MEM. Once back, Bob and Val got all their samples into the lander and took another quick nap before it was time to liftoff.\n\nThe sun was almost setting when the two Kerbonauts fired the ascend engine and left the Mun behind. A few orbital maneuvers later and the Crew was finally reunited. Just one more thing to do before leaving the Mun: Deploying the subsatellite. Happy to have something to do, Bill happily went to work. He opened the CSM equipment bay and activated the subsatellite engine. With just a little nudge it slowly drifted out of the CSM and into it\u0027s own munar orbit. The crew stayed just long enough to make sure the satellite was successfully deployed before preparing the trans-kerbin injection. \n\nThe trip home was uneventfull. The crew ejected the service module, as usual, when they approached the atmosphere of Kerbin. But due to their long stay on the Mun they had to reenter over Kerbins night side. They safely splashed down in the middle of the night, five days after their launch.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

View full album](//imgur.com/a/db9eR)\n\nThis mission marked the first time other Kerbonauts than the original three would head out to the Mun. Commander John W. Kerman, Command Module Pilot Thomas K. Kerman II and Munar Excursion Module Pilot Charles M. Kerman Jr. had been training for a long time for this mission to our distant companion.\n\nThe Sleipnir V rocket worked flawlessly during the ascend. Once the first stage was burnt out and jettisoned, the S-II stage carried the spacecraft all the way to orbit. After [the problems during Odin XV](http://imgur.com/Z0xKA7y) the new shroud design had been reworked and now separated as intended, together with the S-II stage. The crew spent one and a half orbits, just over an hour, in orbit around Kerbin to check all systems before firing up the S-IVB stage for their trans-munar injection.\n\nThe S-IVB stage worked as intended and put the crew on their desired path. With the burn completed the crew prepared for the last crucial maneuver before their cruise to the mun. Ten minutes after TMI burn was completed the CSM seperated from the remaining craft and turned around to dock with the MEM. Command Module Pilot Thomas K. Kerman performed the maneuver flawlessly, just like the endless times he had practiced in the simulator. In the mean time the Commander had prepared some snacks and the crew could slack while they were cruising towards the Mun. \n\nOnce in munar orbit, the crew started obeservations of the munar surface and prepared for the decent to the surface. About one hour after MOI John and Charles undocked and headed for the Hilbert Highlands. With the heavier J-mission MEM they have to take a very direct approach. Therefore just nine minutes after undocking the Gauss Crater and the Highlands came in to view. John initiated the main breaking maneuver and just five minutes later the MEM touched the munar surface, right in the target zone.\n\nAfter taking a quick nap inside the MEM John and Charles donned their spacesuits for their first EVA. John was the third kerbonaut to step onto the munar surface, followed by Charles a few minutes later. Their first task was to deploy the Munar Roving Vehicle and the two OMSEPs. After checking out the MRV, Charles and John each carry one of the OMSEPs to their deployment areas, about fifty meters away from the MEM. Once back at their lander they strap intro the MRV and take it for it\u0027s first ride. \n\nTheir first target was the Newton crater. It actually consists of two craters, so the kerbonauts stopped at both centers to collect some samples before heading north-east, out of the crater. Next they drove along the ridge of Caushy, stopping periodically to collect samples and make pictures. The third station was the northern cluster, an indentation in the munar surface of unclear origin. John and Charles collected several samples and pictures of the sorroundings, hoping to shed some light on it\u0027s origins.\n\n This marked their furthest distance from the MEM on EVA1, at about eight kilometers. The kerbonauts then crossed the Hilbert highlands to get to Legendre, a crater on the southern edge of the highlands. Here they also collected several samples from the center of the crater before driving along it\u0027s ridge to the southern cluster, where Charles got off the MRV to collet several samples. Just like it\u0027s cousin on northern side of the highlands, the southern cluster is a series of indentations of unknown origin. Having secured these samples aswell, John and Charled headed back to the MEM. \n\nThey transfered today samples into the ascend-module and called it a day. Time for a nap and some snacks.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/HJlBG)\n\nAfter a good nap John and Charles donned their spacesuits and left the MEM to head to the target of their second and \n\nlongest EVA: the Gauss crater.\n\nThe first station was the northern one of the twin peaks formed by the rims of Laplace and Leibniz. The other one would be visited during EVA3. Once ontop of the peak, John left the MRV to collect some samples and make pictures of the surrounding area. He also used the view to chart out their further course towards Gauss. From the there John drove the MRV down into Laplace and from here over the two lowered ridges into Leibniz. Halfway between Laplace and Riemann the Kerbonauts stopped to collect several samples of Leibniz rocks. They continued into Rieman, an impressive crater inside Leibniz. Once the samples from there were bagged, they left toward their main target.\n\nOn the small stretch between the two craters John was able to push the MRV to [45.5 m/s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=45.5\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bkph\u002Band\u002B45.5\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bmph), a new speed record, before jumping into the Gauss crater. During the 2000 meter descent the MRV accelerated to [71.2 m/s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=71.2\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bkph\u002Band\u002B71.2\u002Bm%2Fs\u002Bin\u002Bmph). At this point the guys at mission control got the key for the locker with the pre-written obituaries. But to everyones surprise John, Charles and the MRV survived the landing on the bottom of the crater. However the MRV lost all it\u0027s wheels, so while Charles collected a few samples from the surrounding area John replaced their tires so they could head back to the MEM.\n\nBut first it was time for some science! After all this daring jump wasn\u0027t done to entertain the kerbonauts. Close to their landing spot John and Charles found indentations, similar to the clusters on the highlands. They stopped and collected several samples for later analysis. Next stop where two big craters within Gauss. Driving the MRV along the crater, Charles collected several samples of ejecta before heading to the northern ridge of Gauss. In a small accident the MRV lost two wheels, but the two Kerbonauts where by now used to replace them. While one collected a few interesting samples of stone, the other one repaired the MRV wheels.\n\nOnce John and Charles started climbing the ridge of Gauss they realized, just as Val and Bob did on Odin XV, that the MRV suffers from low torque. Progress was painfully slow and they had to stop several times to reload the batteries. At mission control people were starting to get worried. Maybe they would have to shorten EVA3. \n\nWhen the MRV reached an altitude of 2000 meters above zero, it had only 35% fuel left in it\u0027s tank and it was using it up fast. The engineers at mission control became very worried while consulting their slide rules. The MEM was waiting for the Kerbonauts at an altitude of 5000 meters. EVA3 would have to be scrubbed, there would be not enough fuel left in the MRV. \n\nOnce John and Charles reached 3000 meters above zero, only 13% fuel remained. Mission control informed them that EVA3 would have to be scrubbed. Actually the engineers on the ground were not sure if the two kerbonauts could make it back to the MEM with the MRV. \n\nThe tough, little mun buggy carried the kerbonauts to 4081 meters before giving up. While the machine had held up admirably, mission morale was at a low point. John and Charles went through their collected samples and picked the most important ones before abbandoning the MRV six kilometers off the MEM. They activated their jetpacks and headed back. \n\nThey entered the MEM and sorted through their remaining samples before eating some snacks - hoping to ease the gloom.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/gEeyZ)\n\nWhile John and Charles took a nap in the MEM the guys at mission control thought what do about EVA 3. Since the MRV had to be abbandoned the kerbonauts mobility was severely limited. But they came up with something and once the men on the mun had eaten their morning-snacks they donned their space suits and left the MEM.\n\nThey headed to Laplace by foot and collected a few samples on the ridge of the crater before activating their jetpacks. They jumped right across the crater to the southern one of the twin peaks. Once they had assembled ontop of the peak, John started to make pictures of the view while Charles collected samples. \n\nWithout the MRV they soon had to return to the MEM. Using their jetpacks they jumped back across the Laplace crater. After collecting a few further samples along the way they climbed back into the lander. Once safe inside the lander they stored the remaining samples, ate the last snacks and prepared the MEM for liftoff.\n\nThe MEM fired it\u0027s ascend engine once the preparations where completed and the CSM was in the righ position. After the circularization burn, a comparatively long burn was neccessary to match orbital planes. Due to their extended stay on the munar surface, John and Charles had drifted far out of the CSM plane. \n\nNonetheless about one hour after liftoff the ascend-stage approached the CSM and John docked the two spacecraft without any complications. Thomas opened the hatch to the MEM and welcomed John and Charles back on their spacecraft. The crew moved all samples and experiments from the MEM to the CM before jettisoning it and leaving it to crash into the munar surface.\n\nThere was just one more thing to do before leaving munar orbit. Thomas opened the CSM instrument bay and launched the subsatellite. The small, solar-cell clad satellite slowly drifted out of the CSM bay and into orbit. With this done the crew activated the SPS and once in the right position over the far side of the mun made the trans-kerbular injection. \n\nThe trip back to Kerbin was rather uneventfull. Thomas listened to John and Charles\u0027s stories from the munar surface while they had some snacks in the Odin capsule. Just enough time for a nap before they had to prepare for reentry.\n\nAbout 100 kilometers above Kerbin the crew jettisoned the service module before the dived into the atmosphere at 3200 m/s. Thanks to improved planing by the guys in mission controll the capsule didn\u0027t have to reenter over the dark side of Kerbin, as it had on Odin XV. Just a few minutes after being engulfed in a firery ball of plasma the parachutes deployed and the crew safely descended to the ocean below them.\n\n![XrfnFzu.png](http://i.imgur.com/XrfnFzu.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T21:46:52Z","Content":"Xeldrak, is your rover ever on all 4 wheels at once?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T22:01:10Z","Content":"OK, now I need to build my Jool ship.
