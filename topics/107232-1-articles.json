I usually launch KSP via shortcuts on the desktop. Yesterday, when having trouble finding a PartDatabase.cfg, I realized that one of my shortcuts had the wrong folder listed in the \u0022Start in\u0022 field on the shortcut, which was causing PartDatabase.cfg to spawn in that folder.\n\nI played around with it some more, and determined that no matter where KSP.exe actually lives, the KSP.log, PartDatabase.cfg, and Physics.cfg files will be generated in the folder listed in \u0022Start in\u0022. I\u0027m guessing that that is not the intended behavior, because everything else--e.g. save files, craft files, screenshots--appears to ignore the \u0022Start in\u0022 setting and stays with KSP.exe in its actual folder."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:23:45Z","Content":"I blame Windows ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI have no idea how you set your shortcuts up, surely if you made them manually for each KSP.exe they will point to the correct folder?"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinTMC","CreatedById":28909,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:45:51Z","Content":"Oh, it was easy for me to do this.\n\nStep one: Create a shortcut that points to C:\\KSP\\_win\\KSP.exe. The \u0022Start in\u0022 field will naturally be populated with C:\\KSP\\_win.\n\nStep two: Make a copy of this shortcut, changing the target to C:\\KSP\\_win\\_nomod\\KSP.exe...but forget to change the directory listed in \u0022Start in\u0022.\n\nStep three: ???\n\nStep four: PROFIT!\n\nAs I said, it was caused by my own stupidity, but I thought I should mention it, especially in case there might be people out there who are *wanting* to redirect their KSP data to another directory. (In which case they\u0027d surely be disappointed that only KSP.log, PartDatabase.cfg, and Physics.cfg moved when they attempted to change the reference directory.)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:47:21Z","Content":"But, you copied a shortcut with C:\\KSP\\_win in the Start In field, what if you make a shortcut from each KSP.exe you want to use separately from each other?"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinTMC","CreatedById":28909,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:53:00Z","Content":"That would have been a smarter way of going about it, yes.\n\n(But then I would have had to go to the trouble of copying the -popupwindow flag over from one shortcut to another...and at the time I suppose that felt like too much work. ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif))\n\nBut again, bottom line: I just wanted to make sure that Squad were aware that KSP is, in a limited way, paying attention to what is in the \u0022Start in\u0022 field when launched from a Windows shortcut. My guess is that they\u0027d prefer for whatever might be in that field to be ignored altogether (which it seems to be once the program has fully launched)."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:57:05Z","Content":"While this is handy for Windows users I don\u0027t think it\u0027s KSP that\u0027s using the Start In box, Windows is doing that so it can find the KSP executable.\n\nI\u0027ll move this to Tutorials as it might help some players ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T20:50:15Z","Content":"Sounds like just using \u0022PartDatabase.cfg\u0022 instead of KSPUtils.ApplicationRootPath \u002B \u0022\\PartDatabase.cfg\u0022 or something...which might be intended behavior, you never know. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
