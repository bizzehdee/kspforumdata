I usually launch KSP via shortcuts on the desktop. Yesterday, when having trouble finding a PartDatabase.cfg, I realized that one of my shortcuts had the wrong folder listed in the \u0022Start in\u0022 field on the shortcut, which was causing PartDatabase.cfg to spawn in that folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played around with it some more, and determined that no matter where KSP.exe actually lives, the KSP.log, PartDatabase.cfg, and Physics.cfg files will be generated in the folder listed in \u0022Start in\u0022. I\u0027m guessing that that is not the intended behavior, because everything else--e.g. save files, craft files, screenshots--appears to ignore the \u0022Start in\u0022 setting and stays with KSP.exe in its actual folder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI blame Windows \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea how you set your shortcuts up, surely if you made them manually for each KSP.exe they will point to the correct folder?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinTMC","CreatedById":28909,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, it was easy for me to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep one: Create a shortcut that points to C:\\KSP_win\\KSP.exe.
