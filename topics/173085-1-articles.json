Only one probe was able to soft-land due to a bug I\u0027ve had with my landers. For some reason they want to bounce back up, usually flipping over in the process. I have had this issue with both the smallest and the medium sized legs. I\u0027ve also played a bit with the leg springs and dampeners. I lowered their tweakable settings. During that landing, the craft sank into the surface of the Mun and one of the legs exploded, requiring a revert.

This issue has only occurred since 1.4.1 and hasn\u0027t happened previously. I do own Making History. I\u0027d love some help with this one, since I have several contracts that require soft landing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-27T04:23:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2018 04:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by MrBonesWildRide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForgot to post version and Expansion status\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrBonesWildRide","CreatedById":138618,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-27T18:33:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevermind. I figured it out. It\u0027s not a bug, it\u0027s the new spring settings. I found out that increasing dampener strength but not spring strength fixes the issue completely!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
