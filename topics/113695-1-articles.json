Maranda Kerman and her collegues already visited LKO, Mun and Minmus in person and have also set up a small yet comfortable (read: enough snacks available) space station in LKO. Right now our scientists are working on a three-kerbonaut lander and a rocket able to carry it to Kerbins moons. Spaceward Ho!\n\nP.S.: the dude behind ASES bought KSP when there was version 0.25 available, updated to 0.90 and now started all over with 1.0.2 final, running a science sandbox career for the first time.\n\nP.P.S.: I really enjoy the writings of some KSP users, especially the Kold War story was fun to read!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T12:40:27Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums!\n\nLet\u0027s see...
