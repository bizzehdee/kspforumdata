That said, i can see why the hunter class assault carrier will not hold up to RT-10 torps or any other capital ship weaponry, the best choice woulkd be a core full of nothing but girders, like my newly developed SK-FRG-I frigate with carrier functionality, but i see its is extra mass that isnt being used as fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the simplest way to improve the vessel is to replace the central FTL-800 fuel tanks with MK2 long fuel tanks, those have MUCH better impract resistance, no girder but way better then 6 m/s, and they are only a hair heavier and you can get pure LFO versions too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI build most of my weaker armored vessels out of MK2 or MK3 fuselages/cargo bays, these are negligibly heavier then what Macey is using, and are actually resistant to everything that isnt a high powered weapon. Stuff like antpedoes (what i call torps that are oscar\u002Bdocking ports\u002Bant engine) will never ever do any damage to these things, whereas they can and do destroy FLT-800 tanks if you hit it from the right distance and speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, the damage model has drastically changed from teh past, with mass playing a much bigger role then before, so having one massive tank, is actually not bad since it seems to be harder to kill then impact resistance alone would say. For exapmple, try hitting a 14400 tank with a short ibeam, it doesnt matter how fast it goes, it almost always instantly desintegrates on contact. Seems that right now what atters the most for armoring is the force a joint can take before it breaks (you dotn see much part vaporized anymore, mostly just ships cut in half or missing components that have been shot off), the mass of the part relative to teh mass of teh bullet/rocket/whatever (low mass weapons dont do jack anymore unless you are shooting at extremely weak stuff liek fighters), and ofc impact tolerance is always good to have as well, but in my experience, using 1.04, 90% of damage is when a joint is overloaded, cutting something off the ship, with low mass missiles being almost worthless.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T19:05:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most practical design solution is to have everything attached at a high-impact tolerance core.

What im defenetely gonna copy is the way the side fighter bays are layed out, since i do like that layout and well, it works well from a armor standpoint since its better to loose the fighter bay then the whole ship (internally mounted fighter bays are weakspots).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, that is ofc after i finish my new corvette, i keep redesigning teh SK-CRV-I as im still not happy with it. It has enough armor to at a minimum be very very hard to kil with ibeam weapons (ive done it, but it took in excess of 10\u002B 2 long ibeam salvos to actually chop it in two), and it can take the random RT-5 if needed. Ofc itll die quickly to dedicated heavy firepower, but for a anti-fighter flakship so to speak (kinda designed it to replace my old flakboat in the anti-fighter defense role), its armor, range, and firepower is more then adequate. Currently armed with 2 generic RT-5s, 8 long ibeams, and 16 KDrone precision rcs powered anti-fighter missiles, 8 S and 8 M model. Considering all that armarment is more then the part count of the hull, and the whole thing comes in below 300 parts, i say its a win for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T07:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUm where am i able to download this craft file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso is any body able to put flags on structural pieces like the panels 2x2 or do they need something special for it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T07:42:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jon144\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jon144\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe most practical design solution is to have everything attached at a high-impact tolerance core.
