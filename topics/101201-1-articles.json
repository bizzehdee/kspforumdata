For example, I have a contract to land an outpost on Minmus, all other portions of the contract have been fulfilled. However, when the outpost has landed on Minmus and stopped motion, the contract did not recognize the landing. Even with landing gear retracted, re-deployed, engines shutdown, SAS turned off, the contract will not resolve. The same occurs when attempting temperature readings or EVA reports on the Mun. Though I land in the correct place and find myself directly beneath the marker, I get no indication of being in the correct location or completion of the contract when having taken an EVA report. In some cases, though the contract will acknowledge that I am at the correct location, when I take an EVA I get the text that says \u0022Collecting data for #### location\u0022 (#### meaning whatever location I\u0027m at) but no EVA report screen and the contract does not resolve. Will post screenshots if necessary but I hope this description was enough to describe the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR, contracts to build outposts don\u0027t acknowledge landings, contracts to take temperatures or EVA\u0027s don\u0027t acknowledge location and/or EVA report request.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody else having this problem?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T06:24:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESurface surveys have very small target areas. They\u0027re only about 50 meters in diameter. Make sure that you are standing in one before you do the experiment. Sometimes it can be difficult to tell when on EVA, so make sure that you park your vessel close to the target area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe outpost might not be completing for several reasons, but I need more information to help you. The outpost has to be new, it has to have docking ports, it has to have power generators, it has to have an antenna, and it has to meet crew capacity. It also might have special requests on top of these requirements. If you meet all of that, and you land in the correct location, you still need to hold your vessel steady for ten seconds to complete the contract. If your vessel is sliding, this will not complete. It needs to be stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T06:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThread moved to unmodded support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E modded, contact a moderator (e.g. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25176-Need-a-Thread-Moving-Removing-Closing-or-Post-Deleted\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E) to move it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hawk1009a","CreatedById":138979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T17:38:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EArsonide,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Since writing my post I have restarted my computer and the game and when started the contract for the outpost still did not resolve until I \u0022flew\u0022 my outpost. It was already landed on Minmus yesterday and thus today when I went back to \u0022flying\u0022 it, the contract immediately resolved. However, the EVA reports and the like still won\u0027t resolve, I agree the target area is very small, however I have placed flags in the points where I received notification from the game that I was within the target area. At these points (when i was told I was in the area) I would take EVA reports only to have the \u0022Collecting area information\u0022 text appear without an EVA report box, and then I am unable to make anymore EVA reports at all unless I exit to the space center and then return. Even then, though I am standing in the same place, the game no longer acknowledges that I am in the correct EVA location. Having marked that location with a flag I returned with another crew later in the game to find the same issue; I.E. I am standing at the flagged location that should be within the EVA area, and am not given indication of being in the right place. It should be noted the same occurs when over-flying an area for a temperature scan or a crew report, though my altitude is correct and my flight path flies over the target area (all of the criteria are met) I receive no notification of being in the correct area.
