The helmet is a vital component of an astronaut\u2019s spacesuit. It keeps the air we breathe in, and the vacuum of space out. Its visor offers unparalleled visibility while blocking the harmful rays of Kerbol. But as any kerbal can tell you, our arms are too short to reach the tops of our heads, so just how do the astronauts wear their helmets? Do they use mechanical arms? Are the helmets equipped with Reaction Control System (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E) thrusters? Do they get help?

There were no indications of mechanical arms mounted to the insides or tucked away in some storage drawer. Instead, storage containers held items like trash, garbage, and rubbish.

Gene immediately started flipping through procedure books, while Jeb flipped the only unlabeled switch in the capsule, which ejected the capsule spacecraft hatch around 10,000m. Gene grabbed Val\u2019s headset and told Jeb \u201CAt this point, you might as well jump.\u201D Jeb undid his harness. At 350m, according to the camera on his pressure suit, Jeb shifted his weight to roll the capsule spacecraft, and fell jumped out of it. He hit the runway of the Old Airfield head-first, and miraculously survived.

Then why label him an impostor ? These last few days his heroic reputation has been questioned by the publication of compromising documents in the anti-kerbonaut press. These documents appear to have been leaked from the Kerbal Space Center where they had been kept under lock and key. The first damning element is a statistic indicating that JK has taken part in more than 95% of the Kerbal Space Program missions. This has made the anti-kerbonauts react violently : for them it is proof that Jebediah Kerman has benefited from blatant favoritism. This information has totally unsettled the scientific community, since it gives credence to a strong conspiracy theory. However, the most scandalous element is a letter which Jebediah Kerman sent to Gene Kerman, the Mission Control flight director. The conspiracy theorists have picked up on one particular sentence: \u00AB Ah-Uh ! Aaaaahh ! Uuhh, ah uh ! \u00BB. This sentence written in Kerbal can have two meanings : either \u00AB I am highly qualified to join your team \u00BB or \u00AB I\u2019m the boss\u2019s son - hire me ! \u00BB. This second version tends to corroborate the anti-kerbonauts\u2019 suspicions. For them Jebediah Kerman is a shameful impostor with friends in high places, a schemer who is only interested in his own advancement and puts qualified kerbonauts out of the running. Of course, these shocking revelations can be interpreted differently depending on one\u2019s viewpoint. However, for most of us Jebediah Kerman will always be a hero of the Kerbal Space Program, and a universal model of success.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nL\u00E9o Kerman\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UomoCapra","CreatedById":167737,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T00:51:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDear Agony Aunt\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156079-kertech/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022156079\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156079-kertech/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Kertech\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EBy Alanit Kerman\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EHello again my dears and welcome to my little corner of the chronicle.
