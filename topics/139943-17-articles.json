Circularising your own orbit is as hard after reaching space as reachign space is from your first launch. At that point, rendezvous seems nearly impossible and docking seems actually impossible. But once my basic skills were bedded down, interplanetary flight wasn\u0027t as interesting as building space stations. So from there I wanted to build multi-launch interplanetary missions, but that led me to my next problem:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Mods. \u003C/strong\u003Ebecause orbital assembly was the thing I found the most fun,\u00A0I started adding mods to make building large ships more interesting - Near Future and MKS to start, followed quickly by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and suddenly I have like 20 mods, and could build really interesting ships.\u00A0This was about the time I started going to Duna a lot,\u00A0but it ultimately led to problem #3:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3) Community Tech Tree.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EOnce you have that many mods, the game gets too easy unless you spread the new parts out a bit. So I added\u00A0CTT. With tha larger steps between science \u0027levels,\u0027 I needed to collect a lot more science, so probes to Eve and Duna and Moho and Jool were attractive prospects. But it also meant that the parts for the boosters were harder to get to, and delayed the development of larger ships. Saves took longer to \u0027mature,\u0027 which led to problem #4:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4) The update cycle.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0With mods and CTT powering 12-20 launch porbitally-assembled behemoths, I was spending hundreds of hours per save. This meant I started losing games to updates and part redundancy in mods. My latest save got to Mun operations and M.O.L.E space stations before I got a bit bored and wandered off. Maybe I\u0027ll make Duna a priority in my post 1.2 save.
