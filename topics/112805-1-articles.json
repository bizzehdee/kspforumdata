All the science data you collect is unviewable once you close the description or send the data back to KSC. Sure, you get the (often amusing) description, but that\u0027s it, and if you want to read it again you\u0027ll need to re-create those circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see clicking on R\u0026amp;D in Sandbox take you directly to the Science Archives screen where all the planets and the research you conducted on those planets is stored. I\u0027d also like to see science points retained in that window just so you can keep track of the relative value of what you\u0027ve done. (The points would be unspendable, but collecting them as a form of score alone is quite fun, indeed, I edit my save-files to do just that in Science mode at the moment.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same general idea applies to contracts - Tourism ones in particular, are enjoyable because they are tracked. I don\u0027t conduct contracts for money, but because they often provide interesting goals or design challenges that could be \u0027roleplayed\u0027, but are more fun to conduct using the contract system. Even without financial reward, contracts in sandbox would be quite fun for that reason. (I\u0027m not sure if keeping reputation in Sandbox, with a similar complete lack of effect, is worthwhile.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeither of these would affect the actual gameplay of Sandbox mode too much, one could continue to ignore Science collection and contracts if they simply wanted to explore locations or design interesting vehicles without having to unlock parts or fly Tourists up to 70,000m to pay for them. The change would however make tracking past gameplay achievements much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T23:24:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 11:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Coam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T23:39:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a major issue, but science collection and contracts in sandbox are certainly something I would like to have in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T04:23:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMee too\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T18:23:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyea, it would be amazing, because sometimes sandbox gets a little boring\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T19:14:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just want the science archive in sandbox.
