If I read the files correctly, they have pretty low drag (thus saving fuel) until the air is coming from an angle, in which case their drag is a lot higher ( and so they pull the rocket back into the air stream.\n\nThe way you are mounting the small winglets you\u0027re basically keeping them in constant angle mode so they are slowing you down constantly vs. just when the rocket starts to wobble. \n\nOf course that will stabilize the whole thing by braking the tail but have you tested if the stabilizing effect is actually that much better than mounting the winglets normally or just at a slightly sub-optimal angle? A third winglet would also cost the same $ and part count at the girder segment while having a lot less inline drag and a lot more angular drag, so I\u0027d also test if having 3 fins don\u0027t do the job.\n\nNormally I just slap on cheap fins at the very bottom of the boosters until it is stable enough if I run into problems.\n\nOr is this in FAR?"},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T16:19:55Z","Content":"Reminds me of the Soviet style [grid fins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_fin), which pull the back end of the rocket to keep the front end pointed fronty:\n\n![220px-MOAB_grid_fins.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/MOAB_grid_fins.jpg/220px-MOAB_grid_fins.jpg)\n\nIt\u0027s a drag device, rather than a lift device, and will cost you delta-V accordingly. Probably more efficient to replace them with larger *(or more)* fins. Airfoils produce far more lift than drag, and *pushing* the rear back into line for stability will be **much** less drag than *pulling* with plain drag as you\u0027re doing now.\n\n**Edit:** Upon further reading, actual grid fins are grids of tiny airfoils, so they are also *(rather odd looking)* airfoils acting with lift - albeit ones that are more easily folded against the body. Your butterfly stabilizer is perhaps better compared to small drogue parachutes slowing the rocket back end, keeping the front end fronty.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T16:42:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DancesWithSquirrels**"},{"CreatedByName":"wnderer","CreatedById":102068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T18:17:45Z","Content":"Here are some numbers.

The 1.0.2 aero doesn\u0027t like short, wide booster clusters. You can counter this to some extent by sliding the boosters up the core as far as you can because KSP doesn\u0027t model radiant heat from rocket flames, so the tank adjacent to the exhaust (but not in line with it) won\u0027t feel a thing. In general, though, it\u0027s usually better practice (and looks better) to just add stack stages than a wad of radial SRBs.\n\nThink of an arrow. It\u0027s heavy at the front (the arrowhead) and has tailfeathers. The important thing for rockets is that the CoM be above the CoL as much as possible, like an arrow. Low CoMs can be countered by adding more fins. In extreme cases, it might even be necessary to use detla wings and control surfaces. From what I can tell, these don\u0027t add as much drag as deliberately trying to make drag, but serve the real purpose of moving the CoL as low as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"wnderer","CreatedById":102068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T18:36:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Think of an arrow.
