The 1.0.2 aero doesn\u0027t like short, wide booster clusters. You can counter this to some extent by sliding the boosters up the core as far as you can because KSP doesn\u0027t model radiant heat from rocket flames, so the tank adjacent to the exhaust (but not in line with it) won\u0027t feel a thing.
