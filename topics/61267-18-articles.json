I certainly do. The feeling you get when you make a perfect touchdown on another planet or dock two giant ships in orbit is incredible. I\u0027d recommend the Kerbal Engineer mod, gives you all the data that MJ does, but without the autopilot.\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, things I\u0027ve learned:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Learn to use the navball. Knowing what every indicator means, what it does, and \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E is so useful. I think 90% of people\u0027s issues with things like docking can be attributed to not fully understanding how to use the navball. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When in doubt: Simplify. Every ounce of weight you add at the top of your rocket will force you to make every stage under it bigger, which gets out of control exponentially. Learn what you really need, and what you can do without. Lean, mean rockets are easy to lift off, easy to fly, and easy to land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Learn to dock, and get good at it. It opens up a whole new world... well world\u003Cem\u003Es\u003C/em\u003E actually. Why struggle getting a massive ship into orbit when you can split it into two parts and have them docked in less than half an hour? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Rovers are fun... for about 30 seconds... then they flip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Understand why things happen. There\u0027s so much information at our disposal, here on the forum, in youtube vids, wikis, ect. It\u0027s easy to look up an answer to a specific question, but if you take the time to learn why things work they way they do you\u0027ll have learned a skill that you can use to solve future problems without needing to look up the answer. It\u0027s rewarding, it\u0027s enlightening, and it\u0027s fun. \u0022Give a man a fish and he\u0027ll be fed for a day, teach a man to fish and he\u0027ll feed himself for a lifetime\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember a typical minmus mission in .25.

Use RCS to fine-tune the last fractional m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Disable RCS when turning. It will ruin your movement direction. Turn towards your target, wait until it\u0027s squat in the center of the navball and burn prograde. It shouldn\u0027t be very fast, but you should try to get there in less than, say, 1/8 the orbital period. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Watch the navball. Prograde should sit squat in the middle of Target. If it doesn\u0027t, use RCS \u0022translation\u0022 controls to get it there. \u0022I\u0022 pushes the prograde marker down, \u0022K\u0022 up, \u0022L\u0022 right, \u0022J\u0022 left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Don\u0027t crash. If you did everything as I said, you\u0027re more than likely to be on collision course for the station. Instead of turning retrograde to brake, you can lose that 10m/s or so with \u0022N\u0022 control (RCS backwards). Stop at a place where you can easily move in position to the port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Stop again. Doesn\u0027t have to be a perfect zero but it helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Set the port as target and \u0022control from here\u0022 on your port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Move somewhere roughly in front of the port, some distance away. Turn to face the direction at which you will be when docked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The navball is your view forward from behind your ship. The main screen is the view from the side of your ship, telling you how far you are and what direction you\u0027re moving in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- and again, chase the prograde marker into the very middle of the target marker using RCS. Keep chasing it as any errors grow much larger the closer you are and it will keep escaping. Only pay attention to the main screen to see the distance, and control the approach speed with \u0022H\u0022 and \u0022N\u0022; but the main game is being played in the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- reduce the speed to some 0.7m/s when you\u0027re final meters away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, heed my advice on placing three differently-colored headlights in front of your ship. The above procedure depends on keeping a progression towards your destination. If you miss, you need to back away quite a bit, and try again. If you have three lights radially around your docking port, you can stop dead two meters from the target ship (and ten meters to the side from the port), then \u0022translate\u0022 until the port is right in the middle of the \u0022white\u0022 (where the three colored lights overlap), then just press \u0022H\u0022 for a moment and you\u0027re docked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T11:09:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you just can\u0027t balance your load?

The perfect time to start it is T -14s. But you got confused somehow and began burning at T -20s. So, keep burning until you reach half of dV, 120m/s left. The timer will read T -6s.

Start at the docking port (first part placed is the root) then work your way up or down.

I never start at the command pod/drone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip: KSP will not allow you to use that docking port (maybe its just my version) if it is from the sub-assemblies section (I only get one attachment point - bottom of the docking port). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Crate up sections that can be reassembled later. I usually create some elaborate over designed docking port. I like to protect my sections so there is no risk of damage/explosions. I use large decouplers (I manually decrease the force of the separation) and struts. Then encase it with fairings. I then get to use my tug to position the new pieces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WKIh79P.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WKIh79P.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
