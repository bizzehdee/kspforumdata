Is piracy a good thing? Well, not really, and maybe. It\u0027s not as easy as saying that every download is a lost sale. Some of those will likely turn into sales, if your product is good and within the person\u0027s ability to pay for. Other times, it\u0027s kinda crazy how it can have the opposite effect to what is expected, as was the case with BSG in North America. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, there\u0027s no excuse for pulling an Ubisoft and saddling your customers with anything remotely resembling Uplay. I dunno about others, but when I see devs like Squad, Kerberos Productions, CD Projekt RED, Stardock, or...the guys who made Cities In Motion, I WANT to give them my money. Mostly because I know I won\u0027t have to deal with the headaches DRM inevitably causes. The lack of copy protection is practically value added, a positive feature for customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for a solution? The only solution that works is to make a good product, one that people will recognise as being good/great and wish to support. You can see this kind of behaviour with the fans of the companies I mentioned. Make a great product, people will want to give you their money.
