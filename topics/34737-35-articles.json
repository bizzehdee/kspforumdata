So, I guess everything is already local. This also means that working out the distance is simple once I know \u0027which way the rail is pointing\u0027 and this is where I come unstuck. At the moment I use an ever growing collection of \u0027if\u0027 statements to determine the direction eg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, I\u0027ll try to explain the concept the best I can \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll coordinate spaces are technically local to something. So a vessel may have it\u0027s own coordinate space that is local to Kerbin, but for the parts the vessels space is the world. What you are wanting to do for this problem is calculate the CoM and CoT to be local to the adjustable rail, so that applying an x,y,z offset will get you to those values. This sounds quite tricky, but is actually trivial as it\u0027s something that\u0027s done all the time in 3D programs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou first need to get the WorldTransform of the rail. I\u0027d be very shocked if Unity doesn\u0027t offer this! This will return a 4x4 matrix containing the position and orientation of the rail. As you want to get CoM and CoT relative to this you need to calculate it\u0027s inverse to effectively \u0027cancel out\u0027 the placement of the rail, imagining that it is at the origin instead. This should just be a case of writing = matrix.Inverse();. Then you multiply the CoT and CoM vectors by this matrix to give their coordinates relative to the rail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that you can treat it as a 2D problem again, removing all your if statements as the rail is always in the same orientation relative to itself. I can cover this more by PM if you wish but I\u0027m confident that this will work, and allow you to place the rail in any position on the craft and have it work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T21:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sirkut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sirkut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EZodiusInfuser sent me a few models.

All you have is a name, some controls and a speed multiplier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say there even space for an \u0027acceleration/deceleration time\u0027 text field, allowing you to specify the time it takes the parts to reach their top speed (based on the multiplier).
