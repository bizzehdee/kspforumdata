Some want a huge, realistic solar system, some want the easy-science back, etc... I think this will only get worse as Career mode evolves. A one-size fits-all method won\u0027t work, and simply slamming the door on those who are opposing the changes won\u0027t help and might even hurt the game\u0027s future. I think KSP needs a difficulty selection that allows the player to trim the game to his/her skill level/preferences. I am no game programmer, but it doesn\u0027t seem like it would be difficult. I don\u0027t mean as in changing the order of the bodies or something huge like that, but simply altering a few more minor things. Example: A player can, at the creation of a career mode save, choose whether they want infinite experiment uses or not. Or, a player could choose how tolerant the prestige/money system is (when that is implemented, of course). They might also be able to choose whether the solar system is the current size, or realistically sized, or maybe even easy-mode where the distances are shrunk even more. I just think this will open the career mode to all different types of players, instead of just being locked on one level. I know, this can be done by altering the game\u0027s files, but that can be difficult and even dangerous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T04:02:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve suggested this before, and I believe it ended up being added to the \u0022what not to suggest list.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough who knows, maybe the devs will change their mind at some point?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire Snow Leopard","CreatedById":79521,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T04:04:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never saw it on the list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T04:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always wanted this sort of thing.

Maybe even going so far as stuff like crash tolerances, or engine efficiency. I always loved how the Civilization games, for instance, had a HUGE list of options for new games.
