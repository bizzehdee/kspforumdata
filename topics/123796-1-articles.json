I\u0027m using Realism Overhaul with Real Solar System because reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already gotten back on track, mostly. I can reliably design a rocket to achieve orbit etc. However, there is something that has been bugging me A LOT, and that is that most of my launches are \u0022unplanned\u0022. While I can put a satellite on a GEO, no problem, I\u0027m having trouble planning my launches so that I can do things efficiently. For instance, I have devised a mission to put three satellites in GEO. The first one got up no problems, though I forgot to add fuel to its RCS tank and it\u0027s pretty much just floating now, lol. My question now is, is there some \u0022magic\u0022 math formula or whatever I can rely on so that I can plan where my satellites go? For instance, I want these three satellites to be precisely 120 degrees apart from each other (\u002B/- 1 or 2 degrees). How would I go about planning and executing that? I realize I can use the longitudes to gauge where they need to be, but how would I go about planning my maneuvers so that they end up where I want them to?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is especially problematic with RO because delta-v and engine ignitions are VERY precious things, so I can\u0060t just make 5-6 burns to adjust my orbits most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T18:13:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I do not play with RSS, but I think I can give you some advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe period of a geostationary orbit is 24h ( duh ), so the best way of dealing with the 3 sat positioning in GEO would be to launch the three of them in one launch, put them all in a orbit with a period of 24/3 = 8 hours and that has the Apoapsis at the geostationary height ( around 36000 km , IIRC ) and then separate one at the time for the circularization burn every time you get to the Apoapsis of that 8h orbit.
