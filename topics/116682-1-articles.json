Even if I upgrade to level 3, I am restricted to 18 tons. I have read that this is a 64-bit problem, however, I believe that Steam currently only allows for 32-bit. At least I can only see the KSP.exe and not KSP\\_x64.exe in the respective folder.\n\nAny advice?\n\nVersion: 1.04 on Steam, downloaded \u0026 installed July 23rd 2015\n\nOS: Windows 7 64-bit\n\n![ksp1.jpg](http://s27.postimg.org/ywh2q6i9v/ksp1.jpg)\n\n![ksp2.jpg](http://s1.postimg.org/8966uwg67/ksp2.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T20:05:05Z","Content":"Hi Nukedude, please upgrade your launchpad ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEdit:\n\nJust going to add a bit more, you show your VAB as upgraded, rather than the pad itself, right click the pad in the KSC view just as you have done with the VAB, and upgrade it as well, the pad controls the mass limit as it needs to bare the weight of your rocket.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T20:10:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"nukedude","CreatedById":148692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T19:26:46Z","Content":"thanks...and a little bit embarassing.
