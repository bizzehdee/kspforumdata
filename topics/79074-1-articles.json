When taking off, as my craft is just clearing atmosphere, the game stutters for a bit, and the view changes slightly. This happens about once a minute, until eventually I\u0027m zoomed all the way out and angling the camera at a high angle just to keep my craft in view in the corner of my screen. It seems like it\u0027s creating an invisible part or series of parts, as the center of mass shifts in the direction of the camera change. If I use mechjeb to manage the ascent, it keeps trying to align the ship around the new CoM, which causes the rocket to start whirling around this invisible axis alongside the ships central axis. The longer it\u0027s in flight, the wider the rotation around the axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using a bunch of mods, but a list of suspected culprits are mechjeb, kerbal engineer, Hot and Cool Rockets, remotetech, Kethane, and KAS. I\u0027ve got the most recent updates for each, except Kerbal Engineer because I didn\u0027t know until an hour ago that it\u0027s got a newer update, and I\u0027m at work right now. I seem to remember having a problem like this back in .22 or .23, but I can\u0027t remember how it got fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one issue I\u0027m aware of is the new problems with Hot Rockets and old craft files. The ship I\u0027m trying to launch was based off of an old save, but I have deleted and replaced all engines from it, and everything seems good in that department. But I\u0027m at a loss for the whole shifting of mass thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT\u003C/strong\u003E Forgot to mention, I\u0027m running x86 version.

I did a complete reinstall last night, and got rid of some stuff. When I tried a few craft this morning, it seemed ok. But now that I think about it, my rocket didn\u0027t have any chutes, and the SSTO I tried got a little squirrelly on reentry, but I chalked it up to my aspect angle. It did have chutes though, so I\u0027ll look into that later this evening.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frickafrack","CreatedById":93890,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T23:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think Realchute was having problems with chutes symmetry not being set correctly.
