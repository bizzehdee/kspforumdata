To me I probably have to say my most proud mission was one to Minmus, even though i don\u0027t have any pictures of the mission or the rocket I will try to explain it best I can. It was a 4 staged multi-lander with 3 Mk 1 pods, and I brought it to land on minmus and collected about 900\u002B science from flying EVA on the face of it. I know people have done much better but I am extremely proud of how much fuel i managed to land with, i had about 4 minutes of burn left in my rocket and about 700 delta V left. If you want, feel free to post your best missions down in the comments below and thanks for sharing with me ;P\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-09T16:57:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2014 04:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MrZayas1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T17:23:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell done!

Just as with the Apollo missions, it brings the command module and lander in one unit, and once a trans-munar free return trajectory has been established the command module turns around and docks with the lander, before activating the CSM engine to capture itself in a retrograde orbit. The lander even has separate descent and ascent stages, so I can leave the lander base behind as a monument to my exploration!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pEaCMFx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pEaCMFx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just think it looks so majestic sitting on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4GFO57m.png\u0022 alt=\u00224GFO57m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022TMI\u0022 stage carries the lander and CSM to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jc2Wd3p.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Jc2Wd3p.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m particularly proud of how Apollo-like the CSM and lander both look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2ELU9Be.png\u0022 alt=\u00222ELU9Be.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, that\u0027s a base below. This mission was actually very interesting, and I am going to provide more details on it in my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64910-Munstak-Industries-Empire-2-0-Operation-Wealthy-Mun-STATUS-ONGOING\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ededicated mission thread\u003C/a\u003E when I get to that point in my career. I was basically using the Joolean II MMP to get my crew to the Munar mining base, since I couldn\u0027t really use my intended platform the COTS to do so since my refueling station in orbit currently doesn\u0027t have any fuel on board...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat actually segues into the other craft I\u0027m really proud of - My Munar Keth-o-Hopper SSTO Kethane Tanker, which brings the Kethane mined from the base into low Munar orbit so it can rendezvous with a larger tanker that will send it all home. Instead of using the MMP ascent stage to rendezvous with the Joolean CSM, I sent it the other way into a prograde orbit to rendezvous with the Keth-o-Hopper that I\u0027d left unmanned in orbit (I didn\u0027t want to send it up with crew because it was as yet untested and I didn\u0027t want to risk messing up any of the systems and then having to send a rescue mission up to bring the poor guy back home).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tQzO4Df.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tQzO4Df.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the ascent stage docked with my Keth-o-Hopper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ixjdoLz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ixjdoLz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is my Keth-o-Hopper on the surface of the Mun. Big sucker, ain\u0027t it? The reason I\u0027m so proud of it is I actually measured out perfectly how much fuel I would need to get it into orbit and back with a full load of fuel (by design I needed to be able to lift the amount that came out of my miner so that I could keep mining and optimize how much Kethane I get per each trip). As it turns out, with 16,000 units of Kethane to deliver, only about 6,000 actually get offloaded onto the tanker, which is perfectly fine. The rest goes to refueling the Keth-o-Hopper for the return trip back to the Munar surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI talk all about the mathematics behind designing an orbital fuel tanker in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65203-The-fuel-tanker-problem-and-how-it-relates-to-KSP!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread here\u003C/a\u003E.
