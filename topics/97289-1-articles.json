Anyway, Roley Kerman, the pilot for Auk X, was understandably disappointed at being relegated from \u0022first Kerbal on another world\u0022 to the slightly less cool \u0022first Kerbal to orbit Minmus.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is what happened:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/eyJdk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
