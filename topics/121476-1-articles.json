You can\u0027t change what\u0027s on the giant celestial script; you trying to is just written on it to begin with. This is the most believable theory in my book. Story time [explanation]:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are exploring through the forest, and happen to hear a faint noise nearby. A weird sound, like a mix of a crash and computational noises. You check it out, noticing a sphere on the ground next to a tree, slightly damaged, but it is made of metal, and has an interface on the front reading out some numbers. You get a look at it, noticing \u0022Time Stamp\u0022, \u0022O-Time Stamp\u0022, and \u0022Return\u0022. You, having no idea what this thing does, decide to check it out after seeing no one nearby. The \u0022Return\u0022 setting is the most appealing, since it has no numbers beneath it, so you go ahead to push that, unaware of what is going to happen. The sphere glows, and the top hemisphere starts to spin. A flash of light appears, pooling into a sustained field of energy, where you are pulled in slowly. Just before you can get all the way inside, you hear a voice shout \u0022Wait!\u0022 nearby, but see no one. You black out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter regaining consciousness, you look around you, but don\u0027t see the sphere, rather instead a bunch of high tech-looking tools and a console. Out of pure curiosity, you take a look at the console, noticing sophisticated blueprints and many little bits and pieces spread all over. It\u0027s baffling to look at at first, but after studying it for a while, it starts to look rhythmic. Trying out the interface, you pan around the blueprints, not noticing the title for some time. After realizing, you notice [lucky enough] that these are the blueprints for the sphere you had earlier. It appears to be a time machine of sorts, but you have not seen any of the materials that lay around you, and figure this must be quite a bit in the future, when computation is far more advanced. Regardless, you search around the room for more clues, seeing as how your sphere is gone. Looking through cabinets, peeking though doors, and... Hey, what\u0027s that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell lucky you, the two halves of the sphere! They are separated, but the mentally assembled shape is familiar to you, so you take them out, trying to figure out how to put them together. Taking a look at the console helps you with that, but also explains the functions of the 3 basic settings. \u0022Time Stamp\u0022 is to describe what time and location you will be at when using it, \u0022O-Time Stamp\u0022 is where the sphere itself will be, and when, after it is used, and \u0022Return\u0022 takes you back to a pre-set time and place, but you see below that it says the return can cause a slight miscalculation of the two times and places of both you and the sphere due to rounding errors that need to be fixed. You get the two halves together, and start to punch in some numbers trying to lead back to where you were before, but don\u0027t know that you have to account for you and the sphere being in slightly different places. The light appears again, you are pulled through, bracing yourself to not fall unconscious this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou land in the middle of a forest after reaching the other side, and see no sign of the sphere. Getting up and searching for it for a minute, you see a small flash of light, and hear the wild sounds of the energy field. You run toward the spot where it\u0027s coming from, screaming a loud \u0022Wait!\u0022 to try and get the attention of the person who\u0027s using it. But, you were too late, as by the time you get there, no sign of a person or the sphere remains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFascinated by your experience beyond all words, you tell your stories to your family and friends, but they seem to mark it off as fiction, believing the such things are impossible. Irritated by the unaccepting words, you decide to dedicate your own time to finding out the secrets of the sphere, keeping up with the latest of technology for many years to come, making sketches and blueprints, developing formulas, constructing prototypes, and writing in a footnote about the miscalculation problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was far longer than it needed to be. And this is just the first theory! Come on now!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI at least hope that explains it. This gives me a headache.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMoving on to possibly it\u0027s opposite, Temporal Chaos:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the belief that you have control of what happens in the future due to your actions now, and that it could be changed, but out of all the possible things you could have said or done, only one of those will happen at any given time. Making decisions now will affect what happens later, and if you were able to change it, you could, rather than what you said is set in stone. This theory in my opinion isn\u0027t really believable, because it leads to paradoxes. Being able to control fate would be cool, but the word fate has meaning and application, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, story time:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter returning from your work to find your sphere halves taken, you start to search all over for anywhere they could\u0027ve gone, hoping that whoever stole it doesn\u0027t know how it works. About an hour later, you happen upon a slightly damaged sphere, lying in a few bushes. It is removed, and cleaned. Searching for clues as to who did this, you notice strange things around the room. The footnote of your blueprints on the console, the cabinets and doors left open, and a hint of a fingerprint on the \u0022Return\u0022 button. You then start to put the pieces together: The voice that screamed \u0022Wait!\u0022, the footnote, the damage to the sphere, and the reason why it ended up where it did a long time ago. It was all you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering the events, what happens next? You figure you want to stop the encounter from happening by going to the time the sphere was released into the woods, and removing it from the scene. After considering other options, you decide to go ahead with the first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEntering in the correct two time stamps, you proceed into the past just before the other sphere enters the same time. The flash of light happens, and it hops through, hitting a tree and receiving a small dent. You pick it up, placing it inside your clothing, when the unexpected happens: You, alternate-past you, and the two spheres disappear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy is this? Well, if past you had never encountered the sphere, you would never have had the experience that leads to it\u0027s creation, meaning there\u0027s no sphere to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeware the consequences of changing anything if this is what you believe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHeadaches aside, the last one is actually quite simple: Multi-linear:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the belief that, at no one time, only one thing is happening. Every decision, action, even thought, it taken into account. Everything that you could have said, done, thought about does happen, but not simultaneously in the same spot. Everything that could take place at any given moment leads to it\u0027s own chain of events that takes place outside of your influence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s not really a story for this that could work. Want me to try? I can do it, but it\u0027s gonna be scary if it happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have any theories of your own how time travel works [assuming time is not just a construction], or do you think one of the above it correct?
