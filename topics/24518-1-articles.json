I know (or at least am pretty sure) there is not an \u0027intended\u0027 way to do this, but is there a way to mod the part to have a lock action by tampering with the .cfg? What I\u0027d like is to be able to bind this to an action group so once in space I can easily lock all the flaps on my craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas guys?
