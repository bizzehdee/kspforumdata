Ive come to a road block in the game and figured id finally reach out for help. After hours of trying over and over to land a very large lander on the mun ive finally did it. The return stage worked great. Underneath that I had a refuelable probe that was too be able to explore a the mun\u0027s surface and ferry around Kerbals. It all worked great until I went to activate the probe. Nothing... dead batteries. K.. no problem ill just open its solar panels. And.. I cant. I need batteries to open the solar panels. Damn... this mission took me days to design and it came down to this. So before I scrap it. Id like to see if theres a solution by any means necessary. Mods.. anything to get this probe some power. if I have to make another probe and send it to the mun that can charge this probe I will. Is there anything thay could allow me to do that? Ill even cheat if I have too. I just want these two batteries charged up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T00:42:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could send a manned mission out to the probe.
