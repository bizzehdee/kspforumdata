As I\u0027m a science major, I like to try and apply as much real science to the stories as I can, but as I\u0027m a \u003Cem\u003Ebiology\u003C/em\u003E major, I\u0027m not so great when it comes to certain aspects of physics. I\u0027ve been able to fill in a lot of the gaps courtesy of Nyrath\u0027s Atomic Rockets website and other online sources, but I\u0027ve hit one or two questions that I just can\u0027t find an answer for, which brings me here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn one of my stories, a hostile military fleet departs their base on the Moon and heads for the space colonies at Lagrange point 5. I want to know how long it would take them to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that the Lagrange points are on the Moon\u0027s orbital path around the Earth, I\u0027d thought the fleet could simply accelerate and then fly along the Mon\u0027s orbit until they reached L5, but it turns out that if they did that it would boost them into a higher orbit. I looked up how a co-orbital rendezvous works and learned about how it\u0027s done by NASA (dropping into a phasing orbit and exiting it when your target loops back around and catches up to you). The problem is that using that method would take over \u003Cem\u003Ethree weeks\u003C/em\u003E (about 23 days).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt occurred to me, however, that the phasing orbit method may just be the rendezvous method that uses the least DeltaV, and that there might be other ways that are faster but have a higher DeltaV cost (sort of like how a brachistochrone orbit is faster than a Hohmann transfer orbit, but uses much more DeltaV).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know of this hypothetical faster method?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I\u0027m sorry if I\u0027ve brought this to the wrong place; I know this is more for people who play the KSP game. I just figured it couldn\u0027t hurt to ask.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T05:17:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you speed up, cut a chord inside the Moon\u0027s orbit.

And since there is no stealth in space, defenders would have plenty of time to prepare for attack. Generally, i think war in space is very similiar to a chess match between two expert players. They can see the board and all pieces, they know exactly what are the rules and what can be done with them. If anyone would win, i presume it would be more intelligent of the two - able to plan farther ahead and formulate a cunning strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T08:25:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA phasing orbit can be above or below the rendez-vous orbit. You phase lower to catch up with your target (you go faster) and you phase higher to get caught up by it. So to reach EML5 from the Moon, you would just boost higher and wait for the EML5 to catch up with you, and then do a classic orbital transfer back down to lunar orbit for the RV. You could probably optimize it with a single parabolic burn that takes you outward and brings you back down where the EML5 station will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, EML5 is a poor place to put a colony space station. It\u0027s both hard to reach from Earth and hard to reach from the Moon.
