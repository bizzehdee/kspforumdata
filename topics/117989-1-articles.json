Well this third version of my hexagonal array frame has a lower part count, better construction drone, and is much easier to get to orbit.\n\nI highly recommend a docking alignment mod. The docking ports have to be right on the money in order for them to connect properly.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Ive launched 200t capital ships made of nothing but wings (even worse then Macey\u0027s Laniakea carrier) into orbit atop massive rockets, so this shouldnt be too bad (its more or less nothing but girders and docking ports). That and it shouldnt completely screw over rocket aerodynamnics like anything with massive amounts of wing parts."},{"CreatedByName":"StormKat","CreatedById":126927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T01:01:34Z","Content":"I personally enjoy the construction aspect.
