When the community heard the dev\u0027s plan to go straight for 1.0 without an interim beta, this is what many of us feared would happen and I feel that my concern was warranted, I do not consider this to be that great of a release. I have no doubt the issues will be fixed (by modders at least if not by the devs) and I still consider this to be one of my best game purchases, but I\u0027m still disappointed to see yet another developer succumb to rushing a release.

The relatively poor communication of the devs with the forum community throughout this whole process has only exacerbated the negativity we\u0027re seeing, and I\u0027ll admit that I\u0027m definitely one of the forum members who is not happy with Squad\u0027s handling of the game and forum community right now.
