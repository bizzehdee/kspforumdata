So I think it would be easier to get to Minmus than to get to the Moon. We will probably have been there before going to the Moon, as even though insertion burn would be greater, the lander would need to be a lot smaller, and less powerful.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPermanent human occupation, if it happened, would most likely take place on Minmus due to its weaker gravity, as it would be easier to take materials or humans to its surface. Its ice layer could also easily provide water for its inhabitants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe greater distance to Minmus would actually be a good thing for space travel: after going to the Moon, our only option for manned flights is Mars. With Minmus at this position, there actually would be an intermediate destination before Mars. It would be easier to test vessels or general interplanetary technologies. Assuming space conquest happened at the rythm it did in real life, I think we would probably have sent humans to Minmus, and we would be more advanced in our Martian programs, at least technologically and biologically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, due to \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ethis proximity of orbits between the Moon and Minmus, the latter\u0027s\u003C/span\u003E the great distance from Minmus to the Earth, Minmus\u0027 orbit would most likely be unstable. It would risk being ejected from Earth orbit anytime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming Minmus would be made of extremely dense ice, then the most plausible scenario for its origin would be that Minmus was once two very large comet from the outer solar system. They somehow impacted each other and fused, making this extremely large comet (60km radius). Its orbit would have been modified and after several gravity assists by Jupiter or Saturn it would have ended up being captured by Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you take a 10x radius for Minmus (600km), then it is trickier as bodies this size are essentially made of rock, and form by accretion (with the exception of the Moon). That would make Minmus somewhat between Enceladus and Ceres, though surface features would be very different. Minmus would then be made of rock covered by a thick ice layer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe large flat surfaces of Minmus could have been caused by an impact ejecting a part of Minmus\u0027 ice layer, and leaving the rocky interior exposed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA plausible scenario for its formation would be that it was originally formed as a moon of Jupiter or Saturn. For some reason, Minmus formed very closed to its parent planet or another moon. This unstable orbit would have thrown Minmus extremely close to its planet, tidal forcces ripping off a part of its ice layer, and was then ejected to a solar orbit. Then, it stayed on an unstable orbit, was disrupted by Jupiter and eventually captured by Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother scenario for Minmus\u0027 formation would be similar to Ceres\u0027: a protoplanet that never got large enough to be a proper planet. Either formed in the Kuiper belt, or somewhere between Mars and Jupiter, it would have been captured by Earth like the scenari above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming Minmus was indeed formed in the outer solar system (either orbiting a gas giant or in the Kuiper belt), studying it could provide precious information about this part of the solar system. In our system we need to send probes to comets or in orbit of the gas giants to get such information. It would be much easier to land probes or rovers on Minmus, and bring back samples, and huge amounts of data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-18T20:10:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2015 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEdited post according to Jodo\u0026#039;s correction\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jodo42","CreatedById":68895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T19:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I completely blew the orbital altitude.
