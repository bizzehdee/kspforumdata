If you plan on going interplanetary, the biggest problem is inclination. You want to have very little inclination when doing an interplanetary burn, and Minimus will start you off with a few degrees. It\u0027s also more difficult to make a transfer from a moon to another planet, although you can leave Minimus\u0027s SOI before burning to fix this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want a station that far out, put it in Kerbin SOI, and make sure it\u0027s not in a path that can be intercepted by Mun or Minimus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"957Chatterton","CreatedById":92816,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T11:16:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, Rufferal!
