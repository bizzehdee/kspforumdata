I think a simpler solution might be to give the player a discount on the next launch containing that object (either complete vehicle or subassembly). This would give players an incentive to make a reusable system of launchers for various payload sizes, rather than making a bespoke rocket for everything they launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s another issue, though - most dropped lower stages (currently the most commonly reused rocket part, if I remember correctly) never actually touch down in KSP - they drop out of physics draw range before they touch down and are lost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T17:50:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe issue with recovering spent boosters is that the game deletes anything not being controlled below 22km and \u0026gt; 2.5km from the controlled object.
