It was intended to travel to Eve..... and it proceed to orbit Kerbin for the next 100d before it even started to burn out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. I spent quite a while sitting on 1000x timewarp waiting for an optimal burn window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen during a hickup, I actually forgot to deploy my solar panels and left SAS turned on. So my probe actually entered Eve orbit while totally unpowered (facing away from the sun, so my always-on panels had 0 angle for even slight power), so I then spent another 950 days on 1000x time warp to circle the Sun (and this time deploying my panels as soon as I powered back up) waiting to re-enter Eve orbit and burn retro to exit Solar orbit and into stable Eve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027m looking for is just a tiny thing that examines your current orbit, and tells you how long until something happens, (ie crossing planetary body SOI). Possibly also have it setup so you can set a target, and you can see how many orbits/days it\u0027ll take before you reach closest approach (like when I went from a 300d trip to finish a one-way probe of Eve to 1100 day trip, due to probe running out of battery life) This could then be entered into the Kerbal Alarm Clock, so if one were so inclined, you could setup multiple interplanetary expeditions all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissed your flyby, but still have a good orbit that eventually\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 will give you a second chance, now you\u0027ll know how long before it happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to ask for anything else, it might be to associate the set-target feature, and get a rough icon on the map of \u0022place maneuver node here\u0022. Again, referencing my Eve trip, I spent 90 game days with a probe just chilling on 1000x time warp, waiting to drop my maneuver node, and when Eve finally approached a rough optimal approach location, I dropped to 1x time, and then spent 30 RL minutes tweaking my maneuver node to give me as close to a perfect flyby of Eve as I could get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure this is partly available through MechJeb/Protractor, but neither gives an icon or anything. So, all things considering, being told you need a phase angle X, your node will be on prograde Y, blah blah blah, you still need to hold an actual protractor upto your screen to optimize burns. However you do have to be on the final orbit, whereas what I\u0027m requesting will try to be pointing out \u0022In X days node here\u0022 with a spot. After that, it\u0027s still player action to put the node there, and then start tweaking. It would better simulate how any space agency would work, where if you launch with a goal in mind (like entering orbit around say Mars), everything would be pre-calculated. So if you get to the launchpad, before launching you enter map and click target Eve. Burn into stable parking orbit, then you\u0027ll have your notification of say, \u0022Orbit 6 days, then begin burn\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELength of burn, and exact direction wouldn\u0027t be listed because that\u0027s unnecessary information, and every general burn is going to have different intentions. Flyby, versus entering orbit, versus aerobrake\u002Bland, versus slingshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoable? Yay or Nay? Or is there a mod that already does this, without just listing numbers?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tinyboss","CreatedById":74022,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T11:26:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA couple of random bits I can address quickly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

I\u0027ll have to go back to poking around. Can the KAC also be set to go off when planets enter certain formations, or is strictly for Kerbal/drone operated craft? So far on my extra-Kerbin missions, as long as I\u0027m patient enough, I can usually go direct from Kerbin 100km parking orbit to within \u0026lt;2mil km off target. I do that entirely off burns within Kerbin SOI, but I dont think it\u0027s entirely optimal to do such, but I\u0027ve only owned the game for about a week now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the big thing I really need, is when I had an unmanned probe orbitting Kerbin for 90 days (90km parking orbit), until Kerbin and Eve were lined up almost perfectly. Even at 1000x timewarp, 90 days is a helluva long time, and there\u0027s zero chance at an SOI change. What I really like to do is throw lots of probes into parking orbits, and then go to map view, accelerate time and wait until planets enter alignments I want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I\u0027m doing this in a few different career modes, I don\u0027t always have access to forgiving technology. So I\u0027m throwing probes around using LV-909\u0027s or Poodle\u0027s, rather than using ion or nuke. Because those drives aren\u0027t as forgiving, I like to think it\u0027s forcing me to learn at an accelerated rate. But I also don\u0027t want to feel like I need to keep a protractor next to my monitor to hold up now and then and check planet angles, and trying to offset my maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
