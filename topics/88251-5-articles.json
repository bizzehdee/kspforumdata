Do the trajectories in map view show an encounter?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo some extent, that was exactly what happened. SOI changes would work fine sometimes and not-so-fine other times. The map view would show an encounter, but you would never leave the SOI of the larger body. If I hacked myself into orbit, I could get to the Sun\u0027s SOI, but not to a planet\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually fixed it, and I\u0027m not sure how. I think I fixed it by updating the childBodies of each CelestialBody. I\u0027m edging closer and closer to release, but one more bug just popped up -- a moon was named incorrectly, taking the name of planet \u0022e\u0022 when it should\u0027ve taken the name of planet \u0022c.\u0022 Everything else was correct, although the orbit looks as if it wouldn\u0027t be terribly stable (its orbit crosses paths with the orbit of another moon -- it\u0027s a matter of time before the two likely hit one another).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to see what I can do to clean that up. Then it\u0027s just making sure that there is no other game-breaking bugs and we\u0027ll get it out there. I\u0027ve made a lot of improvements, I think, and I\u0027d rather have the new version out over the older version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE: Hmm. Is there a way to turn off the auto-destruct for vessels on rails? I safely landed a crew of Kerbals on a planet surface, then warped away and came back. When I returned, my Kerbals/landed ship was gone.
