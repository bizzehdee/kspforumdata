The main engine had the gimbal to cope with the offset thrust (I think about 8 degrees?). The reason they\u0027re asymmetrical in the first place is because it had set mounting points for LOX and various fuel lines at 10.30 and 1.30 positions. So they only had limited places to put SRBs on that weren\u0027t at these places.

Further, SAS isn\u0027t set up to be aware of it either; this is something that can easily be set up though, it\u0027s very simple control theory to account for that, since they did actually model it using a proper 1st-order system. Hell, Realism Overhaul uses that for its engines, and many of those get about 7 degrees of deflection and they behave just fine (even under SAS\u0027s control).\n\nThere are no compelling reasons for why the gimbal ranges are as low as they are. There are really only two reasons, and both of them have better options than limiting gimbal range:\n\n1) It reduces wobble.\n\nThis problem can be solved by stiffening up the joints further. Also, I recall Harvester talking about how they thought that some wobble was \u0022fun\u0022 and so were leaving it in, and if it\u0027s fun, I don\u0027t see why removing wobble is desirable. In any case, making use of the already-existing response time code fixes that quite well.\n\n2) SAS can\u0027t cope and introduces control-induced oscillations.\n\nThis problem can be solved by making SAS aware of the way gimbals, control surfaces, etc. respond. This is already a solved problem in control theory, nothing difficult at all. It even opens the possibility for mods to hook in (if it\u0027s done right) so that SAS is aware of pretty much any method of controlling vehicles.

Many real life SRB\u0027s have gimballing and in the case of the STS, they were vital for the functioning or the system.
