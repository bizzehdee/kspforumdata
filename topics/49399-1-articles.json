Subsequently pinning the freezing point of water at 32 degrees makes the gradiations easy to mark, because 32 = 2^5 power, so you bisect the distance along your thermometer between those two pinned points five times, and you\u0027ve got a length that will match up to 1 Fahrenheit degree of temperature on your homemade thermometer, and you can start scribing the lines on.
