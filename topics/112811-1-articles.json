If I try to place a node such that I arrive at Mun orbit at 90 degree inclination from Kerbin\u0027s orbit, I\u0027m actually paying a very large amount of dV. About the same as the sum of inclination change at Kerbin and then the transfer dV amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if I first burn to the Mun, and then do inclination change right at the border of the Mun\u0027s SOI, then the dV for that in total is much less. This makes sense since the cheapest way of changing inclination is at highest orbit, but why doesn\u0027t the combination method work?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KarateF22","CreatedById":143090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T02:43:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne reason for this is because the Mun is moving. You do not need to shift your plane a full 90 degrees relative to Kerbin to achieve a polar Munar orbit, you only have to shift your plane between 10 and 20 degrees in tandem with an entry into the Mun\u0027s SOI while at maximum deviation from its plane distance-wise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, plane changes are cheaper the closer to the Apoapsis you are as plane changes are a percentage modification of your total speed, you are slowest at your Apoapsis so it is cheapest there. This is why it seems cheapest to do as you enter the Mun\u0027s SOI, because it effectively is. The only time a plane change is guaranteed to be cheaper in tandem with a rendezvous setup burn is when at Apoapsis, however the closer to it you are the more likely it is that this is the case.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T02:46:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KarateF22\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T03:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECombining gives you good only if the two burns are close enough.

On the one hand, the closer you are to semilatus rectum (line through the focus of the orbit and perpendicular to the semi-major axis), changes along the normal vector are most effective at changing the elevation at the apoapsis. However, normal burns are pretty expensive at the semilatus rectum because you\u0027re still pretty low, and hence moving pretty fast.
