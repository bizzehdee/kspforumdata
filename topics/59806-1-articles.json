Well, I control hordes of minions that are attempting to destroy your headquarters. This first game will have 4 bases. HQ, Alpha, Beta, Charlie. Each player can control one squad, that needs to defend from the minions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttacks can do as much damage as you want, I will modify them if I think they are op. (1 day=1 turn, as I will be updating once per day). Each \u0022horde\u0022 of minions have 1,000,000 health, and can do 50,000 damage to a base per turn. Each base has 10,000,000 health, while the HQ has 1,000,000 health. I can attack the HQ through any base I have destroyed. The HQ is secure until I defeat a base.
