Also, I think we should separate the landing gear from the hull. But Daemoria\u0027s model can\u0027t do that. Another thing is it\u0027s over-sized as you have seen in the first picture. So I would ask you. Would you agree for a reboot where I remodel (I\u0027ll stick to Daemoria\u0027s and the initial concept style), or should I just continue? I wouldn\u0027t mind to continue but... you know. Also, the landing gear isn\u0027t too detailed. I\u0027ll do some improvements if I remodel.

For the sake of clarity I will post my message to Blackheart:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sorry for the delayed response. Hmmm it\u0027s entirely up to you Blackheart, I really liked Daemorias model but if it is proving a pain in the butt to get the landing gear right and you are willing to have another go at the model then by all means.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe work you have done on the Aerojet proves that you are a talented person when it comes to modelling, I just worry that starting from scratch will mean a bunch more work for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do like the idea of the landing gear being a part of the main fuselage, one of the driving ideas behind the concept was to keep a very low part count so that multiple Pterons could be attached to a space station without killing peoples P.C.s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess, in the end what I am saying is: have a go at a new model if you are willing. Just remember...small,simple and Sexy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and lastly if you are going to take another run at the model is it possible to have skids rather than wheels? My initial sketches had skids which I thought were rather *****ing looking and had the benefit of keeping the shock absorber geometry simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again thanks for all the hard work so far and I look forward to any model ideas you come up with.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhilst everyone is making suggestions...Small hatch on the side near the windows or hatch on the top of the fuselage?
