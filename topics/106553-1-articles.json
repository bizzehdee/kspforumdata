It will show you the realtime data on the orbit. Especially useful during ascent is the height of the apoapsis and the time until you reach it. Your goal is to reach the apoapsis with as much horizontal velocity as you can muster. Once the Apoapsis reaches the desired height, usually about 75K, the your focus should be having adequate speed when reaching it. A good way to achieve this is to find the horizontal burn that will \u0022push\u0022 the apoapsis in front of you. If the \u0022time to apoapsis\u0022 is counting down, you need more thrust (or slight inclined upwards if at max thrust). The closer it is to you, the closer to orbital speed you need to be in order to avoid it counting down. Usually, the apoapsis can stay about 0.5-1 minute ahead of you. As you pick up speed, you\u0027ll find that you can be closer and closer to the apoapsis. As you are close to the apoapsis, only the periapsis will be raised by your thrust, thus achieving a circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T18:11:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lightbombs\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lightbombs\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei dont know how to find my rocket\u0027s twr can you tell me please\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get the TWR divide the thrust of a stage by the weight of your rocket:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR = Thrust / (Mass * 9.8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you can use Kerbal Engineer Redux which does the calculation for you in real time\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lightbombs","CreatedById":142510,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:44:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks sooooo much to everyone for helping me out! i can do a good orbit around kerbin now (yay)!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut final question what is a good difference between apoapsis and periapsis for a good orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf an elliptical one is not required I go for around \u0026lt;10% Ap Pe difference for parking orbits, and \u0026lt;1% for permanent ones when I want them pretty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Pe is above 70 km, it\u0027s a good orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn mods like Remote Tech, it is required to achieve multiple very accurately matched launches with as nearly identical orbital periods as possible (eccentricity is not that important).
