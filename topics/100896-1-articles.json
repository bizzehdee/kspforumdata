What polycounts do you aim for? I know this is a very vague question, for that I apologise.\n\nThanks! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T23:58:31Z","Content":"The station modules in FusTek have recesses, rings and cutouts, so I usually use a series of wedge-shaped colliders arranged in circles."},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T01:14:29Z","Content":"A single mesh collider object can have 255 (or maybe 256) faces, but you can have multiple mesh colliders (and multiple primitive colliders).
