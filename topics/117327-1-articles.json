The spaceplane is mounted on top of the rocket, where the usual payload would be. This is actually my attempt to recreate ESA\u0027s Hermes shuttle :\n\n![hermes_4.jpg](http://astrotek.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/hermes_4.jpg)\n\nI\u0027ve successfully built one before the aerodynamic model was patched but now (KSP v1.0.4) I haven\u0027t been able to build one that flies without flipping over... I understand that flipping is caused by the CoL being in front of the CoM so the rocket is naturally unstable, but I haven\u0027t been able to find a workaround to counter that phenomenon... I tried to attach more fins to the bottom of the rocket or/and add tons of SAS but nothing works. The only way I can reach space is to fly it straight up until it leaves the atmosphere which is of course very inneficient... I don\u0027t know if I miss something with the design or if I don\u0027t fly it properly.\n\nDid anyone succeed with this design in KSP V1? Any advice would be much appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T17:29:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 05:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TaoDue**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T17:25:20Z","Content":"Adding larger fins at the bottom should help - you want the rear fins to be enough to more than compensate for the unhelpful wings on the shuttle. On a launcher your strongest control is often the engine gimbals so I advise lighting one or more gimballing engines at launch, don\u0027t launch on SRBs alone even if they have the thrust. The usual advice of never straying too far from the prograde marker applies too."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T17:33:59Z","Content":"I tried doing a DreamChaser replica (which is really a more modern attempt at Hermes, unlike the Hermes the Dreamchaser has been constructed and flown in atmosphere) but it is very difficult to maintain control with those lifting surfaces on top.

I switched out the fins for a few airbrakes. As I found out, there was only a few times where it was difficult to keep from flipping. So on my ascent, if I found the rocket started to wander, I would put the brakes on just for a few seconds to get it to correct itself and then release. Airbrakes were on the bottom where my fins were originally.

The real Hermes would have been a tiny plane on top of a huge rocket.\n\nUnless you build something really ridiculous, the rocket won\u0027t be aerodynamically stable. Even if you add [two sets of giant wings](http://jltsiren.kapsi.fi/ksp/1.0/pol_mission_1.jpeg) to the boosters, the rocket will do its best to flip over.

In this way, the spaceplane acts as the rocket\u0027s tail feathers and all the mass of the rocket is at the top, so it will fly straight. At least given sufficient torque and/or RCS, plus some small (compared to the spaceplane) fins on the nose. This works quite well in 1.0.4.\n\n[![17727503938_80774f4de3_b.jpg](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7781/17727503938_80774f4de3_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/t1w6iC)\n\nIn the above pic, the rocket lifter is an SSTO heaving 2 identical planes AND a full orange tank nuclear tug into LKO. At which point (as shown on the right), TAC Self-Destruct got rid of the lifter.\n\nIf you just want to do a single plane, you can hang it nose-down below the rocket then dock a transfer stage to the plane\u0027s rear end once in LKO. Because this gives a bit of asymmetrical lift, however, it requires the rocket to have more attitude control muscle than when launching a pair of planes.\n\nIt\u0027s a good idea to disable all the control surfaces on the plane(s) before launching.
