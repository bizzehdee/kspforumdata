Maybe this was causing tweakscale to create the bug. I reinstalled everything last night so i will need some time till i get to that rcs wheel who always trips out but there are also other parts affected. But as said need to check if they resurface with the new install. (without tweak everything)\n\nI\u0027ll keep you posted!\n\nThanks for taking time!!\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThis is still happening with the stack RW wheel. RW from MRS works without issue.

I don\u0027t want to scale the cost all that much. Increased complexity is what drives up price most IRL, not so much with scale. I don\u0027t think there needs to be a big differece in cost between different sized tanks. Different sized *engines* however, that I would like to increase with the scale. I\u0027m thinking in a scale that matches the percent scaled in size. Ex. $100 1.25m engine, $150 1.875m engine, $200 2.5m engine, etc. \n\n@scaleTypes: Yup. Neither do I. I made Tantares\\_Default just to have default, and early on in the writing, Tantares\\_SurfAttatch had different scales. They ended up becoming the same thing eventually.\n\nYup. Tightly controlling the scaling factors for each part is tedious, but doable. I\u0027m definitely going to reduce the number of scale types if I can. The user won\u0027t care, but it\u0027ll make it easier to maintain for me in the future. My basic design goals are:\n\n- Scaling pods is allowed, but the hatch can never be smaller than a Kerbal could fit through within reason. Larger hatches are ok, as long as it doesn\u0027t look ridiculusly over-sized.\n- Solar panels, antenna, and other greeble should scale with whatever parts they were originally meant to be attatched to. For example, because the 1x4 Soyuz solar panels were designed to be mounted on the 1.25m Soyuz SM, the solar panels are called 1.25m panels at their default scale. I don\u0027t like % scaling, as it gives the \u0022cheaty\u0022 feeling some complain about.\n- Part cost increases between sizes should be minimal, but present.\n- Tech Tree unlocks for different scales. Not even sure where to begin here. Heh\n\nI\u0027m about to get back into IRL Summer courses here, so my time will be more restricted unfortunately. I\u0027ll probably push one or two more updates, and at least get the thing stable.

Compared to stock behavior, a higher exponent will make small parts cheaper and large parts more expensive. So you will recognize the right scaling by the fact the both up-and downscaled parts have reasonable values. \n\n@part cost increases should be minimal: just be careful not to break the stock balance (unless you also change that). In stock, a large tank or engine is not that much cheaper than a pile of smaller parts with the same performance. for me, errors here feel much more \u0027cheaty\u0027 than a large solar panel that is equivalent to several small ones (in all aspects but part count). \n\n@resource scaling: look into scaleExponents.cfg. Unless you override them, you get the defaults defined there."},{"CreatedByName":"blub01","CreatedById":137083,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T16:36:17Z","Content":"\u003E Any errors or exceptions in the log?
