E.g. lift generated by structural pieces instead of wings.\n\nAll light blue lines in the first image are pretty much symmetrical. In the second there is a very tiny line on the right hand side probably caused by side-slip and your high angle of attack."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T16:03:30Z","Content":"I do\u0027nt think so.

The light blue lines are from body lift. You are getting lines off the FL-T800s as well as the intakes. The intakes are producing body lift because of the way occlusion works\n\nAlso, I think that your second picture is also as Tex says, and it turns out the left side line simply isn\u0027t long enough to come out of the tank. The base of the line actually starts inside the parts (at the origin).\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:46:09Z","Content":"But why those lines goes to the front of the ship ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:51:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But why those lines goes to the front of the ship ?\n\nThey do not.
