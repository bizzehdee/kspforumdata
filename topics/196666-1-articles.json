I like big craft and physically emptying tanks is a giant pain in the butt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only other thing like this that would help are indicators for drag like outside so I can find drag bug from things like clipping and cargo. Basically a wind tunnel or similar simulator. I would think artificially simulating the data with existing displays like when you hit F12 would be easy. It doesn\u0027t need to be live compute. Just enter a variable number to see the end results and the drag values in the vehicle building areas to see the end results and resolve them without having to fly the vehicle. It would make it so much easier to be able to see drag lines inside with a set of given values to see if the drag lines are off of what the should be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-02T07:45:58Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2020 07:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
