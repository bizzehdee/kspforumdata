Check. Handles like a pig. Check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly I haven\u0027t yet discovered how to make this thing useful. However, through the magic of the Spider engine it sort of flaps its wings (because of this sometimes some of the canards clip through and look ungainly see pic #3). It has two Klaws for feet. It can land on them fairly well, best bet for survivability is to rock it onto the \u0022tail feathers\u0022. You may need to retract the gear to unstick it from the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this you can go and Klaw stuff. I assume. I say that, because I\u0027ve tried and I usually end up crashing. So theoretically possible. Practically speaking, I suppose it\u0027s more a barely functional bird sculpture that seats one Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably make a good gatekeeper...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some serious caveats with this if you want to fly it... Namely 20m/s should be seen as Vne. Bad stuff happens when you fly faster, namely an uncontrollable attraction to rapid disassembly through the medium of solid ground. If you want to descend, nope can\u0027t dive. It can only handle gentle, slow, powered descents. It handles like crap. I had a different prototypical variant that didn\u0027t have feathers in the same way - that flew beautifully. So I\u0027ll blame the form over function argument here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETakeoff - EVA from the pod if you don\u0027t use Take Command. Board the seat, stage once to fire up engines and retract the ladder. Let them spool up, then release the launch clamps and fly away. If you are successful in tagging something in the claws, you\u0027ll be able to lift a bit of payload. About 2/3rds throttle will give you liftoff (barely) at launch weights. So there is payload capability, if you can get it into the Klaws - I can\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy crashing.
