I\u0027m running into a minor, but annoying issue. The best way I can describe it is \u0022shadow jitter\u0022. I\u0027ve included a screenshot, but it isn\u0027t the best example, just the one I managed to capture. Basically, shadows on my craft jump back and forth and all over the place. As well, I get weird lines, for example, where the hexagon edges of the different building areas of the KSC meet, I get artifacts. I\u0027ve tried messing around with gfx settings, but to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xj2PLrB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xj2PLrB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is probably the best view of the \u0022lines\u0022 problem. The shadow \u0022jitter\u0022 I tried to capture an image of, but hey, shadows just look like shadows. Has anyone run into this?
