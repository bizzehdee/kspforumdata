Rosetta and Philae are two spacecraft currently investigating the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Rosetta is the orbiter, while a few months ago Philae became the first spacecraft to land on a comet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECraft Info\u003C/strong\u003E: 137 parts, 4.4 tons, 700 m/s of dv.
