I tried pretty much all of the engines I had (stock, KW, and KM), and the only useful scenario I was able to find was for low altitude stages; however, SRBs are so cheap, and liquid fuel tanks so expensive, SRBs have universally outshined them as an early launch solution in practical situations. Might just be SRBs are under-priced, or IRL factors ignored (vibration, reliability, etc) which would normally counter this. The lack of a sizable Aerospike has also hindered my preference towards Hydrolox, as it seems it\u0027s best use would be for early stages where the Aerospike shines, but only a 1.25m Aerospike engine is available baring obscure/outdated, unsupported mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom suggestion; Argon is used by a number of mods, if convenient it would be nice to have as a fuel in the core pack, though I understand if you\u0027d rather not include it (the stock ion engine could use it, you know \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I am fiddling with MM comfigs for tank weight based on surface area and mass, rather than volume. Moreover, different tanks having different attributes; for example, Unpressurized tanks only hold liquids, while pressurized tanks can hold either, but tend to weigh slightly more, and hold less volume (rounded or spheroid in shape). Spherical tanks in general are the lightest for their volume, having the least surface area. Then there is the matter of cryogenics; they are all heavier due to insulation, but sometimes extreme cryogenics which are actively cooled are required to avoid boil-off, and alternatively, maybe the player could sacrifice insulation to save weight when the stage will be immediately used. These are things I am fiddling with on the side, currently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, would there be any way to have tech level default to the highest level available, or alternatively just update to the higher level and not show up in the GUI?

What set of engine configs are you using?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What size engine are you testing with? And payload? If you\u0027re using a 3.75 medium-height tank (which is what, 40 tons or so wet?), then you probably want about 300-400kN of engine to go with it (call it 0.5t dry mass) at ~450s Isp, and maybe 4t of payload. Assuming ~5% for tank mass, that means a mass ratio of 7.55 and a total delta V of just shy of 9km/sec. Even if you quadruple the payload (to 16 tons) you still get over 5km/sec of delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re testing with more engine or more payload, it\u0027s not going to work well; hydrolox stages are best for orbital applications where burn length matters less so dry mass can be minimized (in this case it\u0027s a burn time of 7\u002B minutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*All* tanks are pressure vessels, which means tank dry mass does scale with volume (although insulation does scale with surface area so it\u0027s more like vol^.95 or something). Even pump-fed engines need a fair amount of pressure in the tank. Obviously highly-pressurized tanks will have a higher structural fraction, as you point out--look at the mass ratio of the Able/Delta upper stage if you want to weep (22% or so, vs. ~5-6% for a pump-fed stage; now, some of that\u0027s RCS and avionics, of course, which are absent or a lower relative amount for a larger lower stage). The ServiceModule tank type is for that type of stage; Default is for storables or mildly-cryogenic liquids (or very early cryogenic tanks); Cryogenic is for 1970s\u002B cryogenic tanks.

While spheres are slightly stronger (relatively) than capsule tanks, they\u0027re also more expensive and not as useful. So a purely spherical tank should mass something like 70% of a capsule tank, but it will also lead to poorer volume utilization (and thus a higher structure:tank mass ratio) than a capsule tank, so that evens out some.
