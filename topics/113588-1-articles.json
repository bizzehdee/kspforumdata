In N body physics, there\u0027s no clear boundaries between bodies, which results in zones where several parent bodies cancels out their influences (lagrangian points)\n\nNow, patched conic orbits are calculated from, obviously, cones ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) the \u0027parent body\u0027 \u0027point mass\u0027 is the spike of the cone.

( F = (G\\*M\\*m)/(r^2) ). if you are doing interplanetary stuff or going to a moon you use a system called patched conics for the preliminary orbit design, so you look at the orbit of an object until you reach the edge of a SoI, then switch SoIs and look at the orbit there, until you reach your destination. then you combine (Patch) all the individual conic sections together into one overall picture. that is why it is called Patched conics.\n\nJust as an aside when go from earth to mars (IRL) you look at 3 different SoI, the Earth, the Sun, then Mars. The math behind it is reasonably simple, but can be confusing.\n\nIf you were to look at the more complex method then you have to do n-body physics which is very hard. the Forces due to gravity only become F = (G\\*M\\*m)/(r^2) \u002B (G\\*M\\*m)/(r^2) \u002B (G\\*M\\*m)/(r^2) \u002B (G\\*M\\*m)/(r^2) \u002B ... which is very very hard to solve."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T17:04:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E sgt\\_flyer\u0027s video has the typical terrible rubber sheet explanation for gravity.
