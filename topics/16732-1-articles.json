This is issue is when to engage my rocket engines to go into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first, I would go to about 11-13km at an angle of attack of 60*; when I noticed the Prograde marker start falling I would engage rockets and burn into orbit. Though this got the job done I couldn\u0027t help but feel that I didn\u0027t really use the full potential of my Air Breathing engines. Later on I tried for a more horizontal angle of attack, but then realised that, while I had a faster velocity when I engaged my rockets, I would lose quite a bit of Delta V to atmospheric drag and gravity loss (At least, I think that is what it was). Still, I was able to make it into a sub-orbital trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, how do YOU do it? Do you go for a sharp angle of attack and maximise your rockets? Do you go more horizontal? Both? Neither?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I make any sense?

Then I burn until I have a circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, I don\u0027t actually have any air breathing engines on my plane.

My current space plane flies to about 12km at 70-80 degrees at which point it reaches 220 m/s, I fire my Rockets and then start trying to do a gravity turn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis weekend I will be designing a second SSTO Space plane to see if I can increase my efficiencies and my skills.
