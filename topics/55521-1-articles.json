My pods are mostly inspired by real world spacecraft and given a Kerbalized twist. The 1.875m parts in the pack allow for you to build medium sized rockets, for those times when the standard tanks are too small and rockomax is too big. The tanks are themed liked the Soyuz and Long March rockets, giving your space agency an all new feel. There\u0027s also a few odds and ends thrown in for good measure. These parts have been balanced for career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bddXHa5.jpg?1\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bddXHa5.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/FXlrA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
