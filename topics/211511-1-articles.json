A couple of old usb Atari joysticks, and a usb numb pad with printed stickers on it. Mounted to a left over Ikea shelf with a little usb hub (hidden). A square piece of metal tube for cable management. Probably only about $60 all together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got the Atari sticks years ago and it looks like they\u0027re hard to find now. If you\u0027re looking to build your own, (and as I\u0027ve already bough myself for a possible version 2) I recommend getting some arcade cabinet joysticks. I feel these style of joysticks work better for KSP than flight sim joysticks (Ask me why). They can be called 4 way / 8 way joysticks, fighting game joysticks, or arcade cabinet joysticks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re looking for a no fuss plug and play option, I recommend getting a two player arcade game controller (comes with two sticks and buttons ready to go). If you\u0027re looking to be fancy, you can get a pair of these style joysticks from arcade parts suppliers for like $80.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe num pad is a cheap $10 one from any computer store. Printed out the buttons on a sheet of vinyl sticker from a local UPS/print shop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything is screwed down to the Ikea shelf, except the keyboard, which is part of my normal set up and sits on the board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe expensive and not so necessary piece is the Stream Deck. But it\u0027s super neat. The buttons are screens, so it can be programmed to change. Comes with really good macro software that can do stuff like click the mouse at a specific part of the screen in addition to normal button presses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
