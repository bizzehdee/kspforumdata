Just stick the phrase \u003Cem\u003EAll Rights Reserved\u003C/em\u003E somewhere in your download and your forum thread. This allows you to retain all relevant rights to your work, and grants \u003Cem\u003Eno rights\u003C/em\u003E to anyone else.

This means someone could modify your work, sell it, or use it to develop nuclear weapons - all without giving you any credit!

Also, I can explain my perspective though I can\u0027t explain that for others as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy knowledge of programming has been accumulated across many years of intermittent study and practice. When I get started on it, I devote a lot of time to it and much of what can be learned from a textbook and taken at face value on faith that the book is correct, I\u0027ve produced by sheer tenacity and learned the hard way. You can see why that would lead to many false starts on projects and stretch the time it has taken me to acquire practically applicable proficiency. Though now, I\u0027ve met a standard I set for myself years ago: I\u0027ve accomplished something in code that one I\u0027d consider more knowledgeable has said is impossible, and it only took a few days\u0027 tinkering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, where does this put me as a budding developer? I have no releases to point to yet, nothing on Github to showcase my skills, no resume in programming, and my academic credentials in the subject consist of a whopping one class on fundamental concepts that could have as easily been taught using Basic as C\u002B\u002B. I am under no delusions that I am desirable as an asset to any company yet. So, my next milestone is something worthwhile for a portfolio, and the milestone after that is to prove myself an asset. So, wouldn\u0027t it be pretentious of me to worry about whether somebody out there makes money with my code? It would only be beneficial to us both if anybody did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, bring in KSP. The game has motivated and inspired me, so for love of something fun and challenging, I want to do something challenging to help others have fun. My project is one inspired by sheer good will and recreation; not some serious research project or commercial product in development. It\u0027s a toy, even if it\u0027s a toy with potential applications for more than just KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is probably a very different perspective from that held by one who understands the nuances of various licenses and the practical consequences of departing from standards thereupon, and I can\u0027t say with certainty but would wager that for many mod developers, it\u0027s exactly the same. They work out of love for a recreational outlet, and build their skills from that frame of reference. As such, for those of us writing from this perspective, it would be awesome to have a license that better reflects our intentions. See, we could write one up ourselves, but it would be practically meaningless, and we could borrow parts from existing licenses, but we wouldn\u0027t understand all the ramifications of such in practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-29T05:42:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2013 05:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by silent_gnomore\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ea stray apostrophe\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jasmir","CreatedById":76744,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T16:59:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust my 2cents:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think, especialy the GPL licences is the best for mods.
