As a personal rule I only use your cryo tanks within payload fairings (since they *look* like they\u0027re not meant to be aerodynamic, even if the game\u0027s physics doesn\u0027t care), but I\u0027ve always been interested in using cryo engines for transfer stages and not just payloads.  I was always hesitant to patch all the other tanks to support cooling (since then there\u0027d be no point in having dedicated cryo tanks), but the extra power consumption is a nice way to balance it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Nertea said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Fixed science costs of many tanks\n\u003E \n\nWow.
