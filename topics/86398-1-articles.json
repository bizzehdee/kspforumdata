Why can\u0027t anything go right? How hard is it to have a cool looking SSTO? I have been trying to get the original craft file of EE\u0027s fighter, but old B9 save breaking BS has kept me from loading it. And it\u0027s only three errored parts, the lights an landing gear. I tried to delete the offending parts, but it broke the SPH. So I had to make a new save. I built a replica with BD Armory, B9, and KSPI, but it does not fly well at all. It goes into a flat spin, and has a tendency to pitch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UU_lkYO1SiTqRAD_ou1Tk4Eg\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi61.tinypic.com/dmfl0l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dmfl0l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi58.tinypic.com/j0fojl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022j0fojl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi61.tinypic.com/dmfl0l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dmfl0l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-08T00:35:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2014 12:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by WhiteWeasel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T00:01:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has a tendency to pitch down because the CoM is below the CoL.
