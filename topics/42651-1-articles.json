A pure gravity assist uses only the gravity of a body to change the direction of the spacecraft trajectory. The change in direction is limited by the mass of the body, and how closely it can be approached. An aerogravity assist uses a closer approach to the planet, dipping into the atmosphere, so the spacecraft can also use aerodynamic lift to further curve the trajectory. This enables the spacecraft to deflect through a larger angle, resulting in a higher delta-v (change in velocity). This in turn allows a shorter travel time, a larger payload fraction of the spacecraft, or a smaller spacecraft for a given payload.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe related techniques of aerocapture, aerobraking, and atmospheric re-entry also attempt to use the body\u0027s atmosphere to help reduce propulsion requirements.

You\u0027d have to note exactly where the manouver node is supposed to be. Also to be fair, your fuelgauge wasn\u0027t showing so I didn\u0027t know if you\u0027d used fuel or not, so I couldn\u0027t figure out if it was supposed to be a unpowered manouver or not (hence my question).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould\u0027ve probably been easier to decouple the engine before posting the save, and explaining where the manouver node is to be set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: After a bit of testing, if we have to manually put the manouver node down around minute 39 as per your screenshot, the delta-v requirement for an encounter can differ up toward 30-40m/s within one minute.
