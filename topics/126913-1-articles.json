It would be better to have better designed science, and have as much as possible \u003Cem\u003Eactually be useful to the player\u003C/em\u003E. For example, a scansat-like form of mapping, and have the mapping adjust how far you can zoom in in map view. High enough res imagery, and you can zoom 1:1 in map view to plan landing sites, etc (maybe including the ability to drop markers you can target). Bodies that should have dense clouds, like Eve, could require a radar mapper. Atmospheric data gathering could unlock the ability to accurately plot your path through the atmosphere to allow more accurate landings.
