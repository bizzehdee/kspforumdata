I am 72 hours into KSP and still have not completed a docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to figure out if this is a bug or what, but basically my ships just bounce off each other\u0027s docking ports. By that I mean, I have them aligned near perfection and am in docking mode, and using RCS. I can sit two ships on top of each other and park them better than an astronaut. BUT, when my dock ports meet, nothing happens. If I have any inertia going into it, they will bounce away as tho I\u0027d bumped any random parts together in space. There is no \u0022alert\u0022 or message or any indication I am near docking. Every video I\u0027ve seen of this and every tutorial I\u0027ve read lists what you have to do like there\u0027s even an easy way to do it. I haven\u0027t seen a single video mention opening my ports or even if the \u0022covered\u0022 white docking ports are backwards compatible with the other \u0022non-covered\u0022 port. I\u0027m nearing the end of my patience here and just shelving this game until they get closer to a release condition. Any ideas? Can the covered ports dock with the uncovered ports? Can a \u0022Jr.\u0022 port dock with a covered port? I cannot find that information anywhere.
