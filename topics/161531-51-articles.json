Using the thermal *rocket* engine causes my framerates to tank *majorly*. Only this one engine. Replace with a thermal turbojet, problem solved - and the thermal rocket only seems to exhibit this problem when I\u0027m using Mechjeb\u0027s ascent guidance, which is also very very weird.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m surprised MechJeb\u0027s ascent guidance doesn\u0027t tank your framerates with the Thermal Turbojet as well (are you using it in internal propellant mode?) Under-the-hood, the way atmospheric ISP is calculated is now quite different than most rockets...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause a thermal rocket nozzle can be used with a variety of heat exchanger temperatures and power-levels (even different power-levels at the same HX temperature- as with Microwave Thermal rockets receiving different amounts of beamed power) it was necessary to make use of a more realistic calculation for atmospheric vs vacuum ISP to not get ridiculous results- especially in certain edge cases (you can blame me- this was my idea- and one I\u0027m still rather proud of...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of an engine losing a certain percentage of its ISP at sea-level based purely on the part and/or fuel-mode, thermal rockets and turbojets (when in internal propellant mode- the code is quite different for atmospheric propulsion), it loses ISP due to the relation between its thrust and the physical size of the rocket nozzle. Thus, a 10 GW Hydrogen-propelled Microwave Thermal Rocket is going to lose a much smaller percentage of its thrust at sea-level than a 1 MW Nitrogen-propelled Microwave Thermal Rocket of the same size nozzle, despite the Nitrogen having a much higher molecular weight (14x to be precise), due to the much higher volumetric flow and thus mass flow rate and exhaust-pressure through the 10 GW Microwave Thermal Rocket. If we had fixed ISP-loss to fuel-mode instead, then the Hydrogen-propelled rocket would have lost a much higher percentage of its thrust at sea level than the Nitrogen-propelled rocket, despite having an insanely higher exhaust-pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf none of that makes sense to you, don\u0027t worry.\u003C/strong\u003E Here\u0027s a really simple explanation of how ISP-loss due to atmosphere ACTUALLY works, though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine the atmosphere pushing against an invisible wall around the bottom of your exhaust nozzle. The exhaust stream in turn pushes back. Whichever has the higher pressure tends to win...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the atmosphere has higher pressure than your exhaust, then it compresses your exhaust stream (and pushes its way into the exhaust nozzle itself if the difference is great enough) and causes your rocket to lose a lot of thrust. This is known as an \u0022over-expanded\u0022 exhaust stream (see the part on expansion-ration below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if the exhaust stream pushes back with a higher pressure, then it tends to continue to expand past the end of the nozzle, and prevents the atmosphere from sapping nearly as much thrust from the rocket (the stronger the inequality the lower the thrust-loss). However, since the exhaust pressure was stronger than it needed to be to stop the atmosphere from compressing the exhaust stream inwards, you would have been better off with an even larger expansion-ratio exhaust nozzle. Such a case is known as an \u0022under-expanded\u0022 exhaust stream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Exhaust nozzles act to expand the exhaust- reducing pressure but producing additional thrust from the expansion by increasing the exhaust-velocity... The ratio of initial exhaust size at the nozzle \u0022throat\u0022 to final size at the end of the nozzle is called \u0022expansion ratio\u0022 and determines how much pressure is reduced and the velocity increased...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, in practice, most real-world rockets over-expand their exhaust-stream: even launch-engines that are used off the ground. This is because as you ascend, atmospheric pressure goes down, and the ideal expansion-ratio goes up as you need less exhaust pressure to counteract the ambient atmospheric pressure. Since rockets tend to go UP, it only makes sense to design them to optimize for the highest *average* ISP over their ascent, rather than the highest ISP right on the launchpad...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Put another way, as you expand an exhaust stream more and more, the atmospheric ISP at a given altitude goes up until you reach the point where exhaust pressure equals ambient pressure, after which point the stream becomes over-expanded and the atmospheric ISP at that altitude declines. However, vacuum ISP *always* increases as you increase your expansion-ratio: which is one reason rocket engines heavily specialized for extra-atmospheric use tend to have very large engine nozzles and very high vacuum ISP\u0027s, but very poor sea-level ISP\u0027s...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this has led to the creation of variable-area rocket nozzles in real life: that is rocket nozzles that become LARGER as you ascend (usually by mechanically deploying a telescoping sheet of metal from the initial engine bell as the rocket climbs). Which would be a pretty cool thing to include in KSP-Interstellar for the thermal rockets, but something I don\u0027t necessarily forsee us working on anytime soon... (it would ideally require some sophisticated animations- which is something neither myself nor FreeThinker are particularly good at...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to the main point- MechJeb is probably tanking your framerate because it\u0027s going absolutely bonkers with the changing ISP (and thus Thrust) as you ascend being governed by a *very* different set of equations under-the-hood than anything it\u0027s used to (or code for) from stock or even RealFuels (*although*, RealFuels is about to undergo a MAJOR change to the way they calculate their atmospheric ISP in the next release- it\u0027s possible they were inspired by our code to release something even more sophisticated/realistic, or something basically on the same level as our math/code...) You could have the MechJeb creator take a look at our atmospheric Thrust/ISP code- despite the increased complexity of explanation, the actual math is actually no more complex than what goes into stock of RealFuels- it\u0027s just very different (and better), and thus it should be easy enough to release an update coding around it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ss8913\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ss8913\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2.
