That means all those experiments are already unlocked by the time you get there. Apart from gravioli which is in a parallel slot.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Service bays are already planned (see to do list/road map on first page). Due to the way KSP deals with node and my lack of programming skill, there won\u0026#39;t be all those sizes. I can do one node size, half level including core and full level. I need to verify but I am pretty sure it would be problematic with obstructed free nodes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Half bottom and half top module don\u0026#39;t cost anything as they use the same mesh and the same texture space. So AFAIK they shouldn\u0026#39;t be a problem memory-wise and so are included free of charge to avoid users to deal with orientation.

I completely forgot to test it and it\u0026#39;s very important. So I had a look this evening and the only workaround I could find is to replace the part ID in contracts.cfg .

Somehow it doesn\u0026#39;t seem to accept having multiple part ID. When I do that it doesn\u0026#39;t offer those contracts anymore. [B]But I repeat that this means every satellite contract will need the OctoSat part to fulfill those science requirements ( the stock experiment won\u0026#39;t fulfill the contract) if that modification is applied[/B].
