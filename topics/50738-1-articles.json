Don\u0027t split them up to mount them on say, the capsule and the rest on the lower body. The differential in inertia can tear the lander apart. The capsule will survive but might get seperated from the rest of the ship. KISS (Keep it simple). You will need between 1500 and 2000 m/s of DV to get back in orbit. Drogues are a good idea. Since the atmosphere is thin, you need to put more parachutes than you would on kerbin or keep some fuel to do a burn near landing to drop before 10 m/s. If you\u0027re interested I can send you two .craft files for landers that work very well on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T05:22:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TechnicalK3rbal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TechnicalK3rbal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there any way to figure out if a lander will be able to land on and return from a planets surface?
