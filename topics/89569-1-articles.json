While building a vessel - no matter what type of it - my lift rating indicator will not move. At first i though it\u0027s just a glitch, but it persisted through several gamesaves: planes have a visible issue with steering, both stabilizers and winglets do not work.

There\u0027s a thread for those on the addon release forums.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is more accurate to say Ferram intentionally disabled FAR/NEAR for x64 due to all the \u0022bug reports\u0022 which were just more x64 instability. For the benefit of Stikkkychaos: Ferram is hardly the only modder to have done this; the instability of the Windows x64 distribution is common, and there are enough entitled idiots with x64 issues to cause every modder headaches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESenshi has released an x64-enabled version of NEAR. If you download this, do be aware that Ferram will not support you, and Senshi will probably not support you either, because Windows x64 is a buggy piece of crap. The alternatives are to use Active Texture Management to reduce RAM consumption, which should allow you to play 32-bit with a bigger stack of mods, or take the dive and install Linux, whose 64-bit distribution has so far been rock-solid. That, or just not play with so many mods. This issue will be resolved when the Windows x64 release\u0027s stability problems are resolved, and modders no longer get stupid bug reports from people who are simply running into x64 issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stikkychaos","CreatedById":128396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T13:50:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, neither Google nor forum search seems to locate the fix...
