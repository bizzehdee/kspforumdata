Past mach 0.9, the drag curve would remain the same, so rockets and supersonic flyers would act the same.

I have on occasion built subsonic planes that could circumnavigate Kerbin on very little fuel (Wheesleys are amazingly economic, although Panthers in dry mode offer other advantages at almost the same fuel economy). It\u0027s just tedious to do in 3\u002B hours what can be done in under an hour if pushed supersonic instead, so not a lot of people do that out of habit. And I don\u0027t know for sure if it ends up using less fuel, but I do know that in the case of spaceplanes it\u0027s worth at times pushing right up or through supersonic in dry mode when using Panthers instead of lighting the afterburners from the very start. What you may be seeing is that in general, supersonic craft fly significantly higher than subsonic - and altitude definitely makes jets more economic in their fuel consumption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure what you mean by not gaining speed at altitude - if that were a fundamental problem in KSP,\u00A0 none of us would be able to make working spaceplanes in the stock game. Jets do have imposed operating ceilings and power curves, yes, but that\u0027s a simulation choice and somewhat akin how real engines work. It\u0027s not that difficult to cruise at 10\u002B km on Kerbin with most stock jets - which if you consider Kerbin\u0027s scale compared to Earth is way higher than what most conventional or even experimental jets can do. 10km or 33000 feet is where jet liners tend to fly, but that\u0027s on a planet roughly 10x the size of Kerbin. On Kerbin, that\u0027d be the equivalent of 1km (or 1.75km) up... all stock jets fly well at that altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also don\u0027t recognize the second point you make: slow take-off rolls are almost childishly easy to achieve in KSP, ironically in part due to high drag, which you are suggesting should be lowered. You almost have to be careful to not make your plane flip backwards at take-off. Or even before starting to roll... (just place your main gear a little too close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E). And speed does generally build up as altitude increases, even for Wheesleys; atmosphere density drops faster in the first few km than the jet power curves, so for most planes it\u0027s immediately beneficial to get out of the lower draggy atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a lot of well-performing (space)planes being shared every day; here, on KerbalX, on Steam. Which tells me a lot of KSP plane builders are not held back by the current stock parameters.
