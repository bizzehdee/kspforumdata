It\u0027s one of the things that works with gravitation only. If the objects were charged and the force was electrical, orbiting would emit energy in the form of photons because the body is constantly accelerating (although the scalar stays the same, the vector changes its value, so it\u0027s some kind of acceleration) and the body would lose height, eventually colliding with the main body. It was a huge problem in the earlier days of atomic theory because electrons were thought to be orbiting the nucleus, and should therefore crash into the nucleus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBohr postulated \u0022they orbit and they don\u0027t lose energy\u0022 just to make his atomic model. It was later discovered that electrons in atoms are standing waves called orbitals, so they don\u0027t lose energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
