You can probably guess that a lot of real life stuff got in the way, and though I have been continuing to play KSP off and on, I didn\u0027t feel motivated to maintain a series like that anymore.\n\nBut I\u0027ve decided to change that, because I\u0027ve got a plan. My eyes are on the red planet.\n\nI\u0027ve constructed a mothership in Kerbin orbit, losely based on the design of the Ares 3 from the upcoming film The Martian.\n\n![the-martian-ares-3-trailer-0.jpg](http://www.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/12/files/2015/06/the-martian-ares-3-trailer-0.jpg)\n\n![J7FvGI9.png](http://i.imgur.com/J7FvGI9.png)\n\nI\u0027ve used more mods than I care to count, including Infernal Robotics to spin the huge centrifuge arms, rotate the satellite dishes, and to give it an articulated robotic arm.\n\n![KFYhMK5.png](http://i.imgur.com/KFYhMK5.png)\n\nIn addition to the mothership (name still undecided) to carry the crew to Duna and back, my mission plan also calls for a lander, hab, and rover to be sent to Duna separately, and an ISRU lander to harvest Hydrogen from Ike for the return to Kerbin.\n\n![OkN9SzU.png](http://i.imgur.com/OkN9SzU.png)\n\nThis will not be a career mode mission, and there won\u0027t be any science to collect (except in the narrative of the episodes)\n\nI\u0027m not sure when I\u0027ll be getting around to the first installment, but I\u0027m considering adding some video to the episodes so it may take me a bit to learn.\n\nI just hope I\u0027m not getting in over my head with this one.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T20:57:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 08:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jfull**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T12:38:19Z","Content":"Good luck with it.

It also has the added benefit of integrated landing thrusters.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any feedback on which rover they\u0027d rather see."}]}
