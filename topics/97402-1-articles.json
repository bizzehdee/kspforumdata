For things like Gravioli and Atmospheric Scan reports, the transmission time is significantly faster with the more advanced antennae. They are more expensive in terms of charge per packet, so if you\u0027re not worried about time, the Communotron 16 is still technically better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T08:15:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs its the difference between taking a few seconds to send data and a few seconds more then I agree there\u0027s little point in using other than the Communotron 16.
