In your case I would guess that it is not pulling in the text string right for some reason. Whatever the case, use the right click menus rather than trying to use keyboard shortcuts. There are more options available that way anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep an eye out for the mod to update. When a new version is pushed, depending on what changes in the code a plugin may do anything from not loading, to loading with really weird things happening, to being perfectly fine. And unfortunately sometimes it is not obvious what has to be fixed in the programming to make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizwalker","CreatedById":78337,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T19:58:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
