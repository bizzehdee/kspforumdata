My personal opinion is that autopilot functions should be game rewards that are deliberately held back to encourage players to try doing some of these things manually first and reward players who can.

My feeling is there are actual qualitative differences between getting to orbit, docking, precision landing in vacuum, and precision landing in atmo--even with all the data tools imaginable--that make some tasks genuinely more difficult and more time-consuming to achieve than others. No one would deny that landing on a moving target that\u0027s 20m across is harder than landing on a stationary target thats 1km across. They both require practice, but one requires much more practice than the other. Getting to orbit isn\u0027t easy, but it has the advantage that you can overbuild and loosely approximate a gravity turn and you\u0027ll get there. Docking is definitely harder, even with tools, but it has the advantage that there\u0027s no hard clock ticking. You\u0027re not burning away \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E every millisecond as you adjust. You can take your time and approach slowly. Similarly landing within half a km of your target on Minmus takes a little practice, the Mun takes a little more, and Tylo takes much more.\u00A0And of course, with enough practice and with all the necessary tools I completely agree everyone could land on a drone ship off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. The question is HOW much practice, and how likely is it that 50% of players are willing to invest that kind of time mastering an incredibly fine-tuned skill that even with all the mods in the world even we--a razor thin\u00A0set of veteran players who have played KSP obsessively\u00A0for many years--find pretty effing hard? I suspect it is not likely at all. I think it is very easy to say \u0022I did it, everyone can.\u0022 And you\u0027re right! But you may be expecting a much higher level of patience and and time than most people are willing to invest. And those people \u003Cem\u003Ealso aren\u0027t wrong\u003C/em\u003E. They\u0027re players too, and we all deserve a chance to play this game and learn and have fun. So, by all means, reward players for landing hyper-precisely! But don\u0027t make building colonies and recovering boosters dependent on a skill most players won\u0027t achieve, and don\u0027t waste player time on something that might be better spent on building cool colonies, going interstellar, and all of the other fun things KSP could deliver.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nbtw I love yall and this is one of my favorite debates so don\u0027t take any of this as disparagement.
