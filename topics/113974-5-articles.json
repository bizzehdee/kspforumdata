The sodium floodlights cast the world in a sickly yellow pallor, and drowned out most of the stars overhead. Her EVA suit didn\u0027t fit well, it had been specially constructed for Dibella before EVA was removed from her flight plan, and Valentina was smaller still. The folds and bunches made her squirm restlessly in the unpadded seat as the ute bounced along. Or maybe it was her stomach after all. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You not have to do this,\u0022 Igor said from behind the wheel, seeming to note her discomfort. He looked unusually unsettled as well, if not truly nervous, but that was impossible, not Igor. Except... Except it felt like she hadn\u0027t seen him in days, longer even. Was that true? Or was it just another effect of...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course I do,\u0022 Valentina said, still staring ahead at the rocket, then more softly, \u0022I have to.\u0022 Tercella hadn\u0027t argued the point when she\u0027d returned. Moving about outside a spacecraft was difficult, but it could be \u003Cem\u003Elearned\u003C/em\u003E. A pilot\u0027s eye, a pilot\u0027s feel... that could be honed, but not taught. Not in mere hours, at least. And of course, there were other concerns...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ute squeaked to a halt at the base of the gantry tower. Technicians ran, truly ran, every which way, straining to accomplish in hours what was planned over days. Clouds of drifting fog and faint hissing lent an unearthly feel to the launchpad. With the setting of the sun and clearing skies, the temperature had plummeted, squeezing the moisture out of the air and coating nearly every surface in sparkling white frost. It was risky to launch like this, they all knew it, but for the moment, fear of risk had vanished along with the day\u0027s clouds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You will come back,\u0022 Igor said grimly as Valentina struggled from her seat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I will,\u0022 she said, and hoped she managed a smile. As she stepped from the seat, her motion abruptly stopped from an irresistible force around her arm. She turned to find Igor gripping it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0come back, or I must see Kommissar.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe managed a real smile this time, \u0022and you do not like to see Kommissar.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003ENo one\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like to see Kommissar.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes,\u0022 Valentina said, looking up at the towering rocket bathed in ice and light, \u0022yet it seems like no one ever does.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Trust me, it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0better than the alternative,\u0022 Tercella said as she approached, carrying Valentina\u0027s helmet, \u0022here, I have made some adjustments. You should not have the same problems I did.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, I will have all new ones,\u0022 Valentina smirked as she took it. Tercella just frowned at her. She turned the helmet over in her hands, it seemed far too large, but had gained a thick leather-covered pad at the back and a switch that flicked on bright new lights.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is a helmet that fits a female\u0027s head really too much to ask?\u0022 Tercella grunted, \u0022it feels like being in a fish bowl. The pad should help. I do not know how well the lights will hold up in space, but they are worth a try. There is a double lock on the faceplate now, too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina opened her mouth to say something, but Tercella grabbed her arm and was nearly dragging her towards the gantry elevator, \u0022come, time is short.

She took the helmet and gently set it on Valentina\u0027s collar, securing the latches, then went about checking the seals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There are snacks in bin TK-421,\u0022 the grin became a fragile smile, \u0022the survival kit is overhead next to the hatch, and the floatation vest is under your seat.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina smiled back, \u0022D\u0424--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u0424on\u0027t say it,\u0022 Tercella held up a finger, \u0022I \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0see you back here. \u003Cem\u003EBoth\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of you.

Awkwardly, due to the enormous space helmet. Valentina stepped into the elevator car, slid the gate shut, and waved as it ascended into the floodlights.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElectric motors whined and fittings hissed as she was drawn up the flank of the rocket, its usually drab green skin now entirely white with frost and trailing tendrils of heavy mist. Strange forms shimmered and danced as it drifted by the floodlights. Upward she went, the lift seeming to take an very long time. This was the tallest rocket in the Union, probably in the world, but as the writhing shapes in the fog beckoned, Valentina wondered if it \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0just her nerves.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust nerves.

A handful of technicians in white scrubs greeted Valentina, waited respectfully for her to step off the lift, then took her place and descended back into the fog. All except...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Comrade Kerbonaut.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe timid technician was standing nervously next to the open hatch of \u003Cem\u003EZarya\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I... was not expecting to see you up here,\u0022 Valentina said, somewhat confused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll be finishing your briefing,\u0022 he gestured awkwardly towards the waiting hatch, \u0022emphasis on the \u0027brief\u0027 part.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina thought his smile looked a bit forced. She approached and slipped into the conical capsule and down into the left seat with relative ease, despite the bulky, ill-fitting space suit. She took a moment look the interior over, and pause for breath.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNearly every surface of the forward section was covered in switches, knobs, or dials. Several of which were missing. Her old, ironically named Orbiter had seemed rather spacious in comparison, being little more than an empty sphere with a few boxes. This... this was not exactly cramped, but \u003Cem\u003Efull\u003C/em\u003E. There was space to move around up front, but only \u003Cem\u003Eenough\u003C/em\u003E, the rest filled with equipment and more switches. She knew what they were for. Well, most of them. Probably. But laying here on her back, it was all just a bit...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Overwhelming?\u0022 Timid stuck his head in the wide hatch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Er, yes..,\u0022 Valentina said cautiously, \u0022hours in that mockup... and I do not feel like I have retained a thing, now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um...

Here, there was a small, square vestibule, just enough for two Kerbals to stretch out in. The sides were lined with dozens of marked bins and more equipment, and of course, at the very back...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What about this?\u0022 Valentina said, eyeing the other Kerbal, \u0022is it... safe?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe was pointing to the large, round hatch at the back of the capsule. The hatch... the \u003Cem\u003Ehole\u003C/em\u003E... in the heat shield.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um, well, that\u0027s one thing this flight was meant to verify,\u0022 he said sheepishly, \u0022but don\u0027t worry, all the suborbital tests worked. It\u0027ll weld its self shut on reentry. Probably. But don\u0027t try to open it in flight, the crew tunnel back there is just a placeholder, and the pressure differential would...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stared at him flatly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTimid chuckled, and began nervously scratching at the back of his head, \u0022y\u0027know, it\u0027s kind of funny, the Foreigners got wind of it, some photos of the mock up got leaked,\u00A0but they never could figure it out. Or the docking port at the back. That\u0027s not installed either.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina continued to stare. He didn\u0027t seem to notice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Someone decided to mess with them,\u0022 he chortled again, \u0022fed them some false info.

You\u0027ll be on the return capsule\u0027s reentry reserves the whole time. That, and the chest packs. Should be enough but you\u0027ll be cutting it close. As soon as Dibella\u0027s on board you\u0027ll need to start the landing sequence.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina huffed, \u0022right. This, I know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, uh, pretty much everyone in the world with a short wave and binoculars will be watching out for you. Most of them are friendly. But, um, if you end up in a bad place like Cerima...\u0022 Valentina craned back to look at him, \u0022there\u0027s explosives and instructions in bin TK-420. But try not to mix them up with the snacks in the next bin, they taste about the same, also--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, how do you know \u003Cem\u003Ethat?!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Er, don\u0027t ask,\u0022 that sheepish grin again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina sat back, and let her eyes wander over the panels as Timid droned on about things that had already been explained. Irritation was creeping into her mind again. The voice was still there, but she\u0027d been so busy these last hours she\u0027d barely heard it. It would be a long flight, alone with her thoughts. Still... she was beginning to find a certain comfort with the \u0022just right\u0022 space of the craft. It was familiar, like the cockpit of an airplane. She couldn\u0027t remember the last time she\u0027d been--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait, what?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey,\u0022 Valentina broke into the other Kerbal\u0027s stream, \u0022what is \u003Cem\u003Ethis?\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 She pointed to a mostly rectangular metal box low on the panel between the seats. Black and yellow hash marks adorned one side, an odd little antenna stuck up from the top, and on the other side were two large, round lights, one green, and one red. Had it been there a minute ago?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, um, that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eit\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EIt\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EIt\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s so secret we\u0027re not even allowed to talk about it...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina glared at him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Er, well, I suppose you fall under \u0027need to know,\u0027 now.

One day when she came to trade, the men were waiting for her, and the last of her old life dropped away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Coming up on staging... MECO in \u003Cem\u003Etree... dva... od\u00E9en...\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor an instant, Valentina was shoved forward in her harness, then slammed back into her seat as the separation motors pushed the stages apart. Four loud, simultaneous bangs, and the inert abort motors fell away, the upper stage now continuing on its single sustainer engine with glassy smoothness.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStages, yes. It just wouldn\u0027t do for one so young to be alone, that\u0027s what they\u0027d told her. Especially one with \u003Cem\u003Eher\u003C/em\u003E... history. Valentina stared, unseeing, into the darkness in the window. Flashes of a memory blinked in her mind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...have to go now...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...never should have...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...searching house-to-house...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut again, the more she stretched for it, the more it drifted away. Whatever they had done, it must have been unspeakable. So the truancy apparatchik had given her a simple choice: join the factories, and disappear; or join the martial service, and serve the Imperium. Serve, and atone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo Valentina\u0027s continued surprise, she had tested into the Air Force, and surprise beyond that, into the test pilot corps. As her mind drifted and the rocket accelerated, she finally made the connection. That horrible feeling in the mission control room, when the world had crumbled away and she hung helpless on the precipice... she recognized it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe recognized it from a day long ago, face down in half-frozen mud, no food or sleep for three days, crawling beneath barbed wire, explosions all around, and a spiteful-eyed drill officer firing his revolver into that mud inches from her face. Everyone in the martials slogged through the same basic training. The brave, the fierce, the powerful, the smart, everyone. It was said they must break you; shatter you and grind you down, burn away the unwanted like ore in the furnace. Destroy you, and forge something new. Something of \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0will.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe darkness wanted a tool. And a tool has a purpose.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Coming up on SECO, now.

Light flared in the windows as the discarded rocket stage backed away with its separation motors, then sound died away to the soft hum of air handlers and instrument gyros.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTentatively, Valentina opened her faceplate with a whisper of air. Her stomach twisted uncomfortably at this odd new sensation, now that she finally had time to appreciate it. She turned the buckle on her harness, and the belts sprung out and bounced in strange ways. Oblivious to the world, she drifted from the seat and pressed her face close to the window.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, or really above from her current perspective, the lights of Bylia and Gytep spread out like jewels on the felt of the globe. \u003Cem\u003EZarya\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0drifted along the borderline, the web of illuminated roads twisting chaotically as they followed the unseen contours of the land. Then the lights disappeared beneath clouds, and the ship passed high over a storm raging in the Yaltik Sea. Sporadic flashes of lighting lit the clouds from above and below, the arcs stretching out and rebounding like the neurons firing in her mind. And further beyond, a thin rainbow line of airglow marked the distant curve of the horizon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut Valentina Kerman saw none of this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the craft slowly tumbled, her eyes remained fixed on the stars, exploding forth in their billions upon billions. So many, so many she could never count them all, with a vibrancy and depth that shamed even the clearest night back home, sitting on the roof of her cabin in the cold. The disc of the galaxy was painted in light across the reach of space, stars proceeding from it like any army. For a moment, a wordless, unformed thought drifted in Valentina\u0027s mind, of fortresses and armies and desperate last stands. But no, that was for another. This, now, was hers alone, a knowledge that no night was never truly dark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I finally made it, \u003Cem\u003EDeda\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 she whispered.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA flash of noise in the headset brought her back to the world.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbin to Valentina, come \u003Cem\u003Ein\u003C/em\u003E, Valentina...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Huh?

She settled back into her seat and hooked the toes of her boots under straps on the pedals. Her hand reached for the IVAN keypad, then froze.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe voice. It was... gone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot merely distant, but \u003Cem\u003Egone\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Her head was clear for the first time in a long time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny further thought on the matter was cut off, however, as Valentina noticed the writing etched into the keypad housing. It was subtle, difficult to see if she wasn\u0027t looking at \u003Ci\u003Ejust\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Ethe right angle. Along the top edge of the panel was a complex, dense script she thought might be Gytepi, but along the bottom were familiar Kerillic letters, giving her the distinct impression they said the same thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:tahoma, geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMech.IVAN rev. 202\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027times new roman\u0027, times, serif;\u0022\u003EA product of Wutani-Kokuni, LTD\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was... odd. With all the secrecy, Valentina had assumed the strange little box was a product of the research department. But, with all the Foreign goods flowing into the Union, who could tell anymore? Bah, that was a thought for another time. She flipped through the paperwork, entered the nonsensical hexadecimal string into the keypad, then hit the \u0027INPUT\u0027 button. The tiny CRT on the panel flickered and changed:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027, courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EHOHMANN TRANSFER TO TARGET\u003Cbr\u003E\nRECALCULATING. . . .DONE\u003Cbr\u003E\nMANEUVER NODE IN M\u002B33:42\u003Cbr\u003E\nEND OF LINE\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina frowned. That sounded right... sort of. The thruster check should make more sense. With only a moment\u0027s pause to think, she threw the relevant switches on the panels, and finally set her gloved hands on controls. A side stick was to her left, controlling pitch and yaw. The pedals below the panel controlled roll, and a thick, stubby knob to her right controlled translation.\u00A0Hesitantly, she moved the stick, and a flash of light in the window and sound like a muffled gunshot announced the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters were working. She spent a few moments moving the ship about, finding she adjusted naturally to the slightly odd control arrangement. It responded crisply and precisely to her commands, with no hint of overshoot, again reminding her of a well-designed aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Valentina watched the sparkling lights of Kerbin\u0027s cities shift around in the window before her, she found to her dismay that she was \u003Cem\u003Ehappy\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Despite everything that had happened, everything that was yet to come, despite knowing that her friend was up here, somewhere, alone and clinging to life, Valentina was \u003Cem\u003Ehappy\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it dug into her heart like a knife.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-03T07:44:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2020 07:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goldensniper79","CreatedById":104041,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T10:33:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really enjoy (and enjoyed) both of your stories catastrophic, keep it up! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: And was that a Spaceballs reference I saw many chapters ago?????\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-10T10:54:48Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2015 10:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Goldensniper79\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T12:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAhh, \u003Cem\u003EKrasniyy Ivan - \u003C/em\u003Ethe\u003Cem\u003E old\u003C/em\u003E kerbal\u0027s\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003Erocket. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd remember Comrade - MechIVAN is watching you...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T01:20:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is saddeningly awesome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T08:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222316303\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022113974\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449743630\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022104041\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Goldensniper79\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Goldensniper79 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really enjoy (and enjoyed) both of your stories catastrophic, keep it up! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: And was that a Spaceballs reference I saw many chapters ago?????\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossibly.

Oskar Kerman had been possessed of that quiet ease that told everyone around him\u00A0he was a pilot, without him having to open his ever-smiling mouth. He\u0027d had a unique way of breaking his primary flight training students of the habit of clutching the yoke too hard. He would have them fly with a pencil tucked under their middle knuckle, the pressure it put upon their other fingers enough to dissuade them from squeezing too hard. Valentina had broken it. And the plastic pen. Bent the aluminum fuel line. It had taken a steel rod, the bruises not fading until after the cross-country flight when he had fallen asleep with his feet propped up on the dash. By then, he was that confident in her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EYou do not charge blindly at your prey, Tinka, you will spook it.

It was a circle! To go forward, she had to go...\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebackwards\u003C/em\u003E. With a featherlight touch on the controls, Valentina pointed the ship, and fired the thrusters.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EKokos\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0what... what are you doing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe ignored the calls, focused on the fading mote lest she loose it against the glare of Kerbin far below. She slowed her breathing, let her hands move naturally, her eyes track the mark. This... this was hunting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd she was\u00A0a hunter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly, agonizingly slowly, the mote became a speck. The speck became a dot. The dot became a blob. And the blob, at long last, took the form of a tiny spacecraft, while the face of Kerbin passed beneath obliviously. Valentina deftly steered her own ship closer, closer still, her movements quickly becoming unconscious as she did. The precise, automatic motions of a hunter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, she brought \u003Cem\u003EZarya\u0027s \u003C/em\u003Enose in just under the other ship, the two making contact with a soft \u003Cem\u003Ebong\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that resonated through the hull.

She couldn\u0027t see over her head in the enormous helmet, had to work her way out of the hatch mostly by feel, but finally her dull white form appeared outside of the dark capsule. And as she looked around to get her bearings, her breath caught.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was Kerbin in all her beauty, casting a pale blue glow against the harsh sun, now low on the horizon. The two craft were\u00A0drifting sedately across the eastern terminator, the place where day became night. Valentina was mesmerized by the unending conflict playing out below.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe darkness, and the light.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere, shadows from mountains and clouds inexorably, unceasingly crept across the ground, casting the vivid colors of the day into subtle shades of pastels, before swallowing them completely.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe darkness, and the light.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere, the day routed before the night, no valiant defiance, no desperate last stands, only unending flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe darkness, and the light.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere, in this place of contrast, despite the voice being silent these past hours, Valentina still felt the pull. The hunger. The inevitability.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere, the darkness triumphed, and the light died.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI \u003Cu\u003Eam\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0a thing of darkness\u003C/em\u003E, she resigned, \u003Cem\u003Eit cannot be helped.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo her right, the sun sped toward the horizon, while to her left, the M\u00FCn rose, full and bloated, pallid like a corpse. And like the orbital night inching ever closer, the ball of anxiety in her stomach edged toward fear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina pulled herself out of the hatch, moving slowly, deliberately, trying not to upset her path as Tercella had described. The suit resisted her motions, stiff from the life-preserving air inside. She crawled along \u003Cem\u003EZarya\u0027s \u003C/em\u003Esurface using only her arms. Flailing her legs would not help, only make her overheat. She clipped and unclipped her tethers as she went along until finally she touched \u003Cem\u003EOduvanchik\u0027s\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ehull with a hesitant hand.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Control, \u003Cem\u003EKokos\u003C/em\u003E, I am in position.\u0022 Valentina switched her final tether and pulled herself onto \u003Cem\u003EOduvanchik\u0027s\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E flank.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy that. Stand by, I am going to back \u003Cem\u003EZarya \u003C/em\u003Eaway thirty meters.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTranslation thrusters fired silently in the void. Valentina\u0027s gut clamped down more at the eerie sight of her spacecraft moving away on its own. She tried to push the thought out of her head. The riskiest step in the mission lay just ahead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was no... sane way to open \u003Cem\u003EOduvanchik\u0027s\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E hatch. With no provision for EVA built into this Orbiter, the hatch was bolted securly shut with a dozen pyrotechnic bolts. There was no time to even consider removing them one by one, the hatch would have to be blown open. If Dibella\u0027s visor was not down, if her suit was not fully sealed, if an errant piece of debris in the cabin...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s innards clenched, she tried to push the thoughts away. As the sun sank lower, it gave off a\u00A0ghostly yellow hue. She pulled herself hand over hand towards the spherical descent capsule, her pulse loud in her ears, her breath like thunder. She came to the small window in the hatch, but could see only darkness inside. Someone had hand-painted a dandelion on it. Remembering the lights on her helmet, she switched them on, the beams cutting into the shadows. The window was rimed with ice on the other side, specks of frost, suspended in the air, glittered in the beams.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina could see the top of Dibella\u0027s helmet, but there was no motion within. Her arms floated limply, lifelessly. The\u00A0tension in Valentina\u0027s gut now worked its way up her spine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I see her. She is not moving. I am going to blow the hatch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRetrieving a simple tool from a pouch, she swung down to the brightly painted arrow marked RESCUE on the side of the pod, pressed the tool against the catch, popping it open. She grabbed the lanyard inside, threaded her gloved hand through it, then slowly, agonizingly, worked her way back to the other end of the craft. Trying to catch her breath, she braced one hand against a ridiculous fin at the back, steadied herself, then gave the lanyard a mighty pull...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...pivoting over her other hand, tumbling over, and smacking roughly against the hull. She had to restrain a cry, but not out of pain. Again slowly, tortuously slowly, Valentina worked back to the far end of the ship. She pulled the cord and nearly tumbled over again. Mission Control was saying something, but she ignored it. Her vocal cords strained with every breath.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ELeverage... need leverage\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe fumbled, felt around, and finally stuck her boot into the worthless engine nozzle. Bracing again, expecting the worst, she pulled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blows came hard and fast from every direction. Light and dark flickered and flashed like a nightmare, Valentina flailed helplessly. For an instant, she had a close-up view of one of \u003Cem\u003EOduvanchik\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0attitude thruster nozzles before it spat out white gas and sent her tumbling again, bouncing off her tether against the hull. Was she screaming? Crying? She couldn\u0027t tell anymore.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething found its way into her hand and she held on with everything she had left, finally stabilizing herself as the craft\u0027s own motion slowed. She paused, she had to, her breath ragged and choking. Static crackled in her ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Negative copy, Control,\u0022 Valentina panted, \u0022say again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother burst of static.
