In a business setting, 3d design is split among a large group of people, all doing only a little bit of this or that before it\u0027s passed on to the next worker in the chain. when you\u0027re a single person, it\u0027s you doing all of that work. modeling is not necessarily difficult, but very tedious. these programs don\u0027t always work the way you want them to either. needless to say, it\u0027s a complex process with a lot of steps to take. you\u0027re the whole production line, from the drawing board to the factory floor. design decision choices can often take a lot of time to mull over. sometimes you can work for hours and get very little done, and projects can take dozens upon dozens of hours, which you might be able to work on only an hour a day or less. many of us modelers make models in our free time at our own leisure. sometimes we need a break, sometimes we hit brick walls that we don\u0027t want to deal with at the moment. we\u0027re not being paid to do this, yet we devote countless man hours to it. there\u0027s a point where something stops being fun and seems more like a chore, because too much of anything is a bad thing....so we take breaks. the one main advantage though, is as a sole creator of a mod, you have complete quality control over every aspect of the process. no bureaucracy to steer you except...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find commentators often do more harm than good. they try to change the nature of your project with suggestions, piling more work on. then they push and push and whine when a project isn\u0027t ready soon after they hear of it. but when it comes down to it, KSP is a game that most modders, don\u0027t play as much as non modders. we\u0027re often veterans that have done everything there is to do in the game that like to give people something new to play with, but at our leisure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efortunate for me, that while I do listen to suggestions -- I also know when to tune them out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epeople also should keep in mind that even if you see a complete looking model, there\u0027s still plenty of work to be done.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-29T00:59:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2013 12:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by trekkie_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T00:58:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis thread continues to be a source of shocked puzzlement for me, I for one wouldn\u0027t lose sleep if it was locked for a wee while.
