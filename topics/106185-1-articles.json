In the process I\u0027ve strip mined Minmus and want a bit more science before going interplanetary, so I have to do what I only do when I\u0027m forced to: go to the Mun. Sure, it\u0027s close, but its extreme gravity compared to Minmus and lower science values make it, for me at least, rather unappealing; where a design I used on Minmus hopped around 4 or 5 times before coming back I\u0027m scared to do any on the Mun (it has a bad TWR).\n\nI\u0027m primarily curious if I\u0027m alone in this, so, how often does the average person head to our closest neighbor?"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:15:29Z","Content":"Any time I build something stupid big, the first place I stick it is the Mun.\n\nNow realize I almost *\\*always\\** build something stupidly big.

Jeb got stranded in a highly eccentric Kerbin orbit. I didn\u0027t rescue him for days. But he had loads of science in the pod, and I was approaching the level where it costs 90 science to research the nodes. Then, the thing that finally made me rescue the poor guy was a contract for science from the surface of the Mun (he landed). So I saddled up a Kerbal, and blasted off to go and get him.\n\nMost of my space program kerbonauts are rescued Kerbals."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:28:08Z","Content":"I go there when the contracts say I should, which during early career seems to be a whole lot.
