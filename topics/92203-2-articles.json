The root part resizes back to default. The trick I have found is having the root part be it\u0027s normal size, while tweaking the rest. Please note that if you jettison the old root part as part of staging, the new part that was attached to the decoupler becomes the root part and suffers from the same issue. Right now this is the only work around I know of, until tweak scale is updated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lack","CreatedById":47978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T18:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlonzoTG\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AlonzoTG\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey, I have a bit of a mystery here... First I am running a DMP server in Science mode. I have a large and illustrious modpak. I trimmed out all of the NxM parts from my pak because I couldn\u0027t find a valid use for them. I have Remote Tech and would like to use the Large Scanning Antenna. However it is not available in the parts library or for launch. In sandbox mode, I made a few designs using it. I can load the design in science mode, but there\u0027s no part! Apparently it should be in \u0022Experimental Science\u0022 The node exists on my tree and I have the \u0022Communications Tower\u0022 but no large scanning antenna so I\u0027m really baffled.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmm, I\u0027ll have to have a look at this. Could be that I mucked up the node name, or one of the disabler counters it (there were two different scanning dishes, but I reduced this to one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@cavilier210,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not that bright on my end, being equivalent to the white in some of the stock parts (which I based it off, although specularity value varies). Easiest way to find textures will be to run a search for .tga and .png. Did you post on reddit about this a few weeks ago, actually? I did some looking around and tried changing the main 2x1 texture to grey (I can upload that later on if you\u0027d like), but then found a bunch of duplicate textures so did some work fixing that and converting parts to .mbm and never got round to posting a reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, AnitMatter\u0027s suggestions are solid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
