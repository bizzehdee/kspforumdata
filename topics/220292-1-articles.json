Let me know if you do in the comments and your opinions on the game. I like the character customization and events, even though i suck at the events lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TwoCalories","CreatedById":228871,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-26T23:24:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used to play Astroneer, and I sometimes wish I still had it. I would play it with all my friends, and we would rove around with our buggies and dig for resources. Sometimes I wish we could add new habitat structures to our base, instead of the single small habitat pod and the rows of solar panels and storage shelves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AstroWolfie","CreatedById":223932,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-27T16:39:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know!
