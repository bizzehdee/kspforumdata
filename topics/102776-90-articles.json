It causes problems for people on mobile browsers and can even cause the browser to lock up.  If you\u0027ve got a big log file to share, the best solution is generally not to paste it in the forum at all, but rather to host it on some 3rd-party file sharing site (there are lots of free ones around the interwebs), and then *\u003Cu\u003Elink\u003C/u\u003E* to it.\n\nIn this particular case, since the vast majority of the bulk of this one really long log file was just endless repetition of the same thing, it was easily fixed by just snipping out over 90% of it, so that\u0027s what we did.  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nAnyway, no harm done-- just, please try to be careful about this sort of thing, folks?

Do you know if the fixes you made work in the latest 1.6.1?  If they do, is it within the license rules for you to share your updated version?  ( I looked in your Git branch but did not see how I could get any updated version).\n\nSecond, you also indicated that you would be willing to curate this mod but would need help on using Kopernicus.  I am sadly not likely to be much help either but I do see a distinction between keeping it working and evolving it.  I am not sure exactly what changes need to be done if the Kopernicus API stays constant and it is updated to Kerbal.  Do you anticipate that it is something that would be hard to learn and maintain if that were the simple goal?\n\nI would be thrilled if this just was able to be used again even if it did not evolve much. It creates a fairly unique Kerbal experience and I was looking to getting back to the top of the Kerbal versions after spending the past many months using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E in 1.3.1.\n\nFinal note, I know how many mods you are keeping alive for the rest of us; I use many of them.

I have actually done this in KSP 1.3.1 so I haven\u0027t had any need to worry about the problem with the compatibility with newer versions of KSP. However, there still have been enough things to worry about and I would much like to post them here on the one hand to provide a reference to anyone else who may want to apply similar fixes and on the other hand to thank everyone who already posted solutions to some issues that have helped me to fix my install. On top of that I have a question in the end about one particular issue that I would like to know your opinion about ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022).\n\nTo be able to load the mod at all in Kopernicus 1.3.1.7, I have applied [this Tidus fix](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/102776-13-kopernicus-new-horizons-v201-2jun17-its-back/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=3345797), so a huge thanks to [@Lyneira](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/149515-lyneira/) for posting it. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nThen I have been able to restore the colors of the rings of Sonnah and Titanus to something more reasonnable. I decided to change them as proposed [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/102776-13-kopernicus-new-horizons-v201-2jun17-its-back/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=3303393) by [@Micro753](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/165380-micro753/) and [@talkItalk](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/71069-talkitalk/) because I like how they look now, but I have realized that these ring colors have also been changed to different values by [@linuxgurugamer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/) in his modified version of the mod.  \n\nI still laugh at myself when I think about how long it has taken me to realize that I had to change \u0022colour\u0022 into \u0022color\u0022 in the \u0022Rings\u0022\\\u0022Ring\u0022 node in the Sonnah.cfg file to prevent Sonnah\u0027s rings to be completely black... ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif \u0022:rolleyes:\u0022)![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\nAbout Arin\u0027s rings I noticed that they have the same inclination as Astid\u0027s orbit, but the planes are not aligned. I am actually wondering whether this is intended or whether Astid is actually supposed to orbit along the outside of Arin\u0027s rings. Since Astid\u0027s description seems to indicate that Astid may originate from a different impact than Arin\u0027s rings, it might actually be intended the way it is, but to me it seems more reasonnable to see Astid as a piece of rock which is part of Arin\u0027s rings, in which case the planes should be aligned. I haven\u0027t tried it myself yet, but I think adding the line \u0022longitudeOfAscendingNode = 50\u0022 inside of the \u0022Rings\u0022\\\u0022Ring\u0022 node in the Arin.cfg file should align Arin\u0027s rings with the orbital plane of Astid...?\n\nI have also added back in Eve\u0027s rings which were included in previous versions of New Horizons and they make me quite happy, because otherwise Eve feels so \u0022unspecial\u0022 since it has no moons and is already included in the stock game... ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif \u0022:blush:\u0022)\n\nNext, I have to say a huge thanks to [@linuxgurugamer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/) for his version of the mod, which includes Derso\u0027s textures. I actually hadn\u0027t realized myself that they were missing up to the point where I found your post about this issue in this thread ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nFinally, I noticed two issues with the atmospheres of some of the atmospheric bodies in New Horizons. I found these problems when I tried to send a jet-powered plane to Sonnah, have it fly around inside of Sonnah\u0027s atmosphere for a while and finally crash into Sonnah.\n\nThe first issue is that in my install, Sonnah\u0027s atmosphere has been light green. It has taken me a while to figure out that it is actually the color of Jool\u0027s atmosphere that I have been seeing. This might be an issue that has been fixed in more recent versions of Kopernicus, but it seems that the \u0022AtmosphereFromGround\u0022 node inside of the \u0022Atmosphere\u0022 node of a body\u0027s config file makes Kopernicus ignore the \u0022lightColor\u0022 value provided in the \u0022Atmosphere\u0022 node and replace the color of the body\u0027s atmosphere by that of its template body given in its config file. In case of Sonnah, the template body is obviously Jool, so I removed the \u0022AtmosphereFromGround\u0022 node and Sonnah\u0027s atmosphere became blue ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022).  \n\nTo be honest, I don\u0027t know what \u0022AtmosphereFromGround\u0022 actually does, but so far I haven\u0027t encountered any issues... also the fact that many of the planets don\u0027t include an \u0022AtmosphereFromGround\u0022 node in their config file seems to indicate that it is not necessary to have it.  \n\nApart from Sonnah, also Titanus and Arin have an \u0022AtmosphereFromGround\u0022 node which I have erased. In case of Titanus the difference in the atmosphere\u0027s color is not so visible but in case of Arin it looks really odd otherwise since Laythe\u0027s dark blue atmosphere doesn\u0027t fit at all.\n\nThe second issue is that the Panther engine I used on my plane has only been able to deliver a thrust of up to 20kN, even in afterburning mode and deep inside of Sonnah\u0027s atmosphere. Inspecting Sonnah\u0027s config file I realized that the \u0022atmosphereMolarMass\u0022 value inside the \u0022Atmosphere\u0022 node has been set to something like 0.000179999990016222 (kg/mol). This value is the same as for the other gas giants Moh and Vanor. I don\u0027t know whether this is intended but this value seems unrealistically low, especially for a planet that is supposed to have oxygen inside its atmosphere, given that the lightest gas that exists (Hydrogen) already has a molar mass of 0.00202 kg/mol. Even although the molar mass in Sonnah\u0027s atmosphere is so low, one does not experience a large difference in drag when entering it, because on the other hand, the atmospheric pressure rises much faster than for the other bodies (the same again being true for Moh and Vanor). There however seems to be much less heating due to atmospheric entry with these settings...  \n\nIn the end, I have reworked the atmospheres of all of the celestial bodies in New Horizons, but at least those of the gas giants should be changed in my opinion.  \n\nAfter having changed Sonnah\u0027s atmosphere accordingly, the Panther engine also performs much more reasonnably.\n\nFinally I found the issue that none of the atmospheric planets include a \u0022staticPressureASL\u0022 value inside of their \u0022Atmosphere\u0022 node which makes the planet info panel in the tracking station display the wrong atmospheric pressure for those bodies. Instead of their real pressure, the pressure of the template body seems to be displayed, which in most cases is Laythe, leading to a displayed value of 0.6 atm. This fix also seems to be already included in [@linuxgurugamer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/) \u0027s version of the mod. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 10/26/2018 at 11:32 PM, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So, is there interest in having a Community Supported release?

Since I want my install to include TACLS and KPBS, I would very much like to have a reasonnable distribution of a few resources like water and atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide on New Horizon\u0027s planets.
