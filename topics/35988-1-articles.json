You should probably kill any ambient light in the scene and use a three-point (studio) light setup if you aren\u0027t using Global Illumination. And since there\u0027s a large window and it isn\u0027t completely black outside, maybe a faint bluish backlight coming from outside the window. Your lights should also have a falloff (so they aren\u0027t the same brightness to infinity). In particular, this would mean that the patio outdoors would have much more of a blue tint due to the sky outside affecting them more than the light on the Kerbals does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The window itself looks like dull grey plastic at the moment, which is mainly an issue with that large specular highlight on the material. Specular highlights are mostly just \u0022cheats\u0022 for the reflections caused by very bright light sources. They are large and dull like this where the surface is rough on a microscopic scale and scatters the rays randomly, but not so rough and so random that a highlight is completely indistinguishable. Glass is not like that; unless it is frosted, dirty, or cloudy, it doesn\u0027t scatter reflected light much at all ... window glass in particular tends to reflect a fairly clear mirror image, when it reflects at all, otherwise it is transparent. So the window should either be very obvious (small, bright reflection of the light source, with the rest of the objects in the scene reflected too), or it should not be visible at all (no highlight, no reflections). I\u0027d lean toward making it mostly invisible, but realistically in this scene it would be acting a lot like a mirror given how dark the exterior is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You shouldn\u0027t use camera motion to switch from subject to subject like this, at least not often.
