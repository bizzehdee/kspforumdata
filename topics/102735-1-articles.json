Now that did push the Concorde from the top of the safety list (zero fatal incidents) to pretty much the bottom (because these lists are \u0022per passenger km\u0022 and the Concorde simply didn\u0027t transport that many people in its lifetime) of the list.\n\nThe incident was caused by a piece of metal left by a previous plane on the runway (I think the lawsuit over that is still going on) piercing a fuel tank as it was kicked up by the landing gear. What really shut the program down was that this was a pretty good excuse to shut the program down; the reasons had more to do with economics than anything else.\n\nAs Kryten pointed out, when you take into account all the security checks (which might have been more extended with a high-profile plane like the Concorde) you lose a lot of the shorter travel time. Another way of cutting your transatlantic travel time down is hiring a business jet (bypassing most of the time-consuming BS at an airport). You\u0027ll get a similar door-to-door time, for probably a comparable price, with a much better experience.\n\nI work in the transport industry. Customers will always tell you that shipping speed is of the utmost importance to them. When it\u0027s time to pull the wallet, they\u0027ll pick the slowest (cheapest) option anyway, with the exception of a very, very select few."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T18:45:03Z","Content":"\u0022We can make an airplane that gets across the ocean two hours faster than mormal!
