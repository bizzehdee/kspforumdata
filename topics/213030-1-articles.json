In addition to these milestone that were in KSP there should be new ones such as burn 10 tons Methalox, burn 100 tons Methalox, Keep a Kerbal alive in orbit for one day, accumulate 3600 seconds of runtime for \u0022XXXX\u0022 engine.\u00A0 Gaining \u0022research\u0022 or \u0022engineering\u0022 in this way is not only more realistic it fits with the learn by doing ethos of the game.
