This is pretty much one of the top issues every FAR first-timer runs into, since stock aerodynamics doesn\u0027t care about aircraft tails at all, but real aerodynamics cares a whole lot.

Don\u0027t go to 10km and then turn 45 degrees - that only results in you presenting the broadside of your rocket to the airstream, which of course ends in disaster \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Turn gradually instead.
