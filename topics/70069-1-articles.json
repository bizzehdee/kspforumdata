I know it\u0027s not exact, but I always bet on 1.5km/s when making a Mun lander/rdv vessel (but then, I do overbuild almost everything). I think my last one had about 1.2km/s but I was cutting it fine and only had about 50m/s in the tanks when I docked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T23:09:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IV8rzue.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis dV map\u003C/a\u003E should help.

This way they can hop to a couple different biomes and complete a temperature/gravity/whatever mission to boot (or simply more biomes if so inclined). Making a number of short hops is more efficient than going in and out of orbit, and docking every time. Also, remember that your initial orbit (unless it\u0027s polar) isn\u0027t going to be able to reach everything. Many of the biomes will require normal/anti-normal corrections, which will cost a great deal both ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T21:11:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are running a lander from a mother ship, budget an extra hundred plus dV for inclination changes. For equatorial targets run a bit shy of a full tank, but repositioning the mother ship for landings at different latitudes is horridly wasteful. A lander is light so dV for it is relatively cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a similar vein, give it RCS but no extra tanks. The command module with 6\u002B units of monoprop is fine for a single dock before refuel. And it is easier and more efficient to have the light craft do the docking maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiving a lander an inclination change budget also allows you to run the mother ship in an inclined orbit which gives more more potential, \u0022easy\u0022 landing spots.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
