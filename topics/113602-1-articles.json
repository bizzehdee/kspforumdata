But, as Red Crown illustrated, the difficulty curve would still start out easy from Kerbin and its moons. And there really wouldn\u0027t be that big of a change in difficulty, anyways. There are enough biomes on Duna alone that would require a change in orbital attitude alone to get an approach to.
