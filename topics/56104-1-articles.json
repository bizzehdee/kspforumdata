While astronauts posted videos before him on the ISS it was not like what Chris did. When Chris was up their he took a lot of his free time showing us a bunch of cool things. There are so many videos to watch. He also took some really good pictures everyday. All this was done in his free time, He was not required to do any of this. I think his videos put out so much awareness to what the ISS was doing it actually saved some programs. He was also the first person from Canada that was commander of the ISS. Its not really that far of a stretch to call a man like that a hero. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Ed Lu not being a hero until he launches the satellite... thats funny to me.

Preventing a killer asteroid is part of that. So is colonizing other planets and other solar systems. I will gladly salute anyone who is working towards those goals, and Ed Lu is one of those people. He\u0027ll have my eternal gratitude once the program is up and running. In the meantime, he has my deep respect just for trying, and just for talking about it as much as he can. We should have been doing this decades ago, and I\u0027m glad he and his colleagues are on the case. It sounds like they\u0027ve got a tremendous team with serious skills and knowledge. I\u0027m confident in their success, and the project has my full support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with many others that his stream during KerbalKon was a major highlight, and I hope his talk resulted in a lot of donations.
