A quick note before I get further into this - this is the first time I\u0027ve done a launch without using the map screen. You can already tell that this isn\u0027t going to go ideally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I needed a little information. I looked at one of my flight-planner probes in 100km circular Kerbin orbit and made note of its orbital velocity and the dV of a maneuver to Mun encounter. I also made note of the travel time to the encounter so I\u0027d know what was too long timewarping. Then, I threw together a lander that I thought should be able to do the landing and return portions of the mission, and still have fuel to spare. However, I didn\u0027t know this for certain, as it was entirely untested. I didn\u0027t even check the mass, not that I\u0027ve made note of how much my Light Lifter subassembly can get to LKO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/F4v7wp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F4v7wp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, bright-eyed and optimistic, I timewarped on the launch pad until morning for the launch, remembering not to look at the map screen. The lander sat atop the Light Lifter and launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/1DZ9Lx.png\u0022 alt=\u00221DZ9Lx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started to turn at 10km, but with the benefit of hindsight, I think I turned too sharply. At around the point you can see in the image above, I was beginning to get a little worried about the lifter. I also realised about then that I\u0027d never even tried to get to \u003Cem\u003Eorbit\u003C/em\u003E without using the map screen, and in fact, I was very heavily reliant on data about the apoapse to get to orbit. Even with my burning, I reached apoapse below 35km - so I definitely turned too early/sharply. So, I burned up, desperately trying to at least get orbit without the map on this attempted Mapless Mun Mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/jH9Ndz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jH9Ndz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELifter fuel ran out, and in my boundless optimism, I had not attached a transfer stage to the rocket. As such, I was forced to burn lander fuel in atmosphere. Getting orbit without the map screen (and without planning, or testing, or... you get the idea) is difficult. How did people do it, back in those old premap versions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/lvg8l0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lvg8l0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, I got out of the atmosphere and started to circularise. I waited until I began to fall before firing that burn, which was probably a mistake. I consulted my notes: an orbital velocity of 2250m/s should work, and sure enough, it did. The orbit wasn\u0027t wonderfully circular, of course - I could tell by looking at the changing altitude meter roughly where my apoapse and periapse were (I think it was about 115 over 78?). I saw something that I think was Minmus, but without checking the map screen, I can\u0027t be sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/Bg56kq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Bg56kq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the right, in line with the top of the lander, the bright blue thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, despite having used a good chunk of my lander fuel just getting into orbit, I wasn\u0027t about to give up on this here.

So, I burned until I got it, then started to timewarp. According to my noted time, it should be a little over a day until the encounter. It turned out to be shorter, but that\u0027s fine too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/GYWG6I.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GYWG6I.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I was coming in over the light side and had no way of knowing my Munar periapse, I decided to burn to land immediately when I began to rise away again. So, I burned until my surface velocity\u0027s retrograde marker was pointing straight up, and kept timewarping and firing retrograde as I got closer. Eventually, fuel ran out on the descent stage, so I activated the ascent stage. I didn\u0027t immediately drop the descent stage because a) I could fire the ascent stage without dropping it, and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E it had the landing legs on it. This may have turned out to be a mistake, as as I got closer, it looked more and more like this was going to be a crash, not a landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel in the ascent stage was running out fast, and the ground was fast approaching. I dared not take a screenshot, and dropped the descent stage anyway. Perhaps I could land on the engine? Fuel was down at the wire as I began to see my shadow on the Mun... and then, it ran out and I began to fall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, a miracle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/emVi08.png\u0022 alt=\u0022emVi08.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lithobraking miracle. The ascent stage\u0027s engine and fuel tank\u0027s destructive impact was enough to set the capsule down on its decoupler, safe and sound. Hardly able to believe it, I quicksaved - almost fearing that physics would suddenly decide \u0022No, that can\u0027t have happened\u0022 and destroy the lander after the fact. Then, with the safety of a quicksave to come back to, I decided to try something \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E stupid. I\u0027d previously determined that with six sepratrons and the right ejection angle, you could return a Mk1 capsule from Mun orbit safely. Lander cans are lighter, so maybe, just maybe, I could use the monopropellant and the same number of separatrons to do the same from the Mun\u0027s surface?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/HqztTK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HqztTK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. Don\u0027t be silly, that\u0027s not going to happen. I didn\u0027t even get over 40km, and I quickloaded as I descended. Perhaps Mun orbit would have been possible, but return was utterly out of the question. So, I got Dozer out on EVA to plant a flag, and put him back in to await a rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/y2V18g.png\u0022 alt=\u0022y2V18g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it\u0027ll give me something else to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so, a (somehow) successful \u0022Land on the Mun without using the Map Screen from Launchpad onwards\u0022 mission.
