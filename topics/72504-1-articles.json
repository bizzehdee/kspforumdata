Things are different on Linux, and wildly different on OS X. Linux has some modicum of standards for where supporting application data must go, while OS X has two folders, only one of which is usually relevant. There\u0027s ~/Library/Application\\ Support/ and /Library/Application\\ Support/ . And that\u0027s it really; anything outside of that is into non-standard land. This makes managing an OS X (or other Linux/BSD) system way, way easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows, is a hot mess. Programs will put themselves wherever they please. There isn\u0027t even a standard place for binaries. Instead of a single /Applications/ folder there are two folders that don\u0027t provide useful separation. And then there\u0027s the blasted registry, and finally the quagmire of folders that is the \\Users\\ folder on Windows where various applications may or may not store their data. It\u0027s not stored in a standard way (Application Support data is stored in OS X by application name), meaning there\u0027s no predictability for the user. One can\u0027t actually look in those folders and expect to find user data for an application. It could be held in the registry (barf) or somewhere else entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll those inconveniences add up, enough that simply wanting the damn program all in one place is understandable.
