Shortly after the rocket clears the pad, a roll program is initiated by the flight computer to rotate the Saturn V/Shuttle by 90 degrees so the crew launches \u0022forwards\u0022 not \u0022sideways\u0022. This is even stated in the movie \u0022Apollo 13\u0022; when the crew launches for the moon, Tom Hanks character says the line \u0022Roll complete. We are pitching!\u0022 He\u0027s telling Houston mission control that the rocket has completed the roll program (90 degree rotation anti-clockwise) and has begun to pitch over to start the gravity turn. So, when you launch your rocket in KSP, if you\u0027re concerned about sideways G forces, you should roll your rocket just like they do in \u0022real life\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leads to one of my KSP forum pet-peeves, which is when people say to start your gravity turn by \u0022pitching over at X altitude\u0022. If you didn\u0027t roll first, technically, you\u0027re \u0027yawing\u0027 over at X altitude, not pitching. Based on the rocket orientation on the pad, and the fact that nobody ever rolls their rocket after launch, if you \u0022pitch\u0022 over without rolling first, you\u0027d be heading south, not east.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I\u0027m being pedantic.

I\u0027ve done a bunch of Kerbin, Mun and Minimus missions, haven\u0027t even been out of Kerbin yet. I\u0027ve unlocked everything and have 3000 science points I cant do anything with. How about adding many more things to keep unlocking (perhaps even go into futuristic (but realistic) parts, fusion engines, much better ion systems, much better power systems (light solar sails, etc etc). Give us more reason to keep unlocking things with science that is my entire motivation behind planing.. unlocking the next great part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Needing to unlock Action Groups should be removed. If they can make landing gear or lights come on from day 1, why would the technology of extending solar panels be any different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Needing to unlock manuver nodes seemed a bit strange (at least needs to be explained better as I had no idea why I didn\u0027t have them any more). Perhaps make it so that when you attempt to place one a message says (requires unlock) just so it is obvious). Also, because I hadn\u0027t unlocked them yet, I couldn\u0027t see them in tutorials that really needed them either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Please put in better docking systems like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220299-docking-port-alignment-indicator-version-5-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220299-docking-port-alignment-indicator-version-5-0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Instead of rescuing a Kerbal in orbit (seems odd... how the heck did he get there)... put him in a little failed ship (e.g. another competing space company sent him up), perhaps an engineer could fix the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Depending on angle and distance from your camera, when rotation around trying to place accurate nodes, the camera snaps in big increments (making it difficult to line things up or get the perspective you need to set the node correctly). The further away from your focal object, the worse it is. Try accurately setting a node on the opposite side of the sun. Panning your camera results in huge incremental snaps. Surely the further the distance from the object the more fine the camera could be moved when panning around? Or is this some kind of floating point problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Adding parts to mine asteroids. It would be awesome to bring a big asteroids into earth orbit and set up a huge refuelling station there.

Perhaps Squad could even hold a forum contest to which members could contribute their own appropriate music, or links to appropriate royalty free music.

One is the lack of any definitive \u0022super heavy\u0022 wing sets. Two, the one-size-fits-everything landing wheel needs an update.

Sure, the MK2 and MK3 got an overhaul. The MK1 still looks like MK0.5 and there\u0027s still a lot of unfinished business regarding plane parts. The MK1 Cockpit has an IVA that is at least usable, though visibility to the sides is lacking. The MK1 Inline might as well be as dark as the MK3, because neither can be flown from inside without having supernatural piloting ability. The only tail-boom in game is that... thing, the one that doesn\u0027t fit with the color scheme, and there\u0027s a distinct lack of small jet parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to mention I could gripe for hours about the lack of useful rover parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kethevin","CreatedById":64466,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T04:17:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
