This is of course very exciting as it shows that KSP is reaching more and more people every day. More people posting also means more issues the Moderation Team has to deal with on a daily basis and we are therefore looking for \u0027fresh meat\u0027 to shape and train into well behaved and knowledgeable moderators. KSP Community Moderators have many tasks including Moderating the Forums, the IRC chats, the KSP TV channel, Wiki etc.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EDue to the content that will be Moderated and a non-disclosure agreement, all candidate Moderators must be at least eighteen years of age. Additionally, all candidate moderators must have mastered the English language both in word and in writing. A final requirement is that you must be able to devote time to the KSP community on a regular basis. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EDo you think you have what it takes?
