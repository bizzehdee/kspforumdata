That\u0027s right,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etwenty\u003C/em\u003E. Over Columbus Day Weekend I had, like, nothing to do, so I spent several hours on two different days searching for additional candidates in known planetary systems. These include confirmed K2 systems or stars with very likely candidate planets listed on ExoFOP. About 13-17 of the \u0026gt;20 candidates are in such systems. The rest are completely new finds in completely new systems. In addition, I will be revealing updates to multiple systems I and other EE users have previously found. These include EPIC 212157262, EPIC 220194953-74, EPIC 228801451, and several more. Here are two systems from one of July\u0027s Daily Roundups with new parameters:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 220364502:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This is a red dwarf of about 0.36 R\u003Csub\u003ESol\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and 0.39 M\u003Csub\u003ESol\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0where I found a potentially habitable candidate. With the new version of LcViewer, I was able to find out that it is most definitely real, but has two major drawbacks. The first is that there are NO other planets in the system, which is somewhat disappointing. Secondly, 220364502.01 is teetering very close to temperatures that would set it on a path to become a Super-Venus. However, there is something incredibly special about this planet: like Natalie, it has TWO stars. This planet presumably orbits the primary member of a wide red dwarf binary, with both members being about the same size. The secondary seems too far away from the primary and the planet to influence its climate. EPIC 220364502.01 is about 1.233 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0(with an error of \u002B10-40% due the binary companion), orbits every 22.497 days at 0.114 AU, and has an equilibrium temperature of 300\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 213044320:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0When I first reported this system, I thought I had found two potential habitable zone candidates around this rather large red dwarf (0.42 R\u003Csub\u003ESol\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and 0.48 M\u003Csub\u003ESol\u003C/sub\u003E). However, with the new BLS search, it turns out that instead there is just one planet. I had mistaken some of this world\u0027s transit events for two entirely different planets. The new EPIC 213044320.01 is rather small at 0.79 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and has a year of just 4.693 days. As such it is a dry, inhospitable desert world baking at temperature of 557\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK (543\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EF), hot enough to melt Tin, Bismuth, and Selenium.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all I\u0027m going to reveal for now.

In addition, I will also present newly validated systems like EPIC-220194953-74, some of Vidar\u0027s newest candidates, and a very intriguing multi-planet system with 5 to 7 Super-Earth planets.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003ECOLUMBUS DAY WEEKEND CANDIDATES\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAs I mentioned in a status update earlier, over Columbus Day Weekend I did a huge analysis on multiple known K2 systems. Using the online K2 database called ExoFOP, I first filtered for known red dwarf systems. These were stars with known planet candidates that fell into a size range between 0.05 and 0.6 R\u003Csub\u003ES\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Csub\u003Eol\u003C/sub\u003E, and had temperatures no more than 4,000\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK. Over several hours I managed to go through every single star that appeared in my filter results. In the end, 8 of those had completely new planet candidates that no one had stumbled upon before. What was quite intriguing was the abundance of what I call\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003ESOCIS\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0(\u003Cstrong\u003ES\u003C/strong\u003Epaced-\u003Cstrong\u003EO\u003C/strong\u003Eut\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EC\u003C/strong\u003Elose-\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u003C/strong\u003En\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003ES\u003C/strong\u003Eystems). These usually contain two planets, sometimes three. The first has an incredibly close-in orbit, lasting 1.5 days or less (there planets were always the previously known ones). Meanwhile, the second (or third) planet(s) had orbits lasting anywhere from several days to over two weeks. One of these outer planets actually orbits within the optimistic habitable zone of its system.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 201239401\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0The first and one of my favorite SOCI Systems I have found. The first planet, a known candidate, is 1.52 times the size of Earth and orbits in a mere 0.9055 days. I found a second candidate of 0.74 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0with a period of 6.784 days and a pretty good sigma confidence of 9.299. With an equilibrium temperature of 427 K, it\u0027s non-habitable but not that bad in cosmic standards.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 201650711:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This is the most extreme SOCIS found during my search, even though it was only the second one I stumbled across. EPIC 201650711.01 has been analyzed by both Vanderurg et al. and Adams et al., with the latest result being reported on July 7th, 2016. It is a very quick-orbiting planet with one of the shortest years ever seen\u00A0 - just 0.25699 days, or only 6.232 hours. As a result, this 0.769 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0planet is likely made almost entirely of iron and will have incredible volcanic activity, far exceeding Jupiter\u0027s moon Io. After the initial shock of such a freakish planet, I managed to find a small 6.302-sigma signal of a 0.40 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0planet orbiting every 5.546 days. Candidates 01 and 02 of this system have the widest mean-motion resonance I have ever seen, with C01 orbiting about 21 times for ever one orbit of C02.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 201785059:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0One of the smallest stars I analyzed (just 0.28 R\u003Csub\u003ESol\u003C/sub\u003E), this red dwarf is the one with the potentially habitable candidate I found. EPIC 201785059.02 is a \u0022Warm Mars\u0022 with a radius of 0.60 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and a year of 17.894 days, placing it within the optimistic habitable zone with a temperature of 284\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK. While promising, it\u0027s one of the least likely candidates I found, with a sigma of 6.313 and a rather poor-looking folded transit. The innermost planet was found in 2015 and is about 88% the size of Earth with a year of 1.395 days. The two have the widest orbital separation of any planets in any SOCI System.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 206215704:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Probably the weirdest SOCIS I found. The first planet is a 2.52 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0Mini-Neptune with a year of just 0.623 days (~15 hours). With LcViewer, a pair of TROJAN PLANETS are found. The two Super-Earths are 1.56 and 1.59 times the size of Earth with years of\u00A02.256 and 2.908 days, and sigma values of 13.673 and 12.891. In other words, they are most likely real. Such a system teases the theories of orbital stability and planet formation, as these three worlds are in such precarious orbits while being very close to a high-density star.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 206298289:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0One new planet of 0.78 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0was found orbiting every 3.214 days, sigma of 9.879, temperature of 543\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK. While the new candidate I found isn\u0027t very interesting, what makes things peculiar is its potential influence from the innermost candidate. It is a large Super-Earth around 1.62 times Earth\u0027s radius hugging its red dwarf host in a 0.435-day (10.44 hours) orbit. A planet that large with an orbit that close is likely wobbling its star very violently, possibly resulting in the orbit of C02 becoming more inclined and/or eccentric.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EK2-91/EPIC 211077024:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This system contains one confirmed planet, K2-91b, orbiting every 1.4195 days. I managed to find a very similar and very likely second signal of a 0.88 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0planet with a 1.441-day year, sigma of 32.823. This second candidate could potentially be a real find, or it may suggest that the K2-91 system is an eclipsing binary.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter combing through all the listed red dwarf candidate systems on ExoFOP (there are many more that exist but weren\u0027t listed on the site), I turned my attention to larger stars of over 0.7 solar radii. There were a LOT of them, so I was only able to go through a third of the stars that appeared in my new filter. Despite that, three systems ended up being quite fruitful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EK2-8/EPIC 201445392:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0A confirmed system of two Mini-Neptunes orbiting a star 80% the size of the Sun. They are almost exactly in a 2:1 mean-motion resonance, with periods of 5.064 and 10.352 days. I managed to find an additional two candidates orbiting every 1.939 and 3.296 days, both in resonance with each other and K2-8b and c. They are between 0.79 and 1.01 Earth radii and are likely molten worlds.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 201497682:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0A second four-planet system I stumbled across.

Two more candidates were found, the first being a 0.91 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0candidate with a year of 2.132 days and a scorching temperature of 1,033\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK.

While such a moon is not likely to exist, the planet itself was recently confirmed. It is 2.01 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and takes 9.562748 days to orbit an orange dwarf about 67% the radius of the Sun.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second paper was published earlier this week or weekend by Hirano et al. It takes a look at over a dozen new candidate worlds around red dwarfs stars of various sizes and metal content. One of those systems appears to have a lot more planets than originally thought - which I\u0027ll get to later. The most important find (to us EE users) is the validation of the EPIC 220194953-220194974 system. If you remember, this was a binary red dwarf system with three sub-Earths found by Vidar to be orbiting one of the stars. Hirano et al. managed to find the actual sizes of the two stars, which are much larger than expected. The primary, EPIC 220194974, is 0.65 R\u003Csub\u003ESol\u003C/sub\u003E, 0.632 M\u003Csub\u003ES\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Csub\u003Eol\u003C/sub\u003E, and has a temperature of 4079\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK and is 10.1% as luminous as the Sun. It is likely a K9.0V dwarf, even though its spectral type is not mentioned in the paper. EPIC 220194953 is not that much smaller at 0.598 R\u003Csub\u003ESol\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and 0.575 M\u003Csub\u003ESol\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0with a temperature of 3854\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EK and 0.066 times the Sun\u0027s luminosity. The two orbit each other at a distance of 1,100 AU (about 1.64557e\u002B11 km). Because of their larger than expected sizes, the three planets are also much larger, at 1.33, 1.73. and 1.64 times the size of Earth. Significant TTVs were not found, suggesting that the innermost planet lacks an iron core, while the outer two are likely Water Giants. They have equilibrium temperatures of 674, 579, and 516 degrees Kelvin, hot enough to melt only a few types of metals and non-metals. The three planets receive between 50 and 16 times the stellar radiation Earth gets from the Sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEPIC 211428897 has been studied in another research paper that was recently published. Two of the four extra candidates shutcheon and I have found were officially recognized - the 2-day planet (my find) and the 4-day planet (shutcheon\u0027s find). In addition, the team used the Keck telescopes to get an image of the star...or stars, for that matter. It\u0027s also another binary system. I am under the assumption that the planets are around the same size as Earth and orbit the primary, but I could be wrong.

Both shutcheon and I did additional analyses of the SFF and Everest2 data for the star. Shutcheon found that the 60-day period doesn\u0027t exist, but there is a likely planet (C05) orbiting every 28.742 days. I did an even deeper analysis, using the BLS search on both the Everest2 and SFF data of EPIC 220522664. I found all the planets described by Vidar and shutcheon in both light curves, along with a Super-Earth orbiting every 37.170 days within the habitable zone. But then there was the issue with C05. While it was easily found by the BLS search in the Everest2 data, the code found two separate candidates instead within the SFF data. One was a sub-Earth of about 0.8 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0orbiting every 4.635 days, while the other was a larger Super-Earth in a 56.598-day orbit. Both had a high statistical significance, but I don\u0027t know what to do with them since they may actually just be C05.

Original observations showed two planets with easily defined orbits and signs of a third Mini-Neptune planet. Using LcViewer\u0027s BLS search, I was able to pin down the orbit of the third planet: about 33.313 days. It is 2.94 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and MUCH cooler than the two inner worlds. The first is 1.10 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and, with a year of just 14 hours, is broiled at temperatures of nearly 3,000\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EF. Only less than a dozen elements, including Osmium and Molybdenum, can stay solid at these temperatures. The second is a 2.12 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0planet (presumably a hot gas dwarf) in an 8.329-day orbit with temperatures around 781\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003Ek (946\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EF).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed to find the research paper where EPIC 212157262.01 (Hemithea) was first reported. It is smaller than I expected, with a radius of 2.97 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E. While I thought it was a Hot Neptune, the paper gives it a density of 2.739 g/cm\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, which implies a surprisingly high mass of about 13.015 M\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E. When plotted on Sara Seager\u0027s exoplanet mass-radius relationship graph, Hemithea falls just above the \u0022100% H\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003EO\u0022 line. This means that instead of being a hot puffy ice giant, Hemithea is instead a world made of up to 90% water, with about 5-10% hydrogen/helium and 5-10% silicates and iron. The upper atmosphere of this planet would be pure\u00A0H/He before transitioning to a mix of water vapor and hydrogen. As you go down further, the air becomes increasingly denser before giving way to a \u0022plasma-water\u0022 ocean, similar to that of Gliese 1214b. It\u0027s possible that on the top of the ocean, it could be almost like an Earthly monsoon climate, except over 1,000\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003EF with incredibly high pressures and no land. The plasma ocean is incredibly hot, but kept liquid due to enormous atmospheric pressure. Deeper in the ocean, the water becomes an incredibly hot and molasses-like soup, before you would reach a solid shell of Ice-VII and Ice-X surrounding a rock and iron core. Absolutely bizarre. It also turns out that EPIC 212157262.02 (Arethusa) is smaller than originally calculated, at just under 2 R\u003Csub\u003EE\u003C/sub\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s everything from the last few weeks of exoplanet research.

Twice, to be exact. On Monday the 22nd, Deiz Alonso\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eet al\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Epublished a paper titled \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06249\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EA system of three transiting super-Earths in a cool dwarf star\u003C/a\u003E\u0022, which validated all three candidates and resized both them and the star. The results are disappointing but at the same time very exciting. The star (now known as \u003Cstrong\u003ELP415-17\u003C/strong\u003E) is almost twice as large as originally expected, with about 58% the radius and 65% the mass of the Sun and a temperature of 4258 K. This makes it a K6V main sequence orange dwarf. The three planets - designated \u003Cstrong\u003ELP415-17b\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Ec\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Ed\u003C/strong\u003E - are much larger than originally calculated, with radii of 1.80, 2.60, and 1.90 R_Earth. The authors also gave likely masses for the planets based off of Geoff Marcy\u0027s mass-radius relationship equation: 4.70 M_Earth for b, 6.50 M_Earth for c, and 4.90 M_Earth for d. As expected, the planets are significantly hotter than before, with equilibrium temperatures of 603 K (626 F), 465 K (377 F), and 325 K (125 F) for an albedo of 0.3. While this seems to kill the potential habitability of LP415-17d, I believe that its position in the system and likely high water content have resulted in a cloudy atmosphere of reflective water clouds. This could bump the planet\u0027s albedo up to 0.7, reducing its equilibrium temperature to 263 K (14 F), and protecting the watery surface from too much heat. But things can never be simple, can they? Literally just ONE DAY later, Teruyuki Hirano\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eet al\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0came out with their own analysis, giving the star slightly smaller parameters and validating the system as\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EK2-155\u003C/strong\u003E. Their results put the star at 0.526 solar radii and 0.540 solar masses with a temperature of 3919 K and a luminosity 0.059 times that of the Sun. The three planets,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EK2-155b\u003C/strong\u003E,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ec\u003C/strong\u003E, and\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ed\u003C/strong\u003E, are significantly smaller and cooler than in the previous paper. They are 1.55, 1.95, and 1.64 R_Earth with equilibrium temperatures of 537 K (507 F), 414 K (286 F), and 289 K (61 F), assuming albedoes of 0.3.

In addition, K2-187 is extremely metal rich, with a metallicity of \u002B0.26 dex, indicating it has about twice the Sun\u0027s content of heavy elements and likely hinting at heavyweight compositions for some of its planets. Whipping around its star in just 0.774 days (18.6 hours) is the hellish K2-187b/Rhoeo.

The front side likely exceeds temperatures of 2,000 K (3,140 F; 1,727 C) and may be enough to vaporize certain metals. One some parts of the planet, magma may rain out of the sky. At least half the planet is covered in a broiling magma ocean. It\u0027s close proximity to K2-187 has likely led to enormous volcanic activity like on 55 Cancri e, where eruptions could create volcanic plumes hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometers tall and wide. However, its orbit is about 4 degrees tilted from those of the other three validated planets. This is likely the work of K2-187c/Chyone.

The star was revealed to be 80.2% the radius and 85.8% the mass of the Sun, with a temperature of 5231 K. This is close to my predictions using the star\u0027s J-H-K magnitude values provided by the 2MASS project.

K2-229b\u0027s extremely close proximity to its star has also likely led to enormous volcanism, possibly even more than K2-187b. In fact, tidal forces are likely so strong that the entire crust may have melted into a broiling global ocean of magma and exploding volcanoes. Molten rock rain is also likely in the forecast. The next planet out is the 2.16 Mini-Neptune K2-229c. It takes 8.33 days to orbit the star and has a Venus-like temperature of 747 K (885 F; 474 C). The planet could be mainly rocky with a steam envelope, similar to K2-187e. The unmentioned third candidate,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EK2-229.03\u003C/strong\u003E, still remains very likely.

Not by a long shot. Just today, a paper was released that presented the most accurate parameters for the K2-229 (EPIC 228801451) system yet, including radial velocity measurements for planets b and c. K2-229b has been re-evaluated at 1.165\u00A0\u00B1\u20090.066 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cvar style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ER\u003C/var\u003E\u003Csub style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;font-size:11.2px;\u0022\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E, significantly smaller than before due to its host star also being slightly smaller.

In fact, K2-229b is probably the closest planet yet found to Mercury, in terms of composition. The planet has a high density of 9.03 g/cm\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0and a strong surface gravity of about 1.9g - for comparison, Eve has 1.7g of gravity. K2-229b is also unbelievably hot, with a temperature calculated at 1,960 K (3,068 F; 1,687 C). This is more than hot enough to melt iron and vaporize certain rocks and metals. It is expected that most, if not all, of K2-229b\u0027s surface is covered in molten rock, maybe with some sandy landmasses on the back side. And by \u0022sand\u0022, I mean broken up volcanic glass.

The goal of this project is to analyze, validate, and publish at least one multi-planet system and likely a few one-planet habitable zone candidate systems. Ajamyajax was the one who first proposed the idea, and I suggested three systems that could be the focus of the study: EPIC 248435473, EPIC 201663913, and EPIC 220221272. The first system is one of my several dozen finds from Campaign 14 and has five planets: two Mini-Neptunes and three small hot Mars-sized planets. However, apparently a few other scientists with far more experience have expressed interest in studying this system, and will likely be validating it within the next few months. The next system, EPIC 201663913, is also a Campaign 14 red dwarf, this time about 40% the size of the Sun. An analysis by citizen scientist zoo3hans (who is one of the co-discoverers of Kepler-86 b) from November 2017 suggested that there could be five Earth-sized and Super-Earth planets orbiting the star, two of which are in the habitable zone. But there\u0027s a problem with the system: because of its faintness, and the weakness of the transits, and the fact that there\u0027s a second brighter star nearby, it is very complex to analyze (ajamyajax couldn\u0027t get any solid results on whether any of the candidates were likely real) and may be a fruitless endeavor.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThat leaves just one system left: EPIC 220221272, aka Dagr, the small red dwarf with five tightly packed planet candidates. Over the last two-ish weeks, ajamyajax has been using the VESPA algorithm to validate the candidates while I look for signs of more. His initial VESPA analysis led to the validation of EPIC 220221272.04 (Hermodr), EPIC 220221272.02 (Gerth), and EPIC 220221272.01 (Freyr). The chances that these three candidates are anything other than planets are astronomically tiny - EPIC 220221272.02 has a nearly 1 in 600,000 chance of being a false positive. The best-fit radii of these planets were also determined, coming out to be 0.84 (\u00B10.13) R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E, 1.17 (\u00B10.07) R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E, and 1.75 (\u00B10.10) R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E. EPIC 220221272 was also determined to be slightly hotter and more luminous than previously thought. Using data from the ESA\u0027s Gaia spacecraft, the star appears to have a temperature of 3859.78 K and a luminosity 0.0135 times that of the Sun. This, unfortunately, puts EPIC 220221272.01 outside the habitable zone with 2.7 times the stellar flux of Earth, but with a sufficient cloud cover its likely watery surface can be kept at comfortable temperatures (given its size it is likely to be anywhere from 10% to 50% water by mass).\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThe other two candidates, EPIC 220221272.03 and EPIC 220221272.05, are giving VESPA a hard time. Their transit signals are relatively \u0022blended in\u0022 to the rest of the data for the star, and because of that, VESPA thinks they\u0027re something called a Blended Eclipsing Binary. Their transit shapes suggest otherwise, but VESPA is being fooled by the stellar noise corrupting the signals for these two candidates. Both are likely still actual planets and ajamyajax is trying to clean up their transit signals as much as possible so VESPA can accurately determine how likely they are to be planets. Meanwhile, I\u0027ve found something interesting: there may be THREE more planets around EPIC 220221272. The first is the original EPIC 220221272.06, with an orbital period of about 20.749\u00A0days near a 3:2 resonance with EPIC 220221272.01. It gets 55% more sunlight than Earth but is likely too small (0.7 to 0.9\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E) to become a Venus-like planet at its temperature. The second is a new signal found just last month by zoo3hans, orbiting every 25.716 days\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Ewhile getting just 16% more light than Earth. It\u0027s designated EPIC 220221272.08, because it was found after this 31.792 day signal now designated EPIC 220221272.07, which gets only 88% as much sunlight as Earth. All three of these candidates could easily be false positives, but EPIC 220221272.06 has the highest chance of being an actual candidate. Ajamyjax began his analysis of the three new candidates two days ago and will likely post his results in the coming days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis discussion on the study and the EPIC 220221272 system can be found at the ends of the Planet Hunters chat pages linked\u00A0below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://talk.planethunters.org/#/boards/BPH0000007/discussions/DPH0001l3k\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://talk.planethunters.org/#/boards/BPH0000007/discussions/DPH0001l3k\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://talk.planethunters.org/#/boards/BPH0000007/discussions/DPH0001fyy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://talk.planethunters.org/#/boards/BPH0000007/discussions/DPH0001fyy\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, here\u0027s a new rendition of the system using the latest results.

Starting in December 2017, less than a week before the New Year, I began a survey of K2 Campaign 14 using LcViewer and a new program, LcSignalFinder. The latter allows the user to select multiple light curves for numerous stars and use the Box-Least Squared (BLS) algorithm to search for signals in them. Most of these signals are just stellar noise or variability, some are eclipsing binaries, but a good amount are likely from legitimate planets. K2 Campaign 14 is (so far) the largest campaign with available processed data, with a total of almost 30,000 stars. It took me until March 13th to complete the entire survey, and over a few weeks I continued to analyze the best candidates and systems I found during the survey to put in a Google Document. Those systems will be presented here, and the Google Doc will be linked at the very end, along with the original two Docs where I recorded all of the candidates I came across. In this post, I will be going far more in-depth into these planets than on any of the documents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 248527709:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0A small orange dwarf of spectral type ~K6V with four potential planets orbiting it. Three were found by BLS, and take 0.903, 5.753, and 10.470 days to orbit the parent star. The inner of the three is an Ultra-Short Period (USP) planet about 14% bigger than Earth with a temperature around 1,160 K (1,628 F) while the other two are hot Mini-Neptunes of 2.13 R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and 1.96\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0with temperatures of 626 K and 512 K (667 and 462 F). In a post-analysis, I found a transit from a potential long-period planet. Based on the size of the star and the duration of the transit, it appears that this fourth planet is about 2.18\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and takes somewhere around 64.308 days to orbit the star. This places it in the inner edge of the habitable zone, with an equilibrium temperature of about 278 K (41 F). However, due to its large size, it is likely a water-dominated planet with no solid surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 248435473:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0The largest system found so far in Campaign 14, this large M0V red dwarf has a bizarre and compact system of five planets. The inner three are quite small, similar in size to Mars with radii of 0.55\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E, 0.63\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E, and 0.62\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E. The innermost of those three is an USP, taking just 0.659 days (15.8 hours) to complete a single orbit. Tidal forces from the star have likely turned it into a scorched, volcanic version of Mars, possibly similar to the Red Planet in its infancy. The other two \u0022Hot Marses\u0022 orbit right on top of each other, with orbital periods of 6.101 and 7.818 days near a 4:3 mean-motion resonance. All three small inner planets have equilibrium temperatures of 1,281 K, 610 K, and 561 K (1,846 F, 638 F, and 550 F). However, the other two planets couldn\u0027t be more different. They are warm Mini-Neptunes of 2.64\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and 2.47\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E, meaning they are not rocky and likely have thick water and gas envelopes. They orbit quite far from the final Hot Mars but, like planets two and three, are in a close orbital resonance. The outer two planets orbit every 14.705 and 19.478 days, very close to a 4:3 resonance as well, with temperatures of 455 K and 414 K (359 F and 286 F). This was one of the systems under consideration for that joint Planet Hunters/Exoplanet Explorers study I mentioned a few days ago, but Andrew Vanderberg has expressed interest in doing an analysis of the system as well, so it\u0027s best to let the professionals handle this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 248463350:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0A very Sun-like star with two hot transiting planets, one Super-Earth/Mini-Neptune and one Hot Neptune. The inner planet is 1.96\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and orbits every 6.40 days with a temperature of 1,050 K (1,430 F). It is likely to have some sort of gas envelope around 0.1-1% of the planet\u0027s total mass, either as water vapor or hydrogen. The second, much larger planet, is even bigger than Neptune at 4.73\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E. It has a year lasting 18.804 days and a temperature of 733 K (860 F). Despite being a rather boring system, it\u0027s a very good target for validation, as the signals of the two planets are quite prominent. In addition, the two candidates are almost exactly in a 3:1 resonance, meaning that they could case visible Transit Timing Variations (TTVs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 248545986:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0A red dwarf with three small transiting planets, all likely to be rocky.

Even though on ExoFOP it\u0027s been given parameters suggest that it\u0027s an M-dwarf, the J/H/K magnitudes of the star are more compatible with a small orange dwarf.

The Sun-like star EPIC 248651022 has three planet candidates - two Mini-Neptunes and one Hot Neptune, all orbiting in less than a week. All of them were analyzed by ajamyajax a few months ago. The first planet is 2.14 (\u00B10.05)\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and takes a mere 1.49 days to orbit, and as a result is blowtorched at a temperature of 1,793 K (2,768 F), almost hot enough to melt iron. It therefore falls into the category of planets know as COSSNs (Closely Orbiting Scorched Sub-Neptunes) and is likely a molten rocky Mega-Earth. Planet c is larger at 2.44\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and is also cooler at 1,374 K (2,014 F), taking 3.302 days to orbit the star. It is too large and not hot enough to be stripped of its volatile envelope like planet b. The first two planets were found to have FPPs low enough to consider them validated, but the third might be a background eclipsing binary. If a real planet, it\u0027s by far the largest at 3.95\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E, almost the size of Neptune, and orbits every 5.116 days with a temperature of 1,187 K (1,677 F). A group of scientists have imaged the star with the Keck telescope back in March, so it looks like it is in the process of being validated right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 248868569:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This is one of my greatest finds ever. At first, it appeared to be just a normal eclipsing binary, with two red dwarfs less than a quarter the size of the Sun each circling each other every 17.461 days in a moderately eccentric (e=0.1505) orbit. However, once highlighting the primary and secondary eclipses, there was one huge dip that remained. A quick analysis revealed this was likely from a Super-Neptune planet, around 5.18\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E, taking no less than 80 days to orbit the binary pair. I had found my first circumbinary candidate planet! I came across it on Valentine\u0027s Day, the same day a one other very intriguing find I will discuss later. Because of how special this discovery was, I decided to give this planet an unofficial nickname, and I finally settled on Montross, which is possibly the only circumbinary gas giant in all of the new Star Wars canon so far and appeared in the series \u003Cem\u003EStar Wars Rebels\u003C/em\u003E. This system was already one of a kind, but almost a month later, on March 13th, it became even more amazing. While doing a re-analysis of it after finishing up my Campaign 14 survey, I spotted a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esecond\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0potential long-period planet transit, this one from a 1.40\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0Super-Earth orbiting even further out than Montross. I decided to continue the Rebels planet name idea, which was a bit of challenge, because Rebels doesn\u0027t have many notable ice worlds like the one I had just found. There were\u00A0Nixus and Killun-71 A, but neither fit. The former is a tiny dead water ice ball, and the latter is part of a binary planet system. Then I realized there was one more named ice planet in Rebels: Krownest (kinda pronounced like \u003Ci\u003ECronus\u003C/i\u003E), a Mandalorian controlled planet in the Outer Rim. Not the most elegant name, but far better than having to constantly call this thing EPIC 248865869 AB c. With some help from ajamyajax, the orbital periods of Montross and Krownest were revealed. It turns out that their actual orbital periods depend on which star they transited. For Montross, its year is either 243.29614 or 475.16407 days, which would put it at 0.601 or 0.910 AU (the combined mass of the stars is about 0.49x Sun) giving it a temperature of 110 K (-262 F) or 90 K (-298 F). That\u0027s cold enough to allow liquid methane on any of its moons, if it has large moons like Titan, but if you think that\u0027s cold then Krownest will be an absolute shock. Its orbit period is either 3.689 or 7.206 YEARS long, which could make it the longest-period transiting planet ever discovered. That puts it at a whopping 1.882 to 2.941 AU away from the binary pair, and considering how the twin suns have a combined luminosity of only about 1.5% that of the Sun, Krownest is beyond freezing. Its temperature is 62 K (-348 F) at the max and 50 K (-370 F) at the minimum. This is cold enough to freeze methane and even nitrogen and oxygen, depending on what the planet\u0027s actual temperature is. If it has a thick atmosphere, Krownest could be an orange Super-Pluto with oceans of liquid nitrogen and/or oxygen. There\u0027s no other planet like it, and it remains by far one of my absolute favorite finds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 248731669:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Another system that was a potential target for that PH/EE study. ExoFOP says this is a red dwarf around a third the size of the Sun with a temperature comparable to an M2V dwarf, but its J/H/K magnitude values suggest a larger M0V dwarf. Its three-planet system is quite similar to K2-155...at least, back when it was still known as EPIC 210897587 - a hot close Earth-sized planet, a large potential Super-Venus further out, and a habitable zone Super-Earth with a size in between that of the inner two planets. Like K2-155, the star and planets are probably larger and hotter than originally estimated. The three planets were found to be 1.04\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E, 1.49\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E, and 1.33\u00A0R\u003Csub\u003E\u2295\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0with equilibrium temperatures of 571 K, 326 K, and 281 K (568 F, 127 F, and 46 F) for the ExoFOP parameters. They orbit the host star every 2.624, 14.047, and 21.963 days near a 20\u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E4:3 resonance chain. The outermost planet, EPIC 248731169 d, may be similar to K2-155d, depending on the exact size of its host star.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEPIC 248740571:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Yet another three-planet system, this is a mid-sized orange dwarf with three \u0022triplet\u0022 Mini-Neptune candidates.
