I posted it on several forums and got some great responses. (And some angry trolls, but hey it is the internet so what can you do)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The introduction video to this idea is here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/mGOsw8CLxmE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/mGOsw8CLxmE\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is a flyby that tears out the Hellas basin. I found that a great many people thought that it went by the Roche limit. I\u0027d just like to point out ahead of time that Mars has a fairly high density so the Roche limit does not come into play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I made a video showing the location of some things around Jupiter because of this common confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/PJumdRcZcUA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/PJumdRcZcUA\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I just made a video showing what I consider to be the most easily grasped evidence of this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/zHGX_ZQwGdA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/zHGX_ZQwGdA\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have a video planned for the trajectory of the event. I found that many people are convinced that falling into Jupiter or being flung out of the solar system are the only options. I found many planetary scientists I contacted recommended the L4 or L5 lagrangian point as the start of the trajectory. I have decided to adopt this rather than my initial idea of a highly elliptical Mars triggered by a orbital resonance. L4 would accelerate while L5 would decelerate leading to the correct Hamiltonian.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I also have a video planned for the timing of the event. One commenter noted that we would of totally noticed this happening. I guess he was thinking that it was breaking news. We have been watching Mars for quite some time and although it saddens me that I have to make it explicit- This event occurred before the invention of astronomy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So I\u0027m posting on this forum to see if there is other flaws of this idea that I have not addressed. I want to run it by as many people as possible before I start the laborious task of submission to journals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So, if you think you have a debunking concept or just a facet of the idea that needs more depth please tell me. It may be something I have worked out already but have not mentioned, but hopefully it might be something that I have missed. I have had this idea for awhile so it appears obvious to me, I understand if it does not appear so to you; I\u0027d like to know why you have a dubious perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you don\u0027t accept the idea but don\u0027t have a reason why, perhaps you can share it with someone who can come up with a reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you like the idea and have a piece of supporting evidence I have not mentioned, that would be great too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you simply like the idea, I always appreciate a like, share or nice comment. The internet can be a very negative place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T20:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EArnt the l4 and L5 points stable?
