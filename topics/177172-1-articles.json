A non-question is a post in every other forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPractically speaking, if you have a question that has an answer to it (a specific answer, like \u0022how do docking ports work\u0022 or something) then you should post it in the appropriate forum and it will be a \u0022question\u0022 post. Then when people answer it, others can vote those answers up and when voted up they move to the top of the page, in order of number of votes. When one solves your problem, you can mark it as correct and it goes to the very top no matter how many votes it or other posts have. Then, people know at a glance if the problem\u0027s been solved. If you\u0027re just curious what people\u0027s opinions are (with no specific answer like \u0022what do you think about SpaceX going to Mars\u0022 or something) then you should post it in the appropriate forum and it will be a regular post.

Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E poses some problem or question, and the various posts tend to be focused on trying to answer that one person\u0027s question, with the idea that when it\u0027s been answered, then the thread is pretty much \u0022done\u0022.\u00A0 Whereas all the other ones (the \u0022discussion\u0022 forums) are more about ongoing discussions where people are posting back and forth at each other, and there\u0027s not really any \u0022done\u0022, per se-- the discussion keeps going as long as people are interested.\u00A0 We\u0027ve got some discussion threads here, for example, that are lively and active and have been going on for \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eyears\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E and have literally thousands of posts in them.\u00A0 (The \u0022What did you do in KSP today?\u0022 thread is one such example.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that posts in the \u0022discussion\u0022 forums can be questions, too-- but they tend to be open-ended what-do-you-think questions instead of how-do-I questions, e.g. \u0022What\u0027s your favorite type of rocket?\u0022 or \u0022How do you like to design your Duna missions?\u0022 or \u0022What\u0027s your favorite moon?\u0022 or what-have-you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
