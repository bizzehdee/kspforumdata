If the frog loses his leg, has he lost apart of himself... or are his legs an entity in themselves?

Can you really separate them, are there not subtle influences over the years to mold your mind into something the body desires? The body that lacks the capacity to produce these chemicals often seeks to supplement them elsewhere, causing various pains unto the mind until the needs have been met. Depression, Addiction, these are physical ailments that create mental components; do you drink because you want to, or do you drink because the neurochemicals released by the body drive you to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question that remains is, admitting that the body can hold control over and influence the mind; what would you be like as a mind without a body. Neurochemicals create feelings of fear, of love, of hate, of passion.... would stripping ourselves away from our bodies would yield a sociopath? Does that mean morality is a physical response; a kindness one body passes onto another but not what one mind passes onto another?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBodies act independent of the mind, they perform actions we wish they did not and do things without our permission.

Or that the body and mind remain one and seritonin production is a result of you, as an organism, feeling down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what is also true is that many of these chemicals aren\u0027t needed for a mind to exist; how far down the rabbit hole can you go?

So Lacks is still with us in her cells, but the reality is that the DNA that is in those cells has evolved away from HeLa prototype, and the prototype itself was cancerous, its not really henrietta anymore, its kind of a zombie cell that only trained scientist can keep going (HeLa cells that are alive today have spent the overwhelming majority of their existence frozen in dimethylsulfoxide solution in liquid nitrogen. If those cells were truely Lacks\u0027s cells, they would have reached their natural limit to divide decades ago and died. So for instance the oldest person that has ever lived had better than good ability to conserve cell divisions while at the same time had good ability to facilitate cell division without transformation. Thats about 130 years of age, there are some stem cells that can divide longer under the right conditions, but by and large by that age at 37\u0027C our cells are playing out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this issue handled lets move to the last one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are treating the human brain like a programmable digital computer. The human brain is a learning machine, it can compute, and there are certain digital qualities to it, but the digital computer and the human brain are very different things. The computer has memory that is near completely erasable and replacable. In the human brain the hardware and software are prettymuch the same thing. And no two human brains are alike. If you took all the memories and higher CNS function of one person and tried to shove it into the brain of someone else, they might see your short-term memories, but by and large the incompatabilities would knock out much of the function and you would have a very confused 2 year old mind that would have to relearn a whole lot (and the older mind cannot adapt as quickly as 2 year old). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour brain has a function, survive and help you reproduce and do optional stuff on the side. You do the optional stuff like create post here because your biology is tolerant of kin- and social selection activities that improve fitness indirectly. It assumes that all the creative stuff will improve the tribe, the nation or the species allowing humans some overall survival benefit. It gets confusing in the short-term whether this works, but in the long-term success is self-evident. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that to answer your question, your brains function stems from its ability to help you survive and reproduce, its function is tied to the rest of your corpse and really has no benefit to you or the rest of society if that corpse is no longer alive. The memories are not like the on and off bits in a computer, and if you somehow could detect all the memories in your brain and transform them into another person you would not have accomplished much because most of your emotional and functional state is hardwired into your brain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"benjee10","CreatedById":84110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T22:13:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the frog legs twitching is to do with reflexes at all actually.

It\u0027s difficult to define and I won\u0027t pretend to be any expert in philosophy by any stretch, but I remember a New Scientist article once that postulated that consciousness was a property of matter, like mass, which arises when information is processed at different levels. Your brain is effectively just an information processor. It takes information from the sensory organs and works out what\u0027s going on, effectively. That\u0027s what consciousness is.

Together they make a conscious experience of playing kerbal.

We have a limited color palate. We need energy to keep running. We have built in anti-virus software. We are good at recognizing patterns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany more factors that play in here, but it\u0027d take an eternity to list them all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the brain consists wholly of physical matter, and the supernatural soul does not exist, then of course the brain is nothing but an extremely powerful computer. What else would or could it be? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, our brains are actually \u003Cem\u003Eimmensely\u003C/em\u003E powerful computers, and have the type of computing power only \u003Cem\u003Eperhaps\u003C/em\u003E exceeded by the most powerful supercomputer in the world (at least, last I checked)- a giant, parallel-processing supercomputer in China that consumes like 20 MW (yes, twenty MEGAWATTS). Silicon is still \u003Cstrong\u003Emany\u003C/strong\u003E orders of magnitude behind biology in efficiency and information processing density.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason that silicon computers outperform us on things like adding numbers is because we did not evolve such an ability because we did not need such an ability. That said, there are of course many areas where we vastly outperform silicon computers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T18:14:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
