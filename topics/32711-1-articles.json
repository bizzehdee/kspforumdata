Thank you to all the coders, modders, grpx artists, animators etc etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027ve noticed lately that people make something great and creative and they\u0027ll post it in the forum without giving any sort of introduction, explanation or screenshots. This hasn\u0027t happened just once or twice - but its happening a lot. I constantly see posts like\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI wanted a sprocket that could widget my Kerbals so I made one.

Clearly the author knew what he was posting about but without context, information, instructions or screenshots, its very difficult to understand what the part is for, why I would want it, or what it looks like. Posts of this nature use to be fantastic months ago. There would be headers with large font. Nice (and sometimes garish) coloured text. Screenshots. Sometimes a fan submitted youtube. Detailed list of functionality and release notes for each version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe forum crash has removed much intellectual property and a lot of knowledge is lost or now resides only in peoples heads. I ask modders who spend weeks on textures and code to please spend another 10 minutes making a first post that gives your fantastic parts the justice they deserve. Modders are volunteers of course and no one can make them explain their parts, but the standard of 1st posts has declined considerably and I hope this can be improved one post at a time. Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yeomans","CreatedById":46569,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T02:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThough there is no remaining evidence of it, I will say that anything I made I tried to at least write a paragraph on, but part of that is due to the fact that I like to write alot, so that may just be me. Though it\u0027s not definitely the whole reason as to why people aren\u0027t writing detailed posts, I can think of one or two small contributing factors as to why. Firstly, I think some people feel that writing too much is a deterrent, and that people won\u0027t want to download their creation if they feel they have to read through a whole essay to do so. On a related note, I think some people are afraid that either bad grammar, or poor rhetoric is going to prevent their creation from being noticed, since the post is a first impression. Surely, not writing very much at all isn\u0027t a solution, but it is a shortcut to an otherwise uncomfortable process, albeit leading to a similar result. Hopefully that will change, I mean, this community is pretty relaxed and open, but I wouldn\u0027t be opposed to a few mod submission guidelines regarding the clarity of submissions, since it only helps the general populace of the forum at the cost of a few minutes by the authors. Once spaceport becomes the de facto method of mod sharing, it may change as well, since the popularity of submissions seems to be more directly linked to how well they are presented.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T02:15:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei wld hve rd thse pst bt thy b 2lng. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pontiac","CreatedById":62216,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T02:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESuggested headings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[standard/Non-Standard] Installation Method \u003C/strong\u003E- If standard, link to the wiki page of how to install a Mod - Non-Standard should give direct instructions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFull Description:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScreen Shots (if applicable)\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed more on SpacePort that there is more and more junk just being pushed up.

So without further ado, you just open up your trunk/bonnet and then take out a machete (or saw, if you don\u0027t like the image in your head of you wielding a machete), go into the woods, and a few minutes later, you emerge with a crudely-hacked \u0022cork\u0022 or wooden plug as a temporary cover for his gas tank.
