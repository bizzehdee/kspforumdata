Basically what happens is that when a crewed vessel is out of snacks, there\u0027s a random chance every few minutes that the Kerbal will pass out for a short duration(currently a random value up to 5 seconds). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a Kerbal passes out a copy of the current state of all flight controls is created. Until the Kerbal wakes up a few seconds later, the previously applied control state will be applied to the vessel. So if you\u0027re pitching up, you will continue to pitch up or translating up it will continue to apply that control. The idea is due to snack deprivation, the Kerbal didn\u0027t realize the controls were no longer supposed to be applied. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this creates a very interesting/risky situation. You can attempt to fly ships with snack deprived Kerbals, but you risk the safety of the mission by doing so. It would be best to attempt a resupply.

This value is configurable and defaults to 150ms(0 will turn off the functionality entirely). I think this is the best way to handle this problem.
