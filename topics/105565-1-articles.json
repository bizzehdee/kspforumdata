Up to even 70km near orbital velocity the mk1 pod will be at temperatures of 1200-1400\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and the conv flux keeps it there all the way. All the while no re entry effects are visible or any glowing of any part. Almost any part pointed straight into the incoming atmosphere I test at the same altitudes and same velocities have 10-100x less conv flux than the mk1 command pod.

After that you can use full thrust and it should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was for KSP before 1.0, but it seems to be still more or less valid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T19:31:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope, it\u0027s totally and completely invalid.

At 0:51 in my video I show the parachute being at a stable temperature of 310 whereas the mk1 pod at the same point is 610 under almost the same conditions, how does that make any sense? Both parts face into the oncoming air stream, the parachute being smaller maybe should get a little less flux, but as it stands it gets a whole lot less heat flux than anything else even though it is in front of everything else and under almost the same circumstances as the mk1 pod. I don\u0027t understand the difference, I\u0027m not convinced that this is merely about going too fast too low in the atmosphere because there is a very significant disparity between the chute and the mk1 pod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T23:36:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 11:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SanderB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alias72","CreatedById":111778,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to gun it you will need to start with a much lower TWR.
