However, for those of us with multiple mods such as RemoteTech and MapSat, we wind up with a fair number of stable-orbit unmanned craft. These aren\u0027t rightly \u0022Probes\u0022, and in a crowded system such as Kerbin can wind up being the dominant type of craft. It would be very handy to be able to distinguish them from probes-ready-to-launch-to-other-planets with a single click in the Tracking Station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hawk_za","CreatedById":59433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T18:20:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebeen waiting a while for this idea\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T18:28:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, planes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T19:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E(Space)planes would definitely deserve their own icon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding \u0022satellite\u0022, I understand you\u0027re trying to distinguish between unmanned ships which are \u0022on mission\u0022 to perform certain task, and unmanned ships which are doing their job in stable orbit.
