To do this, I put up the first version of a tool that allows you to cut and paste from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E into a text box, or save a JSON file and load it. The tool then gives you part count, a hierarchy of the craft parts in tree view, and a few details about each part and the resources they carry. The Color Editor tab lets you see all colors present on the ship, and by selecting a part, you can use the color selector to pick a new base or accent color using RGB, HSV, or Hex. After making your changes, you can copy the JSON out of the text area and paste back into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA short video demonstration is here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5101253402\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/DadJokeCinema/status/1631750448804757521\u0022 style=\u0022height:644px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tool is currently sitting at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ksp2-craft-tools-46qsp.ondigitalocean.app/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ksp2-craft-tools-46qsp.ondigitalocean.app/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLIMITATIONS:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* pasting in a huge JSON file can take a few seconds, just be patient.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* copying and pasting back into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E sometimes messes up fairings and symmetry.
