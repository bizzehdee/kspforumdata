You could hot key them so when you land *pop* shower of confetti with the party horn sound effect. Just a thought, I have no idea how hard it would be to make that part but if someone wants to give it a go please have at it and keep me in the loop!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly safe and Godspeed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESovereignWinter\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
