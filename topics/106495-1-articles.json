For example, GameData\\Squad\\Resources\\ScienceDefs.cfg has some unprintable characters at the beginning of the file, which is presumably because it uses a different character set than other KSP files.\n\nThere is another file that has something strange going on at the end, and I had to re-type some of it to get it to be readable.\n\nAre you interested in knowing about this kind of thing and/or fixing it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T06:21:41Z","Content":"Perhaps you could upload the offending files?
