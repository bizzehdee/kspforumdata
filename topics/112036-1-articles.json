Simple one-click mouse stuff with bright colours, pre-planned missions that you can\u0027t really fail unless you really screw up and an over-the-top UI tutorial all designed in such a way so as to allow a generation of prospective kerbanauts to enjoy the game without them getting upset because of the amazing level of complexity that you have in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think that it might be very helpful as well to first time players too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T08:14:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggested something once that would fit in well with this - an Unkillable Kerbals feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a Kerbal hits the ground, they just bounce, then stand up, brush themselves off and get back to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a manned capsule hits the ground, the Kerbals are ejected, then bounce and stand back up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T09:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a bad idea at all.
