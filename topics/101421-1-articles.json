My impression is that a space program requires computers and calculations, not eyeballing it and holding a wet finger into the wind as the primary means of navigating. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E This game is not alone. I get the same feeling in Elite Dangerous where the ships have no autopilot (although there is a docking computer). Back to KSP, I\u0027ve tried one survey mission, to fly over a location above an altitude multiple times without success. I\u0027ve activated navigation to the point (Map window) and most of the freaking time, the marker is not visible on Nav Ball. It\u0027s on the edge and covered by the display at the top of the Nav Ball. For the developers- activating navigation should place a cursor on the edge Nav Ball that is visible no matter what direction you are heading that guides you in the right direction until the marker itself if visible. Also, when in visual mode, a marker on the horizon seems appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s looks to me I\u0027ve flown close enough, I mean I can see the entire hemisphere, but the conditions are not met. One tip I\u0027ll throw out for newbies, in flight there is a small contract window that can be opened by holding the cursor on it and when conditions are met, they get a green check mark. And when the conditions are no longer met, if you have not competed the terms of the contract, the green check mark goes away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noted the Waypoint manager mod and will give that a try.
