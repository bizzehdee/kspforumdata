So, I have added some bizarre values like 158% and 1.975 and so on.\n\nBut I also realized that things are not so straight forward as I thought. Many mods has close to real life masses, but maybe just 65% of the size. So when you scale up the mass becomes ridiculous. Now SMURFF compensates for this to some degree, but often to much. So now I just calculate the difference and change the part.cfg file.\n\nIt is probably possible to make all this changes using ModManager but I am not at that level yet."},{"CreatedByName":"lordcirth","CreatedById":137417,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T16:42:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2016-12-02 at 9:16 PM, Johnny2000 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Simple answer is always the best ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I was hoping this would be possible, because that would make it easier to replicate the real world counterpart.

You are looking for chain-scaling (LeftCtrl-K), this means if you rescale a part it will (try to) propagate that change to its children. This works recursively on whole subassemblies provided all parts in between are able to follow the rescale (I never use this so I do not have much experience with it)."}]}
