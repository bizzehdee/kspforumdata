How many engines and what sort? Mk 1 or 2 fuselages? Full length for all engines, or nacelles for some? Swept or delta wings? Wings set high, low or centred? Mid-mount or rear? Canards? Tailplanes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Build the core fuselage first, with engines but without detailing. Then make the sides: additional fuselage sections, engines, intakes, nacelles, wing pieces, control surfaces. Engage symmetry and slide this piece up and down the core until you\u0027re happy with the CoM/dCoM position and relationship. If you can be bothered, remove the intakes and engines and replace them in order to control the air-demand priority: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64362-Fuel-Flow-Rules-%280-23-5%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64362-Fuel-Flow-Rules-%280-23-5%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Tweak the wing position, add or remove canards and stabilisers.

This makes the rear-lateral tanks the farthest (and therefore first-drained) from the core engines. I then add a pair of fuel lines from the rear of the core directly to the lateral engines; this forces them to draw via the core, making rear lateral the first tank to drain for them as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis arrangement ensures that any initial mass shift will be forwards, enhancing stability. After the lateral tanks drain, the core will burn from front to rear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn some circumstances, particularly on single-fuselage planes, it can be worthwhile to lock off a forward tank as a \u0022reserve\u0022. Just use the right-click tweakable to disable fuel flow, and remember to reenable it when appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these balancing tricks become superfluous if you have TAC Fuel Balancer (good) or Goodspeed (better) installed. Goodspeed in particular allows for all sorts of pumping/balancing possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EdCoM Hunting\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet RCS Build Aid. Seriously. You need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, now that you can see your CoM and dCoM (dry, unfuelled centre of mass) markers at the same time, you want to start bringing them together. You want to get the CoM/dCoM offset down to 1m or less. Fortunately, it isn\u0027t too hard to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe markers update live. Build your tank/engine/intake/wing combo, engage symmetry, and slide them up and down the fuselage. Watch the CoM/dCoM relationship change as you do. Spread your fuel load laterally, not longitudinally. Mid-mounted engines provide more flexibility in fuel placement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re carrying cargo, place the CoMs under the middle of the cargo bay. Think about the location of CoMs in relation to landing gear and takeoff rotation. Get your weight balance right, then fiddle about with CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen adjusting more precisely, remember that parts without fuel move both CoMs but parts with fuel move CoM much more than dCoM. Structural fuselages are useful, as are partly-full tanks. Weight a long way from CoM has a big effect, weight close to CoM a small effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can design perfectly well just by eyeball and flight testing; the flight data isn\u0027t absolutely necessary.

Mostly, however, all you want to do is make as many as possible of the numbers green and as few as possible red.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one other useful thing on this screen is the \u0022level flight\u0022 stuff up top right. If you set the analysis for sea level pressure and temperature and the speed for whatever you think you can reach on the runway, you can find out how much AoA you need to take off (the \u0022level flight\u0022 value). Try to keep that number below ten for easy takeoffs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to Apply FAR Aero Analyses\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pretty graphs: use these to check for excessive drag and regions of instability. AoA graph is the more useful of the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumbers: use the Level Flight figure to work on your takeoff speed and flap settings. For the stability figures, check takeoff (1.125 pressure and .35 or so speed), low altitude (1 pressure and .8 speed), Mach 1 (speed obvious, pressure up to you) and edge of rocketry (0.01 pressure, Mach 5). You want green everywhere. You won\u0027t get it, at least to start with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHover your mouse over the red ones and use the picture above to work out what the tooltips mean. Once you decode the x\u0027s and y\u0027s, usually they just mean something like \u0022has a tendency to roll when pitching up\u0022 or similar. Sometimes the solutions are obvious (e.g. too much yaw slippage, add a rudder), sometimes they take a great deal of trial and error to sort out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, these do affect the analyses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR allows some options beyond stock here. You can activate or deactivate axes, adjust max deflection and set flaps and spoilers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the axes, think about what each control surface is intended to do. Control surfaces should be as far from their axis of rotation as possible, and as close as possible to the other axes. So, elevators at front and rear on the centreline, ailerons out to the side, flaps and spoilers at mid-centre, rudder right up the back, maybe some elevons mid-wing if it\u0027s a rear delta design. It\u0027s usually best if a control surface has one job only; you don\u0027t want inputs for one thing affecting something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximum control authority is basically the thrust limiter for your control surfaces. Too little, and the plane won\u0027t do what you tell it to; too much, and the plane becomes a hair-triggered bomb waiting for an aerodynamic failure. How much is largely a matter of personal taste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Calibri, Geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EGenerally though, you want the values on rear surfaces to be higher than those up front (canards etc.). Manoeuvrability and stability are two sides of the same coin; improving one degrades the other and vice-versa. Forward-mounted control surfaces are better for manoeuvrability; rear-mounted control surfaces are better for stability. Mid-mounted surfaces should be ailerons on the wingtips and pure flaps/spoilers near the centreline.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlaps add drag and increase lift. Use them to lower your stall speed at takeoff and landing. Spoilers add drag and reduce lift. Use them to lower your plane to the runway without needing to pitch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, the control surfaces need to be right on CoM or balanced either side of it. If this isn\u0027t the case, activating the flaps/spoilers will also cause an alteration in pitch. Don\u0027t bother with flaps unless you need them for takeoff, and be sure to set a pair of action groups to raise and lower them.
