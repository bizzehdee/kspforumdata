I do know that the types of symmetry are different between the two and can break things if trying to edit one type in the other editor. Here\u0027s what I do to get around this when making rovers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI start with a probe core, and attach a docking port or decoupler to it, and then start building the rover starting with the docking clamp on the other side... this way, I can use subassembly loader to grab the entire rover below the docking clamp, and save it as a subassembly to be imported into other ships inside the VAB. This only works because the root piece is NOT on the rover, but on the part the rover attaches to, thus allowing me to remove the rover and duplicate or attach it anywhere else I please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have subassembly loader and still want to import it into an existing rocket or lifter file, you can copy the internals of the craft file of the rover (not including the header) and append it to the end of the craft file of the rocket you want to attach it to... then you\u0027ll be able to grab it in the VAB and attach it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
