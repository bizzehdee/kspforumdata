(had that happen on the Mun in .20, I was trying to get a really low orbit for a challenge, it was in the high 3000s for apoapsis and periapsis, but it started at 5000 each. Eventually, my periapsis got down to under 2000 and I crashed into a crater wall. before that though, I went within 25, or even 15, meters several times on different terrain objects, which for a ship of that size, is basically enough that rotation makes the difference between exploding and orbitting) Also, time-accelerate once you can, because that will prevent the Kraken from causing your orbit to change (deteriorate, it is almost always in the lowering your energy direction for some reason).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loknar","CreatedById":77750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T07:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalmaps.com/charts/elevation_inclination/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kerbalmaps.com/charts/elevation_inclination/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand select Minimus.
