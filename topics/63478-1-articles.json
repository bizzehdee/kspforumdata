First I built a craft that can lift off kerbin and make low kerbin orbit. (Since I knew duna was similar to kerbin, but didn\u0027t have as dense of an atmosphere, I knew(hoped) I would have fuel left over for the transfer burn back to kerbin) This craft should have small fuel tanks and small engines, use asparagus staging, and have a one man capsule. If you create a craft that can do that, you will have plenty of fuel to take off from duna and return to kerbin. That is your landing and return stage. Second, you must build your transfer stage. This stage can be smaller than expected, maybe 4 small engines and a medium tank. Thirdly, you must build a lift-off stage to get the entire thing into LKO. This will require some experimentation, but I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll get it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you should know how to aerobrake when you arrive at duna and use F5 to quicksave to get the perfect maneuver. Even when you enter the landing sequence of your mission, it\u0027s easy to hit the wrong parachute or the structure of your craft could fail, etc, so use F5 and F9 to reload. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother trick I learned is when you first enter the SOI of another planet, put a node down and drag the blue circle so your Pe drops to the desired altitude above the planet.

This makes it much easier to get everything into orbit and still have fuel. It also means that if you miscalculate and are low on fuel after launching, you can send up a fuel-bearing probe to dock with your spacecraft and top off the tanks. It\u0027s also very handy for the Duna landing itself, since you\u0027re not forced to drop tons of fuel into Duna\u0027s gravity well only to lift it back out when you leave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe interplanetary module will have the highest-ISP engines you can manage - nuclear engines if you have them. If not, just grab whatever engines have the highest ISP value. The basic design is a ring of engines around a big fuel tank. You don\u0027t need much thrust for this module, but don\u0027t skimp \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E much on engine power or your maneuvers will take ages to complete - that hurts efficiency, but mostly it\u0027s just a drain on your patience. I usually go with 4 nuclear engines, although that\u0027s probably overkill. Two is the minimum I\u0027m willing to use, although you can probably get away with a single nuclear engine if you\u0027ve got enough patience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander module will have a bunch of parachutes - probably twice what you need for landing on Kerbin - and some high-efficiency engines. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is thin, but aerobraking is still the most efficient way to land there. Make sure you enter Duna at a very shallow angle to maximize the amount of time spent aerobraking. Even with parachutes, you might need a little bit of engine power to keep the landing soft, but if you\u0027ve done it right you\u0027ll land with 99% of your fuel remaining. One upshot of the thin atmosphere is that engines which are most effective in vacuum are still decent on Duna. Nuclear engines are a bit heavy and awkward for a lander, but the other high-ISP engines work fine. Duna\u0027s gravity is low enough that you don\u0027t need much thrust to make it back up out of the atmosphere. If you\u0027re having trouble getting back into orbit, make your lander such that the science modules can be detached and abandoned on the surface of Duna - you can have your Kerbal get out and physically move the science into the crew module for return to Kerbin so you don\u0027t have to haul the weight of the science modules everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that helps a lot is to make your Duna transfer a the right \u003Cem\u003Etime\u003C/em\u003E - a quick search for \u0022Kerbal Interplanetary Transfer\u0022 should show you some good guides for how to get that done so that your delta-V requirements are as low as possible. Just don\u0027t get too obsessed with transferring at \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E the right time - an error of a few days will cost you some delta-V, but Duna is big enough that you don\u0027t have to be super-precise with your intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have docking modules yet, your job gets harder - but not impossible. Instead of having separate spacecraft, you\u0027ll use separate stages. Just make sure that both the lander and the interplanetary stage have crew capacity. Use the lander stage to land on Duna and get your science, then rendezvous with the interplanetary stage. EVA to move your kerbal to the interplanetary stage (don\u0027t forget to take your science with you!), then abandon your lander stage in Duna orbit and return home. The main disadvantages of this method are that you have to launch everything in one piece and you don\u0027t have the option of refueling once you are in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oggula","CreatedById":10927,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T18:42:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is my early tech Duna and Ike double lander.

You\u0027ve definitely got enough tech for an interplanetary flight, no doubt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d next get Specialized Construction so you\u0027ve got at least basic Clamp-O-Trons and then follow it up with Advanced MetalWorks. Only another 480 science. That\u0027d open up a possible lander - transfer stage combination. You could build a transfer stage pretty damned easily - like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/QzzzR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

They allow fuel cross feed and are still reasonably sturdy. You\u0027d just set them down parallel to the edge of the central tank. Only drawback is that they look ugly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your case, you\u0027d replace the large probe core with an OKTO probe core and the Clamp-O-Tron Sr. with a standard Clamp-O-Tron. I\u0027d recommend sticking the panels and batts to the sides instead of the tops like you have them. That\u0027s only 42 tonnes - easily launched with the tech you\u0027ve got. You could even launch it single stage - your booster would consist of a stack decoupler and seven stacks, one centerline and six outboard. Each individual stack would consist of -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5x X200-32 Fuel Tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x X200-16 Fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x LV-T45 (center)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6x LV-T30 (outboard, on BZ-52s just like that transfer stage design)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus enough struts to keep the whole thing from pancaking. No fuel lines - this ain\u0027t asparagus...which you could do and it\u0027d be way more efficient than the single stack to boot. If you need to see what the actual design looks like, holler; I haven\u0027t got this actual design built but it\u0027d be pretty easy to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat oughta get you a transfer stage into orbit with enough juice to haul a lander with a mass of up to 58 tonnes to Duna and back with a big enough margin for error to cover everything except for extremely poor piloting (for the record, the round trip bit under optimal conditions requires 1,710 m/s of delta-V and the 58 tonne figure would give you 150% of that). I don\u0027t have any RCS anywhere on that transfer stage so she won\u0027t turn very fast unless the engines are lit; that should only be a consideration when it comes time to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich just leaves you to design a lander with the specifications you want. It\u0027d need about 1500 m/s of delta-V all told, more (2600 at least) if you don\u0027t add chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-18T22:15:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2014 10:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T21:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not take the Science Lab with you on your trip?
