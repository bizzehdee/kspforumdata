You see, when MS Flight Simulator renders its high detail terrain, it does so by only loading and working with the general area around where your plane is. That way, it can dedicate all of its resources into making it high fidelity. It gets away with doing this because the view distance and achievable altitude are limited. KSP\u0027s engine, meanwhile, needs to render the entire planet at once - because it is possible to go so high up that you can literally see all of it at once. Even though it does some distance-based level of detail scaling for the PQS system (the stuff which is used to shape terrain), the sheer size required for a planet-wide texture on a real scale Earth to display anywhere near the same fidelity as found in Flight Simulator would be crippling. As in, you would need a video card with 64 GB VRAM or more, just to work on it without swapping to system memory (or worse, to disk). Today\u0027s most absurdly excessive video cards, which cost well above $1000, have 12 GB.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to mention that you\u0027d have to increase the PQS fidelity by an order of magnitude to accurately represent realworld terrain structures. Not sure that part is even moddable. And if it was, you could expect a major performance hit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich also applies for large amounts of buildings. I mean, KerbinSide gets pretty close to having a town-sized \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E area if you really go for it, and I think I previously saw a cityscape with real skyscrapers implemented in some video, but you want more than one. You want them all over the place, and some metropolitan areas are huge. Like, the greater Tokyo area is larger than Wales, and it is full of buildings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd that to the heightened PQS detail and the absurd planet texture size required, and you can probably guess where the framerate would be going in the process...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even IF, a big if, your computer could handle it (which it cannot)... you\u0027d have to build it all yourself. PQS is not something you can just import an arbitrary dataset about terrain elevations into. You have to \u003Cem\u003Esculpt\u003C/em\u003E it. And those buildings and city scapes? You better believe that at bare minimum you\u0027d need to manually arrange imported assets in the correct positions on the planet surface. Flight Simulator was built by a team of people, over years of development. Repeating the feat alone, even if the terrain work is only a small subset of the total effort, won\u0027t be quick or easy.
