It just makes the rescooures tab scary, and resupplying complicated. What I would like is a life support system with unique rescoures, where not each rescoure is necessary, it is friendly for beginners (doing stuffs such as a suborbital flight or simply orbiting needs no addons), but hardcore on long-term, and certain rescoures can be regenerated after visiting certain places and doing certain things.

Why? to have one more bar at the rescoures? Who said kerabls produce waste? Or that they don\u0027t dump it immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMorale\u003C/strong\u003E determines how effectively they perform their \u003Cem\u003Etasks\u003C/em\u003E as a pilot, engineer, and scientist. Of course, they don\u0027t have so much tasks currently. Kerbonauts should have vital tasks so that a low morale would pull back the mission. I have another suggestion to do that, but I will suggest that on another day. Rapidly performing tasks, not having any action for long times (long timewarps), and losing crewmembers might lower this. Having actions such as passing a celestial body, landing, going on EVA there, docking, or meeting a new crew (crew replacement) might increase this. Morale is largely drained during many-year-long interplanetary missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECondition\u003C/strong\u003E determines how quickly they move, and how much they consume from the life support rescoures. Having a realy low condition might cause the kerbonaut to fail performing his\u003Cem\u003E tasks. \u003C/em\u003ETaking damage such as hitting the kerbonaut or his pod might lower this permanently, unless healed (astronaut complex?medbay?). After upgrading the astronaut complex, your applicants will not only have starting XP, but they will have a higher condition (due to the advanced training). Condition might be lowered permadently during many-year-long interplanetary missions, and increased by \u003Cem\u003Egee forces*.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the \u003Cstrong\u003ETemperature\u003C/strong\u003E of your kerbonaut is too high or low, he will have his condition lowered. If he spends too much time with a high or low temperature, he \u003Cem\u003Edies\u003C/em\u003E. So either \u003Cem\u003Eperform short EVAs*\u003C/em\u003E, or use an upgraded astronaut complex to reinforce the suits of certain kerbonauts, to have better isolation--\u0026gt;higher max; lower min. temperature. Temperature problems may occur during EVAs, or if one of your pods is overheating/cooling down. Don\u0027t froget your radiators! Also, how about kerbals producing heat? On certain ceestials, temperature might be a big problem, but on others, wich are easier, and beginner-friendly (Mun, Minmus), you don\u0027t have to worry about temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERadiation\u003C/strong\u003E might affect the crew in certain environments. Either in EVA, or in your pod. If a kerbonaut recieves radiation that exceeds a limit, he might take permanent damage (lowered condition) until he\u0027s healed (astronaut complex?medbay?). Over a certain limit, he might \u003Cem\u003Edie. \u003C/em\u003ETo avoid this, either \u003Cem\u003Ehide your lander/spacecraft*\u003C/em\u003E in an area where the radiation is lower (maybe in an abyss? or behind a mountain?), use radiation-protected pods, and in EVA, \u003Cem\u003Ego for short EVAs*\u003C/em\u003E, or reinforce the suits of certain kerbonauts with a radiation-protection. Radiation is not a problem on the beginner-friendly moons of Kerbin, but it can be a factor to increase the difficulity of certain celestial bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now, to the rescoures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbonauts requie \u003Cstrong\u003Eair\u003C/strong\u003E. This is a rescoure that is necessary in short-term, but thus, each cockpit and pod has plenty of it, so beginners don\u0027t have to worry about it either. No additional air is needed for M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn-missions, but if you don\u0027t hurry with Minmus, you might ran out of it. I don\u0027t want to say fix values, but how about an EVA suit having enough air supply for 3 hours, and a small Mk.1 pod having enough air for 4-5days? To supply kerbals with air, your pod/cockpit/EVAsuit drains electricity (this would mean that pods\u0026amp;EVA suits should have more batteries). If you either run out of electricity or air supply (maybe your morale lowered? Who wouldn\u0027t start panicking? Oh, frogot about Jeb:sticktongue:.),still there would be enough air, outside your life support system, to keep you alive for maybe half a hour in EVA, and a day in the Mk.1 pod. After that, they \u003Cem\u003Edie\u003C/em\u003E. To avoid cheating, the rescoures you take with yourself for an EVA (air, electricity, monopropellant) should be taken from your pod, of course. If you need even more air, for a quite long mission, you could supply it with small external/inline tanks. Rather easy to supply large ammouts of air. Huge tanks available for space stations, and many-year-long interplanetary missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn mid-term, kerbonauts requie \u003Cstrong\u003Ewater\u003C/strong\u003E. If they don\u0027t get enough water for maybe more than a day, they will have a lowered condition. If they don\u0027t get water for maybe 2-3 days, they \u003Cem\u003Edie.\u003C/em\u003E IVA suit would have no water, and the Mk.1 pod would have enough water for 5-6 days. This means you wouldn\u0027t need water supply for neither a moon, nor a minmus-mission. Water can be supplied with medium-sized tanks, wich are rather heavy, like rocket fuel tanks. Supplying water is the hardest of these, so there might be a need to find it yourself. It is also the most easy to find/extract. Again, large tanks available for space stations, and many-year-long interplanetary missions. But they are very heavy and big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn long-term, kerbonauts requie \u003Cstrong\u003Esnacks. \u003C/strong\u003EIf they don\u0027t eat for more than maybe 3-4 days, they will have a lowered condition. If they don\u0027t eat for more than maybe 1-2weeks, they die. Again, you don\u0027t need any snacks for a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn/Minmus mission. Neither EVA nor the Mk.1 pod has snack supplies. Snacks are very light and small. They are very very easy to resupply anywhere, but with a reason: they are the hardest to acquire on the field. Supplying a very large ammout of snacks is easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you are thinking in\u003Cstrong\u003E stations or interplanetary\u003C/strong\u003E, the mid and long-term problems appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to have some \u003Cstrong\u003Ecrew modules\u003C/strong\u003E with beds. If your crew can sleep, they won\u0027t lose condition on mid-term. With a Minmus-mission at the border of short-term, amd mid-term. You might want to sleep, if you don\u0027t want to return from Minmus with a slightly lowered condition. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn many-year-long missions, due to weightlessness, the condition of your crew will start to drop dramatically. To avoid this, you might want to have \u003Cstrong\u003Etraining machines\u003C/strong\u003E, so they can remain fit. I think artificial gravity would not be supported much, but as mentioned before, having larger gee forces for longer times could act like having training machines, so this would only be a problem on very long term. For example, I would like to have Duna-misions witouth lowered condition due to weightlessness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause supplying water is hard, it is even harder on long-term. That\u0027s why a \u003Cstrong\u003Ewater-recycler\u003C/strong\u003E can be vital. A machine, that can recycle the water used by 1-2 or 3 kerbonauts. Maybe 50-80% of the water could be recycled. Because I wouldn\u0027t like to measure \u0022waste water\u0022, this would rather mean that 50-80% less water will be consumed. A rather heavy device, due to the fact that it saves lots of mass. It needs a large ammout of electricity to operate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere could also be an \u003Cstrong\u003Eair-recycler\u003C/strong\u003E machine. Because turning CO\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E2\u003C/span\u003E into O\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E2\u003C/span\u003E and C is a very complicated, costly, and nearly impossible process, this machine could be large, rather heavy, and would need tremendous ammouts of power to run. Altough it could recycle a very large percentage of the air, due to the fact that this machine is heavy, costly, and resupplying air is not, the efficiency of this machine is unsure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the hard-to-acquire snacks should have something that reduces their consumption. I tought about a \u003Cstrong\u003EFood Processing and Preparing Unit\u003C/strong\u003E (kitchen) that reduces the consumption of food. Maybe with a 20-30%...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the other pods could be equipped with some of these. Or maybe they would only have enough space for a few of these. For example, the Mk1-2 pod could have the beds, and space for an optimal addon. The Mk3 cockpit could have the beds and 1-2 optimal addons. And so on with the crew cabins. Mk2 Crew cabins with beds, Mk3 passanger modules with beds and a larger, optimal addon, capable of supplying all passangers. The hitchhiker container could be a very-long-term option, with beds, training machines, the kitchen, and enough board games so that your kerbals will never lose morale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bet many of you would like to find/\u003Cstrong\u003Eproduce rescoures\u003C/strong\u003E on the field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few options are obvious, such as reciving air if you have intake air on Kerbin/Laythe. Altough the \u003Cem\u003EXM-G50 Radial Air Intake\u003C/em\u003E is an ugly piece of device, it could have pumps in it, generating airflow even while you\u0027re still. Good for bases. It could be used for reloading your oxygen tanks. But I would like to have much more options. What I would like is a chemical processing unit, maybe just a small, 1m device, that works similarry to the \u003Cem\u003EISRU Converter\u003C/em\u003E, but it can proceed various materials collected on the celestial bodies, such as intake air from Jool, Duna, Eve, ect. A new tool, a \u0022sucker\u0022 could also be introduced, to collect the fluids of planets for processing. I think the water of Kerbin and Laythe shouldn\u0027t need processing to be able to drink it. Also, a new harvester could be added. Unlike the big industrial drill, wich drills down the surface for ores, a light, cheaper, lower-tech harvester could be used to collect the soil of a planet for processing. The mentioned processer could turn the various liquids, air intakes, and soils into various chemical materials. Mostly to get water, but some chemicals could be used as ingredients for Liquid fuel, Oxidizer, Monopropellant, and sometimes to get air-supply. KSP could be made more educational, if it would teach the chemical background of making things like rocket fuel and water from different substances. And getting food? I don\u0027t really support the idea of greenhouses, that\u0027s why I would rather make snacks easily-suppliable. Or max getting it from the soil of Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe life support system I described would not only be rather simple, beginner-friedly, and hard on long term, it would also help making KSP more educational, open a wide new array of torment possibilities, and add more stuffs to space stations, bases, and inteplanetary ships, making them more homey. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI promised to write the suggestions of others here, but I kinda abandoed this thread, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-24T16:35:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2015 04:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTurbomuffin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T18:42:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that best case, we have just \u0022snacks\u0022.

Simply having water recyclers on board your ship adds nothing to the experience except added mass to any long term mission. Fun factor there is not especially high. On the other hand, having something inherently useful about, say, Duna\u0027s poles or Laythe\u0027s atmosphere, requires that access to large quantities of water or oxygen carry specific advantages beyond what you could obtain by merely reusing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossibly this could be accomplished with the simple non-reusability of food/snacks.
