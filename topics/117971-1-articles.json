But what kind of life support would you like to see? I\u0027d like you to share your thoughts.\n\n* * *\nThe life support system I would like to see:\nFor me, I wouldn\u0027t like to see something like TAC LS; As you have 6 or 7 rescoures, that are drained at the same time, and wastes are produced. It just makes the rescooures tab scary, and resupplying complicated. What I would like is a life support system with unique rescoures, where not each rescoure is necessary, it is friendly for beginners (doing stuffs such as a suborbital flight or simply orbiting needs no addons), but hardcore on long-term, and certain rescoures can be regenerated after visiting certain places and doing certain things. The possible issues might be solved with *improvisation\\** ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)(yeah, I will mark the improvisation like *this\\**).\n\nEach kerbal would have stats, such as\n\n- morale\n- condition.\n- temperature\n- radiation\n\nand they would consume rescoures such as\n\n- air / oxygen\n- water\n- food / snacks\n\nThey would not produce wastes. Why? to have one more bar at the rescoures? Who said kerabls produce waste? Or that they don\u0027t dump it immediately.\n\n**Morale** determines how effectively they perform their *tasks* as a pilot, engineer, and scientist. Of course, they don\u0027t have so much tasks currently. Kerbonauts should have vital tasks so that a low morale would pull back the mission. I have another suggestion to do that, but I will suggest that on another day. Rapidly performing tasks, not having any action for long times (long timewarps), and losing crewmembers might lower this. Having actions such as passing a celestial body, landing, going on EVA there, docking, or meeting a new crew (crew replacement) might increase this. Morale is largely drained during many-year-long interplanetary missions.\n\n**Condition** determines how quickly they move, and how much they consume from the life support rescoures. Having a realy low condition might cause the kerbonaut to fail performing his *tasks.* Taking damage such as hitting the kerbonaut or his pod might lower this permanently, unless healed (astronaut complex?medbay?). After upgrading the astronaut complex, your applicants will not only have starting XP, but they will have a higher condition (due to the advanced training). Condition might be lowered permadently during many-year-long interplanetary missions, and increased by *gee forces\\*.*\n\nIf the **Temperature** of your kerbonaut is too high or low, he will have his condition lowered. If he spends too much time with a high or low temperature, he *dies*. So either *perform short EVAs\\**, or use an upgraded astronaut complex to reinforce the suits of certain kerbonauts, to have better isolation--\u003Ehigher max; lower min. temperature. Temperature problems may occur during EVAs, or if one of your pods is overheating/cooling down. Don\u0027t froget your radiators! Also, how about kerbals producing heat? On certain ceestials, temperature might be a big problem, but on others, wich are easier, and beginner-friendly (Mun, Minmus), you don\u0027t have to worry about temperature.\n\n**Radiation** might affect the crew in certain environments. Either in EVA, or in your pod. If a kerbonaut recieves radiation that exceeds a limit, he might take permanent damage (lowered condition) until he\u0027s healed (astronaut complex?medbay?). Over a certain limit, he might *die.* To avoid this, either *hide your lander/spacecraft\\** in an area where the radiation is lower (maybe in an abyss? or behind a mountain?), use radiation-protected pods, and in EVA, *go for short EVAs\\**, or reinforce the suits of certain kerbonauts with a radiation-protection. Radiation is not a problem on the beginner-friendly moons of Kerbin, but it can be a factor to increase the difficulity of certain celestial bodies.\n\nAnd now, to the rescoures.\n\nKerbonauts requie **air**. This is a rescoure that is necessary in short-term, but thus, each cockpit and pod has plenty of it, so beginners don\u0027t have to worry about it either. No additional air is needed for M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn-missions, but if you don\u0027t hurry with Minmus, you might ran out of it. I don\u0027t want to say fix values, but how about an EVA suit having enough air supply for 3 hours, and a small Mk.1 pod having enough air for 4-5days? To supply kerbals with air, your pod/cockpit/EVAsuit drains electricity (this would mean that pods\u0026EVA suits should have more batteries). If you either run out of electricity or air supply (maybe your morale lowered? Who wouldn\u0027t start panicking? Oh, frogot about Jeb:sticktongue:.),still there would be enough air, outside your life support system, to keep you alive for maybe half a hour in EVA, and a day in the Mk.1 pod. After that, they *die*. To avoid cheating, the rescoures you take with yourself for an EVA (air, electricity, monopropellant) should be taken from your pod, of course. If you need even more air, for a quite long mission, you could supply it with small external/inline tanks. Rather easy to supply large ammouts of air. Huge tanks available for space stations, and many-year-long interplanetary missions.\n\nOn mid-term, kerbonauts requie **water**. If they don\u0027t get enough water for maybe more than a day, they will have a lowered condition. If they don\u0027t get water for maybe 2-3 days, they *die.* IVA suit would have no water, and the Mk.1 pod would have enough water for 5-6 days. This means you wouldn\u0027t need water supply for neither a moon, nor a minmus-mission. Water can be supplied with medium-sized tanks, wich are rather heavy, like rocket fuel tanks. Supplying water is the hardest of these, so there might be a need to find it yourself. It is also the most easy to find/extract. Again, large tanks available for space stations, and many-year-long interplanetary missions. But they are very heavy and big.\n\nOn long-term, kerbonauts requie **snacks.** If they don\u0027t eat for more than maybe 3-4 days, they will have a lowered condition. If they don\u0027t eat for more than maybe 1-2weeks, they die. Again, you don\u0027t need any snacks for a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn/Minmus mission. Neither EVA nor the Mk.1 pod has snack supplies. Snacks are very light and small. They are very very easy to resupply anywhere, but with a reason: they are the hardest to acquire on the field. Supplying a very large ammout of snacks is easy.\n\nOf course, if you are thinking in **stations or interplanetary**, the mid and long-term problems appear.\n\nYou might want to have some **crew modules** with beds. If your crew can sleep, they won\u0027t lose condition on mid-term. With a Minmus-mission at the border of short-term, amd mid-term. You might want to sleep, if you don\u0027t want to return from Minmus with a slightly lowered condition. \n\nOn many-year-long missions, due to weightlessness, the condition of your crew will start to drop dramatically. To avoid this, you might want to have **training machines**, so they can remain fit. I think artificial gravity would not be supported much, but as mentioned before, having larger gee forces for longer times could act like having training machines, so this would only be a problem on very long term. For example, I would like to have Duna-misions witouth lowered condition due to weightlessness.\n\nBecause supplying water is hard, it is even harder on long-term. That\u0027s why a **water-recycler** can be vital. A machine, that can recycle the water used by 1-2 or 3 kerbonauts. Maybe 50-80% of the water could be recycled. Because I wouldn\u0027t like to measure \u0022waste water\u0022, this would rather mean that 50-80% less water will be consumed. A rather heavy device, due to the fact that it saves lots of mass. It needs a large ammout of electricity to operate.\n\nThere could also be an **air-recycler** machine. Because turning CO2 into O2 and C is a very complicated, costly, and nearly impossible process, this machine could be large, rather heavy, and would need tremendous ammouts of power to run. Altough it could recycle a very large percentage of the air, due to the fact that this machine is heavy, costly, and resupplying air is not, the efficiency of this machine is unsure.\n\nAnd the hard-to-acquire snacks should have something that reduces their consumption. I tought about a **Food Processing and Preparing Unit** (kitchen) that reduces the consumption of food. Maybe with a 20-30%...\n\nI think the other pods could be equipped with some of these. Or maybe they would only have enough space for a few of these. For example, the Mk1-2 pod could have the beds, and space for an optimal addon. The Mk3 cockpit could have the beds and 1-2 optimal addons. And so on with the crew cabins. Mk2 Crew cabins with beds, Mk3 passanger modules with beds and a larger, optimal addon, capable of supplying all passangers. The hitchhiker container could be a very-long-term option, with beds, training machines, the kitchen, and enough board games so that your kerbals will never lose morale.\n\nI bet many of you would like to find/**produce rescoures** on the field.\n\nA few options are obvious, such as reciving air if you have intake air on Kerbin/Laythe. Altough the *XM-G50 Radial Air Intake* is an ugly piece of device, it could have pumps in it, generating airflow even while you\u0027re still. Good for bases. It could be used for reloading your oxygen tanks. But I would like to have much more options. What I would like is a chemical processing unit, maybe just a small, 1m device, that works similarry to the *ISRU Converter*, but it can proceed various materials collected on the celestial bodies, such as intake air from Jool, Duna, Eve, ect. A new tool, a \u0022sucker\u0022 could also be introduced, to collect the fluids of planets for processing. I think the water of Kerbin and Laythe shouldn\u0027t need processing to be able to drink it. Also, a new harvester could be added. Unlike the big industrial drill, wich drills down the surface for ores, a light, cheaper, lower-tech harvester could be used to collect the soil of a planet for processing. The mentioned processer could turn the various liquids, air intakes, and soils into various chemical materials. Mostly to get water, but some chemicals could be used as ingredients for Liquid fuel, Oxidizer, Monopropellant, and sometimes to get air-supply. KSP could be made more educational, if it would teach the chemical background of making things like rocket fuel and water from different substances. And getting food? I don\u0027t really support the idea of greenhouses, that\u0027s why I would rather make snacks easily-suppliable. Or max getting it from the soil of Minmus.\n\nThe life support system I described would not only be rather simple, beginner-friedly, and hard on long term, it would also help making KSP more educational, open a wide new array of torment possibilities, and add more stuffs to space stations, bases, and inteplanetary ships, making them more homey. \n\n* * *\n\nI promised to write the suggestions of others here, but I kinda abandoed this thread, sorry.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-24T16:35:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2015 04:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTurbomuffin**"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T18:42:19Z","Content":"I think that best case, we have just \u0022snacks\u0022.

Mod it if you want it more complex.\n\nI do agree that life support should make it into the stock game however.\n\nEDIT: Also necessary I think, would be a background system that comes into play when you are time warping for long periods. If you have a base on the mun, and you warp for years, stop the warp and give a pop up warning when any craft in local Kerbin system is 1 month from running out of snacks. Give a notice when a craft in the Eve or Duna Systems is 8 months from starving. Give longer notices for more distant systems so you can either return them safely, or send a snack resupply mission.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T18:47:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r4pt0r**"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T19:21:18Z","Content":"I think the USI Life Support is very well suited for stock."},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T19:29:15Z","Content":"I\u0027d be happy with oxygen, water, and food, drained at different rates and available by different means, as resources. Overdoing it with stock resources would make the already steep learning curve maybe a little too steep for a new player.\n\nHowever, they will have to have just enough complexity to be interesting. Simply having water recyclers on board your ship adds nothing to the experience except added mass to any long term mission. Fun factor there is not especially high. On the other hand, having something inherently useful about, say, Duna\u0027s poles or Laythe\u0027s atmosphere, requires that access to large quantities of water or oxygen carry specific advantages beyond what you could obtain by merely reusing them.\n\nPossibly this could be accomplished with the simple non-reusability of food/snacks. If it\u0027s possible to manufacture food in situ with access to power/sun, water, and oxygen, and simply have the food production facilities be inefficient enough that you\u0027d either need extremely huge and heavy oxygen/water recyclers or access to a natural resource, this might make \u0022colonization\u0022 efforts more fun.\n\nBut a system even that complex, just the three resources, would probably be something like 50 new parts, especially if you wanted to do fun things like use electric powered sun lamps which can be turned off if you have enough sun for your food rather than just make a nondescript production cylinder that consumes power. This also means that making a really sweet station like many enjoy doing will raise already high part counts, so let\u0027s hope the game engine gets some big improvements in the meantime."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T19:39:29Z","Content":"Waste is fine, assuming it has value as a resource later (possibly for greenhouses, etc) USILS is pretty decent, though I would prefer to see supplies added to certain parts, and I think that kerbal well-being/morale should require a dedicated \u0022habitat\u0022 part for trips over a certain length.\n\nThere is no point at all in the multiple consumables of TAC, IMHO. No matter how many you make, you can always distill it down to X kg of consumables per Y time frame used. It is incredibly cluttered to track all the different LS consumables, and functionally pointless.

A greenhouse part could be added and when a part of the ship it would produce infinite amount of food for, let\u0027s say, 4 crew members, but would need crazy amounts of electricity non-stop.\n\nTo sum this up:\n\n-Kerbals need food\u002Belectricity to stay alive\n\n-A green house can produce infinite amounft of food for X kerbals, but also needs a lot of electricity.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T15:55:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 03:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T13:09:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E To sum this up:\n\u003E \n\u003E -Kerbals need food\u002Belectricity to stay alive\n\u003E \n\u003E -A green house can produce infinite amounft of food for X kerbals, but also needs a lot of electricity.\n\nThats perfect, but I would still advise some way to warn players so they don\u0027t timewarp and accidentally kill LKO stations, or munar bases, ect, that might not have the greenhouse bit."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T13:37:39Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to have to regulate internal heat of cockpits/pods because 1600K sounds a bit toasty even for a kerbal."}]}
