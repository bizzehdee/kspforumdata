Basically the challenge was something like this: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;We are determining the team\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s capability to land on the mun. Do that and we will send you a stupid t-shirt.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/sZ6FS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/sZ6FS\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;HERE\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; are some images from my mission: \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;As you can see, i decided to take the challenge a bit further and see how small a vessel i could make it with. I think my concept is sound enough, but when i finally landed it on the mun i realized i didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have enough fuel to make it back. So here is a challenge to you: Can you make it back to Kerbin and land on the runway again? (The whole point of my vessel is to not drop any fuel tanks during the mission.)\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Part 2:\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; I needed a incremental power slider for a part of the new administration facility gui. The framework (EzGUI) we use for this can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t handle that so i had to come up with a nifty trick to make that work. Basically the existing implementation can only move the slider up and down or left to right, but it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t tick along certain increments. Adding a callback on \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CValueChanged\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 for the slider won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work either because a ticking slider obviously doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t change it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s value until the next tick, so it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a bit of a chicken and egg problem. So i created two sliders on top of each other, the top one being transparent but with triggering colliders. The invisible slider is actually moving with 0 increments, and whenever it gets in \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Chalf range\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to the next increment, it sends and update to the bottom slider to have the knob move to the next increment. When the slider is dropped both sliders snaps into place on the given increment so the colliders are aligned and ready for the next move.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Miguel (Maxmaps):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Organizing stuff for adding new sounds and overall effects to the game. Looking great so far. Also, our art team is currently sequestered in what is the largest 3D asset endeavor that we have overtaken so far. So much so you won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t see it in .25, so forgive them if they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not really sharing a lot of info on the matter. We are talking dozens of high quality models that must be made. Oh, I also wrapped up a deal with \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Porkjet\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; to add a modified version of \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Spaceplane Plus\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; to the base game.

Now, I\u2019d planned to have it ready for you today, but it\u2019s still undergoing edits and approvals so while it\u2019s not here yet, expect it soon. We\u2019ll get some decent mileage with a much more focus stream of thoughts from the community. Otherwise, I\u2019ve still been spending a lot of time on the KSP-TV front.
