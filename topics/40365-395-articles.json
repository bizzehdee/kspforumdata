In fact, it\u0027s basically the same concept as a concentrating solar power plant- only the thermal energy is used to power a thermal rocket (already in KSP Interstellar, and already a real life technology that was demonstrated with nuclear thermal rockets) instead of to generate electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rosenkranz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rosenkranz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe solar one is airship based and I aggree with them that airships and supersonic speeds won\u0027t mesh well.

The added weight of the duct work would outweigh the benefits. You can try this yourself. Copy a stock engine. Add the appropriate weight to account for the duct work. Add intake air to the engines requirements (liquid fuel should be .9, oxidizer is 1.1. Start with intake air at 4 or so). Slap an intake on it and see how it goes. I\u0027m not sure the isp should change though. However, the fuel consumption would go down by virtue of the fact that intake air may take up to half of the total ratio. This would (should?) double your fuel economy by itself.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou *do* realize that jet engines require a bunch of ducting as well, and we still use them.

What this does is; Only certain objects should even be affected by the microwaves in question.
