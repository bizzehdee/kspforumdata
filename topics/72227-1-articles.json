I am creating this thread to see what you guys think the future will be like. By the future I mean the relatively near future, nothing much further than the next 50 or so years. (Does that still count as near future? To me it seems like a fraction of a blink of an eye, but alas, I am an astronomer, and also a dreamer)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI admit, I\u0027m making this because I\u0027ve been reading to many articles/papers predicting a breakdown of our civilisation within 50 years. (Also, a lot of them are by NASA, its almost like they are trying to convince us to buy into spaceflight or something:sticktongue:)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Anyways...

Yet nobody ever predicted the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I would suggest that in the next 20 or 30 years, the trend will go towards more virtualization and dematerialization. Both oil prices and technology will make physical travel obsolete. We would no longer need to physically go anywhere because we will be able to work and visit everything and everyone in the cloud. All this space malarkey will become obsolete because if we wanted to muck around in microgravity or go visit Saturn or Europa, we could just don our VR goggles (or plug our implants into the cloud) and go there by telepresence. There would be no point in sending humans to the Moon or anywhere else, because it will all be mapped in hi-resolution 3D and simulated in a computer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T08:21:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI admit, I\u0027m making this because I\u0027ve been reading to many articles/papers predicting a breakdown of our civilisation within 50 years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople have been predicting the end of the world for a loooooong time.

Space travel would still be astronomically expensive, but VASMIR tugs lower the time and cost tremendously. On the Moon, the Chinese, Europeans, Russians, and several American companies (SpaceX, Bigelow, Golden Spikee, Moon Express with NASA partnership) have established bases on the Moon from the year 2030 onwards.

I was largely basing my conclusions on two things. One was the shortage of helium, and the shortage of phosphorus. Helium being used in liquid form to cool all manner of technology, and phosphorus being used to make fertiliser. Easily accessible and dense phosphorus may run out in the 30\u0027s, where we will have to produce more food, with less land, without the benefit of modern fertiliser. Admittedly, with better distribution of resources this problem may be reduced. But, withstanding significant advances in space flight, or the discovery of vast new deposits of resources, I feel **** is about to get real.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then again, these problems have been predicted, and wether they would have come to pass or not, there will be those who work to avert such things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I\u0027m trying to finish this off but I have more to say.

And yes, it means we\u0027ll have cyborgs.

Think of the small print shop that sells custom tshirt, or that laptop you ordered built to your specs, well the trend is going to continue, with a lot of tiny companies filling niches and taking orders for custom made stuff. You also have large impact on companies, because they will have the option to use a 3D printer rather than have a massive stock of spare parts.
