The burn times are based on the engines last recorded performance and as long as your ship doesn\u0027t change the burn time will be accurate. There are several things that could change or distort the original estimate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use staging or otherwise detach parts of the spacecraft during a burn then the mass of the ship changes and the burn time won\u0027t match the estimate which was based on the original mass plus the fuel that would be burned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you add or remove engines during the burn (for example half of your engines have less fuel and will flame out) then it changes how quickly the ship can accelerate which again invalidates the original estimate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also throw off the estimate if the starting information is not correct. If you where previously burning the engine at half throttle, or you staged after ending your last burn, then the information about how much thrust and isp your ship has will be not be correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose figures can also be thrown off by a ship design that flexes while under burn. You might wonder why the game doesn\u0027t simply take the engines thrust stat directly and use it - that\u0027s because the textbook thrust of the engine is not always what you\u0027ll get in a given design. For example if you angle your engines slightly outward then not all of the thrust is being directed in the direction you want to go and so the real thrust is lower. The same happens if your ship flexes or twists while under thrust, the engines won\u0027t be perfectly aligned and the true thrust contributing to the maneuver can be variable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause you said the burn times are \u0027completely wrong\u0027 rather then just off by a small amount, and because you say this is happening when you are burning for a landing I suspect that you have decoupled some engines or fuel tanks that you used to get into orbit but have not fired your engines since. This means the games information about your engines is out of date - it has no way of knowing correctly predicting the performance of your \u0027new\u0027 ship until you fire the engines with the new load and structural design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T02:47:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022robopilot99\u0022 data-cite=\u0022robopilot99\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen I create a new maneuver node the estimated burn times are always completely wrong.

I\u0027m using the Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X and the burn time estimates are always completely wrong. This is because cutting the throttle isn\u0027t done with a keypress, it\u0027s done by rapidly moving the joystick throttle back to the off position. Technically, since it\u0027s analog, it reduces the thrust from 100% to 99% to 98% ... to 1% to 0%, and this somehow confuses the heck out of KSP\u0027s estimation calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-17T02:57:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat must be exactly what it is thanks for the tip\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
