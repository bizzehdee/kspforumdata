Now this may be a mindset thing here, My enjoyment with Kerbal is experimenting with designs and performing tricky maneuvers. In short to me its about the journey not the arrival, but its only the arrival you get a reward for. There is no reward for complex flight planning and test flying. Surely this should be the very basis of science for a space career. I recently performed a probe mission to Duna. I launched from Kerbin, did a sling shot maneuver around mun then a partial aerobraking into Duna orbit. I landed and with 4 experiments (- the transmission cost) I netted about 75-100 science. To me this should have been multiplied by the number of SOI changes in the journey. Think of the scientific impact of the early mars landers this was no trivial achievement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a better system would run on 2 levels. Firstly the science level similar to what we have now but with some tweaks and additions. The second level would be efficiency of parts. To start with you would have a basic engine, a basic fuel tank, some basic fins and a gyro stabilizer (think V2). All of their efficiency would be around 50% this would mean they would develop 50% of their maximum power. Every time you use something you a). Get a trickle of science (1 per 10 km traveled or something) distance per point would increase over time, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E. the efficiency would go up by a random amount which is maxed at say 1/3rd of the gap between current levels and maximum (so you can never actually achieve 100% efficiency). Each time you unlock a new set of parts their efficiency is at 50%. This would change the onus to encourage test flights and unmanned flights to improve your capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-15T03:02:23Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2014 03:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TJ_Tas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThomasNY","CreatedById":103519,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T01:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would make things interesting. For example you run a mission with a proven design and something goes tits up, so you might have an Apollo situation. That way you would have to plan out possible failures and incorporate redundancies into designs. Maybe to make it so that it is easier for newer players it would be a good idea to make the failures optional, that way they don\u0027t get frustrated too much.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-15T01:50:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2014 01:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ThomasNY\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T01:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eas far as reliability of parts goes, you better edit your post before it gets rage and the concept here gets ignored....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, it would be neat to have a boost in gain for when you achieve a first.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you shall simply have to wait until v0.24 and see what contracts bring us..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echeers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T01:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds pretty grindy, tbh.
