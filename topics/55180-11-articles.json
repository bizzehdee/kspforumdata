At first, I saw the large wheels and thought it unnecessarily bulky, especially for not carrying any science equipment. Count in the fairly large skycrane, and it starts to become very big and ungainly. But then I watched the video. That\u0027s when everything changed. Seeing that rover being able to cover immense distances and survive the extreme bumps and dings that would have meant game over for any other rover, I instantly changed my mind. Your entry went from one I wasn\u0027t even considering, to first-place tie with another great entry. I then thought \u0022Who sends out a rover to do science anyway? Humans, that\u0027s who, and we don\u0027t like them.\u0022 At which point, I completely disregarded your lack of any science equipment on the rover and took it for what it is: An extremely rugged and durable rover able to cross any obstacle it comes across. I figure this is one of the best rovers for noobs, because what does every new player do the first time they go roving? They flip it. They get it stuck or get bored because it\u0027s so slow. You\u0027ve made a tedious process such as driving a rover into an enjoyable psuedo-flight experience. Not to mention the excellent amount of character you sold it under. You also included an objective comparison sheet to all the other entries for judgement, it\u0027s not pretentious, it\u0027s not excessive, it\u0027s fun in every sense of the word. I like to think of this one like a Tonka toy. It\u0027s tough, takes a bit of abuse, and it\u0027s fun for everyone.

I suppose I did put a lot of effort into the presentation of my design. Now that I think about it, I should have put some more effort into the rover itself (it was pretty flippy!). I agree with your comments about science equipment. Well said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rover has wheels, but I\u0027d say it\u0027s main feature is the ability to fly with RCS.

Since you used RTGs, you could power all the wheels and lights non-stop. And even on gravity as high as Eve, you can flip your rover over with the powerful reaction wheel included. Although at first I was skeptical of your use of the medium wheels rather than the rugged ones, I soon discovered that their lower traction ensures the rover doesn\u0027t flip as easily during turns. Great job! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E I also voted for you on the final vote.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EXeldrak:\u003C/strong\u003E I love the CRAATRV because it has a wide wheel base and is probably the most stable rover in the whole competition. Although it\u0027s not possible to right the CRAATRV if it flips over on Kerbin (although on Duna you can), it\u0027s basically guaranteed not to flip over unless you drive it off a cliff, in which case no rover could possibly survive anyway. I also like the semi-low part count. Good job Xeldrak!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAntbin:\u003C/strong\u003E The One-Way Ticket is a very stylish-looking and sturdy rover. I like the roll-cage that you spent a long time perfecting. Although 70 parts is a bit on the high side (for a stock craft in my opinion), I like the fact that it includes RCS. Great rover, antbin!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERavenchant:\u003C/strong\u003E Others have mentioned how nicely your entry demonstrates the use of the LV-R1 engine. I must agree. Your rover is a very nice expansion of the stock one, in my opinion. The stock skycrane has an extremely high thrust-to-weight ratio, making it nearly impossible to decouple the rover safely while hovering, but yours is much easier to control due to a lower thrust-to-weight ratio. And of course, the use of the tiny probe wheels means your rover is stable, just like the stock one - albeit not able to right itself if it falls over. Congratulations!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERhomphaia:\u003C/strong\u003E I like the Dunakhod SDS because it has low part count, pretty good stability, and is crammed with science equipment. It also has a wonderful array of spotlights. Unfortunately, it can\u0027t right itself on Kerbin if it flips over. Even though the skycrane has very low torque, the high gimbal of the radial engines makes it easy to control during descent.
