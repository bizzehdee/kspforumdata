I struggle to build a plane that just gets off the ground without crashing, building one to bring a craft back to the KSC is way out of my capabilities. And my precision landings...well not really there yet, especially through atmosphere. What I expect once there is currency in career mode is recovery to get more expensive/less usefull/etc. the further the craft landed from the KSC, as a soft incentive to improve your landings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
