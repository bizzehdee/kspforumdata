This part doesn\u0027t have to be fancy (and it will never fly), it\u0027s just a few structural components and docking ports that line up with the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you save this part to a subassembly, you can then mount it to your other craft, and it will show you exactly where to put your ports on that other craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI, it\u0027s really hard to get these things perfectly.

Yours was a matter of them not being constructed in the right sequence in the VAB/SPH - if they are attached to their parent craft properly in the first place then they will work in practice and make for stronger connections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the problem in hand - that they don\u0027t align properly anyway - there\u0027s nothing that can be done in flight. NoClass\u0027s advice to use a template-piece is about the best. Otherwise built subsidiary craft on the original in the VAB/SPH then save them as sub-assemblies. For the immediate issue I\u0027d suggest that taking two landers using one docking port each may work. If you connect just one then you may get balance issues but if it works then that will be lighter. If none of those options is viable then it\u0027s time to scrub the mission and de-orbit those ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T08:37:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you want to fight wobble, you need at least three connections. Two ports will still allow the attached piece to flap like a door on its hinge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking ports make for a rather strong connection in terms of force needed to pull them apart. But they have about as much wiggle room as the upper lip of a docking port is thick. The small ports, giving and taking one inch at either side, can easily bend by ten degrees. The large ones bend much less simply by virtue of having a wider ring. If you want to reduce wobble even more, you don\u0027t need many connections, but you want to space them as far apart as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, keep in mind that you have to unbutton all ports if you ever want to un-dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
