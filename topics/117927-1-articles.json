Yea maybe it could have been more efficient money wise but I was able to take it in from Jool to Kerbin with 2 Kerbin aerobrakes (the first one took a lot of quick saves to get altitude just right) at 100% re-entry difficulty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I\u0027m coming down this happens (the inner craft comes outside the cargo bay through the wall, a lot. It got more drastic after my picture) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/qy3e0n6zo7uaof5/2015-08-06_00007.jpg?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/qy3e0n6zo7uaof5/2015-08-06_00007.jpg?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone made a thread about \u0022magical\u0022 cargo bays that I guess freeze things in place in them? That would be great, but im fine with things moving in the cargo bays, just not them coming through the walls. Also note that if you disconnect yourself from an object that is in your cargo bay and time accelerate, the object will travel outside your ship like the bay is not there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe return took a few quick save reloads to get it down, and surprisingly it did not tear my ship apart like I was expecting; it just flailed around violently and made me annoyed and very worried. I think this maybe due to Claws stock bug fixes I have installed; they fixed my Glue Kraken issue (Claw\u0027s my hero), and maybe stopped the ship from being torn apart? Aside from that its an all stock game from Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was brought on when the ship got lower in the atmosphere, not when it was going 4.4km per second through 70-38km atmosphere range. The weight of the ship is \u003Cem\u003Eslightly\u003C/em\u003E towards the rear and I bring it down from front-forward because you need a heat shield, and that made it go side to side a little, but the ship was controlling it well; until the lander in the cargo bay flings out from the inside and screws everything up. Did it ruin my $400k mission? No. Did it destroy my ship or corrupt my save? No, and I\u0027m happy about that. Was it extremely unrealistic and an unsatisfying end to the mission? Yes, but I got 2.2k science out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be really great and realistic to have the parts inside the cargo bays stay put and actually contain things, or better yet let Engineer Kerbals make temporary struts in space to secure objects (and not just those inside cargo bays). Please note my craft is connected inside the cargo bay via a docking port. A Sr. docking port may help it, but it would look weird and im good on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing: is it weird that during Kerbin re-entry while coming in straight that there are not really flames on the right side of my ship? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/hag781o8g7uzj6g/2015-08-06_00004.jpg?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/hag781o8g7uzj6g/2015-08-06_00004.jpg?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E I mean if im coming in sideways yea, but im going straight in..
