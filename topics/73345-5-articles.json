It\u0027s helps us to remember that there have always been people against change. For some it\u0027s just too scary. They want to just keep things the same. Perhaps they are the descendants of those who argued that the earth was flat, that we didn\u0027t need cars because horses worked just fine, told the Wright Brothers they were out of their minds, or insisted that we\u0027d never reach the moon. Or perhaps they are the voices of larger entities who are now feeling threatened by the paradigm shift that is Solar Roadways.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know what?

Over short distances and low current DC would be fine. If we really did have a shedload of DC microgeneration down at local level in the grid it would be worth looking at.

Classic suggestion from an engineer looking at things from a purely efficiency-based optimisation perspective and missing the big picture.
