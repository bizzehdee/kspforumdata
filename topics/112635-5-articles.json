For now, in beta, the hulls should all be rated to a crash tolerance of 70. Once you\u0027re above 70 m/s, you\u0027re on borrowed time, and that\u0027s pretty much in line with stock parts. Now, I have had a yacht break 100m/s and cruise along just fine with no parts flying off at the same crash tolerances as the release. So they are capable of faster speeds. I do need to review everything though. I\u0027ll consider it, but keep this in mind (yea I know it\u0027s a game)... 1 m/s ~ 1.9 knots... Meaning, that little CVE I\u0027ve been testing does over 140 knots... which is unheard of IRL. Most CVA\u0027s do 35ish and they\u0027re considered fast. I also know that you don\u0027t want to spend a week driving your boat to the other side of the planet. I\u0027m trying to find a balance between realistic speeds for a boat and the impatience of humans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am hoping eventually to have more hull designs. Wider ones for cargo and... those designed specifically for speed. The Clipper that\u0027s in the pack now will be a medium-fast hull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the outriggers, I tossed those in at the last minute, they haven\u0027t been fully tested yet. I\u0027ll keep this in mind tho and see if others have speed related issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and as for gimbals... They did have in the alpha but... I had to make a choice. It seems that the spinning propellers you now see are incompatible with gimballed engines. I didn\u0027t try it to be certain, but that\u0027s how I read it in the Firespitter info (which is what allows them to spin).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T03:08:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 03:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T14:48:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA while back, when I was screwing around with the not-boat thing, I noticed that boats actually make for decent parachutes, on Eve at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of a whole bunch of debris which I noticed that had been falling slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://smg.photobucket.com/user/smjjames/media/screenshot104_zpscstojyt7.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v214/smjjames/screenshot104_zpscstojyt7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot104_zpscstojyt7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuh?

It\u0027s not the outriggers, it\u0027s the blisters. They\u0027re too close to your centerline. They lift the ship straight up and then the outriggers have to try to keep it level. Put your blisters on the corners, where the sides meet the bottom of the boat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the Outriggers are mostly designed, for now, to aid heavy boats with stability.
