Sometimes this reaction is so strong that it\u0027ll not only stop you from rolling in the direction you want to, but you\u0027ll actually struggle to stop yourself from rolling perpetually in the opposite direction instead! It\u0027s as if the planes roll controls actually make worse the problem they\u0027re supposed to fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s definitely to do with the control surfaces. I only managed to get some stable flight by restricting the control surfaces so each set only controls one axis - e.g. the rudder for yaw, wings for pitch, fins for roll. If you enable roll controls on the wings\u0027 control surfaces, the problem gets massively, massively worse. Not only will there be a sort of bounce in the opposite of the direction you\u0027re trying to roll in, but you\u0027ll not be able to roll at all - e.g. hold down E, for a moment nothing will happen, and then you\u0027ll just slowly start spinning in the opposite direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem\u0027s so severe, that if you\u0027re in stable flight with SAS enabled, and click to enable roll control on the wings, you\u0027ll very quickly find yourself spiralling uncontrollably, and the only way to bring it under control is actually to disable all roll control altogether. It\u0027s as if the plane design is naturally stabilising, but actually the roll controls are somehow dangerously counter-productive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should say, I\u0027m not using any aerodynamic mods like FAR, but the wings and wing control surfaces are from B9 Procedural Parts, the fuel tank is from Procedural Parts, and the cockpit, air intake and engine are from SXT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Additional information - the plane is perfectly symmetrical, the centre of mass (dry and wet) is just behind the cockpit, and the centre of lift just slightly behind that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Huh.
