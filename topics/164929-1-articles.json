There were several technical challenges to be overcome. Today we are unveiling the prototype for review. This version is a test-bed for new technologies and will be worked on to increase speed, range and include armaments. It has a top speed currently of 60.5ms in level flight (don\u0027t be fooled by the navball, the wings are pitched so even though the nose is slightly down, the wings are level and maintaining altitude). It is as efficient as could be built although it is currently under-powered for military purposes. It uses two twin Juno KAe Mercator engines in a push/pull configuration. It is envisaged the production version will be equipped with the tri Juno Brigand engine. A lot of effort was put into making this aircraft AI controllable for the Stock Turboprop DogFight challenge, so it could not be finicky, or need special tricks to fly. As such it is remarkable easy to fly for a pilot, just stage (space), engage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E (t),\u00A0and full throttle (z). Pull up at about 40ms and it should lift smoothly off the tarmac, you don\u0027t even have to worry about tail prop strike. Landing is as straightforward as any other aircraft, though landing pitch of more than 10\u0027 may cause damage. Stall speed is below 30ms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMustang Prototype - Top Speed\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EVIFFCE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EVIFFCE.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can eke slightly more speed out of it by deploying the rear blades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMustang Prototype Development\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther ipsEmbeddedOther_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=http://imgur.com/a/Wqft9\u0022 style=\u0022height:467px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-29T10:05:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2017 10:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by selfish_meme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-30T08:09:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust made my first attack run, not much luck with the AI pilot yet, but that\u0027s because I was never great with it, need more practice\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022x3UOppX.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x3UOppX.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-30T08:14:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2017 08:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by selfish_meme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
