For staging it doesn\u0027t matter whether its IVA view or the craft view. For the final minute or so of the Mun landing all you need is the radar altimeter from IVA and you\u0027re done. Map view in fact is usually how I perform 99% of the time of my missions so there\u0027s no major change (for me at least).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission parameters require the Mk 1 pod which has a window that is useless for landing (its not a lander capsule). But that means you have no way of knowing if your landing site is suitably flat or not until you do or do not tip over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two points make the whole mission boil down to pure chance whether you hit a flat spot or not: Getting there in map view is trivial, landing safely is pure chance.

Alternatively one could go to Minmus since the flats guarantee not toppling over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Allowed map view \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E when engines are off which essentially restricts it to the times where you\u0027ve left Kerbins atmosphere to set up the circularization, waiting for the transfer burn etc. It also means you need a watch or something since you can\u0027t see the remaining burn time from inside the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thought I point that out because I genuinely believe its a cool challenge idea but it suffers a bit from the details.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-15T16:21:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2014 04:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MrOnak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fenderzilla","CreatedById":70047,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T19:03:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToo bad there are no mods.
