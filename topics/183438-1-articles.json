However I noticed something really odd going on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am orbiting Kerbin, and I got my manuever node set for an encounter with eve. I start my burn, and then switch to the tracking mode solar system view. As my apoapsis is increasing I get Mun encounters along the way (which happens), but\u00A0then all of sudden\u00A0with about 30 seconds of burn to go my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E system just starts to wig out and my ship just starts spinning and does not know where to go, and then that\u0027s the end of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI noticed I start the burn and just stay in the 3rd person camera view and just burn until the clock says stop, it does not wig anymore.
