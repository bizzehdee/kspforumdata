When you said that I realized that that part is probably the only command pod in KSP that has aircraft landing on it\u0027s roof.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Yep, you were in the ballpark. Essentially, the rudder will be a canard on steroids. You theoretically could mount it on an aircraft but one touch of the controls would probably send you flipping.\n\u003E \u003E The best way I found to steer my ships is two small control surfaces on the stern above the propeller and waterline. For heavier/bigger ships I put the control surfaces front and rear. I also add RCS ports and tanks or Vernier Engines with fuel/oxy tanks hidden somewhere. You\u0027ll see it in my video.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Boy, I\u0027m still debating the whole bow thruster thing and a good way to implement it. Many \u0027real\u0027 ones are built into the bow. Some are bolt on an some are mechanically recessed and only extend when needed. It seems for now you guys have turning worked out with RCS but I\u0027d like to come up with a good nautical alternative. I\u0027ll keep thinking. One thing I need to do is reduce the electrical charge the cargo bridge uses for the reaction wheels. Even with solar panels on the roof, it eats batteries like a flashlight.\n\u003E \n\u003E And thanks for the feedback guys. Since most of my time now is spent making and testing parts, I\u0027m not getting a lot of time to abuse them before I\u0027m off to the next project.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T01:47:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 01:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"greydragon70","CreatedById":101186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T02:01:26Z","Content":"\u0022I think, you have found the ultimate use for a torodial fuel tank... a life preserver. And I had to laugh, a 3 wide carrier. You guys are putting these parts to the test. I never would have come up with some of these designs. Nice video.\n\nAs for the CVE bridge... fixed in the next release. You were very correct, I had it\u0027s crash tolerance set to what a command pod should be, not a flight deck. When you said that I realized that that part is probably the only command pod in KSP that has aircraft landing on it\u0027s roof.\u0022\n\nSadly the toroidal tanks won\u0027t stick to the side so they are mounted on oscar-b tanks. That was actually the first time I\u0027ve used toroidal tanks effectively.\n\nAs far as the 3 wide hull, I needed more room so I added two hulls catamaran style with octagonal struts then slid them towards the center to get the flat top look. I used a fair amount of struts in discrete places and it was still kinda wobbly in the water.\n\nAlso when using a double or triple hull I can set the thrusters on action groups to steer like many ships do. One side forward the other side reverse. But the small control surfaces work very well.\n\nThanks, that video was done 3 times before it was finished. I just wish I had known you updated with the ro-ro and rudder. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T02:59:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 02:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by greydragon70**"}]}
