I\u0027m also very excited to hear that Scott will be directing, but equally disappointed to hear about Damon. He\u0027s a good actor when playing his strengths, but I don\u0027t see cocky and cynical astronaut being one of them.\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, one of the best examples of how a poorly-selected lead actor can ruin what otherwise would have been an amazing film is another Scott work, Kingdom of Heaven. Everything about that film was amazing, from the music to the cinematography to the support actors--really world-class, once-in-a-generation epic material. But then Orlando Bloom would open his mouth and suddenly each scene became impossible to take seriously. His \u0022right before the big battle\u0022 pep speech in particular goes down as one of the most truely painful dialogues in quality AAA film-making.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you couldn\u0027t tell, I\u0027m really worried that the same thing is going to happen here. Take a talented guy like Sean Patrick Flanery with his wise-guy persona and let him flourish under Scott\u0027s direction. I\u0027ll still see the film, but between the above and the quality of Damon\u0027s contributions to Interstellar, I\u0027m going to try very hard not to let my excitement drive my expectations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just saw that someone had suggested Fillion on the older thread.

I think he will do a great job, but I don\u0027t think their will be anything particularly special about it. They missed an opportunity to pick people who are out of the box. I think it would have been a great opportunity to take Robert Downey Jr. off the avengers train for a little while. That not out of the box I know. They could have done good with an unknown or a new up and comer. A comedic actor who is good at drama might have been a good choice. Karl Urban is the every man type guy. Like I said I don\u0027t think Matt Damon is gonna be bad as Watney.
