I\u0027m also very excited to hear that Scott will be directing, but equally disappointed to hear about Damon. He\u0027s a good actor when playing his strengths, but I don\u0027t see cocky and cynical astronaut being one of them.\n\u003E In fact, one of the best examples of how a poorly-selected lead actor can ruin what otherwise would have been an amazing film is another Scott work, Kingdom of Heaven. Everything about that film was amazing, from the music to the cinematography to the support actors--really world-class, once-in-a-generation epic material. But then Orlando Bloom would open his mouth and suddenly each scene became impossible to take seriously. His \u0022right before the big battle\u0022 pep speech in particular goes down as one of the most truely painful dialogues in quality AAA film-making.\n\u003E \n\u003E In case you couldn\u0027t tell, I\u0027m really worried that the same thing is going to happen here. Take a talented guy like Sean Patrick Flanery with his wise-guy persona and let him flourish under Scott\u0027s direction. I\u0027ll still see the film, but between the above and the quality of Damon\u0027s contributions to Interstellar, I\u0027m going to try very hard not to let my excitement drive my expectations.\n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT: Just saw that someone had suggested Fillion on the older thread. I\u0027d see that!\n\nNathan Fillion would be a great choice! I think Matt Damon is the safe choice. I think he will do a great job, but I don\u0027t think their will be anything particularly special about it. They missed an opportunity to pick people who are out of the box. I think it would have been a great opportunity to take Robert Downey Jr. off the avengers train for a little while. That not out of the box I know. They could have done good with an unknown or a new up and comer. A comedic actor who is good at drama might have been a good choice. Karl Urban is the every man type guy. Like I said I don\u0027t think Matt Damon is gonna be bad as Watney. I just don\u0027t think he is gonna bring anything special to the part."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T00:12:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This can be done in stock! the ring wont rotate without infernal robotics but this CAN be made in stock, I\u0027m just too lazy to do it.\n\nWhy on Earth in Milkyway are people insisting that these rings need to turn?

It was mentioned in the book a few times. I guess they learned from Interstellar, although its realistic, it can be nauseating for the audience. \n\nHowever the more I look at the picture the more I think that whole thing might not be the ship. I said before it looks like the harvested the ISS. They might have just done that but instead just made it a refueling station for the Hermes. I mean that ship just looks too large! Am I wrong? Its beautiful don\u0027t get me wrong. But it still looks too big. The more I look at it, it looks like it just might be docked with the refueling station. Could you imagine the maneuvering scenes at the end of the book with that thing? It would probably look cool but unlikely. \n\nAnyone else think that the Hermes is just docked? Although I see engines all the way at the end? But I also see something docking with the ship in the background.
