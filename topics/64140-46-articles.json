However, I keep running into a problem where my designs tend to generate more heat than the default 1100 limit in RSS. As a result, my designs tend to melt and die when crossing the Mach 4-6 border. I know that there are other materials which can be used that have better thermal limits. These are in NASA\u0027s EngineSIM and I think they get denser and more expensive as they go. Off the top of my head, titanium has a thermal limit at 2500, Stainless Steel at 3300 and active cooling (like the Reactive Engines pre-cooler) at 4200. Anyway, I was wondering if it would be possible to include a right click menu parameter, which would change the material and hence the heat, weight and cost properties much like you can do with tank types?

I took the little Flags from FASA and made one scalable this way. So i am able to scale the little Flag any size i like. But what I asked is, if it might be possible to have some kind of Texture-Switch like in the original Procedural Parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere you have some Textures to choose. I made two own Textures there (one Russian like the Soyuz from BobCat an one like FusTek. It looks quite well). I thought it might be possible to have some kind of selection.

So you want the ability to use a variety of different flags (gathered from a small set of textures) on the same vessel, as well as having the flags freely scale-able. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, there\u0027s not really any mods around that can do that, and the way Procedural Parts is designed, it\u0027s most likely not going to happen for quite a while if ever. If you have any experience in coding, you could look into how Procedural Parts uses textures and try to copy that. Or, if you have skills in the 3d modelling area, you could build a part for each flag texture you would like, and then import that into the game, and then add tweakscale to it. There\u0027s several great resources on the forum for both of these things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, if different flags are that important to you, you can always split your ships into several launches,choose a different mission flag for each one, then dock them all in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry I couldn\u0027t be of more help.
