It was firstly observed using flags on the HQ buildings and such, then observed the same behavior with Debris (Launch Clamps at Launchpad.) My assumption is that, without the IFFtag installed on a \u0022craft\u0022 such as debris and flags, such objects will \u0022save\u0022 along with the active vessel, then \u0022load\u0022 in the same orientations as if they were parts of the active vessel in flight. (I\u0027m kind of aware this is almost repeating what I said before, but now I\u0027m pretty sure the IFFtags are what cause the issue, since anything with the tag won\u0027t be affected.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing the fix would have to incorporate some sort of check between the craft files part count and the \u0022saved\u0022 craft part count, so that when a craft state is saved, the crafts themselves won\u0027t \u0022add\u0022 new pieces to the craft. Either that or simply reduce the \u0022save\u0022 radius to something like 1Km around the IFFtags, but use a system similar to Romfarer\u0027s Lazor mod to extend the loading of crafts within a scene, so that crafts outside of the 1KM radius would load up their own IFFtags. Again, suggestion without complete understanding, but suggestions nevertheless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: More to add to the report, this time a different issue regarding ordinance launching into orbit. From what I can tell, once the rockets reach beyond the atmosphere, they lose all their launch capabilities and seem to be \u0022weightless\u0022 and fail to physically fall back to Kerbin once they are released. I have no idea why this is occurring; I did quicksave before re-entry from orbit, which I think is causing a glitch with the fairings I\u0027m using, causing them to \u0022shrink\u0022 near the base. Tested the rockets on the launchpad before launch and they seem to work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: Also probably worth mentioning is that sometimes, at random, when reverting to the SPB/VAB from anything using arms, the game will crash because of a \u0022Write to location 00800000\u0022 causing an error, which usually I hear happens due to RAM issues, but it doesn\u0027t seem to matter even if I\u0027m just testing a rocket out with 3 parts and no other crafts nearby... will need to investigate my RAM usage during the next crash.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-24T23:49:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2014 11:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KolourBlynD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate 2.0\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blitz2190","CreatedById":102654,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T07:42:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EID when repairing a vehical how can you tell if its doing anything, and can i time warp while its repairing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfiniteDice","CreatedById":57451,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T14:44:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blitz2190\u0022 data-cite=\u0022blitz2190\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EID when repairing a vehical how can you tell if its doing anything, and can i time warp while its repairing\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fix message should stay up while it\u0027s working.

I would like to notify you ID that indeed Skillful is causing something weird to be occurring whenever physics seems to be calculated and applied to crafts NOT equipped with IFFtags; after uninstalling the mod my previous rendezvous problem ceases to exist. Also my issues with debris and flags seemingly disappeared along with Skillful as well, so I hope you can address this in a future update, but as it stands it would seem you should probably suggest to those willing to use the mod to only install using a fresh install, and possibly only for saves in Sandbox that will focus on war games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-26T07:04:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2014 07:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KolourBlynD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate 2.0\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfiniteDice","CreatedById":57451,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T13:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tacotown99\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tacotown99\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eum wich config the wepons them selves don\u0027t have a code line for that (ive looked many times)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFire key only fires all active guns on the craft, it\u0027s not for releasing bombs...

As in the target craft suddenly takes on the same orbital as my active vessel? I\u0027m not using the IFFtags on the crafts, does that cause any problems with them \u0022saving\u0022 with Skillful installed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also is there possibly a way to use the weapons without having the entire combat/save system in place? With the current issues I\u0027m having with Skillful, I won\u0027t be able to really do much else apart from war-type missions, as any other launch I do seems to affect the save in ways that I seem to be unable to fix; even quicksaves seem to get corrupted for some odd reason, failing to load randomly. If I chose to do so, what is the correct uninstall procedure for Skillful?
