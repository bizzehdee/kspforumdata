I am now in program for Minimus and as this is the first time I am going there I have sent an unmanned lander which will be later maned this is only to test it. Anyway got there to Minimus and on my way home the lander lost electrical charge completely despite having lots of 1x1 solar panels. It was drained thanks to the SAS but this shouldn\u0027t happen since I had many panels.....Anyway as I got closer to Kerbin (still I had attached lander legs with engine and tank which need to be ejected plus parachutes that cant be deployed, strange that there is no aux.system of deployment) I have noticed that panels are at least to my eyes exposed to the Sun but no charge! So I got a bit sad over a fact that mission will fail and that I will lose all my science collected but then suddenly while my lander was burning through atmosphere the batteries started to charge so I managed to get rid of last stage and activate parachutes. So my question is if I have a probe in space that for some reason loses charge and despite that after losing charge panels gets exposed to Sun they won\u0027t charge or they will start charging even if charge is 0?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T19:42:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried right clicking the panels to see what they say? It\u0027s quite possible you managed to damage them, or they\u0027ve been blocked by some object such as Kerbin or Minmus itself. It might be possible (but very unlikely) for one of the inner planets to block it briefly as well, although I haven\u0027t seen that happen myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe panels should charge your batteries as long as they have a \u003Cem\u003Eclear line of sight\u003C/em\u003E to the Sun, and are pointing in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hallofo","CreatedById":81314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T19:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start, good job on getting a probe to Minimus seaces! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solar panels will charge a ship/battery from 0 - you can completely drain your charge but still get more.

I do not think that there was a flaw in my design since there were at least 8 panels supplying SAS, Science Jr., 2 Goos, and some other small sensors there was no transmission at any time. Only that thing that was ON all the time was SAS on trip towards Minimus and back but on this way to Kerbin for some reason the panels did not charge the battery of 1000 units not even when I came near Kerbin and directly exposed to Sun. Only after I started to burn the panels provided MASSIVE amount of charge and that kind of charge was expected out of those 8 panels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
