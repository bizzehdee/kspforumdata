I then built a gaming rig 2 years ago for the purpose of playing video games and coding. Now I\u0027ll be finishing the last 2 years of university and will need a laptop. If you ask yourself why I didn\u0027t get one sooner as a computer science student is because I was a community college student, where I didn\u0027t require a laptop. Before I proceed with my questions, can the community make a recommended laptops sticky? There was a similar thread I saw, but it would be grade if that list was updated in a certain period of time for the next couple of years and all that people would have to do isread the reviews, choose something within their budget, and purchase the product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways... All I need this laptop for is mainly programming. I mainly program in Java, Python, Android Studio (Java as well, but take into account the emulator), and sometimes I venture off to other programming languages. I am now playing video games in a small portion of my time due to school and work, but I definitely like to play Kerbal Space Program, Terraria, Minecraft, and similar games. These are the only games I expect to sometimes play on a laptop, anything else will probably be done in my gaming rig.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy budget is $850 I am willing to go up to $1,000. Please try not to suggest anything above $1,000. I am trying to save as much money as possible to pay for my university out of pocket, and remember I have a dedicated gaming rig at home. I have some laptops in mind which are: Lenovo Y50, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:verdana;\u0022\u003EDell XPS13, ASUS X55LA-DB71, ASUS N550JK-DS71T\u003C/span\u003E. The press around Lenovo has scared me a bit, even after some redditors reassured me they don\u0027t have the superfish problem on the 2015 models. Again thanks for the great help and if you can elaborate on actual experience with the model you suggest, it would be great. I had some people simply tell me \u0022go buy this model\u0022 and that doesn\u0027t really help me much to understand why I should get it. Also, if you know of a laptop that I should definitely NOT get list that below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:verdana;\u0022\u003ELAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECountry of purchase: USA\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBudget range: 0- $850\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPurpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Mainly web browsing, programming, some gaming.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EScreen size preference: ~15in\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): I will not be gaming much, but when I do it will be things like Kerbal space program, terraria, minecraft.

After a bit of research I was going a bit crazy and decided to settle down on a GE60 Apache Pro this one in specific: MSI GE60 Apache Pro-867 15.6\u0022 i7-4720HQ 16GB 120GB SSD \u002B 1TB 7200rpm HDD NVIDIA GTX 960M 2GB Full HD Windows 8.1 Gaming Laptop Computer \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TUEP0Y8/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_Jh1yvb03GFFTP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TUEP0Y8/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_Jh1yvb03GFFTP\u003C/a\u003E. I got a gift card after selling some books on Amazon and decided to raise my budget a bit more. I think it has more power than I will ever need, but the other laptops I found had one missing feature that I wanted. Macs with a 15 in. screen and 8gb of ram were quite expensive. Normal laptops that met almost all requirements either didn\u0027t have a full 1080p screen, or only had 4gb, or a 5,400 rpm HDD. This MSI seemed to have met all requirements. The only downside is that is relatively new so it doesn\u0027t have many reviews to prove of it\u0027s durability. But like you said they seem to be making decent gaming laptops. Another problem these models seemed to have in the past were overheating gpu\u0027s, but I believe the 960m might take care of that.

The new maxwell nvidia cards run much cooler than the previous generation so overheating shouldn\u0027t be an issue as long as you give the laptop proper ventilation while gaming (i.e. use a laptop cooler or at the very least prop it up).
