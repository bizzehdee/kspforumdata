Both of these didn\u0027t used to be a problem, but since 0.90.0 they have become a major limiting factor in what I can do in KSP. I like complex designs, not necessarily big things, but things with lots of detail and now I can\u0027t build craft that are over 300 parts without the game becoming a slide show (in the past I regularly built things of 400-500 parts and still had reasonable FPS). The stutter issues means I can\u0027t have a complex space program, I\u0027ve had to abandon my current career (40\u002B in flight craft \u0026amp; 40\u002B debris) because with that many in-flight craft the stuttering makes it unplayable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have other frustrations and things I wished the game had, but largely they are minor (certainly not worthy of hate). \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3530-Kat-s-Notes-on-1-0-x\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esee my recent blog post for details\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0027t mind things like OP describes, that\u0027s just part of pre-flight checks.
