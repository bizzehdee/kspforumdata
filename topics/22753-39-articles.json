Now, I know that romfarer worked on the Canadarm, and that\u0027s great and all, but there\u0027s a better way of handling it. Of course, this way is much more difficult for new players, so maybe you\u0027d want to ignore it altogether. On all of the non-Russian modules, including the PMA\u0027s, there is a berthing mechanism on every module, so that the arms can grab and manipulate them. Here are some examples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Alpha_Magnetic_Spectrometer_-_02.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Alpha_Magnetic_Spectrometer_-_02.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Mplm_in_shuttle.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Mplm_in_shuttle.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/STS-124_Kibo.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/STS-124_Kibo.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you see those small circular bits with antenna-like protrusions? Those are the berthing mechanisms for the robotic arms. I think it would be easier on the whole to create those as a \u0022place anywhere\u0022 part as docking nodes, and then the same can be done with the robotic arm heads, allowing for a more stable capture. Of course this would mean a lot of extra work, but building stations isn\u0027t supposed to be easy, and especially not the ISS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, though this may be a bit out of reach, the Canadarm is detachable from both sides, allowing it to be docked with any berthing mechanism on either side. Of course the only way for this to work is by allowing a kerbal to \u0022grab\u0022 the piece and carry it to another position, which I believe is entirely possible(since I\u0027m not a coder, this is just a guess). Being able to detach and move the Canadarm would make running a space station more enjoyable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother suggestion would be to add the Mobile Transport System, though this one is probably more out of reach than the other one. The Mobile Transport system allows the Mobile Base System(with an attachment for the Canadarm) to move across the trusses. Since the trusses are separate pieces this is probably completely out of the question, but I thought I\u0027d bring it up anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last but not least, a special mounting piece for the S0 truss should be made. The S0 truss isn\u0027t mounted on Unity\u0027s Zenith port, but rather on top of the Destiny module and secured via MTS(Module to Truss Structure) struts. It\u0027s not actually \u0022docked\u0022 to the ISS, but docking is the only way to attach these together. Perhaps create the S0 with the struts already on it, and then they attach to an invisible docking node on Destiny\u0027s Zenith.
