It was the afternoon of saturday 16th of May when I drove out of my street and embarked on a nice \u0027grand\u0027 tour. After around 30 minutes the German border was reached. For me, Germany is like the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn in KSP; it is rather close and offers lots of sights. But unlike the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, it luckily doesn\u0027t require a descent rocket to reach. First destionation was Frankfurt am Main, a city in the middle of the country and on of the financial powerhouses of Europe.

After a stop in the Austrian city of Salzburg, the journey went gradually northwest and the next stop was Dachau, a town notorious for the fact that it housed one of the (concentration) camps during WWII in Europe.
