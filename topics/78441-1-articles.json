Generally I want to delete electric charge and replace it with 6 different power lines. (3.3V, 5V, 12V, 36V, AC, and High Voltage ) Actually it\u0060s done (for few parts now, just to see if it\u0060s working) but without gauges showing actual production and consumption it\u0060s like \u0022flying blind\u0022. The idea of this mod is to add built-in (and later external) powers supplies and fuel cells with specified power ( in wats) so it has to be managed all the time to be sure every device is getting enough power etc. without relying on batteries only, and make them just an emergency feature.( to make game a little harder and more realistic \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is I don\u0060t understand a word from C#... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, I saw many tutorials and managed to create a window with a simple text, but how add variable values ? Stock resources tab does not work for me. I need 2 values per line in the window , for ex. :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5V : 120 / 300 Wats\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12V: 45 / 200 Wats \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst line represents the name of the power line, second real-time consumption , and the third line real-time production. In this case, pod is using 120W and generator is giving 300W, so I know I have 180W free, while stock tab shows 0 because there is no change in batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower is just a normal resource like original electric charge, and voltage converters are made using moduleGenerator in cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd how integrate it with a toolbar ? Does it need any special code, or does it work automatically ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted it to be like mechjeb, always visible in the hangar and during flight, and use module name for ex. PowerMod in cfg to enable it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the second part...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to add a CFDC (Central Flight Data Computer \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ) to simulate computers on-board. I wanted it to consume electricity while working, but to save energy for ex. while docked to space station I thought about adding an \u0022on/off\u0022 switch. I would like to override the data coming to GUI to set altimeter and speed meter to 0, and set navball straight up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother nice option I thought about is Fly-by-wire system, when it\u0060s turned off, the ModuleCommand has to be somehow jammed (or sth) just not to react on control buttons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut doing this is complete hardcore and I even don\u0060t know how to start \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help ! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
