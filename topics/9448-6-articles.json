However, the danger then lies in that they may end up spending 9k doing it at tech 0 which in the end is more costly then just upgrading their tech level. It should balance out providing the expected tech levels are properly set up. Additionally, using high tech to accomplish simple missions is trivial and should be penalized. Further to this, the tech level used should be calculated by the craft file, not what the player has purchased, so for example a player could buy up to tech 5, but then only use tech 4 or lower parts on a mission and thus they would be scored based on tech 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way being efficient with money (cost of your craft \u002B r\u0026amp;d) is balanced with the challenge of the mission.

For those that appreciate this, have sucked it up and continue with turn 3, thanks for soldiering on. That said, if nothing was learned from v1 then it would be a shame. Here is my approach:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo determine rewards I play tested the first two missions with 13 different craft designs. 13. I used many combinations of SRB\\\u0027s, decouplers, pods, landing on water, explosive decoupling, creative staging - you name it. 13 craft. From those 13 craft I determined what missions could be achieved and for each mission I determined the average cost for those two missions. By using the average, half the players would be over that cost and half would be under that cost. I then added roughly 30% to that average cost and that became the \u0027first in\u0027 prize money. Example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayer 1 mission cost = $90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayer 2 mission cost = $110\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAverage mission cost = $100\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrize money = $130\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see that Player one gets more margin - and rightly so - but BOTH players make a profit - as it should be. Missions that make a loss is not sustainable. Two work out \\\u0027diminishing returns\\\u0027, I worked out 2nd place is something like a 22% margin, then 16%, then 9%, then 5% etc etc. I made those numbers up - those aren\\\u0027t the real numbers. My point is that it diminishes in a curve. The difference between 1st and 2nd is much larger than the difference between 4th and 5th. For the mathematical, the formula:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrize money = average cost of craft*1.3*x^-0.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFancy huh. You don\\\u0027t need to understand it. I do and you need to understand I\\\u0027ve put in a lot of thought into this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow - how did this anomoly happen? It\\\u0027s statistics but I\\\u0027ll explain it. If I\\\u0027ve already lost you then I don\\\u0027t blame you - either keep playing for fun or go read some other thread. If you\\\u0027re still interested, here we go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose that did the 70,000m mission - and you\\\u0027ll see there were a few, came in at an average cost of $5805 with a reward of $7546.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose that did the 35,000m mission came in at an average cost of $6097 and, because the average is higher, the reward is $7926.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that fair? It\\\u0027s certainly not intuitive but what has happened is those that did the 70,000m mission have done so on very well designed craft. They used SRB\\\u0027s and explosive decoupling with careful staging and terminal velocity taken into account. Those that did the 35,000m mission, and I mean no disrespect - did so with fat, ugly craft that had too much fuel, they used expensive decouplers and had poor staging. Their craft were really ungraceful. And this is OKAY! This is fun and learning so I mean nothing by that statement!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact is, the skilled players can actually go higher for less. This has the unexpected side effect that you\\\u0027re seeing now. As unintuitive as it appears, it is a symptom of me not benchmarking these missions beforehand. We didn\\\u0027t have this problem in turn 1 because I already play tested turn 1. In turn 2, YOU became the play tester and the model is flawed, or, more correctly, the skilled players departed from the less skilled players in mission choice and my averages have become skewed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I\\\u0027ve explained all that, and confused everyone, we need to decide what to do about it.

It\\\u0027s a good idea, in principle. Where it falls down is that you use the ACTUAL COST of the submitted craft as the basis.

Don\\\u0027t try to be too precise as that will do your head in as the missions get more complex. Ballpark it. Then look at how those figures for the concurrently available missions compare and make sure there is a logical slope there. If one of the figures need a lot of adjusting, consider that maybe the mission parameters are wrong, some part costs are off or maybe your playtesting wasn\\\u0027t very optimal in one of the missions. Tweak one of these three parameters per mission untill there\\\u0027s a seemingly good slope of difficulty, reward and scale. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next bit is important, the base figure has to be shared with the contestants.
