If that\u0027s true, and you don\u0027t have a RT probe core, then I wouldn\u0027t expect you to have any control of the vessel, and therefore the game is working as intended.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mention that the game won\u0027t accept the escape key, but it is clearly accepting mouse clicks, which leads me to believe your problem is more likely related to #2 or #3.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know how or why you excluded RemoteTech, but since that mod most definitely can restrict vessel control, eliminating it as the cause seems premature.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou came here for help. People are trying to help. Please provide more and more detailed information. Alternatively, try Snark\u0027s recommendation (and add to it my own suggestion of verifying the game files); if you eliminate possibilities 1 and 2, then you will know that it is likely to be 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"marimuff","CreatedById":200522,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-02T15:14:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can exclude RT based on the fact that I have flown the exact same vessel time and time before. Also it does work when I stop the game (task manager or just close it through ein toolbar) and then restart it again. It is an unmanned craft with the capability of also carrying kerbals to an orbital station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just verified the files and it found 2 faulty files. It seems to be fixed as a second run didnt find anything. Thank you for your help in that regard already. I\u0027ll get back to you about it once I can tell if it is fixed now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
