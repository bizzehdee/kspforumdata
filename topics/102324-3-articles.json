Realistically, a properly useful car like the Nissan Leaf has a range of about 150 kilometres, though it depends on circumstances. If can be a lot less or slightly more. Driving on the highway that means, in most countries, you would be happy to get two hours out of it, and quite likely it will be less. Top Gear showed us that the Leaf will take 11 hours to fully charge when depleted. So everything over two hours of one way driving is pretty much out of the question. That is fine for a fair amount of commutes or grocery shopping, but anything beyond that quickly becomes unviable. If you want to make a round trip, you either have to charge on site or shorten your journey. Remember that very few companies or car parks have charging stations yet and that finding your own solution is sometimes actively discouraged by blocking all options.\n\nIf I look at why I need a car it is because I need to bring bigger stuff than I can carry, and because I need to go longer distances. The shorter trips can easily be done by foot, bike, train or bus, but for taking a bunch of stuff and/or going on a day trip a car is pretty much the only option. Trains are a good second, though taking too much with you is out of the question.\n\nAs a second runabout car, electric might be interesting, but if you only have one vehicle, the range is still prohibitively limited. I am not even talking about purchase cost and write-off, as both are quite high compared to normal vehicles."},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T01:42:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can not tax electricity for electrical cars only, you can increase road taxes, this hits everyone from the cargo, the single mother in an old beat up car to the guy with his Tesla constantly on insane as he charges for free at the company parking house and is required to supply free charging for electrical cars.\n\u003E Secondary problem is that taxes has multiple purposes, primarily is getting money, secondary is shaping behavior by tax \u0022sinful/ bad\u0022 behavior more and reward good behavior. \n\u003E \n\u003E Now changing tax setup is hard, main operation is to add more taxes to get the budget in balance, however the settings and previous promises shape this, lots of special taxes is legacy who makes no sense today.

However, it still does not make much of a difference, as driving to a gas station will still take less time than charging for hours and hours. Even if you can do most of that charging during other activities, it is still a constant hassle and issue.
