Realistically, a properly useful car like the Nissan Leaf has a range of about 150 kilometres, though it depends on circumstances. If can be a lot less or slightly more. Driving on the highway that means, in most countries, you would be happy to get two hours out of it, and quite likely it will be less. Top Gear showed us that the Leaf will take 11 hours to fully charge when depleted. So everything over two hours of one way driving is pretty much out of the question. That is fine for a fair amount of commutes or grocery shopping, but anything beyond that quickly becomes unviable. If you want to make a round trip, you either have to charge on site or shorten your journey.
