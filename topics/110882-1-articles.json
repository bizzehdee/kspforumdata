But soon after realising its impact on the games load time, I promptly uninstalled it. This is when my troubles started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI go into the SPH or VAB, and the parts on the side refuse to load initially. I can open craft, make new ones, exit the respective hangar, but not use parts until I toggle one of the little UI widgets above the parts area (name, mass, cost and size). Have you ever seen while the parts are loading a curious parts category with what looks like a kerbal and the fabled potatoroid? Well this is what turns up and the actual parts area doesn\u0027t turn up. Only if you toggle the button where you get subassembalies do you get them, and even then it cuts off at the aerodynamics tab every time! Ive tried restarting the game but to no avail. On top of that, when you place new parts you cant move them around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS - how do I get the output log in a post, say in a spoiler tab?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022a\u0026gt;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor some reason hastebin does not want to work - it says the file size is too large\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T16:29:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 04:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Branjoman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T12:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Branjoman, please use \u003Ca href=\u0022Hastebin.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHastebin.com\u003C/a\u003E for logs, and please post some pics of the issue to \u003Ca href=\u0022imgur.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eimgur.com\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
