If the thread turns ugly, you know what will happen to it, and appropriately so.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the holiday weekend and watching a lot of online banter between Atheists and Christians, I started really thinking hard about what classifies as proof in such extreme circumstances. Pondering things for a time, I was hit with some interesting realizations. Even though popular culture would say otherwise, proof of \u0027ghosts\u0027 would not prove there is an afterlife. Proof of an afterlife would not prove there is a god. Even proof of a devil wouldn\u0027t prove there is a god.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I wondered what would happen if the actual real god (keep in mind, I\u0027m not referring to any particular god from a certain faith, simply a sentient entity that willed the universe into being) showed up and said, \u0022Here I am.\u0022 How would it prove to a skeptic that it was indeed a god? I\u0027ve played out a number of different scenarios in my head, but none of them led to concrete evidence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, it could say, \u0022Well to show you I\u0027m God, I\u0027ll blow up the moon. It points to the moon, the moon explodes. Ignoring the panic about an impending rain of meteors and tidal waves, a skeptic could say, \u0022Well that\u0027s not proof. You could have rigged the moon with a massive explosive beforehand.\u0022 I\u0027m not even sure if that alternative explanation defies Occam\u0027s Razor or not (because an actual god brings about a lot of questions), but the point is such a \u0027miracle\u0027 would not be sufficient proof. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, other forms of evidence such as clairvoyance, mind reading, prophecy, etc. would also still not prove that the being actually created the Universe. It could still just be some alien visitor who knows the history of our civilization, and is \u0027playing god\u0027 for some other motive. I\u0027m pretty sure Jesus was even accused of such a thing (reading the prophecies and then setting out to try and recreate them), and that was in a VERY superstitious era, where people were not as quick to doubt what was told them. One could conceivably \u0022scooby doo\u0022 any bizarre phenomenon that they witnessed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtheism and people of Faith butt heads on this all the time, and many say that it isn\u0027t possible to prove, or disprove the existence of a god. And now I\u0027m wondering if it would even possible if a god itself were present to partake in the debate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, thoughts?
