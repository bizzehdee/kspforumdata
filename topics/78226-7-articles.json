I\u0027ll try to explain things as easily as possible through words for the time being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddressing the questions first, 1) Pressing the SR button will take the entire mass of the rocket and ALL of the parachutes and see if that could land. Generally that\u0027s not what you want for recovering stages though. It\u0027s not a simple task to be able to split stages programmatically so at the current time SR doesn\u0027t even try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Generally bottom up is a good idea for totally new craft, or make stages by themselves and save them as subassemblies (or just remember the configuration: if an SRB with two radial chutes is enough for a safe landing, just add two chutes onto each SRB you use). With RealChute it isn\u0027t as big of a deal, just determine the dry mass of the stage in question (the new engineer is good for that) and enter the mass manually into the chute configuration tool (I usually add a little bit extra and aim for 5m/s touchdown, just to be safe). You can even save RC presets if you use similar configurations a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use parts other than command pods as the initial part, so to see if a radial SRB will be recovered just make a new craft with the SRB as the root part and add parachutes as necessary. Then either save that as a subassembly, save the RealChute config as a preset, or remember what was needed for it to work. Center stack stages can use a stack decoupler as a root part, or a probe body, or a fuel tank. Using the decoupler will let you save it as a subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowered landings usually require a bit of testing to be sure, but a totally empty rocket will have a terminal velocity of 100 m/s (without chutes). Therefore you\u0027ll need at least 250 m/s of delta-v in the stage (with atmospheric ISP). If there\u0027s still fuel in the tank then that increases the terminal velocity, so it\u0027s safer to leave 300-400 m/s of dV in the tanks for a safe landing (terminal velocities of 120-160 m/s). If you add parachutes (even if its not enough for a safe landing) then you drop the amount of fuel required by a LOT (the terminal velocity can drop to closer to 20 m/s for instance, which drops the dV requirement to 50 m/s). Even with parachutes SR requires the rocket to have a thrust-to-weight ratio of greater than one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you develop a launcher that works for you, you can just save the whole thing as a subassembly and use it in the future without worrying about it landing safely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-19T19:44:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2014 07:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TeeGee","CreatedById":82434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T17:36:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have an idea for the next update... maybe have a cost for recovering parts.
