What I would like, for sandbox, is for you to be able to change the type of KSC building layout and add customisation! Great for movies and stuff without having to upgrade, change and that stuff. Now I do know some mods like Kerbinside add more buildings and you can choose launch locations, but I would really love it if there was a n option to change the buildings!\n\n-G1"}]}
