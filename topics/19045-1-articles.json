This is my first post here on the forums, but I have been avidly playing since I found the game about a week ago. I have been trying my hand at the spaceplane biz for a while but have had quite a bit of trouble veering off the runway and just generally having a bad run at it. Therefore, I decided to have a go at a vertical takeoff (harrier style), and have run into one slight problem. The design that I have made (with the assistance of RCS and ASAS) makes the takeoff incredibley smooth. The problem that I am running into is the transition between the vertical ascent and the forward flight. I have four jet engines for the initial lift and one rocket engine mounted at the back for horizontal acceleration. The vertical engines are installed directly on the wings, two in front and two in the back. What I would like to do is be able to ease off the vertical thrust as I engage the horizontal. All of this while retaining the vertical engines for a vertical landing. Is there a way to ease off the four verticals while engaging the main without dropping any engines? I think Jeb knows how, but he isn\u0027t sharing his secrets...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be straight with you, it DOES fly, but the take off engines throw things out of wack as they are still firing during turns and all that. That, and due to the attachment to the wings, are feeding off of the main fuel tanks the entire time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize in advance if this has been addressed previously, but I tried a search in the top bar and couldnt really find anything. Thank you in advance for any advice you can give me!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I have learned through trial and error that while in mid flight, you can alt-rightclick on multiple objects to pull up all of their menus. This allowed me to throttle down, deactivate engines and then throttle back up... Not pretty, but it is a start!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-11T07:51:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2012 07:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by UBERDOMINATOR\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T08:24:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want you can use the rotating part from the Damned Robotics mod.
