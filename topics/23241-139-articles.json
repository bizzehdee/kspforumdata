Because that\u0027s been happening for a long time, and I don\u0027t think that\u0027s limited to cargo bays. Or are you talking about something else? \u003Cp\u003EAlso, first time trying to build any planes since .21, and thought I suddenly got bad at plane design with the wobbly gears. The B9 Heinlein or whatever doesn\u0027t seem to suffer from this problem, but that thing has a ton of those invisible strut pieces too I think to keep everything from flexing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, I\u0027m talking about actual off-center lift. It\u0027s like the wing on one side is mounted 1 inch further out from the fuselage. It actually moves the center of lift a little bit over to the right side of the aircraft, resulting in a plane that continuously rolls over to the left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it\u0027s possible to see the actual center of lift move off center in the SPH, I can\u0027t actually see the wings being mounted incorrectly. It\u0027s not a very big and visible thing - but it\u0027s enough to render an aircraft quite unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"synik4l","CreatedById":76492,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T20:43:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022madadam\u0022 data-cite=\u0022madadam\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was using Kerbal Joint Reinforcement in 0.22 and did not have the wobbly gear problem. I\u0027m using it now and have the issue. Also, as I said, replacing the b9 gears with the stock ones got rid of the wobblyness for me. So this to me seems that something got broken in b9 after the 0.23 upgrade. I might try attaching the gears to different parts to see if it helps, but I\u0027m not too worried about this.
