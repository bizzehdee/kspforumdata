I tried to stack several of them with decouplers, but as soon as I stage everything explodes (because of overheathing says the report).\n\nWhat I could do instead is a power descent, but that would require around 3000 m/s of delta-V if I want to bring my speed to 2668 m/s, not acounting for the gain of speed because of gravity.\n\nBut that\u0027s still doable.\n\nMy main concern is how to get the Kerbal out to make the EVA report. If he have to support a too strong G-force he just fly off the ship. So it means I have to slow down my ship enough so the atmosphere doesn\u0027t slow my vessel, which basically means briging my speed near to 0m/s... And which means I need around 6000 m/s to go back into orbit !\n\nIf I could save some speed from my orbit that wouldn\u0027t be that hard, but I don\u0027t know how to do that.\n\nThe last problem is the ascent. You can\u0027t go above 2500/3000 m/s at best while inside Jool\u0027s atmosphere no matter what your altitude is, but you need to achieve 5668 m/s for orbiting Jool. So yes, you can just go straight up and make a radial burn while is space, but that\u0027s ineficient compared to a good gravity turn, meaning you need more delta-V...\n\nThe only good new is that Jool\u0027s atmosphere isn\u0027t that dense at 120 000m, atomic motors are still working with an ISP of 555s at this altitude (though it decrease quickly at this point, only 400s at 110 000m).\n\nBut using atomic motor is adding heat to an already existant heat problem...![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T16:04:38Z","Content":"I will quote someone who wisely answered a question similar to this regarding another Jool contract.

Abort or hope version 1.1 tweaks the atmo to make this plausible. The delta-v requirements to come in at half-orbital speed, then cancel that speed to escape on a near radial orbit (if you can\u0027t build horizontal speed due to atmo, you need to GTFO of the atmo ASAP), and obtain elliptical orbit after escape is fearsome.\n\nAs for making the report once you are there: just use a cargo bay with a external seat. Open bay, get report, close bay.\n\nI have not done this, but this would be my approach:\n\nA Deorbit stage with enough dV to kill orbit (sounds like 3-4 km/s). Can recover this portion with maybe an additional initial dV of .5 km/s\n\nA Mk3/3.25m \u0022lander\u0022 stage with substantial wings to control descent.\n\nAn ascent stage(s) protected by a cargo bay. Enough dV and TWR to ascend to a radial suborbital trajectory (TWR of 2.2-2.4 and a dV of who knows).\n\nAn orbital stage atop the ascent stage with dV to take the suborbital trajectory orbital. The kerbal should sit in a bay that can be opened while docked to the lander (dV dependant on ascent stage).\n\nA support vessel to top-off the tanks and retrieve the return vessel (reducing the mass requirements of the rest)\n\nThe lander wings allow you to translate a lot of that downwards velocity into horizontal velocity. This makes the ascent stages job a little easier.\n\nThe ascent stage needs to be streamlined enough to escape and enough TWR to beat terminal velocity. (unless thermal precludes terminal velocity)\n\nThe rest is orbital maneuvers."},{"CreatedByName":"X-SR71","CreatedById":108775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T16:37:03Z","Content":"And post screens if you actually manage it! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T17:06:43Z","Content":"Well I\u0027ve been avoiding everything related to planes since I started to play this game 2 years ago, so it\u0027s gonna be hard, but I\u0027ll give it a try.

IIRC Kerbals aren\u0027t very heat resistant and can go poof under Eve\u0027s midday sun.\n\nThe problem with leaving a pod is that the kerbal will be ripped from the ladder immediately. The solution is to orient the pod such that the kerbal will be pushed against the hatch. This worked well some versions ago when there was no heat. Now... I doubt that a Kerbal can survive in that place even for the few seconds it takes to gather an EVA report."},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T02:32:38Z","Content":"Apoapsis of 500k km, periapsis of 118k km.
