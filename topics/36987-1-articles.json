As long as you go all the way around. So you can go over the poles if you want. But my guess is that most people will just go east, to save a few seconds. (This IS a race). Also, there is no altitude limit. If you want to fly to 9,000,001 feet and come back down, you are free to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote 2: I also don\u0027t care what engines you use. All I care about is it being a single stage plane.
