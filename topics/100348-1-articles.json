If anyone could do this then I would be greatly appreitiative of the time and effort gone into the mod and will use it in all of my youtube videos and make airliners for download with those parts. Right now i use B9 Aerospace, KAX, B9 Procedural Wings and Falcon Works to make realistic looking airliners, Please check out the KAAaT thread in Spacecraft Exchange, then Rocket Buildes sub-forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank You\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind Regards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECamJK (CamJKerman)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Channel: Cam JKerman (on youtube)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T18:32:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can see the need for it...I for one could use such a mod for an upcoming series I am working on to feature the CSS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A-Stax32","CreatedById":113992,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T13:20:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79542-90-SXT-Lack-s-Stock-Extension-N-1-and-Aero-update-SXT-20-15FEV15-KSC-v3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESXT\u003C/a\u003E has some airliner parts although last I checked it doesn\u0027t have any props other than a tiny 0.625m one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T20:27:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98041\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECoffeeIndustries\u003C/a\u003E had an extensive passenger plane mod, but it hasn\u0027t been updated in a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109567\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFantomWorks-KAX-Part-Pack\u003C/a\u003E has a passenger plane under development, but isn\u0027t quite ready yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T20:48:39Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ultrasquid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
