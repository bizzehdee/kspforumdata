If anyone could do this then I would be greatly appreitiative of the time and effort gone into the mod and will use it in all of my youtube videos and make airliners for download with those parts. Right now i use B9 Aerospace, KAX, B9 Procedural Wings and Falcon Works to make realistic looking airliners, Please check out the KAAaT thread in Spacecraft Exchange, then Rocket Buildes sub-forum.\n\nThank You\n\nKind Regards\n\nCamJK (CamJKerman)\n\nMy Channel: Cam JKerman (on youtube)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T18:32:12Z","Content":"I can see the need for it...I for one could use such a mod for an upcoming series I am working on to feature the CSS."},{"CreatedByName":"A-Stax32","CreatedById":113992,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T13:20:20Z","Content":"I know that [SXT](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79542-90-SXT-Lack-s-Stock-Extension-N-1-and-Aero-update-SXT-20-15FEV15-KSC-v3) has some airliner parts although last I checked it doesn\u0027t have any props other than a tiny 0.625m one."},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T20:27:56Z","Content":"[CoffeeIndustries](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98041) had an extensive passenger plane mod, but it hasn\u0027t been updated in a while.\n\n[FantomWorks-KAX-Part-Pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109567) has a passenger plane under development, but isn\u0027t quite ready yet.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T20:48:39Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ultrasquid**"}]}
