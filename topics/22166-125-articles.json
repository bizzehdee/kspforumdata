We had a long discussion about this on IRC, and the phrase \u0022harder than n-body\u0022 was uttered near the end. Leaving logarithmic timewarp attenuation in place makes things significantly easier, but it leaves us with that \u0022gaps\u0022 problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be tweaking a few scan numbers for 0.8, but improving the underlying mechanics isn\u0027t as easy as everyone seems to think.
