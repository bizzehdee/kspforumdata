Just use space bar to orient the kerbal to the camera.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T16:28:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**"},{"CreatedByName":"troyfawkes","CreatedById":109437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T16:29:11Z","Content":"Thanks for the tip man, \u002Brep!"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T16:48:57Z","Content":"This is useful to me."},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T19:10:58Z","Content":"There used to be a first-person EVA mod which made *great* use of this setting."},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T20:38:39Z","Content":"I use [**VDS Hull CAM**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46365-1-0-2-Hullcam-VDS-Wide-Angle-Camera-Female-Kerbal-EVA-view-Updated-8-May) it has first person view camera."},{"CreatedByName":"keeper","CreatedById":124530,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T21:19:07Z","Content":"Yes you are a legend.
