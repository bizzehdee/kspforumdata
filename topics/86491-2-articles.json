The MK2 set by Porkjet are absolutely beautiful, but now the other two sizes look a lot worse next to them. While Hugo did do good work on the MK1 cockpit and fuselage sections, in my opinion a bit more work should be done to bring them up to Spaceplane Plus levels of polish. As for the MK3 parts, they need a total redesign. Ideally, they should have cargo bays, and be thickened somewhat so that 2.5m parts can fit within. That will finally start making stock space shuttles useful.
