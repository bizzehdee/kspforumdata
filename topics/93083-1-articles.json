Not sure what reasonable is, but with my fledgling new space program (don\u0027t have RCS yet) it took quite a lot of fiddling to match the orbit to the one drawn in map view visually exactly (numbers wise it\u0027s all within a few hundred m, considering apoapsis is over 14,000,000 m that\u0027s pretty exact). And yes, I did match the apoapsis and periapsis point positions to the ones drawn on map, though I don\u0027t really think that should be a requirement, if I\u0027m honest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame\u0027s still not recognizing I did this. I literally dare not touch the orbit at all anymore since even using the reaction wheels seems to whack out the numbers in map view, and any modification I do now just gets it further away from specified parameters. Is this a bug or is \u0022reasonable deviation\u0022 considered to be precision within a meter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the latter, I\u0027d like to point out several things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- you get satellite contracts fairly early in the game, as it should be. However, that early we don\u0027t really have all the bells and whistles, RCS included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- numbers in map view still go crazy when you steer the craft, even without engines and RCS, just using reaction wheels. I just had a situation where my orbit was about 2km too high, so at periapsis I turned the craft retrograde to drop the apoapsis for 2km. However turned retrogade the map view decided my apoapsis was now 2km too low! Turning the craft back, it was again 2km too high. You get the problem - with this kind of supersensitivity insisting on crazy precision is a bad idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- there\u0027s literally no reason to insist on crazy precision as long as the satellite is roughly in a specified orbit. In fact I\u0027d just draw a whole zone it needs to be in in map view. If you want it\u0027s apoapsis to be 14,124.000 m or some such number than anything between 14,000.000 and say, 14,200.000 should be considered reasonable deviation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- when specifying target orbits, do try to avoid ones that take your probe into the gravitational sphere of influence of another body, such as the Mun. Fiddling your orbit to perfection for hours only to have the Mun get a bit too close and pull the probe in is just plain annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy? Because fiddling with orbital parameters for hours while the game still considers it \u0022not good enough\u0022 simply isn\u0027t fun. I was looking forward to satellite contracts, but now that they\u0027re in there I find they\u0027re laborious, boring, and don\u0027t make much sense (lots of these orbital parameters would make no sense for a commercial satellite). Instead of fiddling for hours on end for no good reason, we could be exploring moons and planets. I realize this is still beta, and I\u0027m hoping this feedback will be helpful for future updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, quick thought while I\u0027m at it, I think a camera part should be added, allowing us to take shots of other planet surfaces from probes. That could be good contract requirements as well - take and transmit shots of duna polar region, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-24T15:36:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2015 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Newman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T16:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Newman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Newman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I just tried to fulfill a contract that requires me to launch an unmanned probe that has power and an antenna, into specific orbital parameters withing \u0022reasonable deviation\u0022. Not sure what reasonable is, but with my fledgling new space program (don\u0027t have RCS yet) it took quite a lot of fiddling to match the orbit to the one drawn in map view visually exactly (numbers wise it\u0027s all within a few hundred m, considering apoapsis is over 14,000,000 m that\u0027s pretty exact). And yes, I did match the apoapsis and periapsis point positions to the ones drawn on map, though I don\u0027t really think that should be a requirement, if I\u0027m honest.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not.

Unfortunately I canned the flight and canceled the contract after a near pass of the Mun completely destroyed all the work put into it, so I can\u0027t check anymore.

Get into a circular parking orbit, set up a prograde burn such that my predicted apoapsis matches the required apoapsis marker by eye, doing a quick radial burn midway to correct my apoapsis point if required. Burn at apoapsis to match my periapsis to the marker, tweak inclination as required.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
