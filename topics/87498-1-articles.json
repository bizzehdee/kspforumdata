While being popular are the most deadly and perilous. Professional skill level maybe required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not hard to do, but, is hard to do fast. There are 30 Places Of Interest, POI, around the Kerbal Space Center. At each POI there are science experiments to be done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETour around KSC as fast as you can and grab all the science points from each of the 30 Places Of Interest, while avoiding all the night terrors and perils. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EImaginary\u003C/span\u003E Transparent and hard to see, deadly UNKERBALs are floating around everywhere looking for brains. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience gathering starts at midnight and ends at dawn (Kerbal time 3:00 -\u0026gt; 4:00). You can take as many nights as you need. Just tally up how many nights (1 kerbal hour) go by the initial time of the tour. This will give you free time until the next midnight. Maybe some preperations would be helpful for the next midnight run. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny science left in vehicles must be recoverd during the same midnight hour and is otherwise lost at dawn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETours always start with Jeb at the launchpad/runway at kerbal time 3:00. After 4:00 the free time will start and then will stop at the next midnight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: If on day two at the kerbal hour of 3:00 is the start of the tour. Two more nights later at Kerbal hour 4:00 is the finish of the tour. Then that\u0027s a total of three hours for the tour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fastest tour time is the safest time so that will be awarded once all the science points from each POI are completed. Spooky-vision time if you wait till there is a full Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EImaginary\u003C/span\u003E deadly, transparent UNKERBAL seem to feed off of electricity so better figure another way to control other than with SAS or reaction wheels. You have no way to run all of the flight guidance systems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFire is the only thing that will scare the deadly UNKERBAL. The vessel must have some sort of fuel to burn. Half throttle or more. We need lotsa big flames to scare the UNKERBAL. No stopping, the engines will not fire back up again once off the launch pad or runway. Keep on burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBadda boom explosions seem to scare off the wispy UNKERBAL. A rather large explosion close by to Jeb will then help him come out from hiding. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWimpy explosions are laughed at and mocked by the UNKERBAL. Take a screen shot of the explosion and see how far the light radius is spread out around Jeb. Only 30 seconds of scare off time per explosion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost likely you will need two explosions. One explosion seperated from another explosion by 15 seconds. This will yield 45 seconds for an EVA report, surface sample, plant flag, grab experiments, store experments and board vessel. Hope Jeb is in fit physical shape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb needs somewhere to hide inside of. To protect his brain until dawn. No sitting in command seats unless you got explosions going off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplosions need to be close by to Jeb and in the air seems to destroy less of the beautiful Kerbal Science Center landscaping, but, I could be wrong. Maybe another crater/pond would improve the looks of the Mission Control Building. Besides, Gene likes to go fishing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need another vehicle than go back to the VAB/SPH and launch but cost is 5 minute penalty. Maybe some unguided missles might help. These can be launched but no computer guidance and no other pilot. Only able to use staging and throttle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe recovery team also needs 3 minutes to pick up the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ebroken pieces\u003C/span\u003E vehicle and Jeb. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime penalties only ocur during the midnight tour time and can be time warped through once on the launchpad/runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: If at the end of the first night and you need another vessel for the next night\u0027s tour then you have incurred at least 3 minutes for Recovery (with Jeb inside a vehicle) and 5 minutes for Preperation for a total of 8 minutes and must wait at launchpad/runway at the next midnight hour untill 3:08. Might not be a bad idea to have another vehicle prepared at the runway/launchpad ready for the next night. Start time of the tour would then be 3:13 because there are two vehicles to prepare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you complete this challenge in one vehicle and in 59 minutes then there will be no time penaty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart an easy game mode and crank up all the science. You can expand the tech tree and grab most everything you will need, if not enough science, then add some (just do some science in space no preperations for the tour though) and then save.

Better pack on solar panels to use once in orbit and charge up those dead batteries. Why orbit? Where else?
