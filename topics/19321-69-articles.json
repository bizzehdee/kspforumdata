You can run the AoA simulation with FAR in the VAB/SPH to know your aerodynamic parameters, then i guess you could compute the aerobraking amount from the derived Cd for a given AoA, and then try to hold that (with SAS) during actual aerobraking.. Of course you need to know your entry speed (e.g. like mach 216 for Jool).

This does not happen if the window is open when the editor is left. When the button is clicked after returning to the editor it returns to it\u0027s correct location and the window opens correctly. This happens when only FAR is installed and on a ship that is only a command pod. This is with FAR 0.9.7 and KSP 0.22.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/5I5wB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
