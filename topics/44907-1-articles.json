Is there gonna be a separate tech tree for modded parts? How is this gonna work out. Because it would seem to me that it would be kinda unfair if you have superpowerfull modded parts at the very beginning of your space career. The fun and replay value is the keep improving your spaceprogram by unlocking parts as a result of the missions you complete and the science you operate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there gonna be some sort of measure by which modded parts are rated to define where they are placed in the tech tree? For instance if you have a very powerfull effecient KW Rocketry engine, the game measures what grade it gets based on cost, power, specific impulse etc, to assign it a place in the tech tree. And based on that grade it gets a place early or late in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to know...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"khalidibn","CreatedById":994,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T08:48:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure, I would appreciate if a dev could clarify how career mode would interact with mods.

What i meant was that it would seem to kinda defeat the purpose of the game in my opninion. The fun, for me at least, would lay in the fact that you expand your space program from very small beginnings and discover new things. If you want that big cash you get for that manned mission to a moon of Jool, than its a lot more rewarding if you have to do this in steps and have to improve your technology and expand your knowledge first before you can undertake such an endeavour. If the first thing you do immediatly gets you loads of money and no more big goals to accomplish the game could get really boring really quick.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T12:27:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CyclonicTuna\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CyclonicTuna\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ef the first thing you do immediatly gets you loads of money and no more big goals to accomplish the game could get really boring really quick.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause it\u0027s so utterly tedious as it is right now? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest as some sort of guidelines that mod parts a) don\u0027t work \u003Cem\u003Ein career mode\u003C/em\u003E unless they have tech tree entries, and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E there\u0027s some sort of organised review area for discussion about how mods fit in the tree.
