Or let\u0027s say you are just tired of white wings on your planes. Why can\u0027t we just recolor ship parts to whatever color we want? Kerbal can be creative too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI for one would very much like to repaint my dull white spaceplanes to black or gunmetal-ish.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T18:53:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth are excellent ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - I\u0027m surprised I haven\u0027t thought of this or seen it suggested yet. Interactions between kerbals and more things to do on EVA are the kinds of polish many of us are hoping to see at some point. Not to mention the utility of being able to nab a stranded kerbal without needing to maneuver a ladder over to him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - This has probably been suggested plenty of times, but it is still a very good suggestion. Recently, the kerbpaint mod came out and shows that the stock parts can be dynamically repainted with some clever coding and some preparation on the developers\u0027 part. Hopefully we will see this in stock KSP at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waster","CreatedById":166374,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T02:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fraenir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fraenir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1- Grabbing another EVA Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlightly inspired by Gravity, let\u0027s say you over-extend your stay in EVA while in space and run out of propellant on your pack, you have no way of getting your poor Kerbal back.
