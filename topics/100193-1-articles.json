It\u0027s just a job working for the governmentatthebloodyKerbalSpaceCenter-nervous! Nervous! \u003C/em\u003EI look down and see my knuckles whitening as I grip the armrests. On reflection, that may have been due to the rather... flamboyant driving of the Kerbal in charge of the Space Center\u0027s transport bus. A mix of cheery whistling and blatant attempts to bludgeon his passenger to death with speed bump impacts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I reach into the pocket of the pristine white lab coat given to me at the entrance. It\u0027s big enough to hold all kinds of scientific paraphernalia, but currently it\u0027s empty save for three things - my ID card, pristine and new, a folded form from the receptionist listing my name, superiors (Bob Kerman and Wernher von Kerman) and assignment (Satellite Development, Wing Three) and a tattered, sepia photo. I take out the latter and spread it out carefully, flicking away the dust with a gentle swipe. It depicts three kerbals, smiling and apply, standing in front of a typical suburban house. I smile. That was Theores\u0027 sixteenth nameday, the official marker of the transition between a Kerling and a Kerman, ready to find their own way in the world. Theores was off now, studying at the Anbel Kerman College of Engineering, following in the path of his mother, my dear Rosa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I fold the paper carefully and place it back in my pocket. Enough reminiscing. I\u0027m already missing my family, and I don\u0027t want to add more and more to that feeling. Instead I look up, staring out of the window, watching the departments fly by. Kerbin Air Force development. Engine and Propulsion development. I\u0027m just craning my neck to see if I can catch a look of the stately, imposing Mission Control when my head snaps forward, the seatbelt tightening its grip around my torso as the bus screeches to a halt. Moments later a cheery voice calls out from in front:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Alrighty, we\u0027re here! Hope you enjoyed the ride!\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I choose not to reply to that comment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Stepping out of the bus for the first time for me is one of those indescribably special moments that you cannot put into words - a feeling of awe (and, perhaps, fear) that rolls over me like a huge wave, breaking over my head. I\u0027m still standing there, mouth open, gawping, when a voice from my right breaks my reverie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Wonderful sight, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The voice jolts me into stammering several half-completed apologies as I turn and see another Kerbal in a lab coat standing next to me. He\u0027s about my height, with a disorganised lump of dark hair resembling something a cat would cough up and thick black glasses. He sticks out a hand. When I take it, almost tentatively, he near-crushes my hand in a firm grip and pumps my arm vigourously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Jaines Kerman, researcher.

Those are my first thoughts as I enter the briefing room. A single fluorescent strip of a lamp runs across the ceiling, throwing a sharp white light on a long, metal table surrounded at regular intervals by black leather chairs. The rest is blank, white space. I am the only one here, and it feels, well, intimidating. I check my watch, nervously drumming my fingers on the table. It\u0027s been ten minutes! Where are they!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sigh and mutter to myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You would have thought they would bother to-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe door swings open. In step two Kerbals, cutting me off in midflow. Jaines is first, grinning from ear to ear, in the slightly inane manner of a clown at a children\u0027s birthday party. Behind him is a figure I recognise instantly. That close-cropped black hair, that authoritative but reflective look - it\u0027s a face i\u0027ve seen on many a research paper. Bob Kerman. He looks at me disapprovingly, his brow creasing into a dark frown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bother to what, \u003Cem\u003Erecruit?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E He spits the last word with a kind of accusatory venom. I look to Jaines with a face that I hope conveys my sense of abject terror at being in trouble on the first day, but I think I see a hint of sadism seeping into his grin and decide to abandon conversational direction, instead jumping to my feet and saluting so hard I feel a bruise on my forehead. I thought Jaines was on my side - well, he seemed so nice earlier, but I suppose you can never judge anyone\u0027s feelings towards you by how they act (citation: my early attempts at romance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mr Bob! Uh... I mean sir! I mean Mr Kerman, Sir! I was just... um... you know... I was just...\u0022 I trail off, feeling the nerves well up again. \u003Cem\u003EYOU WERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION, OCTAVIAN. WELL DONE.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis frown only seems to deepen as he strides round the table to look me in the eye, closely followed by Jaines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen suddenly, Jaines dissolves into laughter and claps me on the back, the blow stinging between my shoulder blades. I really hope that\u0027s not going to be a habit.. \u0022Welcome to the Kerbal Space Center, recruit.\u0022 Bob manages to hold the frown for a second longer, but soon his deep, booming laugh joins in as he shakes my hand. I stand there, still confused as to what exactly is going on. When Bob takes a seat opposite me, I finally snap back to reality and sit down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So, here\u0027s the deal.\u0022 He takes out a small piece of paper. As he slides it over to me, I see that it\u0027s a typed letter. \u0022You know the Rockomax Conglomerate, right?\u0022 I nod dumbly, the nerves still wearing off. \u0022You know how they like their over-the-top PR stunts. Well, ever since Kerbodyne started manufacturing the heavy-duty engines Rockomax\u0027s market share has been falling like it was a rocket with no fuel tanks. They\u0027ve contacted us with a deal. They - well, read the letter for yourself.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe letter opens with corporate babble about company presence and market shares, and only gets down to business about halfway through. It\u0027s still packed full of corporate buzzwords and the kind of over-the-top hype that had become the Rockomax trademark, but with a skim read I get the gist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So, as the ultimate space PR stunt for a spaceparts company, they want us to build a satellite that will beam PR messages 24/7 from orbit?\u0022 Bob nods. \u0022But that\u0027s against the whole principle of the KSC! We were built on the promise of never being a sell-out - of being a organisation dedicated to research, not profit! The bloody motto is \u003Cem\u003EResearch, Diligence, Inspiration\u003C/em\u003E, not \u003Cem\u003EMoney, Money, Money\u003C/em\u003E!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI take a deep breath, trying to calm down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m sorry, that was unprofessional.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob shakes his head. \u0022No, no. I understand how you feel. Jaines feels the same way. The problem is, if we don\u0027t build it for them, they\u0027re going to sop providing us with parts. That means we\u0027re locked in to this contract. You and Jaines will be responsible for designing the communications methods. We\u0027ll have other two man teams working on reaction wheels, probe cores, power and so on. Any questions?\u0022 I shake my head, dumbfounded at such a betrayal of the founding principles of the Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good. I\u0027m sorry about this, but I have no choice. You\u0027ll be presenting your designs to Carlton Rockomax Jr in two weeks.\u0022 As he gets up to leave, he turns back. \u0022Oh, and recruit?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t mess this up, or we\u0027re all doomed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sit there, shocked, feeling like I\u0027ve been sledgehammered.

Jaines compliments my technique - I\u0027ve marked him down as the kind of Kerman that makes a game out of everything by now - but I just pull out a new sheet and keep sketching. It\u0027s been a few days now, and already the basket is overflowing with rejected designs. \u003Cem\u003E50cm, Octavian. This should be easy! A nice simple job, but you keep messing up. Nice one, genius.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A loud crash followed by several unrepeatable phrases comes from the impact testing chamber beside us. Startled, my pencil jumps on the page, crossing off the design I\u0027ve been working on. I almost growl with frustration as I ball this one up and hook it over my head into the bin. I\u0027m about to pull out another one when I hear Jaines\u0027 chair scrape across the floor. I look over my shoulder to see him leaning on my chair, looking on sympathetically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Come on, Oct, take a break. Maybe something\u0027ll come to you later?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look up at him, a mixture of anger and confusion on my face, both at him and at my own incompetence. \u0022We\u0027re working to a deadline here, Jaines! We\u0027ve got to finish this!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis tone stays even and soft. \u0022Look, banging your head on an empty page won\u0027t help. We\u0027ve been working hard on this project but we can\u0027t do everything in one go. Ease off, recruit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know he means well, but his words sting, especially \u003Cem\u003Erecruit\u003C/em\u003E, and I feel anger welling up inside me. What right does he have to lecture me? What has he done while I\u0027ve been slaving here, drawing and drawing and drawing? Why does he have the right to take the credit for work I\u0027m doing? The frustration is boiling now, roaring, screaming, clawing at my throat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly I jump up. Kick away my chair. The words come spilling out, roiling over my tongue. \u0022We?\u0022 Incredulous. \u0022WE!?\u0022 More forceful this time, and suddenly I can\u0027t stop myself from pouring out the frustration inside me. \u0022You... YOU... I slave here, day after day, working and working, while you play stupid games and make childish jokes! Can\u0027t you take things seriously for one day? ONE DAY?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe room\u0027s fallen silent. Everybody\u0027s looking at us, but I keep going, ignoring Jaines\u0027 look of confusion and, perhaps a hint of sorrow. He places a hand on my shoulder, and suddenly I go over the edge. A strange, animalistic scream of fury wells up inside me, and suddenly the barriers are finally down. I\u0027ve passed the point of no return. My fist comes up and slams into his gut, hard. As he stumbles backwards, shocked, I take off running. Running from my anger, my hatred, my fear, my confusion, desperately hoping I can outrun the black dog at my heels. Head down, I sprint through the building, shoving aside researcher and engineer alike, but the dog\u0027s still at my side. I keep going, keep working my legs, keeping pounding the floor, but it\u0027s still there. I reach out my fingers, clasp the door handle and in one movement I\u0027m through. I slam it closed behind me and manage to totter a few steps before collapsing, screaming and crying in equal measure, chest rising and falling like some sort of strange dance accompanying the tortured noises from my throat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still screaming when three Kerbals turn up ten minutes later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAuthor\u0027s Note, because professionalism and stuff\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks very much for reading!
