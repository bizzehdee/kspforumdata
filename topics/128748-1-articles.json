I put the word\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EContract\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in double quotation marks because by \u0022Contract\u0022, I mean \u0022Full-blown campaign.\u0022 There\u0027s just no way to avoid one with this mod idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, some background info:\u00A0I got the inspiration for this idea by reading the book\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EKill Chain: The Rise of the High-Tech Assassins\u003C/em\u003E, by Andrew Cockburn. It is a documentary that focuses on the evolution of the military world (mostly on unmanned technology and various other such networks, but that\u0027s too much already). The beginning of the book focuses on the idea in general, investigating deep into the Vietnam War, the Laos bombings, and WWII. Namely, it focuses on Task Force Alpha (operation Igloo White and Rolling Thunder). I was\u00A0inspired to propose this idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe general problem that I see with BDArmory is its\u00A0lack of strategy. Mostly, I see people competing with each other on topics such as\u00A0\u0022Who\u0027s fighter is better,\u0022 or \u0022can you beat\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ETHIS\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022 but, so far, none of those competitions focus on strategy and creativity as much as they focus on the aspects of an individual military device. Sure, you can create some things that are used strategically in\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EReal Life\u003C/em\u003E, but, in the end, you\u0027ll just be pitting it off against something else, seeing how agile or strong it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI generally wanted to see what people would think about it by sneaking some craft ideas into several threads. However, last time I did that, a situation ensued, after which I replaced my status with \u0026lt;\u0022Are you brain dead?\u0022\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E-The_Mad_Emu\u003C/em\u003E\u0026gt;. No, I\u0027m not posting links to that thread, thank-you-very-much. So, I\u0027m proposing a mod that completely tilts BDArmory to the strategic side, by use of these factors:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Contracts\u0022 (again, quotation marks), that make combat focus purely on strategy.\u003C/strong\u003E Drone recconaissance, troop distribution, new offense and defense ideas that could change the tide of war completely (like operation Igloo White, if you know about it).\u00A0The contracts will also be based on the decisions of the enemy\u0027s side, the actions of your troops (yes, troop\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Es\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, you\u0027ll have an actual organized military network) will be decided by you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EPolitics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0The events that you choose to do will greatly influence your relationships with other countries (basic borders drawn out on the map, with basic rules according to them). This is important, and greatly influences military decisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EMany more.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Yes, I keep forgetting if I wanted to write anything else into this post, or I\u0027m just too lazy. Therefore, I write \u0022many more\u0022 or \u0022etc\u0022 after every list I make, to negate any complaints against my lack of points, knowledge,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eetc\u003C/em\u003E. Nice try, military genius.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, if done correctly, reconnaissance, logistics,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eetc\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0will be the main aspect of war, not the quality of machinery. Using the environment given by this mod, a KSP player will be able to give his contraptions the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etrue\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0test, as part of an organized military network.\u00A0Jets and tanks won\u0027t win wars, unmanned drone networks (remote tech will be awesome),\u00A0\u0022invisible\u0022 barriers (again, Igloo White) and strategies\u00A0would be the factors of victory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, Igloo White failed. The last recording of the top-secret operation\u00A0was of a Viet-Cong soldier taking a kraken\u00A0on an acoustic sensor.
