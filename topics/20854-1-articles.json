Begining with 30 orbiting missle defence platforms that can cordinate a massive volley of missles and destroy almost any thing within range. Second we have prepared a massive armoda of space planes ready to be mobilized with laser and missle attack weapons. Third we have readied thousands of ICBM siloes, all across kerbin. Forth if all else fails there is the dooms day cataclysm, which is designed to turn Kerbin it self into a massive powerful bomb by have 100 Nuclear Fusion bombs placed in key locations beneath its crust to detonate all at once causing Kerbin to implode, then the pressure forceing millions of tons of debris to completely wipe out any orbiting ships within kerbin\u0027s system.
