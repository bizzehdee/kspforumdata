They would know this WYSIWYG approach to the maneuver nodes is substandard to placing the node at a point and straddling that point with the burn. \u00A0They would know that the average KSP player is not going to \u0022trust\u0022 the game and want to be far more precise in the time, direction, and duration of the burn than KSP2 will allow (or is even capable of? \u00A0I can\u0027t help but wonder.) The Burn Timer, and the placement and use of Maneuver nodes, in their present state, are both absurd. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey would know that the visual cues in moving stages and stage components around in KSP2 are clearly substandard to that of KSP1.\u00A0 They would know that pinning the little boxes they put around Apoapsis and Periapsis readings get in the way of needed information and UI on the map screen. \u00A0In contrast, KSP1 APO and PERI readings simply became transparent but readable if pinned, and did not interfere with other information on the screen. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey would know that there was literally\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E to be gained by changing the camera controls in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0They would know exactly how irritating it is when the game keeps resetting your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E camera. \u00A0They would know this whole \u0022Workspace/Shipname\u0022 gimmick in the ship saving interface is actually a pain in the ass: \u00A0If I cannot save multiple ships under one workspace, what the hell is the point? \u00A0They would know that auto-populating the description with \u0022Autosaved blahblahblah\u0022 also serves to further complicate things when trying to retrieve a saved ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey would know that we like and have a vested interest in the fate of our Kerbals, and don\u0027t care for them disappearing without explanation after a mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey would know the fonts they used look like they were lifted directly from the 1978 cabinet game Space Invaders, and that their map icons are similarly retro-looking, and that both detract from the game\u0027s supposed polish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey would know that the tutorials, while overly verbose and not voiced in KSP1, were organized in a way that made sense and gave a wealth necessary of information to the player. \u00A0The KSP2 tutorials, while nicely polished, seem haphazardly organized and often information left out of the tutorials seemed to be left out because the game is incapable of letting the player make use of that info. \u00A0The whole thing seems dumbed down. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am reminded of the moment it dawned on me that the second Star Wars trilogy was not for me: it was written and directed for a different audience, with different goals (can you say merchandising?) in mind than the first three movies. \u00A0Is this what is happening with KSP? \u00A0Are we getting a game where, if you just do what the game tells you to, burn when it says burn, don\u0027t worry yourself with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E calculations or useful tools like a precision node editor or fuel management, you get to land on the Mun and learn absolutely nothing?\u00A0 Is Intercept hoping for a larger audience with a dumber product?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said, I\u0027ve got a little over 100 hours in KSP2. \u00A0In KSP1 I\u0027ve got over 900 hours registered through playing from Steam, and probably another 1500 in game time spread out over various mod implementations and pre-release versions. \u00A0I started with v 0.19.0 in 2013. \u00A0In it\u0027s current state, it is difficult to imagine I will get the same enjoyment out of KSP2. \u00A0I hope I am wrong. \u00A0I really do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-25T23:57:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2023 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Meta Jonez\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Racster","CreatedById":228266,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-26T17:09:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTotally agree with Mete Jones post.\u00A0 KSP 2\u00A0 just isn\u0027t as good as KSP 1 in so many respects.

Like listing things that are known bugs, or known to be slated for improvement. And that\u0027s choice everyone is free to make. Another approach is a constructive approach, listing what was changed, how it worked originally, why the change doesn\u0027t work and how to improve it. And skip the known bugs, especially when you know they\u0027re being addressed in the upcoming\u00A0 patch.

practice. You\u0027d have to correct both your position and trajectory which could cause some really janky changes in attitude, which would probably cause even more deviation that would have to be corrected. I did like the ksp1 system which corrected for just attitude deviation, and could be avoided by changing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to lock.

Just remember that all those correction burns will have their own deviations which need to be corrected for since your craft can\u0027t fly straight. The biggest problem though is that you\u0027re asking your craft to perform quick 180 degree turns for some of the corrections. You would have to take into account how quickly your craft rotates, and how much more of a deviation you\u0027ll end up with since presumably the thruster is on during the rotation. Add to that the fact that trajectories include time, you\u0027ll also have to perform your corrections so that you\u0027re at the right position with the right momentum at the right time. And all of this would have to work with any ship design. Is this technically possible? Probably.
