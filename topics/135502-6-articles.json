Specifically vacuum dv vs atmospheric dv is a complication I haven\u0027t seen mentioned yet in this thread. If a new player is told their rocket has 3400m/s dv because their rocket has 3400m/s \u003Cu\u003Evacuum\u003C/u\u003E dv, but they fail to make orbit around Kerbin then they might conclude something\u0027s wrong with the game (especially if they\u0027re not the kind of player who frequents forums or downloads mods).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncluding a dv readout in stock is an entirely different beast from including it in a mod: you know someone who downloads a mod is the kind of player who will look outside the game for more info to at least some extent (because they downloaded the mod in the first place), but some players who play stock wouldn\u0027t even think to look on a forum or download a mod if something isn\u0027t working. Mod-downloading forum-goers are not hurt by having to download a dv-readout mod, but a half-hearted dv implementation in stock could be misleading and confusing to new players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that I am not arguing that Squad shouldn\u0027t add a dv readout. I\u0027m only pointing out yet another complexity that Squad will have to take into consideration for implementing it.
