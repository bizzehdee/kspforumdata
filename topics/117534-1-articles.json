Only one side of the fuel tank is used as a radial attachment point, so you just need to press Q, W, E, A, S or D until that side is facing the right direction."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T15:55:10Z","Content":"Clipping is only cheating when **YOU** think it is cheating. Don\u0027t let others tell you how to play your game.\n\nPersonally I don\u0027t have a problem with minor clipping. I will not put a fuel tank inside another tank just to increase the fuel load. But I will put batteries, reaction wheels etc. inside empty structural pieces.\n\nIf a part doesn\u0027t want to attach exactly how you want it try the translation and rotation tools in the upper left corner."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T17:09:09Z","Content":"The gizmo tools are your friend. They are often easier to use to manipulate a part than trying to attach it perfectly with the mouse. Also, the sci jr has a slighly different attachment than fuel tanks, if I recall off hand.\n\nAs for clipping, do what you feel. I would share my personal thoughts on how much clipping, but that really should color your thoughts on how you play. It used to be a bigger sticking point on the forums until after the gizmos were added to the game, because you had to use the dreaded F12 menu previously.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"lugge","CreatedById":143343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T08:33:41Z","Content":"Hello and thanks, folks.\n\nI finally achieved to get a fuel tank attached on the panel. No rotating necessary.\n\nThen, I quickly made a subassembly for this, because I need this part more often :-)\n\nWell, until now I just built these standard rockets, you know.\n\nTake an engine, fuel, separator, engine fuel, separator...\n\nBut now I\u0027m working on rovers.\n\nI also have a nice skycrane, using a lot of panels and other structural parts.\n\nNow I have to use the gizmo tools and carefully try to fit the attaching point I want to attach...\n\nAt this stage of craft design, I really came to the conclusion, KSP\u0027s craft editor sucks. Balls.\n\nBut thats another story :-)\n\nGreetings, lugge"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T09:17:10Z","Content":"Hold Alt (or whatever\u0027s the Mod key for you) when attaching it.\n\nThe panel has a node (or two on both sides?) in the middle. The tank has nodes at the centers of the two circular sides. But since both are \u0022surface attachable\u0022 the tank defaults to surface attach by half of its length, to the surface of the panel. By holding Alt you enforce node attachment, disallowing surface attachment, and as result the tank would only attach by the node, to the panel\u0027s node."}]}
