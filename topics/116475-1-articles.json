To do this I need to activated the parachute at 24000 - 33000 meters. But when I do this, nothing happens. The highest I can set the parashute to open is 5000 meters and even if I manually open it higher, the game says its not safe. \n\nHow to I get passed this?\n\nI\u0027m playing in career mode. \n\nThankful for any help\n\nHenrik\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T10:40:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 10:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by h1978n**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T10:13:09Z","Content":"It shouldn\u0027t matter. From what I remember chute testing is no different than others - just stage it at the right time.\n\nIt sounds like you\u0027re not aware of the other speed requirement that always come with the atmosphere tests - did you check that?\n\nAlso, have the contract window open when doing part testing. You need all circles become green ticks when you stage.
