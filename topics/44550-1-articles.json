Unless you are using mods like Firespitter that use electric props, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible. So far the only \u0022boats\u0022 that I\u0027ve seen are either jet powered or use rockets but have a very short range before needing to be filled up. And to make it float and go fast, attach some fins pointing down. Then attach some of the large control surfaces pointing in the direction you want (the narrow ends) to move. That should give you enough buoyancy to keep you afloat and provide little friction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T04:44:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u0022Zeroignite\u0022.
