It depends so much on the design of your ship, for example, when doing Minmus returns, some of my ships slow down enough to land with a periapsis of 38 km, and I\u0027ve got another that takes 3 passes at 33km just to get it\u0027s apoapsis down to 300km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T15:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrue, that depends on the shape of the ship.

But it is a gas giant so I suppose it\u0027s fairly realistic. I used the simple orbit function of HyperEdit, which sets the craft in a circular orbit at the altitude you set (so it was at orbital velocity, a few kilometres per second). If you were aerobraking, you would be going much faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T11:44:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 11:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheMoonRover\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
