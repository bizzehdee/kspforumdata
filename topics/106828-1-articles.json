If you close them you end up with fairing bits inside your rocket, which generally results in a RUD (rapid unplanned disassemble)\n\n- The textures don\u0027t quite do it for me: I haven\u0027t found a single part that they nicely match with, the yellow band jumps out to much for my liking, and why I like clean looking parts, they don\u0027t quite fit in the current texture scheme\n\nAnybody else any thoughts on this?"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T10:26:45Z","Content":"You can close the fairing on parts. For example you can use them as interstage, Apollo style fairings. You just close it in around the part and it doesn\u0027t merge inside it just locks onto the outside of the part.\n\nAs for the colours, i like them, but i suppose you might be able to change the texture for them with module manager but i have no idea how."},{"CreatedByName":"WooDzor","CreatedById":72106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T10:33:23Z","Content":"@worir4 I noticed that and it works nicely on the top part of a Saturn, it becomes impossible when lets say you have clipped 4 of the largest tanks for the lower stage of the Saturn V, have your fairing and then have the second stage on top.

If it was possible to just pull the fairing all the way up to the bottom edge of the next stage and stop it there I would be very happy ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T10:38:33Z","Content":"You can make engine fairings (or general interstage fairings) with them, it\u0027s just a bit tricky and frustrating sometimes.\n\n[![kWBTIe4l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/kWBTIe4l.jpg)](http://imgur.com/kWBTIe4)\n\nIf there is ANY part obstructing where the fairing is going to go (or even a bit close to it) then it won\u0027t form an interstage and it won\u0027t form to oddly shaped things. \n\nI\u0027ve also found a quite interesting bug that happens with the craft in the above pic; if a fairing panel gets stuck in another part when you jettison them then you won\u0027t be able to time warp (it say can\u0027t timewarp while moving over terrain) and the orbit in map mode disappears leaving just the Ap/Pe markers flickering about all over the place.

I can just absolutely *not* get the thing to close in the interstage no matter what I do. It\u0027s on a Saturn V replica, and the interstages were working fine. I open it in the editor again, and suddenly fairings just seem to stop working properly. They will close over the whole craft, just not the interstage, or for that matter *anywhere* on the entire craft. Even after removing and replacing all parts attached to the fairing (the tank below it, the fuel tank it\u0027s being attached to, and the stuff inside the fairing)\n\nI then tried the Stock Bugfix Modules, which include several fixes for fairings. Even that didn\u0027t help. Only after creating a *totally new craft* did the fairing work.\n\nAm I the only one who is thinking that perhaps the fairings are a tad bit inherently buggy and they should just be redone from scratch?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-18T00:39:30Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2015 12:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T14:45:36Z","Content":"Yeah I had this problem too. Removing fairing and all parts it covers may or may not help. There is also other bug if  you stage without jetisoning fairing first, engines inside will refuse to activate. But I\u0027m not complaining. Biggest, most annoying and rocket-destroying fairing problem ever was with LV-N \u2013 and that one IS fixed in 1.0.5 :-)"}]}
