In the space type \u003Cem\u003E-force-opengl \u003C/em\u003E(the - is needed) and the game will run on OpenGL.

Sadly, the KSP settings do not allow for you to select MSAA from the settings, thus you have to force KSP to use them through your graphics driver. Again, this seems not to work for you. The only option that I can suggest is for you to change the settings in your graphics driver before you alter it to OpenGL and see if that works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizwalker","CreatedById":78337,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T05:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother option would be to use the dirrctx11 switch.
