The weird thing is, it shouldn\u0027t be the memory limit, because I had a lot of leeway, considerably under 3.5GB in most crashes... I run almost no texture-adding mods just for that reason (KAS, KIS, and roverdude\u0027s LS, basically), and let me tell you I was usually just waiting for a crash instead of closing my games 80% of the time. Of course it still loads much leaner this way, no doubt about that, about 1.9-2.2GB by the time I load a game, 1.5GB of the title screen. Still, some lagginess in anything UI-related is apparent. Or maybe it\u0027s because KSP has been running for five hours now. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, spread the good word in your youtube videos.

I could look up the delta-V of the flight, or I could do the work myself. This project is about doing the work myself, or else I\u0027d have used Realism Overhaul instead of researching all the rockets myself, so.... I\u0027m going to do the math for the delta-V needed to reach Venus as well!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst we need to know how fast we\u0027re travelling before we start moving, and then we need to know the delta-V to get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll begin from LC-12 which is 28 degrees north, and therefore the Earth is 35,410.272 km in circumference there. It takes 86,400 seconds to rotate once, so we are travelling 409.84 m/s when we start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what altitude we went to first. Let\u0027s assume roughly 250 km. I\u0027m assuming this was not a direct ascent since the Agena was fired twice, so the second burn had to be the escape burn. For a liftoff cost we need the desired orbital velocity and then we\u0027ll subtract the starting velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat speed is sqrt(GM/r) and GM is 3.986E\u002B14. Earth radius is 6373.45 km at 28 degrees. I got the radius by doing this in Excel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=A1*SQRT((A2^4)/(A1^4)*((SIN(RADIANS(A3)))^2)\u002B(COS(RADIANS(A3))^2))/SQRT(1-(1-(A2^2)/(A1^2))*(SIN(RADIANS(A3))^2))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used A1 = 6,378.14 for equator radius, A2 = 6,356.75 for polar radius, and A3 = 28 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not the real radius for the entire initial orbit, but it should be close enough to what we need for the liftoff up to the second Agena burn. It\u0027s also more precise than we need anyway!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo orbital velocity needs to be 7908.27 m/s using sqrt(GM/r).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinus 409.84 gives us 7498.43 m/s as a cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also a gravity drag and atmospheric drag cost to a liftoff. Gravity will vary as we gain altitude. We start around 9.8067 m/s but it\u0027ll drop to 9.4365 by the time we reach orbit. We\u0027ll start 90 degrees to gravity at the start, but we\u0027ll be going 45 degrees very quickly (around 6.873 m/s), and eventually 0 degrees when we stop. Gravity losses will therefore change over time, and thus is more complex math, so I leave it to the reader to figure it out, but I got 1496 m/s. That was about 6.5 m/s for the 230 seconds to reach 0 degrees. Atmospheric drag is pretty low, about 300 m/s depending on the shape of the rocket, launch profile, etc. Add these all together and we get 9294 m/s for liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next task is to figure out our escape velocity and orbit transfer velocities. Escape velocity is easy. That\u0027s sqrt(2GM/r) and we have those values from above, so we plug them in and get 11,184 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer velocity requires knowing the orbits of Earth, Venus, and the GM of the sun. We\u0027ll use the formula sqrt(GM(2/r-1/a)) for a Hohmann transfer. We start out in August, so the Earth is 1.0116 AU from the sun, or 1.5133E\u002B11 m. Venus is roughly 1.08E\u002B11 m. SMA is therefore 1.2967E\u002B11 m. Using the formula we get a velocity at Earth of 34,206 m/s and 28,604 m/s at Venus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the orbital velocity formula we know the Earth is travelling 29,613 m/s when we leave. The difference between that and the speed we want to go is 4592 m/s. We don\u0027t need to pay all of that though. We will have excess orbital velocity as we leave Earth\u0027s SOI. Doing sqrt(11184^2 \u002B 4592^2) gets us the true Earth escape velocity we need, which comes out to 12,090 m/s. We\u0027ll already be going 7908, so the difference of 4182 needs to be paid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding the base cost to this, we get a total dV needed of 13,476 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive or take.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T17:59:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, how are things starting to look,for the next episode?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T22:37:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey felbourn, when you get around to it, liquidhype is making a fantastic ariane rocket pack\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T23:01:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, thanks.
