I would like to add one for Minimus when you land on it. Then when you explore farther out you unlock more screens like when you land on Duna you might unlock a screen that shows a lander orbiting Duna with it\u0027s moon (Ike if memory serves correct) in the background and when you click on \u0022start\u0022 it could zoom in to a Kerbal sitting on a \u0027Duna buggy\u0027 (lol) on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to be able to change which one I\u0027m looking at from a list of the unlocked ones. For example if I\u0027ve put a space station around Jool and that\u0027s my current screen I may decide I on\u0027t like that screen. However, I did like the Eeloo screen and I already unlocked it. So I\u0027d like to be able to go to my settings and click on \u0022Eeloo Start Screen\u0022 or something to that effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be nice to have an in-game reward like that rather than just the emotional/physical reward you experience with the accomplishment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps, once development gets closer to done you could make Sandbox mode landers/orbits give out orbiting start screens and Career mode landings/orbits reward with surface view start screens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrKicker","CreatedById":77424,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T01:09:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeh, have it use the first spacecraft you landed on then planet with and have it put the iconic 3 kerbals infront of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"innovine","CreatedById":76487,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T09:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat a great idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T09:20:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know there is as of yet no feature that tracks your accomplishments. Once career mode is implemented there obviously has to be one. Reflecting some of your most memorable accomplishments in the start screen should not be that hard. Doing so with the craft you actually used to do so however will be a tricky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart screens are not movie but are rendered in real time so anything you can imagine could in theory be there. But the scene has to be staged some way to make it look good; camera, vehicles, Kerbals, flags, planets/moons. You wouldn\u0027t want your scene be obscured by some random terrain scatter boulder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T10:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey laid the groundwork for tracking accomplishments, actually. That was the bulk of .21, I believe. I\u0027m not a hundred percent sure, but I think the game currently tracks whether a flight lands on a planet successfully and whether it returns. It probably tracks more than that, I just don\u0027t know much about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I think about it, I\u0027m pretty sure someone mentioned in another thread that it\u0027s tracking whether specific kerbonauts landed somewhere then returned to kerbin safely. But I think it tracks it oddly or something. I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, I\u0027d be down for the main menu scenery changing, though I\u0027d rather have it be...maybe the last planet you touched down on before exiting the game last time. So, if you landed on Duna then went back to KSC to do build something before exiting the game(without launching), it would show a scene on Duna. Or if the last thing you did was launch a station or probe or something then exited the game, the main menu would display either your probe or just some of the stock builds doin\u0027 their thang.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way it\u0027s always kind of reminding you of what you did last time you played. It could even probably be setup to show a snapshot of the last vehicle you landed or got into a stable orbit. Hmm...I wonder how difficult that would be for them to setup...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
