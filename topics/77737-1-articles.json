I mean considering that almost every satellite, prober, lander, and rover, were most likely launched by some sort of atlas or delta, they are surprisingly absent from this game. I think if you are going to undertake the Atlas family, you should do it in a matter that might be a little less detailed and memory consuming so people can get the most use out of it. I mean all of your models are beautiful but I guarantee if you make a pack for the Atlas family it will be extremely popular and heavily used to launch probs, satellites, etc. With the new contracts coming a pack or platform like that could be really useful. So long story short, I don\u0027t think you should do the Atlas 1 but the any of the other variants, would say yes there is a need. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/a/atlasfam.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022atlasfam.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T21:47:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn particular, the proportions of the FASA Atlas are a bit wonky, and it\u0027s not really usable for anything but an Atlas D anyway.

But it\u0027s a start. And the emphasis is definitely on making it a useful launcher. The centaur stage is 2.5m, so it will interface with some existing payloads and fairings. That makes the CCB a weird size, but I built the interstage into the CCB tank, so it terminates at 2.5 m as well, so you could put different upper stages on it if you wanted.
