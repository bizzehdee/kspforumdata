Of course, the ultimate goal, however long it takes, is to explore further into the Solar System and attempt to colonise the other planets and moons where possible, eventually ensuring the continued existence of humanity. That may seem whimsical, and given the current state of affairs, it is. Colonisation of other worlds sadly won\u0027t apply to our current society (unless all space agencies of the world suddenly gain a big boost in funding), but the research being conducted now will help in future endeavours; amongst other things, the ISS wasn\u0027t put into orbit as a publicity stunt. Colonisation is the long term goal, and it\u0027s important that we do this work now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether or not people agree with it or are aware of it, space is extremely useful, and other applications like asteroid mining and orbiting solar farms will likely arise from their concepts to reality (eventually...), providing further and positive impacts for everyone.
