Fuel is drained asymmetrically from twin stacks of attached fuel tanks or constructions on lateral separators or things like that. In a weird way, the program prioritizes some fuel tanks over others, draining some and leaving the rest. This might lead to a premature shutdown of engines that are attached to the drained tanks, because they obviously can\u0027t get fuel from the rest of the ship while the other engines can drain this tank. Not fuel pipes attached, but there are some one-way fuel flowing mechanisms that definitely shouldn\u0027t be there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T06:53:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I don\u0027t know what could have affected the fuel this way, there\u0027s a way to fix the fuel levels.
