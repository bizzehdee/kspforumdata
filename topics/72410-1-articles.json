That really messes with orbits (unsurprisingly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf none of those are the case, then there is a known game bug where SOI changes are not shown until they happen. This tends to occur with near-circular orbits just inside or just outside that of a celestial (and tends to lead to a crash after the SOI change, since you have very little speed relative to the celestial). You could try trusting that the close approach will give you the capture when you\u0027re there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T14:27:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zapman987\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zapman987\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat am I missing?

I hardly ever get a Dres encounter directly from Kerbin but as long as I\u0027ve got the closest approach down into the general area, that\u0027s fine. Just do a very small mid-course burn to finalize the encounter. The problem is that Dres\u0027 SOI is smaller than the smallest amount you can tweak the angle of your trajectory back at Kerbin when plotting the transfer burn. So sometimes you can hit it but often you jump back and forth to either side of it. But no worries. The important thing with any interplanetary transfer is to make sure you and the target end up in the same general area at the same time, which you can see with the closest approach markers. Thus, if you\u0027ve got the closest approach down very small when you leave Kerbin, you can do a very small correction burn somewhere in the vicinity of Duna\u0027s orbit to finalize the encounter. The closer you get to Dres, the bigger angle it subtends, so the easier it is to hit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T14:34:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you just ran into that bug when KSP doesn\u0027t see you\u0027ll intercept the SOI even though you will.
