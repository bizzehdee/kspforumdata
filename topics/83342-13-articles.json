You would have already waited the full time for the roll-out. This more highlights the recovery system in general, and whether or not it would be possible to make recovery take time rather than being instant. If possible it would make sense within KCT for a recovery half-way around the world to take longer than pushing it off the pad or runway, which should be relatively quick.

It will likely be that way initially since the way I\u0027m putting vessels on the pad now is identical to pressing the launch button in the editor in a stock game (start a new flight driver with a new launch from a file). I can take a look at which InputLocks are available since I\u0027m pretty sure I can make it so you can\u0027t recover a vessel. Put that lock on until you actually launch it and provide a way to roll the vessel back into storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait a sec. Recovering the vessel won\u0027t put it into storage how things are configured now, you\u0027d have to rebuild it. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s actually a problem here. This does imply that I should finally get the stuff set up so you can recover into storage directly. If you do that from the launchpad you have to pay the rollout time in reverse (but after 10-25% or so you can start rolling out a new vessel) and from anywhere else on Kerbin I can likely make it take time as well (based on distance and mass, maybe some other factors like the VAB rates. Should be LONGER than rollout for a comparable vessel [since those are on equipment designed for moving them], implying rollout times will be correlated to recovery times).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeffreyCor, thank you for taking a look at that.

I spent a little while fiddling with different designs and finally realized that there is no way I can build a lander that can get there in time and has enough crew capacity to save these guys because my kerbals don\u0027t have enough experience using the parts and I don\u0027t have any in stock. So looking at the part inventory I was like ok I have all the parts I need for one of my really old lander designs, just a Mk1 capsule some fuel an engine and a bunch of science equipment. Now how can I use this since it can only carry one Kerbal, and my RT comms network isn\u0027t robust enough for me to feel comfortable to try landing it with a probe? So I striped off all the science gear and strapped a couple of cans of LS supplies to the sides and two KAS pipe endpoints, added a good booster and transfer stage and I was sitting at just over two days and five hours of build time, leaving me just over a day to get it in orbit and sent to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up touching down almost on top of them with the engine running on fumes. I kept the fuel as low as possible in order to facilitate faster build times, with just barely enough dV to get there and land. But I forgot they were crashed right up next to the north pole so I didn\u0027t adjust my transfer trajectory to put them on a polar orbit when they got there, and I had barley left enough of a margin with fuel so that if i had trouble with the landing I would be able to fly around a bit. Luckily when I entered Mun SOI it was lined up perfectly that I was able to burn to execute my inclination change and move my impact point right on top of them without having to actually enter a capture orbit or anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now Jeb, Bob and Bill are sitting there with a KAS pipe sending life support supplies over to Jeb and Bobs ship and they have enough to last them 150 days or so, plenty of time to build a suitable lander to bring the three of them back home.
