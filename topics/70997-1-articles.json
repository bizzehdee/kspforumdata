The math can get crazy, and I forgot most of it years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, depending what you\u0027re attempting, you could go much simpler. If you\u0027re trying to do an autopilot type thing in space, when there are no other forces acting on your ship, you could just figure out where you\u0027re pointing, where you want to point, and the path you will trace out trying to get to where you want to point. Then, using that traced path, find two points on that path equidistant from the halfway point (like the 25% way there and 75% way there points). Then you can just torque towards the end position until you past the 25% point, stop torquing until you hit the 75% point, then start torquing in the reverse direction until you hit your target position. If you\u0027re not doing anything else while doing this rotation (like pumping, burning, or jettisoning fuel) this works surprisingly well for how simple it is, since you\u0027ll spend the same amount of time accelerating and decelerating your angular momentum\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xty","CreatedById":94977,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T01:04:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I was hoping to do was figure out the angular acceleration a ship can achieve and use that know when to decelerate the ships rotation.
