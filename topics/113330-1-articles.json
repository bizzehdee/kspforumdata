Combine that with Kepler\u0027s [second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion) and the shape of the orbit determined from the other orbital elements and you can figure out how the system will evolve with time. The Mean Anomaly at Epoch gives you a reference point to calculate that evolution from. \n\nAdmittedly, this is rather hand-wavy but I can sort of see how you could calculate positions given the above information.

You\u0027d need the mass of the body too to calculate the *force*, but as peadar1987 pointed out what matters to determine the motion is the *acceleration* (the force is just an intermediate calculation, if you will, to obtain the acceleration), and gravitational acceleration is independent of the mass of the body.\n\nSo you could say that the orbital elements contain in themselves the information that determines the acceleration of the body at any point in time (since all you need is know where it is relative to the other body). This is not an accident: the elements were actually *derived* using the fact that we can compute the acceleration just by knowing the position of a body.\n\nAlso note that if you already know the six orbital elements, you don\u0027t need to compute the force or the acceleration anymore to make predictions! The orbital elements are *already* a solution to the equations that dictate how a body moves knowing its acceleration.

In that case you would not need to explicitly calculate the gravitational forces for all times. This is only true for two-body motion, and I believe the restricted three-body problem (all objects moving in circular orbits among other restrictions), but is not true for n-body systems because of the perturbations caused by all the bodies in the system.\n\nFor a true n-body system, such as the Solar System, knowing the orbital elements at a given time will not allow you to know the exact position of the orbiting body at any given time, *t* because of the other bodies in the system, which the orbiting body itself will affect, which in turn will change the affect that the other bodies have upon the body in question. So, if you have a two-body system, or a restricted three-body system, knowing the orbital elements at a given time will allow you to know the position of all bodies at any time *t*, but if you have three bodies in elliptical orbits or more than three bodies we cannot analytically solve that system, so it must be simulated and cannot be run in reverse (to my knowledge).\n\nKSP\u0027s system is a simplification where everything is simplified to two-body problems, which is what allows for an at least simpler time-warp system.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T18:00:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 06:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T18:02:30Z","Content":"If you don\u0027t mind spoilers, TC, the bottom of [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keplers_laws_of_planetary_motion) page includes a derivation of orbital position as a function of time, starting from Kepler\u0027s laws."},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T18:03:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...

Is that what physicists call it or where did you get it from\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BF"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T21:14:25Z","Content":"The six orbital elements, the three kepler\u0027s law, can be derrived out of :\n\n- Acceleration at any point\n\n- (Conservation of) Angular momentum\n\n- (Conservation of) Orbital energy\n\nThat\u0027s why it\u0027s precise already, assuming a limited two-body problem. The derrivation is really long (like, truly, really long), needs a hell of vector and vector calculus. I\u0027ll not post it here of course.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T21:38:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 09:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YNM**"}]}
