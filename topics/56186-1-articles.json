Imagine it like this -- in order to correctly simulate any kind of dust, you need the program to keep track of pretty much every particle. You can group them, to a point, I guess, but the particles in something like dust will be so numerous that simply the act of displacing enough particles to leave noticeable tracks could easily bring the best computers to their knees if they have to keep track of the particles and perform physics operations on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can fake it to an extent, of course, but that too has its issues. If you try to paste sprites on terrain, either they won\u0027t match the terrain or they\u0027ll be stretched in extremely weird ways. Other options are available, each with their own flaws. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from all that, the next question is how do you save it? If it\u0027s a proper particle simulation, suddenly you need to save the positions of potentially millions of particles. If it\u0027s a sprite, you need to precisely save the orientation and rotation of the sprite on the terrain... and as can happen, if the game loads the terrain later only to find that it\u0027s slightly out of place (occasionally some floating-point errors may mean the game cannot perfectly put the terrain exactly where it was), or around the poles of planets, the terrain could easily change drastically when reloaded (in current implementation, the terrain around the poles is glitchy as all hell since they have to map a square-shaped heightmap all the way around a sphere. Try wrapping a piece of paper around a sphere without wrinkling it or overlapping it... never really works very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, regardless of how you do it, if you have enough \u0022tracks\u0022 to be saved, it\u0027s going to end up bloating the size of your KSP installation immensely; obviously, if you spend an awful lot of time trekking about or roving around, it\u0027s going to take massive amounts of space to save all the tracks that result from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, it \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E be done... it\u0027s simply a matter of finding a way of doing it that works well enough to make the feature worthwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Charzy","CreatedById":440,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T10:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re thinking too inside the box.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tracks could simply be an overlay, the friction could simply be added friction.
