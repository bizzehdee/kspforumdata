The Taurus SDHI expansion is just a scaled up SDHI. The SDHI is a stockalike very scaled down version of the Orion MPCV. The SDHI is a 2.5m service module, the Taurus is a 3.5m service module.

Some of the older models I did in Sketchup have fairly large poly counts for their size and complexity. Such as one of the early Trusses has a poly count of 5,469.
