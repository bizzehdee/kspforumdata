Only reason behind this is performance, ability to use more mods.\n\nCurrently I run the game with 108 mods installed, RSS with 8k textures, textures full rez in the options, a special version of EVE \u002B AVP. \n\nGame takes between 12-16gb of ram depending on what I\u0027m doing, but at least 8gb just loading to the menu.\n\nI normally don\u0027t close the game, I just tab out and do other things, mainly cos it takes so long to load, over 40k patches from MM.\n\nRock-stable. Not a flinch.\n\nGot two friends of mine hooked into the game, and after a few dozen hours playing the original, they wanted to get into using mods and I helped them get the x64 version running.\n\nThey\u0027ve got no issues with it.\n\nI\u0027ve spoken to many members of the community and I\u0027m still unable to find a single person that told me \u0022Yeah, x64 is too unstable for me, can\u0027t get it to work.\u0022 All I hear is praising.\n\nI\u0027m not trying to start a war here, and I know some people (specially modders) are very sensitive to the subject, to the point where I\u0027m sure some of you reading this already have your blood boiling over, even just the title of this thread.\n\nBut in an amicable manner, being polite with each other here, could you guys please explain to me, and to a **lot** of other folks who I\u0027m sure are wondering the same thing: why the hate?\n\nI\u0027d like to believe that all of us, users of x64 version, have the brains to know not to ask or demand support for the experimental version of the game.\n\nWhy can\u0027t mods be released without tools to stop it from working on x64 versions? \n\nWhy can\u0027t you guys just say in big bold red letters: please don\u0027t ask support for x64 versions?\n\nWhy the hate?\n\nSo many wonderful mods out there, it\u0027s really a shame to be limited to only a few of them. We all have plenty of ram, we all have 64 bit processors and it\u0027s damn time to start taking advantage over it.\n\nYou guys who criticize the use of x64 workarounds so much should try having a separate install of the x64 and playing it for your own sake, I\u0027m sure you\u0027d be surprised.\n\nIf everybody was playing it, if all mods were build without disabling themselves in x64, I\u0027m sure the push for an \u0022official\u0022 x64 version of the game would be greater and speed up the process from the devs.\n\nSo, again, without throwing the wrenches, express your opinion.\n\nThank you!\n\n*(p.s. Moderators, please let this run for a little while, I\u0027m hoping people will be able to talk peacefully.

Now that it is a much more technical hack, the people running x64 are much more likely to have stable systems and know what they are doing. This is also where the support issues come in.

(anti 64bit)\n\nFrom this perspective 64bit is not stable no matter how many people claim to the contrary. In fact a closer analysis of the data shows that many people do in fact have issues with certain mods that never worked well in win64bit. For example, people trying to run FAR with the win64 bit hack and the workaround are running code that hasn\u0027t been updated in a long time... I read this from a Ferram post. Basically mod authors are not updating for win64bit and the success you have with it is probably because you don\u0027t know enough to see whats going wrong.\n\nSecondly no matter how many warnings, disclaimers, and red-bold text messages say \u0022DO NOT BUG MOD AUTHORS ABOUT PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED ON A WIN64 PLATFORM\u0022, they doubtlessly get pestered. Who knows how many times they spent minutes or hours on a problem before it occured to them that the bug-filer is running win64... which would explain everything. It\u0027s a waste of time trying to fix bugs on a platform you don\u0027t support. And pretty disrepectful to be honest.\n\nThese guys put time, effort and love into their mods... and all they ask, really, is that we don\u0027t give them worthless bug reports on win64bit. And while I realize the smartest of us would never bother them with something they aren\u0027t going to fix anyways, its not hard to imagine that many people do. To quote a mod author,\n\n\u0022You\u0027re making our lives harder, son.\u0022\n\ntldr: if you use win64bit and never report problems with mods, you are fine.
