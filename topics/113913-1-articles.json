Unity 5 brings a lot of improvements, including better debugging tools for 64-bit Windows (which are essential for figuring out exactly what is causing troubles with Win64 KSP). So with the upcoming transition to U5 I\u0027m hopeful some progress will be made with the Win64 version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother point is that modders aren\u0027t against the \u003Cem\u003Eidea\u003C/em\u003E of a Win64 version; indeed, the ability to use more memory for more mods would relieve a lot of headaches and sources of crashes for modded installs. If a stable Win64 version emerged I think you might see support for Win32 versions start to evaporate (too many memory problems).
