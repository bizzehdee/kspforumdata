The only problem is that I just don\u0027t seem to get any of the satellite missions. I understand that I need to have unlocked solar panels which I have done (the first one\u0027s on the lower tech level) but cant see anything anywhere that says I need to have anything else unlocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStitch\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T21:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoll of the dice.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo a few of them mission in your mission control list (or fast forward a week) and satellite contracts should show up eventually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T23:18:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, satellite missions are also a privilege that you earn from having a high reputation. Which you earn by doing a handful of the stupid contracts. Your rep needs to be over 300, AFAIK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
