An example would be using LFO in a multi fuel engine (think KSPI/Lite) and then landing on another body and mining for a different fuel and filling the tank? Ideally this would be based on storage volume and fuel density.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T02:15:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot aware of one, sorry.

I wasn\u0027t aware of B9\u0027s functionality. EVA would be a cool feature. I\u0027ll dig into it. I know Modular fuel systems can somewhat do this in the vab/sph but not after launch. Seems there is room for someone to develop a plugin for this, as it could potentially save weight for vessels, though perhaps not all that realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"somewhatcasual","CreatedById":102043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T21:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edepends on the part and author setup.

This shouldn\u0027t pose a problem as long as it is not accidental. If one were fuel switching, it would be reasonable to expect a fuel supply to fully replace lost fuel. Below is an excerpt from the cfg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tip. I use firespitter already, so this will help keep dependencies down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E// If true, the user can switch resource types while playing. This will empty out the tank. Makes sense for converting a tank from LiquidFuel to Kethane after landing a mining base for instance. Default is off of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EavailableInFlight = false\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
