The first time it recovered two files, the second time it recovered one.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I\u0026#39;m trying to bring a 3-man pod back from Minmus, with a periapsis of around 30km. This is not the first time I\u0026#39;ve done this on this save, nor is it the steepest re-entry, but it IS the first time with the 2.5m parts. What I\u0026#39;ve noticed is that the heat seems to build up far more quickly than it should, and the heatshield isn\u0026#39;t ablating at all, resulting in the craft burning up. I have no idea why this just started now. I\u0026#39;m pretty sure it\u0026#39;s not related to mods, as I\u0026#39;ve had them installed since I started this save without incident.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nScreenshot:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/QPc57qI.png[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMods:\u003Cbr\u003E\nKER\u003Cbr\u003E\nKJR\u003Cbr\u003E\nKAC\u003Cbr\u003E\nPilot Assistant\u003Cbr\u003E\nStage Recovery\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T01:00:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 01:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dizzle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T03:19:57Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;m currently experiencing this in 1.0.4\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nbringing mission back from Mun, speeds are a lot higher than in stock because i am using the K2 re-scale, I have been watching the thermal debug info in the action menus, my heat shield is ablating but as I reenter I keep getting these occasional convective heat flux spikes, usually happens when command pod (Mk1-2) isn\u0026#39;t perfectly aligned with retrograde which is impossible to maintain. when these spikes happen the skin temp starts rising rapidly and the pod will explode leaving the heatshield to continue on it\u0026#39;s merry way.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI used hyper edit to bring the pod into a 71Km orbit and then reentered to see if that helped but it still happened although at a slower rate, trying to use hyper edit to simply land the craft results in an instant explosion, I have used this pod numerous times shuttling crew from my space stations and have never had a problem, suspect something is bugged with the vessel in the save but don\u0026#39;t know how to fix it :(\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have even turned off convection and turned the sliders way down in the debug menu in the hopes of at lest recovering the crew but still it overheats :confused: I am using DRE but all the stock settings are still what controls the heating\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T21:43:59Z","Content":"\nJust tried it without mods, still happens.\n"}]}
