I have to put on hundreds of air in takes to use the small amount of air it can to get high altitude flight on jets. this is very wasteful(although kind of aesthetically pleasing) and could by bypassed if I could force more air into the existing intakes...

A bit complicated at first sight, but easy once you figure out how it works. To sum it up: the more intake area you have for a jet, the higher it will be able to fly until it flames out. In case of several engines, the placement order defines which intake feeds air to which engine primarily. Excess air fuels the next engine each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake build aid saves you the hassle of building the intakes and engines in the optimal order.
