Currently it\u0027s in play for the Skyrim workshop, but there\u0027s no reason to believe other publishers and developers won\u0027t be quick to jump on the bandwagon. It\u0027s also having as big a backlash as one might expect of such and has stirred up a massive debate about both the feasibility and, for lack of a better term, \u003Cem\u003Eethics\u003C/em\u003E of the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering there\u0027s been plenty of discussion about whether or not KSP could someday get its own Steam workshop, I think this merits a question put towards Squad with a request for a very clear answer: \u003Cem\u003Ein the event\u003C/em\u003E that Kerbal Space Program does gain Steam workshop functionality, and that as of such time publishers and developers have the option of allowing users to charge for access to their workshop items, would you allow such monetization of the Kerbal Space Program workshop? Yes or No?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you answer \u0022Yes\u0022 to the previous question, then please answer the following question: what percent, out of 100% total, would you delegate to the user as their cut of the item\u0027s sale? For reference, Bethesda is giving workshop uploaders 25% of all workshop item sales.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vfernandez84","CreatedById":107377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T22:45:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP modders earning money from their mods?
