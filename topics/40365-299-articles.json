The logic is amazing.\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is there is very little difference between RT\u0027s implimentation and KSPI\u0027s from a gameplay perspective. Both require puting infrustructure out there to work. Both end up with the automagic ability to have the transmiters point in the right direction (once configured properly in RT\u0027s case) The only difference is KSPI simplifies the step of haveing to configure each network node exactly right in favor of requireing that you have your reciever pointing in a somewhat logical direction for what its doing. RT on the other hand requires more upfront busywork but ends up working automagicly on both ends even if you\u0027ve got your ships orientation set in a way that it makes no logical sense that the reciever could pick up jack from ground control being physicaly pointed 180 away from its uplink with the ship in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want that extra lay of busy work to \u0022Point\u0022 your network at a specific reciever each time you cange ships you can always load up a command pod on the launch pad and push a few random buttons in IVA to RP mission control directing the network. Additionaly you can shut off the active systems on any craft that is being powered by beamed power when your done with it to simulate it no longer recieving power. Its not required but it works out of the box with no tweeks needed. Personaly I think I\u0027d just get anoyed with such a self imposed limitation and abandon it after 1 play session but to each their own.

That being said, my opinion is only that there is a growing tendency for the answer to any incompatibility or problem is \u0022edit the config file yourself\u0022. I don\u0027t think that is a healthy path to take in the long term. Since there are several mods that are extremely popular, I only feel that it would be better for the community (which unlike this forum is largely comprised of people who are not comfortable editing config files) if there was some built-in compatibility. That\u0027s only if the mod developer cares about that mind you. And if the mod developer chooses they can always let the community do the work and include compatibility configs that users create. I only think that this would help; I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s a requirement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, I\u0027m using Skyrim as a kind of optimum. You download a mod, install it, and go play. I understand and appreciate the hard work of mod developers and I think that the best way to get your mod being used by a lot of people is to make it easy to use.

I have a large transmission station in LKO which can have up to 12 3.75m reactor/generator combos plugged into it via ports at any one time, all of which have arrived at different times. When I\u0027m trying to reprocess the fuels from Fission plants using the inline refinery what I think it\u0027s doing is processing until one has been refueled at which point it seems to stop. This may only effect time warping as I was able to refill a couple of the less degraded ones in real time last night. Sorry, I know this is more than a bit vague but it\u0027s quite hard to understand what it\u0027s doing - will try and test further later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I deployed a station is low Kerbol (sun) orbit yesterday. It is primarily just a large bank of gigantor solar arrays which that low to the surface actually provide a decent amount of energy each for any interplanetary missions blocked from Kerbin. It does have a generator and reactor but I designed them to be switched off most of the time and only come on when it needs to move itself. The problem is when they are off and I\u0027m transmitting energy it doesn\u0027t give the DC Systems priority and actually drains all the Electric Charge, rendering the station uncontrollable. Same if the generator is left on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a parts request: I\u0027d love to see a small radial single solar-panel like microwave receiver (probably a bit larger but nice and low profile). I would guess the penalty for such a convenient part would be a very poor surface area and thus range, below even the Small Receiver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, many thanks for all the hard work on the mod - having played a year of vanilla KSP I was beginning to run out of ideas and Interstellar has really revitalized it for me!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T09:10:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mdapol\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mdapol\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI agree that if someone wants to customize a mod they can and should learn to do it themselves. That being said, my opinion is only that there is a growing tendency for the answer to any incompatibility or problem is \u0022edit the config file yourself\u0022. I don\u0027t think that is a healthy path to take in the long term. Since there are several mods that are extremely popular, I only feel that it would be better for the community (which unlike this forum is largely comprised of people who are not comfortable editing config files) if there was some built-in compatibility. That\u0027s only if the mod developer cares about that mind you. And if the mod developer chooses they can always let the community do the work and include compatibility configs that users create. I only think that this would help; I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s a requirement. \u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly you basically just described module manager. The comunity can make up MM configs that tweek parts and can fix some issues where a conflict between 2 mods can be fixed just by editing configs. This can also alow for \u0022Hard mode\u0022 or \u0022Easy mode\u0022 settings and the comunity at large is free to release these tweeks. I do see this as a better option than haveing the author do it himself as there is no way 1 person can cater to the collective whims of a large community and even the attempt would grind progress to a halt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever not everything can be fixed just by config edits. I highly suspect the methods that KSPI uses for power transmission and the ones that RT uses for data transmission while similar in effect are quite different at a code level. Different programers will often find different solutions to the same problem. Variables used will be different method calls and returns will not line up, and this results in direct copy/paste not being a good option to swap from one version to the other. Even if the code was close enough chances are RT might not have the method that calculates power loss over distance and so there could still be major things breaking. Unless the authors specificly colaberated to have the ability to swap the systems out its just not something that can be done quick and easily short of another programer decompiling the DLL and rewriting it to do what you wanted. And then you\u0027d have all sorts of issues with version controll and users haveing stuff break because they downloaded version 10.3 of the mod but have 10.2 of the comunity DLL. Some things just are impractical and fall back into the catagory of find someone to do it for you (pay or not) or do it yourself because the authors cant cover every combination. The only other option is to just accept things the way they are even if you prefer X over Y.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd most of the popular mods work OK togeather out of the box. Their authors know what they are doing and avoid issues that actively interfear with anythign but specific parts that they intend to modify (AKA kspi and solar pannles) You still get some weird and very bad conflicts such as that guy with the borked command pod over the last few days. I suspect the author of that mod did something weird that resulted in an edge case interaction. Possibly combining too many part modules into a single part and tweeking thingss very specificly to make it work that then get broken when module mannager tweeks solar pannles for KSPI. gota love the pitfalls of wild card searches. Unfortunatly a single author cant be expected to be able to account for every bizzar and off the wall way some other author will write his code and you get unavoidable conflicts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DailyFrankPeter","CreatedById":101850,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T10:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022localSol\u0022 data-cite=\u0022localSol\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI sent you a PM yesterday about the textures, FractalUK.
