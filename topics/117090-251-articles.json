The hydrolox version even needed a completely redesigned fuel pump to accommodate LH2 fuel\n\u003E \n\nYeah, I know it was not the same engine running different fuels, they were variants of the same basic design, though. From the standpoint of KSP, it might well be possible to get away with a single model, however. I\u0027ve only ever seen one (very poor) image of the LR-87 LH2, so it\u0027s hard to compare.\n\nUnrelated to that (OK, somewhat related because of LR-87), I moved my much trimmed piece of the TRAILS mod into 1.3 to mess with Gemini stuff in SSTU. That mod comes with a SM, which I really need to convert to a SSTU SM, but in the meantime I was experimenting with SSTU parts to make such a part, which got me wondering...\n\nIs it possible to have a top and bottom diameter for the SSTU decoupler? I could see a use for a part that follows the slope of a capsule part. The MUS stages accomplish this via the fairing, which can then match the size of the capsule above, creating a nice line. With a part like the mk1 pod, however, the decoupler results in a visual break as the pod slope then ends in the cylinder, then perhaps a sloped adapter, etc.\n\nOn a related note, we have the conic side booster tank for R7, and the regular MFT tanks... a frustum of a cone tank might also be interesting. Note that I am thinking about it as a service module, so generic SM parts might simply be a frustum of a cone, where the player can chose to make the top and bottom diameters the same. The only issue might be textures, I suppose. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-11T18:31:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2017 06:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Dry","CreatedById":163177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-11T17:32:36Z","Content":"Something about CLS:\n\n    PartLoader: Compiling Part \u0027SSTU/Parts/ShipCore/Series-E/SC-E-DAX/SSTU-SC-E-DAX\u0027\n     \n    (Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/generated/common/runtime/UnityEngineDebugBindings.gen.cpp Line: 42)\n    \n    Module ModuleDockingHatch threw during OnLoad: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\n      at ConnectedLivingSpace.ModuleDockingHatch.IsRelatedDockingNode (.ModuleDockingNode dockNode) [0x00000] in :0 \n      at ConnectedLivingSpace.ModuleDockingHatch.CheckModuleDockingNode () [0x00000] in :0 \n      at ConnectedLivingSpace.ModuleDockingHatch.isInDockedState () [0x00000] in :0 \n      at ConnectedLivingSpace.ModuleDockingHatch.OnLoad (.ConfigNode node) [0x00000] in :0 \n      at PartModule.Load (.ConfigNode node) [0x00000] in :0 \n     \n    (Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/generated/common/runtime/UnityEngineDebugBindings.gen.cpp Line: 42)\n\nFull log:  \n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/0suk7hp1u2c2rnm/2017-06-11-2 KSP.log.zip?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0suk7hp1u2c2rnm/2017-06-11-2%20KSP.log.zip?dl=1)"},{"CreatedByName":"Krux","CreatedById":133026,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-11T19:01:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2017-6-10 at 4:51 PM, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Started a new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E career in 1.3.0 and made some nice looking science vessels along my progression.

This is important for space applications as the surface area is a major contributor to structural needs / skin mass.  They also have an inherently self-supporting structure, and follow ideal gas expansion/pressurization consistency across the skin (making them good for pressurized tanks, or for withstanding external pressure).\n\nHowever they are not the most efficient use of -space- given existing rocket designs; which is why we have cylindrical tanks with domed end-caps.  I think it was the N1 that used spherical tanks with conical/cylindrical shrouds on them, which ended up with a worse mass-fraction because of it (lots of extra fairing/structural panels with empty space inside).  Not as much of a concern for orbital/vacuum use, as I think those shrouds were mostly for aerodynamics during the launch; in space it might be a simple external truss structure, where you could take advantage of many of the pros of the spherical tanks.\n\nBasically, they can be better from a mass-fraction perspective, but worse from a utilization of space perspective.  As with most things rocket related, it is all about the tradeoffs and situational uses that would make one more desirable than the other for any given use.\n\n![38013f.jpg](http://www.ninfinger.org/karld/My%20Space%20Museum/38013f.jpg)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Temeter said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [...]if that\u0027s actually viable...
