I figure this is fair--it\u0027s basically infinite fuel, which is crazy. But with a tech name called \u0022unified field theory\u0022, you\u0027d damn well better be okay with crazy, ha. I made this config while testing my own mod--I was using the engines from this mod, noticed it didn\u0027t have a CTT config, noticed that it filled the *exact niche* my mod was holding (I only made an antigrav part for putting in the \u0022unified field theory\u0022 node in the first place), so I just sorta stopped working on it and went to make this.\n\nAnyway, yeah, I like this mod.

I\u0027m totally ok with that.\n\nBut the fact that many engines need it too and most importantly the fact that you cannot store it in a central fuel container makes it unneccessarily complicated, because you have to keep track on how much blutonium there is on each individual part.\n\nAs i said i\u0027m not against complex game mechanics, but it shouldn\u0027t make game play cumbersome or confusing.\n\nI would have preferred that there was a more clearer chain of resource usage for all engines.

Blutonium\u0027s an interesting concept, but I feel like it\u0027s a little, overcomplicated right now.\n\nI spent about ten minutes just now scouring the tech tree to see if I could find anything that would let me store the stuff, so I could actually start using some of the blutonium reactors and the like I\u0027ve started unlocking. Ended up having to Google it, because I was wondering if something was broke on my game. It\u0027s not at all clear that what you get in the initial tank is all you can store, and I don\u0027t really understand why that\u0027s the case, especially since you can refuel - if they were intended as fire-and-forget then that\u0027d make sense, but.\n\nI like it conceptually, but I feel like you could have made things a lot easier by just doing what\u0027s been suggested above, bundling in that Community Resource pack that was mentioned and tying your engines and reactors to Uraninite. Boom. Refueling anywhere but on Kerbin requires mining or refining operations, stations get set up for supplying nuclear powered ships, and if someone wants to stock up for a long trip, they can, \u0027cause there\u0027s containers for extra reactor fuel.\n\nOr if you don\u0027t want that, then remove the ability to refuel and just make them fire-and-forget and balance around that. As it is, the Manhattan reactor just seems pointless to me - 8k funds for less than 90 minutes of power generation just seems useless to me. Sure, it\u0027s high-throughput, but I can\u0027t think of a use-case for a reactor that can pull down 52ec/s for an hour and then it\u0027s functionally dead weight. If it did 1ec/s for 52 hours it\u0027d be a lot more useful, and I might actually consider using it."},{"CreatedByName":"Carbonjvd","CreatedById":137685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-02T08:39:08Z","Content":"Well this one was a fun one to do... the hopefully revitalizing update to fix Blutonium! Woah!! The two biggest changes of this update is the addition of three radial Blutonium fuel tanks and the roll-back of most of the Blutonium using parts. The radial Blutonium tanks are fairly large, so they can greatly extend the life of the reactors and other Blutonium parts. Nuclear jets now only use Compressed Atmosphere and Liquid Fuel, so its much simpler and doesn\u0027t use Blutonium anymore. Reactors, Zubrin engines, and Nuke \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E are the only three parts still using Blutonium, and the Nuke \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E still doesn\u0027t hold local Blutonium.\n\nIn addition to the Blutonium roll-back, the reactors are now much more efficient, last far longer at high capacity. Besides a handful of parts tweaks, two new parts were also included: Passive Intakes that function to provide large amounts of compressed atmosphere for nuclear jets, and a Huge Docking Port that fills the 3.75 meter niche.\n\nReally hoping this updates has fixed and properly balanced the mistakes of the previous updates.

I\u0027ll just copy and paste what I wrote on the dev thread.*\n\nFirst off, I love this mod, and I don\u0027t know how I ever lived without it before. Hats off to ya!\n\n   I\u0027d to make a suggestion to change the magnetic \u0022Arcturus\u0022 engine and its 3.75m variant(forgot the name), into a hybrid engine that uses electric charge, magnetic charge, and liquid fuel. While in it\u0027s liquid fuel hybrid mode, the engine should consume magnetic charge at the same rate at which it can be recharged, or allow for a part to transfer magnetic charge into the engine. I don\u0027t like the idea of having unlimited fuel, assuming you have the parts for generating virtual particles and magnetic charge, and I think there is a better way to balance it, instead of setting it so you can only use it for a few seconds before it has to recharge. You can leave that mode \n\nThis engine looks way too cool to only be used for niche purposes. I\u0027d like to see this engine see more uses through adding versatility or a completely new magnetic engine altogether(using the same model, and textures though).\n\n     - For balancing and so the engine doesn\u0027t feel like cheating, I would suggest making the \u0022Arcturus\u0022 engine and its 3.75m variant (again forgot the name) have an ASL of 800-1000(or close to the Ra engine) and roughly 5500 isp in a vacuum, wherever in liquid fuel hybrid mode.\n\n     - Also for balancing while in hybrid mode, I think the Arcturus should have a bit more thrust than it currently has, but its 3.75m variant should have a lot less thrust.\n\n   I love the way the Arcturus engine looks, it looks so great as my \u003Cabbr style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted;\u0022 title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s main engines, but I never use this engine because it runs out of magnetic charge way to fast, and can\u0027t be replenished by other parts. I think it is too niche, and can be made into a more versatile and balanced engine. I can\u0027t remember right now(i\u0027m at work) but I don\u0027t think it has sound, like most engines from this mod. If someone could give me a quick crash course on how to add sound, and knows some good sounds to go with these engines, I\u0027ll do that too! I\u0027m a little obsessed with building my \u003Cabbr style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted;\u0022 title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E right now, and I think these changes would make this engine a great\u003Cabbr style=\u0022border-bottom:1px dotted;\u0022 title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E engine.\n\n   I know how to edit some XML stuff at a novice level(idk if it\u0027s an XML type thing or similar), so if you point me in the right direction and tell me a little what to do, I\u0027m sure I can make this change for you if you\u0027d like. Although I am pretty bad at balancing in games, so I would need someone to help me with the numbers.\n\n     A separate suggestion is to make a smaller/more compact variant of the magnetic drag array(awesome idea btw).

Tweaking to fix some existing problems, working KSP v1.2 compatibility. Also have been working on CTT integration as of this week, but without CTT updated to KSP v1.2, its not of much use.\n\nTook a look at the forums for more issues, the Indominus Plasma Engine now has sound and reworked particles (still being worked on). The total rebuild of the Attero and Acturus engines seems a bit overboard, but I\u0027m willing to make them more practical within their current functionality. Magnetic charge stays the same cause I like some semblence of accuracy.\n\nWith the KSP v1.2 update came some new mechanics I\u0027m working on adding in too, so be looking forward to upgradeable engines!
