Much of that is behind-the-scenes stuff, but I expect some things to be different. \n\n- Wheels re-coded from scratch. Landing gear shares the same code-base. Any unusual designs exploiting quirks may not work exactly the same.\n- Asteroids re-coded from scratch. Size class A will still be size class A, but because surfaces are procedurally generated, it\u0027s possible that a save with claws attached to an asteroid, may show those claw attachments floating a little over or under terrain. Here\u0027s an example of what happens when loading an old save, [after they re-sized the standard reaction wheel](http://i.imgur.com/x1nFdfH.jpg). (That craft actually flies, and the reaction wheels work.)\n- The \u0022Tier 0\u0022 structures, that everyone calls \u0022The Barn\u0022 - and held back from two previous updates to re-work it, ought to be ready.\n- New skills for engineers (dV readout) and possibly something new for scientists.\n- Entirely new UI. I expect most of the controls to be in the same places, but they may look a bit different. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Before the applauncher was anchored in the top-right corner of the screen and the apps were laid out to the left. Now the plan is to lay the apps out downwards so they will take up the right hand of the screen.
