I\u0027ll admit i was one of those people who was like \u0022what the hell is this?\u0022 \u0022QA approved this?\u0022 when i first tried the game. Reading things nate said that \u0022productivity was suffering because the devs are busy playing the game\u0022. And i think to myself...all these people playing the game before release and nobody noticed this bug or that bug? I noticed it right off the batt. How can they NOT know? Basic stuff like reentry and all the other bugs makes people think \u0022i paid $69 for this?\u0022 THATS where alot of it is coming from. It is hard to wrap your head around how can they release a game in this condition AND for this price? So if you could talk about that, that is what people like me wants to know. Who pulled the trigger on that decision to release and in this condition? Its not even a matter of who...but WHY? I understand \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E and all that but if you could answer that question I think it would prolly calm the negativity down a bit and offer a little more InSite into how this process is going to work going forward.\u00A0 if we just knew why then we could all move on. But see this is the problem.....I see stuff like AMA (ask me anything) but then i see its not really ask me anything its ask me about the pre-screened, pre-approved, questions the team approve of and not the questions everybody want to know. They go around all that. We see things like you guys have to have \u0022media training\u0022 before you can answer questions or deal with the public and then turn around and praise yourselves on how transparent the team is and in the meantime the forum and steam are blowing up with negativity about the game. So what do we see next? Here come the PR marketing guys to try to save the day and talk the game up with contests and stuff nobody really cares about they just want their ksp to work. In this post/thread you were pretty straight up with us and i appreciate that yet the elephant in the room still exists. This is my way of giving what you guys asked for and thats constructive criticism.

One thing I\u0027d like to point out is that I tend not to submit bug reports anymore due to the amount of time it takes to get everything together. I feel like it would be an improvement to allow each user to create a profile of their machine once and then submit bugs below or in that thread so that we don\u0027t have to assemble all the same information every time. Additionally, I could just be ignorant but for me, I find it difficult to add screenshots since I have to upload them somewhere else and link them rather than just drag them in here. I know that\u0027s probably a harder problem as you\u0027d need more server space but just thought I\u0027d add my reasoning in here. Definitely interested in joining the team though!
