If you switch to the Mun sat, it\u0027s now the active vessel, so the connection drops. \u003Cp\u003EMy general design rule for RT sats is one of the longest useful antenna, and a minimum of 3 dishes. One dish is always a downlink toward KSC or whatever control station you are relying on. One dish is a *fixed* uplink toward either a remote exploration ship or to a remote local network. The 3rd dish is to active vessel, so whatever I\u0027m flying always benefits from a connection from literally every satellite in the solar system within range. For most permanent networks, I\u0027ll usually have 5 dishes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Downlink to Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Peer comm sat in same SOI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Other peer comm sat in same SOI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Ground base within SOI (Mun base, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Active vessel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) and 3) are for redundancy purposes. More than once I went to replace/upgrade a sat and broke my network because I forgot to switch targets on another sat and had to rendezvous with it to regain control. I always have 4) because even with sufficient antenna range, I\u0027ve had problems with networks bridging from omni to target in the past, so I only use omni for transit vessels and backup - and use a fixed connection for anything permanent. 5) is only useful for transit vessels and useless for maintaining the network itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be very useful and interesting is a \u0027lock on last active vessel\u0027 upgrade/option so that all non-focused sats connected to the active vessel (assuming they have active vessel selected and sufficient range - current behavior) and then \u003Cem\u003Emaintained that connection when you switch to them.\u003C/em\u003E If you then switch to another vessel, they\u0027d follow to that vessel. But it\u0027d allow you to repair a mis-configured network by walking the graph up from KSC configuring each satellite as you go. It would still preserve the existing active vessel functionality, and it would be doing nothing magical since it requires already being able to create that connection - we\u0027re just having it hold the connection over vessel change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the late reply - somehow I didn\u0027t get notification that there\u0027d been replies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I understand what my problem is.

Basically, a little dish like the DTS-M1 has a cone that covers Kerbin even from below synchronous orbit, but a bigger antenna has to be very far away before its cone covers all of Kerbin. For instance, the 88-88 has to be a 1.1 million kilometers away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also a big fan of activating the Root Range model. I just figured out that I can use a big dish in Kerbin synchronous orbit (2868.750 KM) to stay connected with an unmanned reentry vehicle that only has the tough little DP-10 for connectivity. Before this, I lost several unmanned vessels on reentry due to lack of coverage and lack of predictions for the flight computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Root Range and Cone Mode will help you keep your communications network from becoming overwhelming - especially in career mode when you don\u0027t yet have the longer range antennae available yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been using Additive, because that was what RSS used, and it made sense that more antennas equaled more range, even though I lowered it from a doubling rate.
