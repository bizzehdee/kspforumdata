After failing miserably for quite a long time, I decided to download a plane from pro-rocket-engineers, just to see what it takes to build a succesfull SSTO plane. Apart from design differences, the main thing I noticed is using of the above mentioned nacelles and engine pre-coolers, which I didn\u0027t use yet, just because I have no idea how they work or even what they are supposed to do \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E But since they have been on the downloaded plane, I suppose they are important in a way that I don\u0027t know, and that led me to the question - engine nacelles and pre-coolers - how do they work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emichal.don\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T16:03:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey both have a function a cooling the air entering the engine, cooler air, denser air, denser air, more kick out of your engine at higher altitudes.

That\u0027s pretty much it. The pre-cooler is ostensibly harder to heat up; myself, I\u0027ve seen little difference between the two parts in practical usage. I do fly FAR, in which the pre-cooler is ever so slightly better in terms of less added drag (in general).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T18:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jaeleth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jaeleth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey both have a function a cooling the air entering the engine, cooler air, denser air, denser air, more kick out of your engine at higher altitudes.
