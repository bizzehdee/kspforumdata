Try playing around with that until Shift/Control go up and down respectively.

If you just want to move in and out, use H \u0026amp; N.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShift and Control run the throttle. RCS doesn\u0027t have a throttle. You use it in bursts. Check your settings to see for sure what your docking thrusters are set to, but the default keys are as previously described.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIJKL for translation, H \u0026amp; N for in/out translation. Also, if you have a docking port (which it looks like) you can right click on it and select \u0022Control From Here.\u0022 That will change your navball orientation and might be more useful for docking operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to not use docking mode, but the \u0022normal\u0022 staging mode. Then rotation and translations will all work as we\u0027ve been describing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: And now I am thinking you want your ship to auto rotate with the camera like a kerbal does. Ships do not have that behavior like an EVA. You must manually rotate them around and sometimes your \u0022up/down\u0022 won\u0027t be aligned with the up/down view of your camera. In that case, you have to rotate the ship or rotate the camera to match and be less confusing. Or follow the navball. (There is no \u0022Space Bar\u0022 equivalent for a docking ship like there is for EVA.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-22T15:02:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2014 03:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T14:55:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ianr15\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ianr15\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem is: If I test t on the ground in docking mode, the RCS doesn\u0027t behave like I want it to behave.
