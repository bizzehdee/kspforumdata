I\u0027ve made three successful trips to the Mun now, and I\u0027m generating a ton of science. I see a lot of youtube videos of folks making probes and/or satellites which look like fun. My question is why? Besides being fun, are there any practical reasons for building them? Do they generate science that make it worthwhile?
