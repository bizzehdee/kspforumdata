It seems like with the current atmosphere model, breaking the sound barrier is the biggest hurdle in any ascent profile that\u0027s trying to get as much mass/deltaV per ton as possible on orbit. In a 3-hull Mk2 design with 4 RAPIERs plus a nuke, it\u0027s always been a long process for me to break the sound barrier and go into the silly thrust zone. I would have to climb to 14km on the RAPIERs at like 290 m/s,then nose down and engage the nuke, hoping that I could hit like 420 m/s and pull back up before getting below 10km. Very tedious and fuel-consuming. Adding one turbojet to the mix dramatically improved the efficiency with which I could get to that point by providing that extra little push at the transition. With 4 RAPIERS and 1 turbo, I was easily able to get a 42 ton craft to the 400\u002B m/s range on a constantly ascending profile. Keeping the RAPIER/Turbo ratio to 3 or 4 to 1 left enough thrust at the high end for me to get up to 12-1300 m/s surface at 24km with enough climb rate that I didn\u0027t burn off all my rocket deltaV getting up out of the soup. Unfortunately, there\u0027s no symmetrical way to place 3\u002B1\u002B1 or 4\u002B1\u002B1 engines, so I had to mount the turbo to an empty tank behind the nuke on a decoupler, then jettison it for the circularization burn. Obviously this is no longer technically a SSTO design, although dragging the turbo the rest of the way to orbit, if it were somehow possible, would still have left this ship with close to 4000 dV on orbit. I haven\u0027t taken this ship to the Mun and back yet, but I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ll make it when I try. Landing a big ship like that on just the nuke is pretty costly though. A previous version without the tacked-on Turbo could make Munar orbit and back, but just didn\u0027t have enough deltaV to land and get back off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T15:08:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 03:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T16:32:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022herbal space program\u0022 data-cite=\u0022herbal space program\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve been spending a lot of time fooling around with this in the last few day,...
