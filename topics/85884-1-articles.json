My model is using Squad textures like SXT but for now it\u0027s just using duplicate texures (exported as mu with textures).

On the Unity side, what I do for the docking shroud (since I\u0027m assuming you\u0027ve already animated it) is duplicate the shroud, child the duplicate to the original (so it\u0027ll still move as one). Then you can swap the meshes for the new ones without having to re-do the animation, for that you can do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImport the new model into Unity, click on the little arrow on the right handside of the model in the asset view and it should expand out to show you all the different meshes in the model file. You can then drag the relevant mesh file from there to where it says name (Mesh Filter) - mesh (E.g. if it\u0027s called Cylinder in blender, under the Transform module it\u0027ll say something like \u0027Cylinder (Mesh Filter)\u0027 with \u0027mesh Cylinder\u0027 underneath.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T23:05:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Lack and noonespecial!
