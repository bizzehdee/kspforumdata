The fuel cells have on and off but no toggle, while a number of other things, like opening and closing air intakes, have toggle but no on and off.\n\nA couple new ones:\n\n- Fix up ladder physics, so it obeys conservation of momentum, so you can timewarp with a kerbal on a ladder, etc.\n- Save crew assignments with vessels; it\u0027s irritating to have to manually place Bob in the cockpit of my science-gathering plane every time I launch it, etc.\n- Add a \u0027Derelict\u0027 or \u0027Defunct\u0027 vessel category for vessels which have reached the end of their mission (e.g. ground or orbital probes that have transmitted all the science they can and are not designed to return home; flyby probes that have finished their flyby and are headed off into nowhere; obsolete reusable exploration vessels which aren\u0027t capable of surviving reentry to be reclaimed) - useless, but still functional. Vessels would never be placed in the category automatically. This category, like Debris, would be hidden by default on the map, but unlike debris is never automatically deleted (in case you have ISEE-3/ICE moment and discover your \u0027defunct\u0027 vessel is useful again).\n- Another new category: Satellite, for vessels which remain active and functional, but require no further human interaction (e.g. ScanSat mapping satellites, RemoteTech comms relays)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T18:21:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 06:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by macdjord**"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T13:28:06Z","Content":"great list,\n\none thing that to bug me: better fuel transfer\n\n- ability to group container under a user group tag\n\n- ability to target thoose container group"},{"CreatedByName":"mdg583","CreatedById":126889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T16:57:06Z","Content":"Regarding career mode, it would be nice if there were some more options for custom difficulty when starting a career.

(This even works for SRBs, since you can just tweak them to 0 fuel so they don\u0027t go anywhere.) I propose changing it so that part test contracts never spawn for any of the KSC biomes, and that \u0027Kerbin - Landed\u0027 part tests require that you do them somewhere outside the KSC.\n- Every time I get a new science part, the first thing I do is always collect science from every KSC biome with it.

Either these experiments should have 0 science value, or they should be done automatically for you as soon as you unlock a new experiment.  \n\n    - In the later game, this applies to all of Kerbin. In the early game, getting science from the various biomes of Kerbin is a matter of repeatedly launching expensive, carefully targeted sounding rockets, or taking advantage of fortuitous reentry locations from space missions; later on its a matter of slapping the new instrument onto a plane and tediously flying to each biome before returning to the KSC (total cost: 200 Funds in fuel - and several hours playtime).\n    - Maybe tie it to the tech tree? Start of the game, you automatically get EVA Reports and, once you\u0027ve unlocked them, Surface Samples from all the KSC biomes. Once you unlock Aviation, this is expanded to Crew Reports and all science experiments you\u0027ve unlocked (because Aviation gives you wheels and an engine, so you can drive around the KSC trivially (rather than having to awkwardly roll around in a reaction wheel-powered pseudo-rover)).
