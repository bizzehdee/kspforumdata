I have been able to do it successfully using a 45 Degree angle from Kerbin. There is something that I have been wondering that I have not been able to find out yet though: How long in game time should it take to get to Duna? Both of my attempts took around 300 days to get to Duna, and for some reason I feel like this is much slower than others I have seen. Should I be able to get to Duna in a shorter amount of in game time?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T12:46:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice question. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most efficient flight (less fuel required) Kerbin-Duna takes 264 kerbin days, it is a interplanetary Hohmann transfer (elliptical orbit) done at the correct time (during a \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elaunch window\u003C/a\u003E\u0022).

I know no tool able to assist in performing that maneuver in KSP. But the same theory is used to compute the theoretical \u0022continuous-thrust transfer\u0022, that would instead be the fastest possible and is performed continuosly accelerating towards the destination for half the transfer, then continuosly decelerating until arrival. Time required is tied to the acceleration of the spaceship, T~ 2*SQRT(d/(2*a)). So, if you have a lot of acceleration, you could theoretically get to speedlight and then decelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore on interplanetary flights \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/interpl.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, in case the subject is of interest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T12:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E300 days is not an overly long Duna transfer.

It\u0027s pretty simple to understand, good easy interface and allows you many options as to when you want to leave, where you want to go, how many days you need...etc. You can basically buy Dv with days or the other way around....If that makes any sense. (It does to me but that doesn\u0027t say a lot). Basically, you should pack a few pair of underwear, some long pants and a good book...or three for the trip.
