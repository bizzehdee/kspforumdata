I read many help posts as well so thank you for the help so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m experiencing a strange behaviour of the orbit displayed (conics I believe ?) when I\u0027m changing from a body SOI to another. For example, assume I\u0027m orbiting the Mun (yay !) and I want to go back to Kerbin. I\u0027ll play with the manoeuver nodes until I get a nice Kerbin orbit after exiting the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll execute the manoeuver not too badly and then, right after I exit (end of the blue trajectory), the orbit will completely change and I don\u0027t understand why. But there\u0027s more. After a short time, the orbit will get back to what it was supposed to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone seen this before and could tell me what\u0027s happening ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t say if the problem also exist with other bodies as I\u0027m still at the very beginning.

behavior, the other a bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe normal thing is a large change in the direction of your blue path once you cross the boundary.\u00A0 This is due to the game changing the frame of reference from one body to another.\u00A0 This is why, in your 1st pic, your blue path is pointing back away from Mun while you\u0027re still in Mun\u0027s SOI, but once you cross into Kerbin\u0027s SOI your blue path is an ellipse pointed at Kerbin.\u00A0 A side effect of the change in frame of reference is that the position of the ship has to change slightly to fit the new coordinate system, which produces a slight jerk causing the G meter to spike and slightly altering your trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bug is that SOI boundaries are kinda \u0022fuzzy\u0022, especially when warping.\u00A0 The SOI itself is moving, tied to the body it\u0027s centered on, and so is your ship.\u00A0 When you\u0027re warping, your ship and the SOI don\u0027t move consistently.\u00A0 Your future path on the map assumes everything moving in synch but that\u0027s not what happens when you warp.\u00A0 Thus,\u00A0you can be going along thinking all is fine, no encounters with other bodies any time soon, and suddenly you\u0027re in a different SOI, because your ship and the nearby body got in different releative positions due to warping than shown by your future path.\u00A0 This can happen when going to other planets but is mostly an issue when maneuvering around large moons, especially if there are several of them close together like at Jool.\u00A0 Flying between Jool\u0027s moons can be very frustrating because of this but it also happens to a lesser extent at Kerbin/Mun and Duna/Ike.\u00A0 Basically, any time you have reasonably large SOIs in close proximity, expect this sort of weirdness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of this sort of weirdness isn\u0027t a bug per se but is\u00A0a side-effect of KSP using a 2-body gravity system, and you can compensate for it but not the \u0022fuzzy\u0022 SOIs due to warping.\u00A0 Still, working around the 2-body issue will minimize your frustrations.\u00A0 The 2-body issue goes like this:\u00A0 Suppose you\u0027re at Laythe (Jool\u0027s inner moon) and you want to Vall (the next one out).\u00A0 From a navigation POV, this is the same as going from Kerbin to Duna.\u00A0 So you wait until Laythe is coming up behind Vall and then burn more or less tangent to Laythe\u0027s orbit so you arc out to meet Vall on the other side of Jool.\u00A0 So, while you\u0027re still in Layth\u0027s SOI, you\u0027re going fast enough to have escape velocity and leave the SOI, meaning you\u0027re going faster than Laythe.\u00A0 But then you\u0027re in Jool\u0027s SOI.\u00A0 From Jool\u0027s POV, your now in a wider orbit than Laythe, which means you have to be going SLOWER than Laythe.\u00A0 And the further you arc out towards Valls, the slower you go.\u00A0 Thus, Laythe catches up with you from behind, and it\u0027s SOI is wide enough that if you haven\u0027t arced far enough outboard by then, you\u0027ll find yourself back in Laythe\u0027s SOI heading about 180^ from your previous course, despite having just left with escape velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo,, to avoid such things, you have to NOT use the most efficient trajectory.\u00A0 Instead of leaving the 1st body tangent to its orbit, you need to angle more towards the target body, so that you get far enough off the track of the 1st body that it\u0027s SOI will miss you as it catches you up.\u00A0 But OTOH, you can use this issue to your advantage sometimes.\u00A0 For instance, Kerbals can only get 2 stars going to Mun and Minmus, but ALMOST have 3.\u00A0 You can get that 3rd star prior to sending them to other planets by briefly putting them in solar orbit.\u00A0 The easiest way to do this is to burn tangent to Kerbin\u0027s orbit until you just BARELY leave it\u0027s SOI, then wait.\u00A0 Shortly after leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI, Kerbin will catch up with you and POOF, you\u0027re back in its SOI and can now land :).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BluK","CreatedById":156046,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T09:13:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022
