I made a fresh save, and headed for the Munhole. This is the munhole, a MASSIVE crater, about 1 km deep, with a monolith at the bottom, and it\u0027s not even the official Easter Egg documentation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PBdCHFo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PBdCHFo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[i know, debug toolbar. I\u0027m ashamed of it now, but this was about a year ago, and I was terrible at conserving EVA fuel back then. I was afraid for Jeb.]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI landed my lander at it\u0027s coordinates, and... it\u0027s gone. Compare these two images of the former and current terrain at the Munhole. The image on the right is the current terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ojRx7sB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ojRx7sB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait. Is it really gone? No. The terrain is an almost EXACT inversion of it\u0027s former hole, making a hill that is just a bit more \u0022stubby\u0022 than the original hole. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm. Something about this seems odd, as if Squad knew about the Munhole, and did this to it. Maybe they did this on purpose! I\u0027ve got more evidence, too. Remember that monolith at the bottom? It\u0027s still there, but not floating anymore. It was \u003Cem\u003Emoved\u003C/em\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mcoKRfC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mcoKRfC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis pretty much confirms that, unless it\u0027s some crazy anomaly in the Unity engine, it was probably Squad\u0027s doing. A hill is far less interesting than a crater (which some people intended to bridge) that gave numerous difficult challenges, and lacked some of the physics bugs of the Moholes on Moho. I\u0027m gonna be bold, though, and dub this hill Crusty\u0027s Lump (Crusty is a handle I use), since nobody else seems to have noticed this tragic change in an anomaly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, I think, for the sake of us, and other anomaly hunters, we need to push Squad to bring back the Munhole, and all of the great missions it brought us! I know it\u0027s not very well known of, but it\u0027s loss is sad nonetheless. It was a bit like a less difficult to find and traverse Mohole. Even though the monolith still stands, the Munhole is gone, and thus is another anomaly gone. If Squad was really behind it\u0027s disappearance, we really need to push to get it back. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-03T18:13:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2015 06:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YourEverydayWaffle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T18:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EObviously Krakaliens don\u0027t want you to discover their secret Mun base \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T18:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENoooo!
