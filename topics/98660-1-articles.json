Once, when I installed safety parachutes onto a plane and deployed them due to a problem with the plane, he decided they were too slow so he cut them and landed the plane himself. Even when Jebediah died in a catastrophe, he managed to deliver time and time again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, for some reason, though I could land planes and fly with other Kerbals, I could only really ever do the tough stuff when he was flying!

If I force myself into either using existing ones where I can, or make new, general ones where required, I also force myself into making plausable payloads. If they\u0027re too big, then they need to be assembled in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chrisb2e9","CreatedById":87224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T13:20:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI rename all of my kerbals to \u0022cannon fodder\u0022 and pretend that they are wearing red shirts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T13:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI too use some RP, for example Samden Kerman is dat guy who always get stranded....alone.
