Special bay doors or tunnels could hide access hatches and dispensers or launchers, while a long skirt around the engine could make the exhaust plume hard to spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ship designs have gotten more efficient since this one - the first one I was able to make work - but I haven\u0027t made any significant strides. (I was originally interested in electrochromic paneling to make the ship glow when it was against the milky way, but a polar orbit might make this less likely to be an issue.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas or exchange would be appreciated! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-07T05:06:14Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2013 05:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Decent Weasel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EImplementing Ojimak\u0026#039;s tutelage.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ojimak","CreatedById":57539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T05:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo imbed an album, type the five letter code at the end of the url between {imgur}{/imgur} brackets (except with [] instead of {}), so in your case, it would be {imgur}GNkoA{/imgur} (with [] instead), resulting in:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/GNkoA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
