Also sandstorms should be random and predictable with weather sats placed around a body. That would be way cooler than just triggering it with an atmospheric entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andem","CreatedById":155578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T19:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYaas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
