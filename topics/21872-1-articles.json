And the acceleration due to gravity on the moons like Bop and Gilly is so tiny that landing on them with your EVA pback and returning to orbit is extremely easy. Gilly has such low gravity that if it wasn\u0027t for the hills and buggy surface that just jumping is almost enough for orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
