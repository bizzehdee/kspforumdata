Even after removing this decoupler, the drag is the same, and doesn\u0027t allow the plane to go fast enough to fly. So can havinga different root part cause this? Or is it some other bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lt_Duckweed","CreatedById":201466,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-24T15:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only time I have seen the root part effect drag is when the root part is either a fairing or a cargo/payload bay.
