I installed that via CKAN, and the game stopped working.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I deleted the folder, reinstalled via Steam, copied that newly installed folder onto my Desktop, ran CKAN to install the essential mods, and........ bust! Any mod hosted by Kerbalstuff would not work, as no connection to the servers could be made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nManually installing mods that use different versions of the Module Manager is a nightmare, so I waited until today - Kerbalstuff servers look a little bit more responsive, but still... even when I pick only the mods RO/RP-0 depend upon, either CKAN crashes and closes, or tells me there was a problem downloading three random mods, fails the installation, and reverts back to the old status.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would so much love to put my lifetime into this game, but Stock is not an option, and with CKAN not working, and RO basically stating \u0022don\u0027t use any other method than CKAN\u0022, I\u0027m basically screwed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even if I magically find some kind of solution to play with these mods - isn\u0027t KSP 1.1 just around the corner? That\u0027ll mess things up badly, mod-wise..... oh dear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
