I\u0027m actually down to 1024x512 now, and even contemplating trying a 512x256 map, and then just using KSP\u0027s random terrain features to fill back in more sharp detail. (Plus it\u0027s much smaller than the 100MB 8k 16bit heightmap I had)\n\nAnother weird one, so even though everywhere I can find has ocean set to false, my atmospheric planet is still rendering an ocean, and tips for for what may be causing it? (at the moment I\u0027ve offset the heightmap to hide it, but that is rather hacky, not to mention drawing the ocean is one of the more intensive parts of planet rendering)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T02:44:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 02:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yargnit**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yargnit","CreatedById":57535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T08:49:36Z","Content":"So here\u0027s what I\u0027ve got so far:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

It takes some fiddling to get it right. If your game is running near the memory limit it may hang since exporting uses more memory. You say you don\u0027t have any other mods installed but do you have any other planet packs loaded in KT? If you\u0027re having trouble, try some memory reduction tricks like ATM or OpenGL.\n\nKopernicusTech\u0027s version of Kittopia was modified to be more compatible with Kopernicus, so I wouldn\u0027t blame Gravitasi by putting his mod\u0027s name there, especially since as far as I know, KCreator doesn\u0027t have any issues with it.
