This means that any amazing deals that might be had on amazon.com or bestbuy.com or anything else .com won\u0027t work for me. It has to be .ca. With the Canadian dollar being as weak as it is right now this means we have to pay more when buying stuff that comes from outside of Canada.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I\u0027m at a point where I\u0027m probably going to have to buy a laptop for school, and while I\u0027m at it I would really like to find something that can play KSP to some degree. My budget is (at the most) 500$. I don\u0027t mind turning the graphics down, keep the ships part-count low. Really I just want to be able to turn the game on and show it to my classmates. We\u0027re not allowed to install games on the school computers but I\u0027m sure there are plenty among them that would love to check it out. I checked on the wiki for minimum system requirements but it\u0027s not really... clear what it all means. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/System_Specs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/System_Specs\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGraphics: SM3 512MB VRAM\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the current contender that I\u0027m checking out. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.ca/Acer-Aspire-SW5-012-16AA-Detachable-Touchscreen/dp/B00NGK98GS/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.amazon.ca/Acer-Aspire-SW5-012-16AA-Detachable-Touchscreen/dp/B00NGK98GS/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand this is it\u0027s CPU/GPU. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ark.intel.com/products/80274/Intel-Atom-Processor-Z3735F-2M-Cache-up-to-1_83-GHz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ark.intel.com/products/80274/Intel-Atom-Processor-Z3735F-2M-Cache-up-to-1_83-GHz\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe GPU mentioned on that page doesn\u0027t say anything about SM3s or VRAM.

But... let\u0027s be honest it\u0027s not stellar. Limited to 32GBs of capacity, 10-inch screen is pretty small, only one USB port. It also says \u0022Windows 8.1 with Bing\u0022 which tells me this might be some kind of horrible \u0022Free OS with adverts!\u0022 deal... I would be really happy if someone had something similar if not better to offer. Anyone who\u0027s found they could run KSP on unusually affordable/low-speced laptops? And before anyone says \u0022Pfff... an atom? That\u0027ll never run anything.\u0022 There are people who claim to have gotten KSP to run on atoms before. I would just like more input on how... usable those cases were.
