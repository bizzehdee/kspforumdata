I feel that the SPP wing parts are essentially fine as is for true orbital space planes that generally aren\u0027t very jet fuel intensive and where the wings are more about providing heat resistance for reentry. I think there need to be a wider class of sub-orbital wing parts that are much lighter, but generally hold the majority of jet fuel (and lack heat shielding) -- and with that, engines should increase in size (and probably weight), with the effect that fuselages would generally not be practical to use for jet fuel. This would I think provide more realistic weight balances and design tradeoffs, and (perhaps more importantly) would mean that aircraft would pose a set of interesting design challenges that would be more distinct from those of rocket design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Overfloater","CreatedById":94031,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T19:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the Mk1-2 capsule\u0027s weight justifies its impact tolerance ._.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T23:17:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI miss Stock Rebalance Project :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"korvanos","CreatedById":126656,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T05:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy is the Mk2 Lander can so stupid heavy anyway.

Obviously this curve needs dialling back. My suggestion would be to pull the cutoff down to 2100m/s and make the curve as follows: 25% at 1700, 50% at 1300, 75% at 1000, and peaking at 800m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a random sidenote, I feel like the term \u0022Basic Jet\u0022 for the low alt jet makes it appear straight up inferior and that it should be renamed to \u0022Standard Jet Engine\u0022 or something of the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E48-7S:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe all know this needs to be beaten up, down, and sideways with the nerf bat.

I see no real way to rebalance it and I\u0027m also not a fan of the model. I vote in favor of scrapping it entirely.

I have found I constantly have TWR issues when using the LV45 as a second stage (not upper, this is on a 3-stage LV) The TWR increase of the LV30 also is too minor to make it worth use over the 45 in many many cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion 1: reduce mass of the LV45 and LV909 by 0.25 tons (this also gives the 909 a higher TWR than a 48-7S equivalent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion 2: increase LV45 thrust to 250 and increase LV30 thrust to a whopping 375. The LV30 would then have it\u0027s vac Isp cut down to 360 to compensate. Conversely, I\u0027d suggest buffing the ASL Isp of both the 30 and 45 by 10 (to 330 from 320).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2.5m Engines:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep the same rough thrust improvement increment, the Skipper should be brought up to 1000 thrust and the Mainsail would need it\u0027s mass cut down to 4.5 (from 6). This creates the same rough increment while still improving on TWR by about 25%. Logically, the poodle should have its mass reduced to 1.5 (from 2) and its thrust cut to 200 (from 220), but I\u0027ll get back to this one in a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TWR changes do not fix efficiency, which is only on par with the 1.25s The Skipper and Mainsail should have their vac Isp buffed by 10 (to 380 and 370 respectively).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to consider is cutting down the Mainsail\u0027s gimbal range to 0.5 from 1 or even removing it entirely. That would add a new challenge to launches which really isn\u0027t there (control authority has never been an issue with nothing but gimbal, at least until MECO)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPoodle:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is a special case and needs some love. First, even with a TWR buff from reduced weight, the engine suffers from an unnecessarily large formfactor. The poodle also seems to attempt to fill two roles, where it does neither well (the LV909 however does a good job of this). I would first remodel it to make it have a skipper-like nozzle, and be about 40% flatter than it is currently. This can be achieved by flattening out the tankbutt as much as possible (or removing it entirely if a later art pass finally makes all stock tanks domed) and shrinking the actual engine structure inwards and upwards (imagine a 1.875m scaled LV909 stuck on a 2.5m tankbutt). The reduced height makes it a better landing engine and the reduced formfactor makes it look like it deserves that mass cut. I\u0027d also bump the vac Isp to 395 (an improvement over the LV909) and the ASL Isp to 290 (it doesnt need quite so much punishment). Either cut the thrust back to 200 (for reasons above) or increase it to 250 and give it a smaller mass cut to 1.8 instead of 1.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbodyne:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t actually share any thoughts on this stuff because GAAHWWDD!!!

If we rebalance mass and what not for target efficiencies and power outputs (say gigantor 100, small 15, static 1), then we cut the gigantors down to 0.2 mass for 100 power. From there, the small deployables would be 0.05 unshielded, 0.25 shielded (also make unshielded breakable even undeployed when stock fairings come out, which is a must (fairings that is) when the new aero model is released).
