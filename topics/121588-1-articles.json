Typical panels used on homes or in slightly larger-scale installations (e.g. over parking lots or solar gardens) have efficiency in the 10-20% range, depending on whether the panels are thin-film, polycrystalline silicon or monocrystalline silicon. Concentrating photovoltaics (CPV) can have higher efficiency, around ~30%. These use high-efficiency multijunction solar cells (efficiency 40%\u002B), but lose some energy in the concentrating optics. I don\u0027t know what the state-of-the-art of solar Stirling systems is, but my understanding is that their actual demonstrated efficiency are right in that same range of ~30%. So a solar Stirling system can be more efficient than run-of-the-mill solar panels, but if you compare like-for-like concentrating systems, it\u0027s about a wash between Stirling and CPV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you think it\u0027s more practical to build fields with Stirling engines with parabolic reflectors as a source of heat instead of solar panels?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetter to look at cost as a figure of merit rather than efficiency. The plain old solar panels have lower cost and are therefore more practical -- assuming you have the space for them. The problem with highly concentrating systems (Stirling or CPV) is that concentration requires mirrors or other optics. These must be aimed precisely towards the sun and must be very rigid structures so that they aren\u0027t deflected or deformed by wind. The structure, the pointing mechanism, and the mirror surface or lenses add cost. (Solar Stirling systems that I\u0027ve seen are pretty big, because there\u0027s a minimum practical size for the Stirling engine. That means the parabolic mirror structure is large and tall, which puts it further off the ground and exposed to stronger winds, so it has to be built stronger. CPV systems can be made smaller to avoid some of this problem.) The simple PV panels can just be plunked down on a fairly low, fixed structure so that they\u0027re tilted a bit to the south (or to the north, if you\u0027re in the southern hemisphere). If they get deflected a bit by the wind, or if the installation isn\u0027t precise, it doesn\u0027t really matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have limited space, then a higher-efficiency concentrating system might make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd what about when it\u0027s rainy/cloudy, would solar panels do a better job?\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo solar system will do much when it\u0027s cloudy.

This is expensive and complicated and the motors will break. PV panels, you just screw down onto a rack and forget about it. If you use microinverters, failures and shading of individual panels don\u0027t affect the rest of the panels, and microinverters now cost $0.50 a watt, the same cost as the larger string inverters now.
