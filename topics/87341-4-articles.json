So much good stuff coming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of Kerbals affecting flight performance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it sounds nice at first (my rockets fly BETTER as my Kerbals survive more disasters!), the truth is, I (the player) actually do all the flying, with the Kerbals screaming (or grinning) in the little PIPs in the corner. From a role-play perspective, sure, you can say that Jeb is in the pilot seat, but unless there\u0027s an automated flight system on the way (I doubt it), he wont ever have to prove his mettle by landing my spaceplane for me. Understanding that I\u0027m the pilot and my skill is what matters: If I fly 2 different missions with exactly the same craft and same control input, I should get exactly the same results; which would NOT happen if some of the craft\u0027s capabilities rely on which Kerbal is at the controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider the situation where Jeb increases thrust for all SRBs due to his Moar Boosters trait (yay!). On first launch, your rocket gets to orbit (yay!). Even cooler, Jeb\u0027s Moar Boosters skill got even better after the first successful mission (yay!). Thinking you have a really good design, you go to launch again. This time, your rocket fails to achieve orbit (huh?). You realize that the SRBs were wasting fuel by pushing too hard against atmosphere now that Jeb is causing them to burn even harder, causing you to lose dV and not achieve orbit (yes, you can have too much thrust). So you have a good laugh at how silly Jeb can be and try Bob, who has the Moar Science trait, instead. You launch but this time you find your SRBs are putting out LESS thrust than your first flight which ALSO causes you not to reach orbit. even though all 3 situations use the same craft (and 2 use the same pilot!), you wind up with 3 different results, only 1 of which is what you planned for in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem extends to craft that I download from someone else. I shouldn\u0027t fail to make orbit just because the craft author designed it with a level 100 Kerbal at the helm (which of course is not downloaded with the craft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThought about another way, giving Kerbals flight performance statistics means we would end up treating them like just another rocket part. I.E. this kerbal adds .05 torque to reaction wheels and this other kerbal effectively adds a free 10 units of fuel. Maybe this isn\u0027t so bad, but I feel that engineering problems should be solved through good design and not because you sat a wily Kerbal in the command chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m NOT saying I don\u0027t want kerbals to gain experience or track individual achievements. I would LOVE that actually. I just don\u0027t think they should have any impact on flight characteristics. Instead, find other things for them to be good at: science processing, limit repair actions to engineer-trait kerbals, give additional rep when a famous Kerbal plants a flag, I dunno...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T18:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StrandedonEarth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022StrandedonEarth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like the idea of Kerbal xp being more of a qualification system.
