Mainly it makes refueling ships using whatever resource system a lot more fun and elegant than using docking ports or the Klaw. It\u0027s also handy for assembling large ships in orbit and then adding struts via EVA Kerbals to hold the pieces together under thrust. And it makes building planetary bases much better, too. And that\u0027s just the most common things you can do with. It has a million uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I don\u0027t have a lot of experience with it in 1.x yet because it just got updated a few days ago. From what I\u0027ve seen, however, it\u0027s better in some ways and more complex/annoying in others due to now using KIS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Can load parts into seats in pods so don\u0027t need containers unless you need LOTS of stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Kerbals can carry multiple items at once in their pockets so less time wasted going back and forth for 1 item at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplications:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Apparently need the KIS tools to actually attach KAS parts to things--they no longer stick by themselves\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Seemingly (not totally confirmed) only Engineers can use the KIS tools (another reason to hate the class system).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
