Exactly when and where tends to vary a bit, but if you\u2019re a bit mad like me and like to play without the extra ground stations, you need them sooner rather than later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best way to ensure commnet coverage is to have at least three satellites in orbits that are synchronous, so that their orbits keep them in the same relative position to one another getting no closer or farther apart. This way one of the satellites will always be in contact with Kerbin, and can then relay that signal out to the rest of the network. This doesn\u2019t need to be geostationary, where they stay in the same place relative to the surface of Kerbin as well as each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve read a few guides on how to do this, and they all talk about \u201Cresonant orbits\u201D, \u201Corbital periods\u201D, and involve *shudders* maths. While all very interesting and accurate, these methods never felt very \u201CKerbal-y\u201D to me. When I play, I like to just slap things together with a vague notion of what I\u2019m doing and get to space with nothing more than a hope and a prayer\u2026 and maybe a few struts\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u2019ve devised a method to create a stable satellite network without the need to use lengthy calculations. It involves no mods, and can be done in the base game. And I intend to describe it here in detail for everyone else\u2019s enjoyment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is the craft that we will be throwing into orbit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZMl7ZNn.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022124.32\u0022 height=\u0022276\u0022 width=\u0022222\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZMl7ZNn.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr more precisely we will be putting four of these simple satellites in orbit. Why four when we can get all the coverage we need with only three synchronous satellites? I\u2019ll get to that later, but we will need to get the thing in orbit first. So, we need something to deploy it from first. Something like the below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UephkwK.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022137.33\u0022 height=\u0022810\u0022 style=\u0022width:300px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022590\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/UephkwK.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s pretty straight forward, I\u2019ve complicated things somewhat with using the hardpoints and stack de-couplers rather than radial de-couplers, however radial de-couplers will leave something attached to the satellite making it harder to control. Hence my bodge job. Anyway, wrap that thing up in a fairing and strap an ascent stage to it and we can launch this sucker!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022t0EzO3W.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002296.20\u0022 height=\u00221012\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221052\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/t0EzO3W.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to make sure to do before we do though (as well as check yo\u2019 stagin\u2019 \u2122) is to reduce the ejection force of your de-couplers/separators (which can be done by enabling advanced tweekables in the options menu). Otherwise you will catapult these tiny satellites halfway around the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022C9PlkBW.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002280.20\u0022 height=\u0022788\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022982\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/C9PlkBW.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext throw it into orbit. I\u2019m not going to explain how to do that, I\u2019m assuming that is straight forward for most people (otherwise there are good guides on this very forum). Select your preferred altitude and try to get a roughly circular orbit. I selected close to 1 million miles, as I like round numbers but am too impatient to get close to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gRuT6Q5.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002276.40\u0022 height=\u0022594\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022778\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gRuT6Q5.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow here comes the clever bit. Decouple one of the satellites, let it drift away from the main craft for a bit and select the main craft as a target. (Don\u2019t forget to deploy the solar panels)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OPQznwh.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002245.60\u0022 height=\u0022507\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221113\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/OPQznwh.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IA1H560.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022107.20\u0022 height=\u0022604\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022563\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/IA1H560.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this done we will now have the closest approach indicators, orange and purple, showing up on the orbit of the little satellite. This is what we are after and is the key to this method of setting up equally spaced satellites. Now make sure the engine of the satellite is activated and point retrograde and fire up that mighty ant engine. Please be sure to allow for enough drift distance, or push away from the carrier craft just a little, otherwise you will rapidly disassemble everything. Anyway, what we are interested in here is the first and second intercept markers. We keep thrusting until the two intercept lines are visually at right angles. This is the only reason that I use four satellites, I find right angles and straight lines easier to judge by eye than 120 degrees. Note, if you build deploy your satellites using radial de-couplers rather than my needlessly complicated setup you will be left with de-coupler remnants on the satellite and it will need a little finagling to fly, but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is your friend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZgAttfx.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002293.60\u0022 height=\u0022539\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZgAttfx.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce that is done, let one full orbit go past and set up a manoeuvre to re-circularise the satellite\u2019s orbit. Or if you are impatient like me you, can de-couple all of the little satellites and let them all fly our together. it saves time but can be a little hectic, so the choice is yours. You need to do one more exactly like before, we will let this one travel around this orbit twice to reach the opposite side of the planet with respect to the carrier. The third satellite will need to be accelerated forward prograde until the markers line up at right angles, so that it will go 90 degrees in the opposite direction from the first two. \u00A0The last satellite you will leave alone, it needs to stay in place because we are going to de-orbit the carrier as its job is over now and I detest space junk. You will also want to swap all the non-circular orbit satellites to target this one now that the carrier is gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hmlIMl6.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022107.60\u0022 height=\u0022571\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022531\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/hmlIMl6.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext when the first satellite we sent off completes one orbit we will re-insert it to a roughly circular orbit. Notice that lovely straight line made up of the purple and orange markers? That\u2019s what we want to see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XqY7Ypp.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022109.40\u0022 height=\u0022683\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022624\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/XqY7Ypp.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly though, it\u2019s a little irrelevant at this point. Now we are roughly in place what we really want to do is get the apoapsis and periapsis values of the target satellite and this satellite to be as close as possible. The closer they are the less drift away from these relative positions there will be over time. You can check this yourself by placing a manoeuvre node and increasing the time to the node by a few orbits, as we can see the orbit remains almost unchanged after 70 days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EfmQgw9.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022156.60\u0022 height=\u00221079\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022689\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EfmQgw9.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the markers start moving, you will know that you need to do a little bit of tweaking. at either the periaps or apoaps to fine tune them. You may need to tweak the thrust limiter to get fine enough control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe markers may not give a straight line, for the satellite pictured below I had to line up the top purple icon with the bottom orange one. You will also notice that my periaps is off by about 6km, so I had to fix this when this satellite eventually makes its way to apoaps, I could also trim the apoaps if I was a perfectionist, which I am not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227f3V2SY.jpg?2\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002286.20\u0022 height=\u0022492\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022571\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7f3V2SY.jpg?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce this has been done with all three satellites and you have trimmed the orbits as much as you desire (less fiddling now means more fiddling to restore the orbits in the future)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xVH2e9N.jpg?2\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002295.40\u0022 height=\u0022721\u0022 style=\u0022width:500px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u0022755\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/xVH2e9N.jpg?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey Presto instant satellite network, no maths, no mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope everyone finds this useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
