It is not impossible, but hard. Set your ladders at an angle away from the cockpit, and place them fairly high, so that the pilot can (almost) climb on top of the cockpit. Set them next to the bubble (the glass part), over the existing steps on the cockpit. Oh, and also, 2 ladders are better than one (they should be on both sides that is). Don\u0027t ask, see for yourself : )\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
