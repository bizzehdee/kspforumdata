However you should currently be taking the Admin strategies that convert science into money at the highest rate you can, because that\u0027s your bottleneck. Look for lucrative contracts that you can do (Satellites and Minmus surveys - I\u0027ve found - are the easiest to do for the higher paying contracts. Also bases. Get a \u0022Put a base for 5 kerbals around the sun\u0022 contract and just launch the bare minimum, empty base with a probe core on it and fling it past Mun out into interplanetary space. Easy money. You can double up on those contracts too if you take a \u0022get a 5-kerbal base in Kerbin orbit\u0022 contract at the same time, the simple act of getting that base out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI to complete the Sun contract will also complete the Kerbin contract.
