Another particularly useful approach I have found is to build the initial core as the final orbital rocket, and build the second and third launch stages outwards from that rather than below [within reason]. The orbital/transfer/main spacecraft can sit atop this construction, providing enough triangles are constructed to hold each part to its neighbours. Struts only weigh 0.05 anyway, so using them will never add any significant weight issues in my experience.

(\u003Cstrong\u003ENOT MINE\u003C/strong\u003E)\u003Cp\u003EI really, really haven\u0027t had issues with wobbly rockets. At least, not the ones I design myself. I also hate struts, and usually use either none or as few as possible. I still don\u0027t have problems. I generally design my rockets while considering the balance of the weight of all the parts I add, and ask myself what would happen with the physics of these parts were I to perhaps try turning rapidly, igniting an engine suddenly, or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually doing that, and placing things intelligently, I come up with designs that don\u0027t bend, or shake themselves to pieces before orbit. The ONLY problem I seem to have regarding structural rigidity, is when I use very heavy rockets, powered by extremely large engines. The engine tends to offset itself from the base of the rocket as I increase thrust. Most of the time even struts won\u0027t solve that. I usually solve it by making that stage a pre-orbit stage that detaches and I therefore don\u0027t care if the engine moves a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, KSP doesn\u0027t do rigid joints very well, but if your rockets are acting like well-cooked noodles, it\u0027s partially your bad design, IMO. Don\u0027t need strut spam to make things stable.
