For example, 100 nanograms of antiprotons can be used to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecatalyze sub-critical nuclear reactions and drive a one metric ton payload to 100 km/sec. This\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecapability would enable the first precursor interstellar missions. In comparison, if traditional\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echemical propellants were used for the same task, nearly 10^9 metric tons of hydrogen and oxygen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewould have to be launched into space. To put this in perspective, the space shuttle can carry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eapproximately 20 metric tons to low Earth orbit. If one space shuttle filled with fuel were launched\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eevery day, it would take nearly a half million years to lift that much propellant into orbit. The\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einfluence of the rocket equation is very pronounced in these scenarios. The traditional propellant\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erequired to accelerate a 1 kg payload to 1000 km/sec exceeds the mass of the observable universe by\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E44 orders of magnitude.
