The panel observed that NASA appeared to be making \u0022safety trade-offs\u0022 to meet that date (though a test flight between EM-1 and EM-2 for SLS Block IB has been confirmed by NASA). The required development of the Exploration Upper Stage, which NASA is building for EM-2, and Orion life support testing were stated to be some of its concerns, along with changes to the heat shield, and \u0022zero fault tolerent\u0022 Orion SM systems, such as propellant valves. The panel has suggested NASA keep Orion in LEO during EM-2, mitigating many of the safety risks - calling the current plan to test Orion/SLS in 2 missions (3 once the \u0027EM-1A\u0027 SLS Block IB test flight NASA now needs for EM-2 is approved by the govn\u0027t).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, though SLS/Orion has received more money from Congress than what NASA has requested in recent years, the flat level of funding (the $1 Billion dollar NASA budget increase proposed by Congress has not yet been approved yet) Also, according to the Council, the\u00A0 budget for SLS/Orion is not layed out \u0022to acheive needed design effort of a major program\u0022 (aka lacking direction). Speaking of direction, NASA\u0027s current \u0022goals\u0022 for SLS/Orion has been critized for lack of detail, despite releasing a new report on how NASA plans to go to Mars and that more detail would do wonders to help it survive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, NASA\u0027s Commerical Crew Program was also studied by the Council, and has been given a much better view of it compared to previous years- where it was much more critical of it. According to them, there has been a \u0022substantial improvement in openness and interaction\u0022; on the other hand, there are still many challenges ahead, resulting in concerns over NASA accepting more risk, and that there is a \u0022high likelihood of delays to the first test flights\u0022. Despite this, NASA has been recommended by the council to continue developing 2 vehicles for that program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last thing, Orion now is using tiles instead of a monolithic heat shield.

Larger Solar panels would likely be needed for a higher power usage, not to mention Dragon has much less available space (and thus downmass and available supplies), thus neeeding a 2nd crewed module on its top to be used for the longer duration missions, which need more space and supplies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe end result is that it\u0027s better to just use Orion.
