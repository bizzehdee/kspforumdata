You\u0027d also have very poor telescope images of planets when you first discover them, especially far planets and small ones.

I also think having their orbits untracked would keep us from knowing whether or not they\u0027re planets/moons/asteroids.\u00A0Second Point: Instead of a telescope, have it so each time you upgrade your tracking station, each planet gets dramatically less blurry and you gain a little more info on it\u0027s apparent gravitational pull, current orbit and other useful information like that.\u00A0On the second, they could start tracking asteroids and specifically differentiate what\u0027s a planet/moon and what\u0027s not.\u00A0Upon the final upgrade, you\u0027d know exactly what the planet looked like (Which helps you to determine if it even has an atmosphere in the first place) and you\u0027d have enough data to tell you how much delta V and Parachutes you\u0027ll probably need.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow if you wanted to just go to said blurry figure\u00A0with your early game mun lander and attempt a landing with no info, fine, do so at your own risk.

the problem is, no one is trying to find the planets at this point in time. \u00A0The furthest in our solar system was discovered in 1846 (1930 if you count Pluto). \u00A0Yes we didn\u0027t know exactly what they were like, but we knew their orbits, gravity and all the stuff you would need to land there long before. \u00A0The only thing a fog of war would simulate is the fact that we didn\u0027t really know how they looked until we sent something there. \u00A0Take Pluto for example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

it was one of the best pictures we had until recently. \u00A0I would love for planets to look like this before you first went there, but since the system is always the same it would only really work once before coming rather meaningless. \u00A0After you unveil each planet by doing some arbitrary task, the sense of discovery would vanish quickly. \u00A0Having this sort of fog would also not help encourage exploration, except on the first time you unveil the planets,\u00A0as after you have done it once\u00A0you have seen it all.

exploring players do, this is not really a\u00A0wrong way to go about it, as it would certainly force players to do some sort of \u0022exploration task\u0022 that is built into the game, whether it is mapping satellite or just simply getting close enough. \u00A0What it does not actually achieve though, is making the player \u003Cu\u003Ewant\u003C/u\u003E to explore. \u00A0The reason why we explore is not to \u003Cem\u003Ediscover\u003C/em\u003E the unknown, it is to satisfy our curiosity\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eabout\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the unknown. \u00A0Just simply draping a curtain over the planets makes them unknown, but it does not make you curious about them, especially if the only action necessary to uncover them doesn\u0027t even require exploration at all. \u00A0Instead, it becomes a quick chore to do before we can do more interesting things, just like sending the resources satellites up before mining. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion, SQUAD has already put a way to incentivise exploration into the game. \u00A0All they did was make that one monolith easily visible from the space center screen (I assume done while they fixed the other hidden surprises). \u00A0In that one stroke, they show the player a peek behind the curtain\u00A0and hinted at what else there is to explore out in space. \u00A0This little easter egg, just by being very badly hidden, hints at all the others that are hiding\u00A0everywhere in the solar system. \u00A0It makes you curious and you start to look for them as you fly your missions. \u00A0Eventually you\u0027ll find more (or hear about more) and \u00A0you soon begin actively searching for them. \u00A0To do so you scour each and every body in the solar system, exploring every mountain and valley to see if there is another interesting tidbit that was left there for you. \u00A0You\u0027ll find the easter eggs, but you will also explore the land and find all the great sights that this game has to offer (unfortunately one of the areas it is lacking). \u00A0Just through the easter eggs hidden away in the game, it incentivises you to explore much better than any fog of war system could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Codraroll","CreatedById":163815,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-12T07:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

In this case they\u0027re either locked somehow which requires unlocking them in sequence and adding an oddly artificial constraint on \u00A0playstyle freedom or else injects a telescope mechanic. Again the telescope sounds realistic enough but think about how tedious and frustrating it would be to stare at your screen scrolling around the sky and time warping for hours on end looking for tiny specks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this could be done simple enough to work in-game:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider a three-tier building, the Observatory (or planetarium?). With tier one, the Tracking Station will only show Kerbin and its two moons, plus Eve and Duna (and perhaps Ike, but not Gilly). It would simply look as if there were no more planets in the system. Upgrading the Observatory to tier 2 would show you Dres, Gilly and maybe Jool, but not its moons. Also, more information about the known planets would be displayed (most crucially, launch windows). An upgrade to tier 3 would show more information about the planets (such as a biome list), but not reveal the rest of them. It would, however, unlock new parts: The Space Telescope. Sending a telescope into orbit would reveal the existence of Moho, the Joolian moons, and Eeloo. That mechanic could feasibly be split in two if you like, for instance that a 2.5 m telescope reveals Tylo, Moho and Laythe, while a 3.75 m telescope shows you Vall, Pol, Bop and Eeloo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs such, the space telescopes would not require hours of manual scanning. Just plop them in a stable orbit, perhaps above a certain altitude, and the scientists will figure out the rest. It\u0027s not completely realistic, but it does add a gameplay element of exploration. Of course, sending probles to the planets would also mark them as discovered in the Tracking Station, but good luck finding them without a telescope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-12T14:12:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222714252\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137220\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470988093\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022163815\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Codraroll\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Codraroll said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, sending probles to the planets would also mark them as discovered in the Tracking Station, but good luck finding them without a telescope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell this is kind of the thing--if they aren\u0027t marked on the map its actually impossible to find them.
