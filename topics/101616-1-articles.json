It had the most basic 3d modeling abilities(simplifies or restricted to game needs possibly) and the ability to blend multiple various current parts together and save them as .craft or in the subassemblies for use in your planes. do it the simpliest way but make it so it has a mode for any special needs and give it access to all stuff like in the VAB type buildings so you can scale it or add preexisting parts. This could allow completely custom parts and condense current ones to single parts. \n\nI would think the only down side is, depending on how it was designed, it may need work limiting any edits to existing parts or forcing weight of things made base on some criteria. Though if they made up some logic for everything in the game I bet it could be doable. Maybe as a future update or something."},{"CreatedByName":"McPoisoned","CreatedById":138265,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T16:05:19Z","Content":"I really like the idea of basic part modeling and fabrication ingame!"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T16:06:28Z","Content":"Nah.
