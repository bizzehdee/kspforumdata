Now because i wanted to dock with a space station i put up there earlier, i corrected my orbit into a polar orbit. I did so and now\u00A0i\u0027m trying to get back to Kerbin. I got loads of fuel left but there is one problem i have: My controls got really strange so that i turn to and away from minmsu with q and e whcih are normally there to just turn the vessel. By that any maneuver nodes are impossible, because i don\u0027t know in what direction to turn the vessel for it to work. Also when thrusting, the vessel randomly starts turning around in all directions and the manevuer node moving with no end aswell. I got an andvanced reaction wheel to control it, an antenna and 2 Kerbals on the ship. It also has tons of batteries and 12 solar pannels(The vessel is pretty\u00A0big with only 2.5m parts). What can i do about it? I tried getting back a million times but i either crash into minmus or make my orbit even worse. (Once i also somehow managed to get out of minmus orbit somehow into a kerbin orbit but the controls were still broken making my orbit even worse when trying to get it down.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-17T10:01:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2018 10:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by LucasCB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T12:35:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve docked with another craft your control point may have changed from your main ship\u0027s capsule (to another capsule, probe core or docking port) so I\u0027d try clicking on your main capsule that\u0027s in line with the engine that you\u0027re using and select \u0022control from here\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LucasCB","CreatedById":186286,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T13:51:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats it!
