Kinda puts some brakes on my RPG idea of using CO2 NTRs extensively on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then, if enriched fissile material becomes more cheaply available\u00A0after the next step in space colonization, perhaps using CO2 NTRs has economic benefits? The propellant is basically just\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eatmosphere\u003C/em\u003E, or even better, lying around frozen at the poles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E NTRs are not a bad idea if you are on Mars and constrained to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E; you really can just land, shovel the stuff into the propellant tanks, and take off again. Not the greatest specific impulse...however, if you can spend a little bit of time cracking the carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide, it\u0027ll improve greatly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yeah, propellant choice is huge. The SSMEs ran fuel-rich even though it lowered combustion temperature, simply because the extra H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E in the exhaust increased the overall exhaust velocity compared to having only H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO in the exhaust. Being able to pump as much hydrogen into your exhaust as you can really increases your specific impulse; pure hydrogen is thus the best of all possible worlds. You just need a way of heating it up. Hydrolox/hydroflox/hydrofluorine engines take advantage of the fact that the specific energy of hydrogen is ridiculously high when combined with appropriate oxidizers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s mostly because it is basically pure potential chemical\u00A0energy, unlike lowly hydrocarbons which can carry a great deal of hydrogen but are composed mostly of carbon atoms which don\u0027t contribute as much to the reaction. Of course, hydrogen is very very fluffy and plays poorly with tanks, so that\u0027s a major consideration for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E applications, which need high impulse density. Someone (I don\u0027t recall whom) defended the virtues of hydrocarbon engines over hydrolox by pointing out that being able to carry a lot of fuel is a GOOD thing for a vehicle, not a bad thing. Dry mass is a much greater predictor of cost than GLOW, and payload-to-dry-mass ratio is a much better predictor of overall performance than payload-to-GLOW ratio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerosene\u002Bflox can beat a water NTR for impulse density, but only barely.

Because it\u0027s not enough to get into orbit; you actually have to get back to the mothership. A polar orbit or a highly-inclined orbit allows the dropship to reach virtually any point on the surface once every calendar day, but this also means that returning to orbit can only be done in a virtually-instantaneous launch window, and the ship doesn\u0027t have the benefit of the planet rotation kick.

By Mach 2, the fan is shut off but the ram effect continues to rise (in combination with decreasing air pressure which increases specific impulse), to a peak of 1,001 seconds at 2 km/s.
