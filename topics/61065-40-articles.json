I\u0027m not currently having the scene change issue, and in this instance I just booted up KSP, loaded my career save, opened the FF menu, config, and turned on TRACE logging. Seing as that seems to be more helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the manner of the original bug though, I think I MIGHT know how it happened. When I started my career save I went and renamed a lot of my Kerbals in the save file, so that they had unique names, and weren\u0027t all \u0022Kerman\u0022s. This didn\u0027t present any issues at the time, but neither was FF installed then. However, I recently added a group of new Kerbals to the space program and renamed them. I\u0027m not sure if this was before or after I played around in the FF menu, But I have a sneaking suspicion that this is why. Especially because I encountered it a second time after renaming a Kerbal I had just rescued from orbit as a contract. Now that I think about it... I\u0027m quite certain that\u0027s what caused the issue. I bet FF was freaking out about a decorated kerbal that it couldn\u0027t find anymore. That being said, I have no idea how that would cause the total game failure I experienced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll do some experimenting and report back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Okay... ignore my hypothesis above...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI attempted to recreate the bug by changing the name of a Kerbal, decorating him by having him fly around, and then changing his name again. Instead of my expected outcome, the kerbal showed up in the list with the new name, and no decorations. This I can understand. It\u0027s essentially the same as adding a new kerbal and removing the decorated one. But if that didn\u0027t cause the bug then I\u0027m back to square one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Maybe don\u0027t ignore that.... I kept on playing around with Kerbal names this time changing the test Kerbal\u0027s name back to the name he had when he was decorated, and I also changed a different Kerbals name. I\u0027m beginning to feel like I\u0027m just muddling things up here, but I did recreate the bug. I\u0027ll see if I can narrow it down further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I THINK I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT HAPPENED! And I\u0027m really sorry for troubling you if this is it... On my Career save Each of my Kerbals, except for Jebediah, Bill, and Bob, has a unique last name that is NOT Kerman. This is because I went into the save-file and edited them for my own liking. Shortly after installing FinalFrontier, I rescued \u0022Duncan KERMAN\u0022 from orbit as a contract. As part of that contract\u0027s design, upon completion, \u0022Duncan KERMAN\u0022 was added to my space center crew. Immediately after this I went and saved, then edited the save in the ROSTER section. I changed \u0022Duncan KERMAN\u0022 to \u0022Duncan MIKKERS\u0022. Upon Loading again the game is unusable, having introduced this bug. Changing his name back to Duncan KERMAN resolves it. I think this is because his name is mentioned elsewhere in the savefile, the completed contract to be exact. and in this location I didn\u0027t change the name, as I was unaware of it. So the completed contract, return Duncan KERMAN from orbit is telling the game that on this save I should have a Kerbal named Duncan Kerman, but the truth is that there\u0027s a Duncan Mikkers instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-21T20:04:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2014 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MarcRan17\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ethink I found the issue\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarcRan17","CreatedById":59722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T20:40:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, now that I think I\u0027ve solved my problem, is there any way of editing the number of mission a Kerbal has been on?

It has a major drawback: Not that easy to edit for the user and for me. This make debugging way more complicated. Perhaps if it supports some kind of fast indexed and versioned access and the option to save load in and out XML files it would be sufficient. Second, for the normal usage I really dont want a save file integration. May this is an option later on (but it would always be an option). But I need an easy way to restore a hall of fame a few saves ago and a time indexed access for each kerbal and for all (linked together). So it\u0027s not that easy to integrate my data structures with a framework. I have not checked this, but I doubt CrewFiles will suffice all those requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd myabe I missed something in the KSP API, but I didn\u0027t found a unique identifier for a kerbal.

One of my kerbals has just been awarded the fast orbit (less than 120 seconds to orbit) ribbon, completely in error. he was part of a mission which launched with 3, single man pods on a single rocket. once the ship was on orbit, the pods were decoupled from the main vehicle.
