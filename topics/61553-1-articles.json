Open your intakes and come on in. Do not, however, attempt to activate your jets until you\u0027re below 400 m/s and or 10,000 m. When you do that, close your intakes and mind your vertical speed. Ideally when you get to the tarmac you want to be going no faster than about 10 m/s vertically. Bring your nose up to about 5 degrees above the horizon to flare out (make contact with the back wheels first). Throttle back on the approach too - 100 m/s is a pretty good surface speed for final.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeacons help too. Build you an automated rover or two and set them out on the runway,and give them the ability to drop probes. When you drop a probe, rename it as a base.

This one has wandered a bit from the original.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for reentry, if you don\u0027t have enough wing or tail area it might flip around because of drag.

Realize you do not have to land on the runway. You can practice on the grass next to the KSC complex. There are lots of techniques, but I try to come in a bit flat (3 degree descent) till getting close to the ground. Then flatten it out so you are almost flying level just above the ground and slowly reduce the throttle. Disable braking on your nosewheel (in the SPH) and turn on your brakes before you land or right after you touchdown. Sometimes turning off SAS at landing helps, and sometimes not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also don\u0027t forget to check your CoM in the SPH for your reentry and landing fuel weights.

Keeping yourself slow gives you time to adjust, generally 100-120 m/s or so is good; fast enough to prevent stalling, slow enough that you have time to make adjustments. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule of thumb - don\u0027t start in on the 100 meters per kilometer until after you\u0027re clear of the mountains. Those are maybe 40-50 kilometers or so west of KSC, of course, and you definitely don\u0027t want to be at 4000-5000 meters elevation at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does take practice, and it\u0027s like landing on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn successfully for the first time - one of those awesome milestone achievements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-30T19:22:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2014 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T19:38:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, thanks again. Since it\u0027s only 2 or 3 days since I couldn\u0027t get an existing spaceplane into orbit I\u0027m pretty happy to be taking my own designs there and more-or-less back.

Constant -3 degrees until flare? High then stoop (before flare)? Low and fast (coming in hot)? Altitudes and distances?\u003Cp\u003E[Or just ignore me - I need to get to know each plane individually and should stop wittering here and practice more, lol!]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to come in high. Something like 20km over the mountains also as I like to maintain a lot of altitude in case I make a mistake. However, I descent pretty steeply (10-15 degrees nose low) to capture that 3-5 degree approach path. I like to be set up 3-5 degrees about 5km out and I hold that until the flare. Because I don\u0027t use a joystick, I mostly control my descent rate by adjusting the throttle a little bit. This also helps control airplanes that like to get a little squirrely when making small adjustments. I try not to come in faster than 100 m/s, but that speed really depends a lot on the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
