So I wanted to know peoples opinions on if the progression speed should stay the same be slower or be faster for KSP 2 especially with the fact that colonies and interstellar travel will be introduced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-29T19:28:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat topic. I actually feel exactly the opposite haha. Or rather I agree but I see it differently. To my mind the pacing from Kerbin to the Mun is about right, after which it comes to a grinding halt. I say that because by progression I don\u0027t just mean the tech-tree, but the entire structure of the game. From this standpoint 2-3 missions to reach orbit followed by 2-3 missions to land on Minmus and/or the Mun, 2-3 missions to set up your first station, etc, really isn\u0027t bad, and players should have access to a good portion of the existing tech-tree to do that. There is nothing however after that point that impels players to start sending interplanetary\u00A0probes and crewed missions and so they spend another dozen or two missions tediously farming around Kerbin and its moons until the tech tree is done, and of those that even reach that point half of them never leave. Given all of the cool stuff KSP2 has in scope it really can\u0027t allow that post-mun-mission bog-down to happen.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0I spent a minute this spring estimating the number of distinct missions it should probably take to get out and build a few colonies and tech up to your first interstellar vessel:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#e6e8e9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nJust some quick estimates:\u00A0I think in principle it should be possible for a semi-experienced player to go interstellar within 100-150 hours of gameplay, or 4h/ week for 6-9 months (for reference it takes around 200h to get to level 100 in Skyrim.) Others may vary but I find I average about 2h/ mission all-in between planning, design, testing, and flight-time. That\u2019s just 50-75 missions. How might that budget out?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#e6e8e9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\n1 survey probe per body: 16\u00A0missions\u003Cbr\u003E\n2 initial landings on 8 bodies (probe and/or crewed): 16 missions\u003Cbr\u003E\n2 prospecting missions on 4 bodies: 8 missions\u003Cbr\u003E\n3 asteroid/comet missions\u003Cbr\u003E\n3 colony set up missions on 2 bodies: 6 missions\u003Cbr\u003E\n4 logistics missions on 2 bodies (satellites, milk-run establishment): 8 missions\u003Cbr\u003E\n3 additional exploration/science missions on 2 bodies: 6 missions\u003Cbr\u003E\n2 interstellar probes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#e6e8e9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nTotal: 65\u00A0missions\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#e6e8e9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nThat, plus down-time spent managing tech development, crews, colony building, and managing economies and resources probably brings you close to that 140-150h mark. Keep in mind these are just guesstimated averages, some missions will be much faster or longer than 2h and different players might spend more time on a few bodies rather than trying to visit all 16. You\u0027ll notice this isn\u0027t really that many missions to play with, but I think its about right considering this is just to get to the point where you\u0027ve completed enough of the tech tree to build\u00A0your first interplanetary colony ship. If you make it drastically more time consuming than that or bog players down with tedious tasks you aren\u0027t going to get most players to even start colonies, let alone explore other star systems.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGiven that kind of pacing I really don\u0027t think you want more than 5-6 initial launches to get to orbit and reach Minmus and the Mun, and you definitely don\u0027t want a dozen repetitive biome hops around them. Those first 6 missions should furnish you with everything you need to go interplanetary and start prospecting and\u00A0building your first rudimentary stations and outposts. The fortunate thing is KSP2\u0027s tech tree is going to be much deeper, so you absolutely can dole out 3/4 of the existing parts within the Kerbin system. After that though I think its important that Kerbin and its moons are mostly mined out for tech rewards so players can\u0027t just putter around and have to make some leaps to keep moving.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maxadmiral","CreatedById":37003,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-30T09:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI absolutely love the progression in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-1, but it might be too hardcore/tedious for many players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dientus","CreatedById":209823,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-30T17:50:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats were the options and sliders come in.
