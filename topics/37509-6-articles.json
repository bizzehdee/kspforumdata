I wasn\u0027t planning to include airspeed, partially because its already there (either on the HUD or Nav Ball), and also because it needs to go a lot higher than 200. While not quite as color coded, the HUD tape provides some of the \u0022at-a-glance\u0022 feel. In real aircraft there is also a stall bar and Vne bar (generally hash marks) that show up on the tape. Unfortunately, as these are so unique to each vessel (and not really applicable to rockets at all) I haven\u0027t looked at implementing them. I can include ground speed in the air gauge, or possibly a side scrolling tape.

The 200 from the one in the picture is an example, I think in reality either a gauge with a selectable order or magnitude or one with some sort of logarithmic scale like the stock variometer would be pretty good - although I fear the latter might be of more limited use. Looking at the SR-71 it surprises me that it actually has a bog standard airspeed gauge with some scaling, along with some more exotic mach gauges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the navball speed readout is that it takes (relatively) a lot of attention to read. Not ideal when you are trying to pay attention to nose attitude, speed, descent rate and where the ground is.

Now I just need to decide on layout and how I want to work with intake air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erottielover, is it just the initial parsing of a bunch of values, or is it a consistent case of can\u0027t find config.xml? Even a screenshot of the log would be helpful. That being said, it should rebuild the config file with default values if it isn\u0027t there. Second question, what OS are you using? And finally, even with the spam, are all the gauges still working?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for gauge sizes, I know they\u0027re a little on the large size. That\u0027s why the bezzels are removable, they\u0027re scalable, and you can make them transparent, and toggle them when you don\u0027t need one or another. The problem is, analog gauges are big. In real planes, they take up more room than the windscreen (well, for complex aircraft). All that being said, the radar altimeter is pretty big, and I may redesign it in a while. Possibly a round dial, or possibly a sliding scale (similar to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37128-0-20-Bucky-s-Instruments-v0-0-4-RAD-ALT-and-VSI-update\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBucky\u0027s?\u003C/a\u003E) or something else entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T18:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaven\u0027t been home yet to post the log.
