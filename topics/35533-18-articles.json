Truthfully, I don\u0027t quite understand why this is not being done by KSP already. Ships should not sway and oscillate all over the place like they do now, If objects were to be made rigid and only breaking forces were to be calculated it would not only make the game most aesthetically pleasing, it would also make struts obsolete and improve performance dramatically. Of course, you won\u0027t be able to make a giant snake anymore by linking 100 inline battery banks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis \u0022flexibility\u0022 in the assembly is wanted by Squad, and it\u0027s what make this game KSP.

(last time I checked this topic was when you were doing requests and thinking about a possible plugin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/m6ikskj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m6ikskj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022m6ikskj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to make a substitute for the mainsail (not available in career for the most part / weird game bugs when using mainsails), so I made this simple, and ugly, looking cluster tank. Without your welding plugin it is a 21 part thing without the support struts to keep it rigid. Now it is one single solid part! When making an asparagus launcher I have 7 or 9 of these, so that is a 140 to 180 part count decrease for the LV with only this simple thing!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut my main reason for this post is to add my voice to the group that has problems with the radial attachment welding. Last two weeks I\u0027ve been reading the entire topic from beginning to the end to make sure I didn\u0027t miss a bug / bugfix / solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see I have the struts on the side, and when I don\u0027t do anything with the part.cfg I can\u0027t attach the it. When opening the .cfg file I don\u0027t have a long list of attach nodes, just the ones from the parts that are on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried placing this part as the first part and add stuff later, that worked fine, but when placing the outer ones for the asparagus stage, they would not connect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can place this part radial on other parts (useless, but fun!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow one of the solutions offered is to delete / disable the nodes that are not used. By doing that the part indeed did work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe file has all original nodes are there, disabled the nodes on the girders that are on the \u0022inside\u0022 (connected to the other girder or tank).
