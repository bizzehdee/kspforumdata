The media is nice, but really isn\\\u0027t oriented to what is demanded of the game. May as well try playing Combat on your Atari 2600 with paddles. It can be done, but you won\\\u0027t get your tank anywhere. You would get a giggle imagining Clu inside there getting seriously motion sick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface would be better intended for strategy games such as RUSE, as that game\\\u0027s initial promotion exhibited quite well its eligibility for that platform. Master of Orion or Sins of a Solar Empire are another pair of prime candidates, considering the example this video gives of Surface\\\u0027s strong ability to exhibit three dimensions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat doesn\\\u0027t rule out building, but I wouldn\\\u0027t want to make such an investment just to tinker in KSP\\\u0027s VAB only. Building a rocket is no fun without actually testing it. And crashing it, then improving it and testing it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Surface could be used with additional input interfaces, as well, then I can see it being flexible enough for KSP. But considering it is more a prototype in essence to woo investors wholesale, its abilities for the wider market are understandably limited. There is nothing I would love than to sweep my keyboard aside and reach up to my screen to get that stage just where I want it. But to think Surface works on its own is narrow-minded and foolhardy. It is one reason why the advocates of Kinect and the Wii drive me insane, because they see only that kind of interface. Motion control is fine, but it is not the end-all interface. People have already shown that the Kinect is an awesome tool when it works in concert with other devices, something I think Microsoft sneakily intended when it released it with just the 360.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface is the same thing. It is an interface device that is left on its own, to tease the imagination and ingenuity of people to find its place among other devices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, no, Surface by itself isn\\\u0027t the ideal device for KSP. But it sure as hell would be an awesome addition to all else we have at our disposal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink about it this way. Surface as it is requires tactile contact for use. That\\\u0027s cool and all, but no matter how clean your hands are, continued use is going to build up issues. I know that all too well with the screens I use at my workplace. My fingers are going to be calloused monstrosities considering the poking I have to do to get my selections made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if you include a Kinect in the recipe? Suddenly tactile contact is no longer a necessity as the Kinect can tell the Surface where you are pointing or pushing or pulling at. Suddenly you are Tony Starkerman, designing your Iron Kerbal to your desire. And not just to the Mun. You are going to take on the Space Kraken, and win. Then the stars will be yours. At least until you can find out how to get over that one Delta-V hump that keeps sending your ship into Kerbol. Though that may require a bit of keyboard and mouse input.
