For full releases I typically have it be automatically packaged in a .zip file with a full GameData structure, but for small dev builds it\u0027s usually just the .dll (I may change that this time around). Not every build is really useable since I may make breaking changes between builds, but I will frequently tell testers to grab a specific build and it makes full releases much simpler and safer (multiple times I\u0027ve released an update with the wrong versions of the .dlls in it...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot having the build server has kinda sucked, so I\u0027m really happy to have it running again.

The process gets stuck at 100% in the building list, impossible to remove; framerate drops as CPU load shoots up; a message is displayed that \u0022this building upgrade is already requested\u0022 (paraphrased); and funds first gets reset to zero, but then starts rapidly ticking upwards, never stopping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolution: disable timed building upgrades. That way, upgrades no longer completely bug out. However, there are other problems. Since there are only three building tier assets available, you can tell CustomBarnKit that the middle visual building tier should be used for buildings levels 2 and 3, and the third and final one would only get used for level 4. But! If KCT is present and the order of of visual building tiers is configured to be anything other than 1,2,3 for the first three stages, the visual building tiers go haywire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, if a level 1 building is directed to have anything other than tier 1 graphics, then upon starting a new save, the building is assigned a random graphics tier. Sometimes it looks like first-tier, sometimes like second-tier, sometimes like third tier. Also, the first upgrade conducted always switches a building to tier 2 graphics; and if the order is changed in any way from stock, you never get to see the third tier at all (unless it randomly gets selected for something at save start).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolution: stick with stock tier progression, and the fourth upgrade tier will just have to be the one that\u0027s visually indistinguishable from the tier before it. This prevents bugs with the visual building tiers. But unfortunately it breaks something else:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif a building has the tier 3 graphics active, then doing anything that reloads the space center screen will magically set that building to its maximum level. In essence, KCT seems to look at the building and go \u0022Hey, this building has maximum tier graphics. Clearly it must be maximum level. What is the maximum level, 4? Okay, I don\u0027t care what level this building was before, it is now level 4.\u0022 So the player gets all their level 4 upgrades instantly and free of charge right after they can afford the level 3 upgrades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolution: I have not found any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut wait, there\u0027s more!(tm) Apparently KCT scales the time it takes to roll out a vessel to the pad by the level of the pad. (Is this even intended? It doesn\u0027t make much sense to me to have that in the first place.) And if you have a launchpad of a level that is not 1 or 2 or 3, then the result of the vessel rollout time calculation is \u0022Infinity, NaN:NaN:NaN\u0022.

The best point to test it with is dropping something suborbital from 30\u002Bkm altitude while still continuing on so the stage unloads above 25km. That will cause it to get added to the watch list, then SR will wait for it to just about be destroyed and pull out the kerbals, then when destroyed it associates the kerbals and either recovers them or lets them die.

Then after the event has finished the replacement occurs, so another mod could easily add new variables or change existing ones if they wanted, without referencing KCT\u0027s assemblies at all. Combine that with a Preset and another mod could conceivably completely override KCT\u0027s own processing of pretty much everything without ever referencing KCT in code.
