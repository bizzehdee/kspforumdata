But I think I have encountered some limitations to what I can do on my way to what I want to do. As I have focused a lot on atmospheric flight most of my suggestions relate to air breathing planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is a wish list that I think would improve gameplay greatly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* ILS, Instrument Landing System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to select a runway to land on and the game will provide with approach nodes. As it is now I have trouble to align myself correctly when trying to land at KSC. Also, some more runways on Kerbin perhaps?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Data storage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all the science going on there is a lot of data collected. Currently the only way to collect more data is to transmit the last readings and thus make memory available for new readings. How about a data bank which can store readings and free up the instruments memory space? Think of it as a reversed resource tank which in time get increases instead of the fuel being used up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the command modules can have some data storage ability as they already have with electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Continuous data gathering\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the thermometer, GRAVMAX, PresMat and Sensor Array all collect data now, that\u0027s great. But I feel such instruments would be even greater if they could collect continuously instead of momentarily. And the thermometer, GRAVMAX and PresMat all just collect a number, a number which now takes a lot of data space. Wouldn\u0027t it be better if they all just collected data while they\u0027re switched on and each reading takes less memory space. This could work great together with the \u0022data storage\u0022-suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Simple flight programming\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA new tech tree (or perhaps additional features to the science tree) which can be used to develop easily constructed flight programs like \u0022Alt \u0026lt; 20000 m: Kill engines, deploy parachutes\u0022 and in time a bit more complicated programs like \u0022Air pressure != IN VACUUM\u0022: Activate thermometer, activate sensor array, start log presmat, start log thermometer, start log sensor array\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose programs could take up data storage if the \u0022data storage\u0022-suggestion is implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Data compression (together with \u0022data storage\u0022 and \u0022continuous gathering\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith loads of data the transmission of the data will take a lot of time and electricity. How about data compression, a relatively slow process which will reduce the number of Mits required to transmit the collected data. This could be combined with the \u0022flight programming\u0022 suggestion and be in the same tech tree (called \u0022computing\u0022 or something).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are my suggestion which are mostly related to the new features in .22. Here is some that I had earlier:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Improved ASAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to let the ASAS control the throttle of some engines, also a ability to remove ASAS control of some control parts and just leave them to player control. The ASAS should also be given the ability to transfer fuel between different tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I fly my new and awesome Science RAM jet, I\u0027d like to drop some science probes. Currently I have to science probes which drops from the tips of my wings which cause the craft to have a centre of gravity which is not aligned with the centre of thrust. My solution is manually reduce throttle and transfer fuel to the side of the plane which dropped the pod. It would be great of the ASAS could do that automatic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Remove parts from staging\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be great if some parts could be removed from the staging (and perhaps some other parts could be added to staging). With my new Science RAM jet I\u0027ve added emergency parachutes in case of mid air failure, with an accidental tap to the space bar this could activate without intention. Sure, you can lock the staging but it\u0027s not the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* A new ballast part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the ASAS could transfer fuel to shift centre of gravity around it would be great to add tanks with a heavy liquid just for the weight to be shifted around the craft. I guess many people already have suggested the ability to fill a generic fuel tank with different types of fuel so what\u0027s really needed is a new type of \u0022fuel\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, the thought of generic fuel tanks made me think of a radial fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Small size jet engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the title suggest, a jet engine which will fit on the small contact surface. Perhaps together with a small jet fuel tank and small air intake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Drop down list for target selection in map mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen there are a lot of crafts in orbit it can be hard to select the right one. A drop down list would be awesome to easily make the right selection. Also, ability to select Kerbin as a target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* More detailed orbital data\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s my inclination to the body I\u0027m orbiting? What\u0027s my period time? What\u0027s my eccentricity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Improved nav ball\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbit as line on the nav ball please, and maybe perhaps a line for the orbit of my target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI surely hope you didn\u0027t get discouraged by all the text above and feel free to comment if you\u0027re wondering about some of the ideas and I\u0027ll try to explain further. I also have some ideas about implementation for some of them.
