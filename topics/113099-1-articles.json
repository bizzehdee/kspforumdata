It won\u0027t give. Maybe that\u0027s why you\u0027re getting the behavior you\u0027re getting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for example, if I attach two tanks radially to a fuselage, then the fuel line attachments I try to feed from those tanks to the main fuselage will be radial, never mirror. (I haven\u0027t tried going the other way around; it might force the symmetry or keep the parent symmetry--or if the parent is the root, then take any symmetry...). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for action group misbehaviors with symmetry, I believe I\u0027ve read somewhere (and it\u0027s kinda my experience with the game, too), \u003Cem\u003Eif after you\u0027ve placed an action group on a symmetrical part, you then try to move the symmetrical part\u003C/em\u003E, it\u0027s advised to redo the action group for it. [thread=97285]There\u0027s a stock bugfix for it, but there\u0027s also a disclaimer about it causing a bit of misbehavior as well, so its caveat emptor whether to use it or not, really[/thread].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest tip I could probably offer so far: plan out the symmetry on the craft you\u0027re building so that each part \u0022branch\u0022 maintains only one symmetry. If you want to force a subbranch that\u0027s placed symmetrical to a different symmetry than its parent (s), you could try building it separately as a subassembly, OR by mounting it as a single part to a free node (make the connection point the point you plan to connect it by to its parent), build the subbranch there, then pick up the subassembly and remount it to its parent in the parent\u0027s symmetry; the subassembly is (hopefully!) mirrored/radialed as it is originally constructed. And, if you\u0027re not averse to mods, get StripSymmetry, in case you really need to tell the symmetry tool to behave. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T14:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found a way to strip symmetry without a mod. All you need is to set the symmetrical part as root. (then you can reset the root back to wherever it was). You may need to set the one directly attached to the non-symetric \u0022core\u0022 part, e.g. 4 sets of fuel tanks with nose cones and engines attached by radial decouplers to the main rocket - it\u0027s one (any) of the decouplers that needs to be set as root.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
