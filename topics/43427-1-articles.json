It would work - if the ring was strong enough and in a high enough orbit - if it were in a perfectly circular orbit where the net gravitational force would be zero, however as soon as the orbit becomes even slightly elliptical, the periapsis (being closer) is pulled in slightly more than the apoapsis (being further away), bringing the periapsis in closer and thus pushing the apoapsis further away, eventually resulting in the ring colliding with the planet and causing immense damage to the atmosphere. I really can\u0027t see what kind of propulsion engine could do any meaningful orbital correction for a structure of that scale, so it doesn\u0027t seem feasible physically (I mean, ignoring all the other engineering problems). Interestingly, the opposite (a repulsive force on a surrounding ring) is stable, which I believe is used in some applications of electromagnetism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, it could work and achieve pretty much the same function if you instead had a lot of disconnected mini-stations all orbiting close together at the same altitude behind one another. You could freely move from one to the next with a tiny burn/retroburn (like jetpack, or even jumping if they are close enough) and only minor orbital corrections to account for momentum transfer. Actually, that would kind of work in KSP, though you\u0027d be constantly loading parts of the station and it would be very fragile. But.. it would work on some level. (I assume you would edit the parts into orbit automatically, doing it by hand would be near impossible to get accurate enough and very time-consuming).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-22T07:16:27Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2013 07:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Bacterius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crater","CreatedById":48907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T08:40:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your original question about how many... if you used station-parts that were 100m long, which is huuuuuge in KSP terms, you would need in the region of fifty thousand launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as has been said, the game engine has a maximum single-vessel size of about 2300m by default, so the physics engine would fail on the 24th.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, ring-stations are gravitationally unstable.
