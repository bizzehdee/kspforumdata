Doing a test, the ship starts out with 1564m/s main engine delta v plus RCS, the inclination change done as requested used 400m/s, the burn to rendezvous used 276m/s, closing speed to the target was then reduced by 155m/s. After that the tutorial gets you to switch to RCS to knock off the last 40-50m/s and do the low speed docking steps. All up I used 55% of the LFO and 25% of the monoprop so there\u0027s some margin for error. Ignoring the tutorial steps you could save some delta v on the plane change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rollo1002","CreatedById":145192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T09:11:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell being very new to the game.

I can\u0027t be the only one fumbling through this so either the instructions are poorly written or some critical steps are not clear enough. When creating tutorials it\u0027s easy to assume it\u0027s ok because prior game knowledge clouds the true first time through experience.
