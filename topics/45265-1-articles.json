Therefore being able to recover decoupled items would be beneficial as they can be reused rather than having to purchase replacements all the time. So I want my parts to stop being destroyed whenever I decouple them in launch. I have tried having parachutes attached that deploy at the time of decouple. Within the atmosphere this works most of the time, also helps keep the parts out of the way. Sometimes though, the parachutes don\u0027t survive for whatever reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is that it would be great to be able to attach a parachute that will auto deploy at under 15000m or something after the part has be decoupled. This should allow for parts decoupled outside of the atmosphere to reenter before chute deployment and allow the parts to make a soft landing and be recovered for reuse. I would think that they work similarly to now. Part deploy at preset level and then fully deploy at 500m from ground level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this is clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts are welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T12:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood idea,but the problem come from game limitation(the 2.5km physic sphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever,I hope that the dev do something to allow that(like,all the parts coming from the rocket have physic enabled)!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carlorizzante","CreatedById":144682,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T11:03:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOld thread but... might this help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64227-1-0-2-Smart-Parts-v1-6-5-Proximity-Sensor-Bug-Fixes-May-17\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64227-1-0-2-Smart-Parts-v1-6-5-Proximity-Sensor-Bug-Fixes-May-17\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAltimeter\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E-------------------\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECapable of detecting when the craft hits a specified altitude, and if it\u0027s ascending, descending, or either, and then firing an action group or staging.
