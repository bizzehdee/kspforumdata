So he cancelled his upcoming TMI burn maneuver and instead plotted a slingshot to the inner system. After a 3 year chase, Jeb exhausted his remaining RCS fuel and rendezvoused with the Goliath stack. Since his Monkeylauncher \u0027Kspam Kan\u0027 capsule was not fitted with a docking port, he had to spacewalk across to join Bill in his capsule, and they lit out for home. Jeb was in too much of a hurry to get home to plot a landing, and they splashed down in the middle of the southern ocean. Recovery vessels are now on route.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage: A happy day for Jeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0026lt;a  href=\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003Ehttp://s6.postimg.org/ca94lvjs1/Jeb_Rescue_2.jpg\u0027 alt=\u0027Jeb_Rescue_2.jpg\u0027\u0026gt; \u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimage.org/app.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Escreencast\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Account","CreatedById":74152,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T00:34:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027s at a research base at Laythe at my career mode save, getting me loads of science.

He had been waiting a couple of days for rescue and didn\u0027t want to walk 10Km so he elected to fly using his manuvering pack. As he would have run out of fuel at the 6 or 7 km mark going a survivable speed, he elected to exceed his suit tolerences. It was not his smartest move.
