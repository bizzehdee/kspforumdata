I had several 20-minute circularization burns I had to do (I was placing solar satellites in low solar orbit for KSPI microwave transmission), and my decently-sized ship (It had 3 ~20 part satellites stuck to it, and it had about ~30 parts itself) was fine for the most part at 3x warp. I couldn\u0027t use 4x as the docking port would get squished and cause it to start to drift sideways, but 3x was more than enough to make it bearable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
