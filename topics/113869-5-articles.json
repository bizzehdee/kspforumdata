In the case of KSP the ability to have multiple copies of KSP (same version or different) which keeps all the associated saves within it makes it much easier (and safer) to run different versions or different mod sets and not get problems because you accidentally load a save from the central location that is incompatible with the KSP you are running (or the mods) and results in breaking of the save (e.g. deletion of vessels that contain parts that aren\u0027t installed)."},{"CreatedByName":"MKellerBR","CreatedById":144229,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T12:03:49Z","Content":"All \u0022original\u0022 Scenarios, with vessels, are with problems for me!\n\nIn the tutorial Docking the ship just explode!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazmaniak","CreatedById":131131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T13:05:28Z","Content":"Hi,\n\nI\u0027m making another approach to Sun low orbit an I equiped my probe with new cooling system BUT, not the whole ship, it\u0027s only where I applied new parts everything is shaking like crazy, do you knnow whats wrong?\n\nThx"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T13:10:47Z","Content":"This is not really the place for it, you\u0027d be better off asking in General/Gameplay Questions and Tutorials.\n\nFor what it\u0027s worth, I suspect you may have some clipping going on.
