The dimensions are a bit off, as the tank is bit larger, and I think a proper texture is needed. Other than that, a half size 3.5 m tank might also be a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess there should be a license here, but I don\u0027t know much about licenses types. Which one is the one for \u0022do as you wish, just say I\u0027ve started it\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a download link\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/vmt9znz1yc8fnla/Large_ore_tank.rar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/vmt9znz1yc8fnla/Large_ore_tank.rar\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
