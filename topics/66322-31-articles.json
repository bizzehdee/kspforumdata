I made it very clear in the post you incompletely cited that there is an expectation of a certain level of communication on the part of the developer. I refer to Minecraft here because they were important pioneers in how this \u0022pre-release\u0022 system works. A lot of people on these forums like to dump on Minecraft for whatever reason, but the fact is they wouldn\u0027t be playing KSP right now if Minecraft hadn\u0027t paved the way for pre-release. SQUAD is capitalizing their release model, but they\u0027re doing a poor job of dealing with the model\u0027s pitfalls. Before and after the commercial release, they\u0027ve been, IMO, very clear about the features they\u0027re working on and what to expect. They can effectively communicate with the community, but rarely give concrete release dates for patches. Features sometimes don\u0027t show up in the patches they were aiming for, \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ebut thats almost never a surprise when the patch launches.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E Failure to actively communicate with the community leads to the problems we see in this thread.

One speaks to the professionalism of the outfit and how people perceive the quality of the product; the other is simply catering (or not) to the tastes of the public, and whether or not the product matches the taste of particular consumers. There\u0027s not much they can do about people\u0027s individual tastes, but there is a certain amount they can do to limit the evidence available to support accusations that may arise of the company\u0027s lack of professionalism.
