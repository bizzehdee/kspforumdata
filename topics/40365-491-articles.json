People that are seeing it start, then fizzle out should look at their resource bar to understand the issue. After you are placed on the pad you\u0027ll see your Megajoule resource bar start to increase. Once you\u0027ve passed 2500 you have enough power to start the DT Vista. If after you start the engine you see the MJ resource bar decrease, then the engine will turn off when you go below 2500 MJ. What is happening is that the reactor and may look good on paper, but their efficiency is dependent on the thermal gradient set between the core temperature and the heat radiating capacity of your radiator setup. Sometimes it is impossible, because of space or weight, to put enough radiators to increase the efficiency to where you want it, and you have to live with some loss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also very important to select the correct size and mode for your generator. Using generators smaller than the reactor diameter may seem attractive to save weight, but they simply don\u0027t have the output to keep the MJ bar filled against a DT Vista firing. Better to use the same diameter generator, and ensure that it is set to the correct mode in the assembly building. KTEC if you\u0027re using core temperature, or direct conversion if you\u0027re using charged particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETalking about charged particles, the magnetic nozzles require them exclusively. Megajoules are worthless to them. There are a very few generators that produce them, namely the upgraded Sethlands and Akulas, as well as the upgraded fusions running on He3 mode. He3 is now available for purchase in the assembly building for v525 per unit. To switch fuels, simply right click on the reactor in the assembly building, drag the current fuel bar down to zero, and increase the desired fuel bar while watching your funds disappear. A big mistake that some people make with magnetic nozzles is to put a direct conversion generator on the reactor. This is precisely the wrong thing to do, as the generator will convert charged particles to MJ, thus taking them away from your nozzles (if you need MJ out of the reactor use its thermal power in KTEC mode and leave the particles alone.) Finally, Magnetic nozzles have zero thrust in atmosphere, so they\u0027re not suitable for orbital launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, though, I\u0027m seeing bugs with both the Fusion reactors and the magnetic nozzles themselves. The my fusion reactors are showing only Lithium as fuel since I upgraded to 0.13, and they don\u0027t seem to perform according to their stats. My magnetic nozzles show zero fuel flow with full charged particles and fuel lines into the nozzle and reactor well outside the atmosphere *shrug*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the DT Vista works great so long as you don\u0027t use it to rendezvous/dock with manned craft.
