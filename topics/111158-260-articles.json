A thick skin is needed to do this job, and we\u0027re very picky about the type of person we invite onto the team-- being unflappable is important.\n\nSo, if a user just happens to have a really abrasive style, and they\u0027re rude or obnoxious to us in *\u003Cu\u003Eprivate\u003C/u\u003E* (e.g. PMs to moderators), then as long as it doesn\u0027t rise to the level of actual threats or harassment, mostly it\u0027s no skin off our nose and we let them vent.  (There\u0027s a good reason for that:  We get a fair number of angry PMs, and we\u0027re okay with that.  Few people *\u003Cu\u003Elike\u003C/u\u003E* getting moderated, and it\u0027s not uncommon for us to receive irate feedback about our actions or inaction.  We try to give people latitude in such private communication, because we *\u003Cu\u003Eshould\u003C/u\u003E* welcome feedback, to help keep us honest and make sure we\u0027re doing our job well.  So as long as a person\u0027s not being threatening or engaging in harassing behavior, we try to cut them a lot of slack.)\n\nUsers who engage in inappropriate behavior in *\u003Cu\u003Epublic\u003C/u\u003E*, on the other hand (such as openly contesting moderation) are subject to appropriate consequences.  But in such cases, it\u0027s because they broke the *\u003Cu\u003Eforum rules\u003C/u\u003E*, not because they annoyed us personally.\n\n\u0022Never moderate angry.\u0022  It\u0027s a pretty important principle we follow.  We make a point of using the forum rules as our yardstick, not our personal feelings.  (We *\u003Cu\u003Eare\u003C/u\u003E* only human, though, so please don\u0027t push it, okay?)  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"AtomicTech","CreatedById":210823,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-01T15:20:25Z","Content":"What happens if I\u0027ve made a new forums account because I haven\u0027t been able to access my old one for sometime?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-01T19:30:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, UXW-20 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What happens if I\u0027ve made a new forums account because I haven\u0027t been able to access my old one for sometime?\n\u003E \n\nEach person may only have one account, so we\u0027d need to merge them.
