I don\u0027t think it could get into space - space planes are a nasty mixture of problems from both sides of the coin. Combining the issues of flight and rocketry. But it could make it to the North Pole if you lightened it a tad. I think you will have to do some tests and see how far it gets - then drop some parts and try to add more fuel. I can\u0027t give more advice as I am better at making space ships than planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, if you are using rocket fuel you don\u0027t need air intakes. Unless you switch to jet fuel only. You may wish to check to see what tanks you are using.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
