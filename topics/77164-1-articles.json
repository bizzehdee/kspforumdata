It isn\u0027t easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step is to put the parts together. Easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you have to test it. Sounds easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then you have to make adjustments. Sounds hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, maybe you should consider one of the plus sides of testing it and making adjustments: (It\u0027s kinda funny though)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-C5YX0KLtvSk/U74W3iy8kLI/AAAAAAAAA_k/gL2uvfGuFhI/w1038-h584-no/screenshot86.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot86.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zVgH-rloYjw/U74W3Uz28tI/AAAAAAAAA_g/so_zjNTAK_I/w1038-h584-no/screenshot87.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot87.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it isn\u0027t really looking like the real Constitution, but I like how it looks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, so I built it up, ran the test, and... like in the first pic, it slants down. Then I made another adjustments and it did it again. Then I made more adjustments (mainly by adding struts), I\u0027ve managed to stabilize it. Then I realized the engines are off. So I made more adjustments and finally got a good product. But then I realized the CoG is off and the engines are destroyed when the ship gets too fast in the water... If you know how to improve it, tell me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, download here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4tG_PxGhuGIRnhtVm15aDRDTVE/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4tG_PxGhuGIRnhtVm15aDRDTVE/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods required: Romfarer Lazor (maybe, recommended), Sunbeam Laser (a must).

That was after the fourth edit (for some reason I didn\u0027t take that series of screenshots). Only the engines broke, and before that it went forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for getting it larger: My computer is a 2010 MSI S6000 laptop that is already past its prime and runs rather mediocre on KSP, and the amount of mods I have on KSP put the computer on the limit. If I put too much parts it might kill the laptop (I still don\u0027t get why my laptop didn\u0027t burn out after some 200 parts in one scenario). It really isn\u0027t for gaming, but I still use it to game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be improving this soon, hopefully speeding it up and making sure engines don\u0027t get destroyed and possibly adding more guns. NOTE: I couldn\u0027t make it sailing on water, so I have the engines to do it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-11T01:41:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2014 01:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Designer225\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KandoKris","CreatedById":103873,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T10:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAd an extr stock copy of the game to try for bigger part count craft\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KandoKris","CreatedById":103873,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T10:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI havn\u0027t done a tall ship before have done a few others but\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UAQK6bk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UAQK6bk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand if I want guns I make rockets and missiles to go on them\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Designer225","CreatedById":48514,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T01:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try for that.
