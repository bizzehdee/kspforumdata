Looking at my textbook map, this idea seemed kind of ridiculous because a straight line doesn\u0027t bring you anywhere near Iceland. You\u0027d need curved maps or 3D maps. I don\u0027t think I outright believed him, but I have been on enough flights since to know that this effect does affect a plane\u0027s trajectory. I just still don\u0027t have an exact idea how much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow it seems I have a problem along a similar vein. I did a long distance data collection contract and noticed I was constantly adjusting my course because I kept tracking the indicator on the navball for the first objective. I started out at 207\u003Cspan\u003E\u00B0\u003C/span\u003E and near my destination it had shifted to something like 250\u003Cspan\u003E\u00B0\u003C/span\u003E.

And by the time you get there your magnetic bearing will have changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see how this can be any different in flight - apart from the fact that the atmosphere is moving both you and the target at the same time, so you don\u0027t even have to worry about the target moving out of your orbital path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027d say that the only reason you had to adjust your course was because SAS was trying to keep you on a constant magnetic bearing. If you had been in perfectly level flight without SAS, your aircraft would have ended up following the navigation sign all on its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way to really check this is to move the camera on the map so that you and the target are both as central as possible on the view of the planet. Halfway there, you should be right in the middle of that view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd also - that screenshot picture you put up is wrong. You most definitely do NOT want to follow the yellow or green lines, because they are not the shortest route.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing back to your example, starting at 207\u00B0 and ending up at 250\u00B0 sounds perfectly reasonable and accurate. The red lines on your screenshot show a final bearing which is over 270\u00B0, which would be a bit much.

That would be true if you left the atmosphere first, but not otherwise since you\u0027d have to travel through more atmosphere to stay at \u0022midday\u0022 and meet your target half a day later. That means going faster, and if you\u0027re going to go faster, you\u0027d be better off going faster straight to the target and meeting it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebefore\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it gets to midday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you are driving on the surface, there is no doubt that aiming straight is the only way to go. If you are really high in the atmosphere, however, it might pay off to consider yourself to be suborbital and compromise, especially since the atmosphere will have a lower rotational velocity as you approach the poles. But you\u0027ll still be pushing through more atmosphere to follow what, from orbit, looks like a shorter path\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
