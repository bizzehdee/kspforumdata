The celestial bodies would also have to be changed to be near identical to the KSP1 ones so your landed craft wouldn\u2019t be in the air or underground or on water. You\u2019d also have to disable some features they said they\u2019re implementing, like collidable ground scatter, because your saved craft could end up inside a boulder.
