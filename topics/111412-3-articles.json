Val died on impact due to too few chutes and too little thrust in the waters of Kerbin. Now she should have shown up as MIA but not only did she not show up as MIA but... suddenly the tool bar was showing up in the astronaut complex, and I was getting out of range errors. Now I did death tests with non-big four kerbals in my testing phase without issue. So now I have to isolate this problem. Just wanted to give a heads up to anyone using this mod that there may be an issue here that could break your save. I was able to \u0027undo\u0027 the damage by modifying the persistent save file and changing her status from \u0027dead\u0027 to Available for now, but will try to isolate the problem and fix it in a hopefully soon to come update.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter poking this with a sharp stick repeatedly, the issue was NOT that Val had died. The issue revolved around a \u0027cloned\u0027 kerbal on my minmus base that was causing an exception error when it tried to complete the \u0027roster\u0027 section of the astronaut complex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis clone issue /appears/ to be related to either KIS or some other mod I have in that when a kerbal tries to re-enter a pod it has them reenter but leaves a copy outside. This copy can cause huge errors in the system. That is what just happened. Typically I do not seem to have it happen unless the kerbal was part of a KIS/KAS function. I will be checking to see how that relates but with the \u0027cloned\u0027 kerbal removed everything else returned to normal pretty much instantly in my game, and I was unable to replicate the problem any other way. So for now I am attributing it to that, which while it does effect my mod seems like it would effect anyone\u0027s saved game if they had a cloned kerbal in this particular situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince KIS/KAS are not part of the AVC I was unaware there was an update on May 31st. It appears this update /should/ take care of this issue, at least that is what the support thread here indicates:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124315-Kerbals-cloning-themselves-when-entering-capsule\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124315-Kerbals-cloning-themselves-when-entering-capsule\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case I have updated both KAS and KIS and will see if this resolves the issue going forward.
