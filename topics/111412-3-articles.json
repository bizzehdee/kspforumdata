Val died on impact due to too few chutes and too little thrust in the waters of Kerbin. Now she should have shown up as MIA but not only did she not show up as MIA but... suddenly the tool bar was showing up in the astronaut complex, and I was getting out of range errors. Now I did death tests with non-big four kerbals in my testing phase without issue. So now I have to isolate this problem. Just wanted to give a heads up to anyone using this mod that there may be an issue here that could break your save. I was able to \u0027undo\u0027 the damage by modifying the persistent save file and changing her status from \u0027dead\u0027 to Available for now, but will try to isolate the problem and fix it in a hopefully soon to come update.\n\nAfter poking this with a sharp stick repeatedly, the issue was NOT that Val had died. The issue revolved around a \u0027cloned\u0027 kerbal on my minmus base that was causing an exception error when it tried to complete the \u0027roster\u0027 section of the astronaut complex.\n\nThis clone issue /appears/ to be related to either KIS or some other mod I have in that when a kerbal tries to re-enter a pod it has them reenter but leaves a copy outside. This copy can cause huge errors in the system. That is what just happened. Typically I do not seem to have it happen unless the kerbal was part of a KIS/KAS function. I will be checking to see how that relates but with the \u0027cloned\u0027 kerbal removed everything else returned to normal pretty much instantly in my game, and I was unable to replicate the problem any other way. So for now I am attributing it to that, which while it does effect my mod seems like it would effect anyone\u0027s saved game if they had a cloned kerbal in this particular situation.\n\nEdit:\n\nSince KIS/KAS are not part of the AVC I was unaware there was an update on May 31st. It appears this update /should/ take care of this issue, at least that is what the support thread here indicates:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124315-Kerbals-cloning-themselves-when-entering-capsule](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124315-Kerbals-cloning-themselves-when-entering-capsule)\n\nIn any case I have updated both KAS and KIS and will see if this resolves the issue going forward. Just wanted to update folks on the situation.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T18:26:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 06:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OakTree42**\n  \nAdding info about duplicates"},{"CreatedByName":"aquilux","CreatedById":23859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T05:48:53Z","Content":"Is there any way to leave the gender selection off?

Which is not to say they are gone completely but maybe I just haven\u0027t found them yet. \n\nBut since no other mod that I know of does what I do with the UI in this situation, I have no other mod to use as a reference point and there is pretty much only documentation created by other modders for this kind of thing and since no other modder that I know has a mod that does this... you get the idea.\n\nSo trial and error, searching and trying to piece this together are all I can do, and that will take time. I got the button working no problem (the little acorn guy) but that\u0027s on the KSC screen.\n\nAnd before you ask, no the changes to the building in R\u0026D is just changing a cfg file from what I can tell, not actually over-riding the actual display.
