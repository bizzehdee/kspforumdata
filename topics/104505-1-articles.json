If you got an idea just inform them in this thread ![:)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/uploads/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nWhat this mod pack contains:\n\n- ~~AutoBalancingLandingLeg~~ **(Currently not maintained)**\n- ~~EditorCamExtension~~ **(Currently not maintained)**\n- FPSLimiter\n- FPSViewer\n- ~~FillSpotsWithTourists~~ **(Currently not maintained)**\n- ModifiedExplosionPotential\n- PhysicalTimeRatioViewer\n- RecoverAll\n- DestroyAll\n- KerbalScienceExchange\n- DailyFunds\n\n* * *\n\n**[FPSLimiter:](https://kerbokatz.github.io/#SmallUtilities-FPSLimiter)**\n\nThe engineers found a dramatic issue with their life simulator which was running way too fast while they had their backs turned to it. Thinking about how the world wants to reduce power consumption to be \u0022green\u0022 they quickly found a fix for it.\n\nThis small tool was created after i was browsing the forums and [a post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115902) came to my attention which wanted to \u0022stop the fan from running\u0022.\n\nOf course this tool doesn\u0027t stop the fan (warranty void by reading this!) but it does something way more \u0022healthy\u0022 and useful. It limits the fps (frames per second) while kerbal is running in the background causing it to use less CPU \u0026 GPU cycles. In the end the CPU \u0026 GPU run cooler and the fans spin down ![:)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/uploads/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\n[![wnczz7V.png](http://i.imgur.com/wnczz7V.png)](http://imgur.com/wnczz7V)\n\n* * *\n\n**[FPSViewer:](https://kerbokatz.github.io/#SmallUtilities-FPSViewer)**\n\nSome of you wished a simple and easy way to display the current game fps.\n\nLeft-Clicking will toggle the fps on/off\n\nRight-clicking on the menu entry will get you to the settings. Here you can set if you want it to be always displayed on top of everything. Something else you can do here, is reset the min/max fps counter, this is especially useful to benchmark a specific scene.\n\n![q21kUUl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/q21kUUl.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n**[ModifiedExplosionPotential](https://kerbokatz.github.io/#SmallUtilities-ModifiedExplosionPotential):**\n\nThis little mod is very simple and modifies the explosion potential in order to create bigger or smaller explosions.\n\nFor example an empty fuel tank won\u0027t look much like an explosion. On the other hand a full tank will explode in a flashy explosion.\n\nCan\u0027t really show what this does in a picture.\n\n* * *\n\n**[PhysicalTimeRatioViewer:](https://kerbokatz.github.io/#SmallUtilities-PhysicalTimeRatioViewer)**\n\nThis little plugin displays a simple layer much like FPSViewer to compare ingame vs real time speed.\n\nWanted to know by how much the time slows down with that 1000 part craft ? Now you can find out!\n\nDo you want to view/change the MaxDeltaTime ? This is the mod for you!\n\n[![Rqd5cjd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Rqd5cjd.jpg)](http://imgur.com/Rqd5cjd)\n\n* * *\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbokatz.github.io/#SmallUtilities-RecoverAll\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERecoverAll\u003C/a\u003E \u0026 \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbokatz.github.io/#SmallUtilities-DestroyAll\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDestroyAll\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\nThese mods initial had their own thread. But since they are so small we decided we would merge it with this pack!\n\nWhat it does:\n\nBasically,as the name implies, allows you to recover/destroy all vessels with a single push of a button. These mods only show up in the tracking station.\n\n* * *\n\n**[KerbalScienceExchange](https://kerbokatz.github.io/#SmallUtilities-KerbalScienceExchange)**\n\nWith this tiny tool you can exchange your science for funds or vice versa.\n\n![r4gUTO7.png](http://i.imgur.com/r4gUTO7.png)\n\n* * *\n\n**[DailyFunds](https://kerbokatz.github.io/#SmallUtilities-DailyFunds)**\n\nThis tool gives you 100 funds per day for every positive reputation point you have.\n\n* * *\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EFAQ\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n**Q: How do i install this one or all of these mods ?**\n\nA: To install only one of the mods pick the respective archive on the download sites. You can mix them up too if you want to use multiple of them. The zip files are all structured so that you only have to extract them into your kerbal folder and overwrite the folder.\n\n**Q: How do i uninstall one of these mods ?**\n\nA: I\u0027m sorry that you want to do that. Just remove the respective folder in your \u0022GameData\\KerboKatz\\SmallUtilities\u0022 folder. If you aren\u0027t using any of our other mods you can remove the \u0022KerboKatz\u0022 folder too. If you have a few minutes please tell us what you didn\u0027t like about this mod. So we can improve it.\n\n**Q: One of these mods isn\u0027t working ?!!!!**\n\nA: Make sure you got the KerboKatzUtilities. If you do so please post your output\\_log so we can investigate your issues.\n\n**Q: I installed with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E and it\u0027s not working!**\n\nA: Even though we let \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E generate meta files for our mods we don\u0027t actively check if its actually working or has the newest version. In cases with issues that can\u0027t be reproduced with a manual install, it\u0027s suggested to take it to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E guys.\n\n**Q: How do i access these mods ?**\n\nA: In general right-clicking opens their settings menus. By left-clicking you will usually toggle a function like the fps layer(FPSViewer) or toggle between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E mode(EditorCamExtension). Some of the mods on the other hand don\u0027t have any settings or toggle able functions and they only work on specific cases like when you are on the launchpad(FillSpotsWithTourists) or during the flight scene start up(DisableTempGauges). Another case are mods(Afterburner) only add part modules in those cases ModuleManager is required to add these modules to parts. And then there are mods that do things in the background without doing having any in-game settable settings and only work in specific scenes like ModifiedExplosionPotential.\n\n**Q: I have issues with one of these mods.**\n\nA: Please post your output\\_log, detailed description and reproduction steps so we can investigate your issues.\n\n**Q: I have a suggestion for one of your mods or an idea for a new mod.**\n\nA: Just post it in this thread. We always like new ideas. But please be aware that some things might not be doable.\n\n**Q: I like your mods how can i thank you ?**\n\nA: Just post something in this thread. We like reputation points too ![:wink:](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/uploads/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif).

So i create this little tool that asks after launching if you want to fill up your free spots with tourists.\n\nIf you don\u0027t want to take your tourists on this trip you can simply press \u0022No\u0022 or just launch your vessel.\n\n* * *\n\n**AutoBalancingLandingLeg:**\n\nI\u0027m sure you landed on as many slopes as i did and the craft was always not even and the slightest tough would tip it over. To solve this problem we send our engineers on a journey to find a way to solve this issue. After many sleepless nights and cups of coffee (they raided the local store for all the coffee they had) they came to a solution. It\u0027s not a very elegant one but hey \u0022It Works!\u0022.\n\nRequires [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219)(Not included).\n\nCan be used without KerboKatzUtilities.\n\n* * *\n\n**Afterburner:**\n\nEngineers at KerboKatz were standing in front of an issue. They need a tiny bit more thrust to take off the short runway. This required more engines but these engines would not be needed shortly after taking off. So they were trying to solve this problem without adding even more mass to their crafts. During one night the lead engineers woke up in the middle of the night and had a brilliant idea: Why not just increase the fuel flow ? This would result in less efficiency and more heat generated but since it was only needed for takeoff that wasn\u0027t such a huge deal. Many sleepless night later they finally managed to build an upgrade for their jets. They called it Afterburner.\n\nThis requires [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219)(Not included) to apply the patch to \u0022J-33 \u0027Wheesley\u0027 Basic Jet Engine\u0022,\u0022J-X4 \u0027Whiplash\u0027 Turbo Ramjet Engine\u0022 and \u0022CR-7 R.A.P.I.E.R. Engine\u0022(Air breathing only).\n\nThis works with multimode engines too.\n\nHow to add the afterburner module to your own engine:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E @PART[JetEngine]{//this should be self explanatory\n\u003E       MODULE{\n\u003E         name = Afterburner\n\u003E         thrustBonus = 25 // How much the thrust will get increased by turning on the afterburner in %. In this example the thrust would be increased by 25%\n\u003E         fuelEfficencyDecrease = 30 // How much more fuel will be consumed. This reduces the ISP at all atmosphere levels. This will reduce the engines efficiency by 30%\n\u003E         heatIncrease = 50 // How much more heat will be generated. When this is set to 0 the engine will heat up the same as if the afterburner was off.\n\u003E         engineID = Cruise // If your part uses MultiModeEngine(like the rapier) and you want the afterburner to only affect one of the engine\u0027s modes use this to define which one. Leave empty if the part only has one engine or you want to use the same values for all engines.\n\u003E       }\n\u003E     }\n\u003E \n\n* * *\n\n**DisableTempGauges:**\n\nIn KSP 1.0.1 Squad introduced temperature gauges. They are awesome but cause a nasty memory leak. You can disable them by pressing F10 but it isn\u0027t persistent and has to be pressed every time you launch a new craft or go to the flight scene.\n\nThis mod disables them when you go to the flight scene. If you wish to see them again you can press F10 to enable them.\n\nNo pics for this one as there is nothing to see.\n\nThis mod doesn\u0027t require the KerboKatzUtilities.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-18T19:46:56Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2019 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceTiger**"},{"CreatedByName":"iDInkeD06","CreatedById":141151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T14:42:16Z","Content":"This can be interessant and offer many possibilities in the future.\n\nIf this mod is continued it can be very useful.\n\nDownloaded ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T14:54:38Z","Content":"Interesting.

Cause of this a lower fps count means less physics calculations and slower game speed. I made the observation that fps over 35 seems a little moot and with 20 it\u0027s still decent.

Zoom in/out seems to be backwards compared to default KSP. For example, in the VAB Shift\u002BMouse Wheel Up zooms out instead of in.\n\nOh is it ? I\u0027ll change that\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Some funky interaction with Editor Extensions. EE has a spacebar hot key that re-centers your view. After using spacebar when the scroll view up/down is used camera switches to the default VAB viewing angle.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks!\n\nYeah Editor Extensions thought that it might be a problem. I\u0027ll see if i can fix these issues."},{"CreatedByName":"hazens1","CreatedById":129789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:54:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can move it by right clicking on the \u0022FPSViewer\u0022 toolbar entry which will open its settings menu-\u003E Click on Change position and drag the tiny little window that pops up over it where you want it to be.\n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah Editor Extensions thought that it might be a problem.

Any plans to incorporate this to use Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar?
