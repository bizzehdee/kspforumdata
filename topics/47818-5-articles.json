I got tired of planes draining their batteries if left to idle, I got tired of the planes somehow not carrying enough juice to operate the damn antennas and alternator output not being enough to run the antennas continuously. So I stuck a 1.25m fission reactor (I have fusion unlocked, but honestly I just want something that just plain works, and the 1.25 fission core is wonderfully reliable and insanely long-lasting for a mission on Kerbin,) a Brayon Cycle thermal generator, and two radiator stacks in the belly of the plane. They\u0027re quite beneficial to the plane\u0027s center of mass, since they\u0027re centered left-right but lower than the fuselage\u0027s center, which helps offset that gigantor tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hilarious thing is how badly this thing breaks reality.
