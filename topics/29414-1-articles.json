Unfortunately, I run a Mac, and I know some other folks are probably in the same boat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I created a Python script that does the same thing and runs on Mac and UNIX. (Runs on Windows too, but it\u0027s more work than ph34rb0t\u0027s .bat file so you\u0027re honestly better off with that) To use it, do the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDownload a Python interpreter.

On Mac you can do this by right-clicking a \u0022.py\u0022 file, picking \u0022Get Info\u0022, opening the \u0022Open With\u0022 tab, and choosing \u0022Python Launcher\u0022. Not sure how to do it on other systems.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESet up your folders. Make a folder inside \u0022GameData\u0022 named after the mod you want to update, e.g. \u0022NovaPunch\u0022. Inside that folder, make one called \u0022Parts\u0022. Inside the \u0022Parts\u0022 folder, set up sub folders using one or more of the following category names, the same as Squad uses for their parts: \u0022Aero\u0022, \u0022Command\u0022, \u0022Electrical\u0022, \u0022Engine\u0022, \u0022FuelTank\u0022, \u0022Structural\u0022, \u0022Utility\u0022, and \u0022Wheel\u0022. You do not have to use all of these names, as long as you use some of them. Move your parts into these folders, according to the category you want them to show up under in the VAB/SPH\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECopy the \u0022main.py\u0022 script into the \u0022Parts\u0022 folder. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE that the script is in the \u0022Parts\u0022 folder, that the folder contains one or more of the category folders given above, and that those category folders contain ONLY parts folders- no interiors, ships, etc. Failure to do so will cause the script to crash.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERun the script. On Mac, you should be able to do that by just clicking as long as you have associated the .py file type with your Python Interpreter.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this only updates the part.cfg files. If the 3D models for the parts don\u0027t work with 0.20, this doesn\u0027t do anything about that. But it gets you part of the way there until the addon folks get to do proper updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETested on my copy of KSP 0.20 on Mac OS 10.7 and it works fine.
