I clicked the comments, and low an behold he was under attack. Granted this guy didn\u0027t do much to get the LS/NLS effects, but the beach assault was on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I don\u0027t mind constructive criticism myself, generally I laugh at the lot that \u0022insult\u0022 me. But this space port is becoming rotten. It should be renamed to Mos Eisley because it has become \u0022a wretched hive of scum and villainy\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the reason for this post is to find out how many of you have had it with the bullies? There are a few, I have compiled a list, but I feel that the mods on here won\u0027t allow the list to become public domain. \u0022 NO WAY! WAY!\u0022 I\u0027m sure many of you have encountered them, if not just browse the comments on objects to see who they are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to those that wish to slice up a cfg file, and have some fun, BRAVO! Keep at it. The spaceport crap is free, remember? Free is good. If some guy likes flinging Kerb\u0027s at the planet near the SOL, and he wishes us to see it, then cool. If some lonely nerd wants us to see his Picasso masterpiece of his version of e Apollo moon lander, BRAVO! The point is this, I\u0027m tired of the bullies that hide behind a keyboard and monitor declaring to the world how awesome they are and slamming the guy who only got this game for fun.
