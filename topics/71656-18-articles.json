I was never able to resume control of this vessel even after undock, It didnt show up in the ship roster at the space center, or on the map. .. another time, me and my son docked two rovers beside KSP runway, after we docked, his screen showed us docked, and he had control, nose to nose, but when he tried to back up, they tried to pull apart. but his rover vanished on my screen, but I still had control of mine on my end(rovers had same name, copies of same exact ship) and he was unable to undock. .. we tried again afterwards with differently named copies of same rover both uploaded to server as a different save name. this time when we docked, I had both ships on my screen and movement was fluid, I could move the docked rovers forward and backwards, but he could not spectate, they had both vanished for him.
