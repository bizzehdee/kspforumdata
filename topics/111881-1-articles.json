Like bad. I am competent enough to make a suicide mission to Eve or Duna but this whole docking/orbiting refuelling depot thing is driving me nuts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I tried going too big too quick. Had a couple mill layin around and decided, go big or stay home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith some help from my friend(s) the twin boars, I put up one ridiculous starter hub with a science station \u002B UKS greenhouse \u002B docking ports \u002B electronics \u002B life support, everything. That was easy. Next I launched up a big orange tank with docking ports and set out to dock it to my hub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E D--------------------------D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED| Orange Tank\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ffffff;\u0022\u003E_____\u003C/span\u003E|D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E D--------------------------D \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I discovered, it is the most difficult thing ever to dock two huge objects together. I tried until I ran out of fuel. Then I launched another orange tank, and tried again. I have Docking Alignment indicator, but the problem is I can never manuever fast enough, even with RCS, to get the monster to line up and slowly connect. I just can\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now my idea is to put up 1 big fuel tank with docking ports, and then dock it to a decent sized KW Rocketry tank(a full ship on its own), and use it as a mule to haul fuel between ships.

No hyperedit used, I can post pictures of the huge lifter if anyone wants them. This was built as a superheavy probe carrier and multi use station, but I\u0027ve used it for refueling quite a few times. Pretty proud of this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe picture doesn\u0027t do it much justice due to the quality, but the trick I found to work was using a HUGE amount of RCS. There is a massive amount near the tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mentioned making a mobile refueling setup. This thing is mobile (designed for a large scale Duna mission, project put on hold), but is a serious fuel guzzler, and was built to accept refueling along the way to its\u0027 destination. Not very practical for what OP is looking for. In my opinion, I think you should go for a large fuel storage setup, put it in a good orbit, and use smaller \u0022slaves\u0022 to detach and carry fuel to where ever needed, if you really need to do that. If you still have issues with docking, I recommend doing some sort of asparagus setup with RCS tanks. RCS was really what made this mission possible, because I packed on a massive amount. And remember, practice makes perfect, so if you can, try it on a smaller (or cheaper) scale and get yourself more familiarized with the RCS tranlation controls.
