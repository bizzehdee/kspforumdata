This is the TIE Avenger. This first appeared in the game *TIE Fighter* and made appearances in *X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter* and *X-Wing Alliance*. The Empire designed this craft based on the TIE Advanced x1 (that fighter Darth Vader flew in the movies). In the TIE Fighter game, it was fast, had shields, was heavily armed, and it could go into hyperspace (though KSP doesn\u0027t have such things). The TIE Avenger I made for this game comes in two flavors. An atmospheric one and an orbital one. The atmospheric one uses RAPIER engines and usually flies around within Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. The orbital version has ion engines and is launched by rocket.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
