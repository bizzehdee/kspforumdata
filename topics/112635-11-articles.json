When the release comes out I\u0027ll detail them but for a brief rundown: all the doors you see are working airlocks (EVA). There will be a passenger module with room for 4 Kerbals, a boiler room (1 Kerbal), and a cargo deck with is essentially just an open area (like the real paddleboats). There\u0027ll also be an adapter. These decks are meant to snap onto the Clipper hull just like the CVE. The adapter will \u0027simulate\u0027 the gunwales on the clipper deck to give these parts a flat, square bottom. Imagine this. You build a paddle wheeler with passenger modules attached to the clipper deck. On top of those decks, you add the adapters and then, snap the CVE deck on top of that. The adapters make a seamless transition for parts that are designed to fit the clipper. If you look close, the first and second deck are made up of only 3 different parts (5 total parts on each deck) with adapters between them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 new engines, a left and right sidewheeler. Unfortunately, KSP doesn\u0027t truly \u0027mirror\u0027 parts. It either copies them radially or laterally. Because of this, there was no way to mirror a single sidewheeler and have the paddle rotate in the proper direction and have both engines thrust forward. If you want to see an example, place an old air scoop on an aircraft with mirror turned on then look closely and look at the wording on it. You\u0027ll see it\u0027s not truly mirrored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the third deck in the pics, or the hurricane deck, you\u0027ll see the Texas. I\u0027m certain in countries other than the US they had other names but, finding anything paddlewheel outside the US is a hit or miss. The Texas was so named because it was the officers quarters. And since they were bigger than the passenger or crew cabins, and since the biggest thing they could think of at the time was Texas, the name stuck. Two parts. A straight section with room for 2 crew and a rounded section (I may make it a 1 crew and add a door).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp top is a new command module, the pilothouse. Most of these on real boats were pretty basic and were more or less designed to keep the pilot out of the weather. Don\u0027t expect much more from this one. While I took some liberties on the Texas, the idea for the pilothouse was a \u0027traditional\u0027 look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you\u0027ll note I have 4 stacks on this one. With 3 engines, it took all of them running to keep positive on steam. (I explained the theory a page or two back) Running 3, it would lose steam but I could still toggle the 4th on and off (that\u0027s at full throttle). And I\u0027m pretty well satisfied with that rate of usage. It took 21 ore and about 15 minutes to run to the Island runway at 45m/s. While that sounds rather slow, there\u0027s lots of junk on this boat and a gob of ore slowing it down. An earlier test with 3 engines on a much lighter boat... I hit 100m/s with little or no problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s still a lot to do but the basic parts, textures, functions are there. Don\u0027t hold your breath waiting.

Floats really well and in the screenshot below there\u0027s an 85\u002B ton rocket sitting on it. I\u0027ve floated much smaller platforms with 300 tons. So, cargo-wise, it can handle some decent size rockets. The failure part. Landing gear do not play well with other parts. Apparently, their collision meshes don\u0027t like interacting with other collision meshes. I\u0027ve had landing gear hang up inside the other meshes and I\u0027ve had them pass completely through a mesh with the rocket falling over. I\u0027ve had the gear break for no apparent reason just sitting on the platform and I\u0027ve had the gear go nuts and shove the platform around in random directions with no engines active. Next problem, connection nodes. Building something this large while still remaining modular is a nightmare. Take a cube for example. If you place 4 nodes around the cube and connect 4 cubes to each node you end up with something that looks like a \u002B. Next, turn that into a square by adding 4 more cubes on the corners. Here\u0027s the problem. When you connect the next 4, you really can\u0027t choose which of the 2 nodes you\u0027re going to connect to and you can only connect to one. In the picture below, I\u0027ve got the 20x20 center section. There are 20 5x5 squares attached to the center, 24 side sections attached to those and 4 corner pieces. At one point I checked and every single square, side and corner piece was connected to ONE 5x5 block and it was the only one connected to the center section. The net result, when it hit the water it flexed like an accordion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, until I come up with some other idea on how to get around landing gear and collision mesh issues, the water landing platform is off the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at least now you know I did a bit more than just consider the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/PlatformTest.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PlatformTest.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T00:15:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe paddlewheeler parts look pretty cool so far, but I\u0027m concerned about the stacks requiring compressed water as you said earlier.
