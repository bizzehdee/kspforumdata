So chances are this Unha-4 might be larger then the previous Unha\u0027s, of course this increases chances of failure. Just a little thing to note.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T20:51:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 08:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xenomorph555**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T20:51:28Z","Content":"While there are works going on at Sohae to adapt it for much larger rockets, it\u0027s doubtful that this work will be done in time for the October test, and there haven\u0027t been any clear signs of significantly larger stages being ground tested.
