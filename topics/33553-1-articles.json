As soon as Bill Kerman connects the two ships, the one with the winch starts to roll over. It will roll over and over and over and it wont stop until I stop rotation with time acceleration. Nothing even breaks! Even if I run into another ship it just rolls over it! Even when I disconnected it, it will keep rolling... forever... It\u0027s kind of hilarious at first, but now it\u0027s annoying. It does it with everything that has the horizontal stack winch. It doesn\u0027t happen when I connect it in undocked mode. But as soon as I switch it to docked mode it rolls over! I haven\u0027t tried the other winch yet. Using the latest version with mechjeb, KAS, and Kethane, all of which are also up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi43.tinypic.com/s3o6df.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022s3o6df.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a winch on the 2 RCS stacks on the right and the fuel truck.
