I will be leaving a large transfer craft in orbit while various modules are deployed to various locations. Once all the objectives are completed, the idea is to bring everyone back to a single re-orbit rocket module, take off and dock up to the transfer craft for the trip home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a prototype rocket that works pretty well... on Kerbin. It doesn\u0027t reach Kerbin orbit, but since drag, atmosphere altitude and orbit radius are all smaller on Duna I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E it has what it needs. That said, experience tells me that Duna\u0027s atmosphere is extremely rarefied compared to Kerbin\u0027s, and since my modules are depending heavily on parachutes to keep them from piling into the ground I want to be sure I\u0027ve calibrated everything (parachute deployment, braking thrusters, horizontal speed control etc) correctly before I attempt the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I want to do is find analogues for Duna on Kerbin - the upper atmosphere of Kerbin is also rarefied, so if I can record data for Duna (with a probe mission) and Kerbin, I can experiment with parachute deployment in Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere and make a \u0027best guess\u0027 to the right settings for Duna. NASA would not send 20 missions to Mars to find out how to land and take off from the surface again, so I don\u0027t see why I should either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not really interested in mods that will pilot the mission for me, I\u0027m much more interested in anything that can help me gather data for scientific analysis so I can apply my findings - yes I enjoy doing it the hard way! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-21T23:25:48Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2014 11:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XOIIO","CreatedById":100854,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T20:00:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting idea, some sort of datalogging mod would be neat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roxette","CreatedById":84963,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T20:37:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re looking for this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/flight-recorder/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/flight-recorder/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T23:24:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat looks like exactly what I\u0027m after, thanks much \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
