The modding community of KSP in an AWESOME asset (call it self-aggrandization, I help develop/maintain two mods myself), and you\u0027d be wise to take advantage of it to spice things up a little... Bored with standard rocket launches? Try a mass driver! Want to fly around on Eve or Duna? KSP-Interstellar Extended Thermal Turbojets work great for that! (as do Firespitter propellers)\n\nUntil 1.0 comes out (which IMHO is going to happen far to soon unless they release another update first- to allow bugs to be discovered/fixed that QA/Experimentals missed, and really ought not to come until they\u0027ve at least switched to Unity 5 and made a performance/polish pass in my humble opinion...) you can keep yourself plenty busy with mods. I \\*strongly\\* suggest giving it a try...\n\nRegards,\n\nNorthstar"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T16:46:40Z","Content":"i can\u0027t install mods\n\nthat is why"},{"CreatedByName":"Guz","CreatedById":105263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T22:57:31Z","Content":"do a stock-only Grand Tour and make a video of it...\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywYtERr-a94?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n... like i did"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T13:45:19Z","Content":"lol no time to do homework now"}]}
