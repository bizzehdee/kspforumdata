Think about what you\u0027re putting together. Several 2.5m segments which are fairly heavy and you\u0027ve got narrow 1.25m docking ports connecting them. The ports are rigid enough when used in conjunction with crafts of a reasonable mass. They\u0027ll never be as rigid as connections between parts made in the VAB though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou really need the 2.5m docking ports to join those pieces and even then, it\u0027s awfully long. If you really can\u0027t condense that design any, then take turning very slowly with the help of RCS. And for things that are so long and with flex to them, you\u0027re better off having your drive section *pulling* the craft. If the CoM is behind the CoT, it dampens the oscillations that occur during burns. The reverse situation tends to amply the flexing and you risk being thrown off your node/breaking your ship apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also, there\u0027s something to be said of transferring components of ships like that individually to their destinations and assembling them on site. So if that whole ship is bound for Duna, send each part separately and dock them in Duna orbit, rather than around Kerbin. Not always the best option, but if you\u0027ve got huge pieces that you actually need to be huge, sometimes it\u0027s more practical to assemble them on the other end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-07T06:16:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2014 06:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Boomerang\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"slavik","CreatedById":93561,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T06:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewoops used my friends login by mistake\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-07T07:36:03Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2014 07:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by slavik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"endl","CreatedById":119320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T06:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eactually that ship is supposed to be all landed on duna as separate craft, the idea was to have one delivery system after achieving orbit for the various modules, i can dock the ship using other ports located perpendicular to the thrust without having to redesign so that its less of a linear configuration but i was hoping for better tolerances between craft in order to deliver bigger designs. seeing as how this is a game and being constrained by a limited design philosophy isnt what i think a agency with an \u0022unlimited budget\u0022 would settle for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif need be i can launch more of the back end of the fuel/booster module and break down the craft further but my goal was to get it there in one shot using one modular system\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Simes","CreatedById":117456,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T08:49:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, look at what Boomerang said.

If you do that then you won\u0027t get much if any wobble, PROVIDED you don\u0027t then turn around and hang lots of heavy stuff on the sides of the module body.

So now it\u0027s like in your pics, heavy 2.5m modules connected by 1.25m ports. In this case, your best bet is to reinforce the joints using KAS struts, which you attach with an EVA Kerbal in orbit after you\u0027ve docked everything together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chrisb2e9","CreatedById":87224,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T00:57:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to what everyone else said, look for Quantum struts. i design my ships so that after they dock, the struts are aimed in such a way that they attach several parts away from the docking port.
