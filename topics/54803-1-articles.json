I think Gemini was a precision splashdown as well, and the Shuttle was fairly high precision as its gliding abilities were only marginally better than an aerodynamic brick. Precision being measured in nautical miles, of course, not feet, for the Gemini and Apollo capsule splashdowns.

That potentially means a significantly bigger craft to start with, if you end up needing to carry another tank to fuel the burn. If you time the de-orbit burn correctly, there should be no need for anything other than relatively minor corrective burns inside the atmosphere (NASA corrected with just aerodynamics from a simple, but clever use of offset CoM, in the case of Gemini and Apollo), and possible final vertical deceleration burn for landing (if you are doing that). The very fact that the question has been asked about the maths tells me that the OP is interested in doing the efficient, \u0022correct\u0022 method, not the brute force one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a starting point which might work. It\u0027s what I use for generic spaceplanes inbound to the KSC runway. It will likely need tuning for use with capsules, or if you need to start from a different orbit. Starting with a near perfect, 100x100km circular, equatorial / 090\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA orbit, I do a retro burn 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA from KSC, i.e. when I\u0027m directly on the far side of the planet. I reduce my periapsis to 35km directly over KSC. This drops me down nicely to about 10km approaching the mountains west of KSC, for a little powered flight in. I usually hold about 10\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015320\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA nose up through re-entry, until I re-establish conventional flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, adjusting for capsules with parachute final descent. Try maybe 40km or 45km periapsis directly over KSC, or do the retro burn just a little after you pass 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA from KSC. Some experimentation will be required.
