My mouse pointer started showing in a different position on the screen to the point-of-click. The offset was consistent enough that I was eventually able to change the settings to a combination of matching the monitor pixel-dimensions and having full-screen on. It helped that it\u00A0was essentially vertical, and you could see the active button light up, both ordinary menu screens and the setting screens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the problem persisted through a clean install, wiped the whole folder and replaced from the zip-file,\u00A0 it looks like something was being saved elsewhere, but I haven\u0027t been able to track down any changes with plausible timing. It couldn\u0027t be anything before today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt only affected KSP. The offset only affects the contents of the KSP window, not the close-window button provided by the OS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was happening with an un-modded install, and could very well explain a problem I was having with a mod. Whether the mod triggered the problem, I am unsure, but since it persisted after a clean install that seems unlikely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I know, it\u0027s not practical to test every Linux version and desktop that is current.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
