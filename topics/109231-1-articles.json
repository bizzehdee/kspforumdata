But, I just downloaded the USI Kolonization Systems (MKS/OKS) with TAC last night to start a new Science campaign, and I was just wondering about what mods should I get in addition or tips with compatibility? I\u0027m trying to stay as vanilla as possible, and I\u0027m trying to use mods that still function with the most recent version of KSP. So far, it looks like Extraplanetary Launchpads will be helpful, and Infernal Robotics? Not sure how well they\u0027re supported with KSP 1.0\u002B though. I noticed that some of the MKS/OKS modules use other resources (Uranium and Xenon, I think?), and I was hoping that I didn\u0027t have to get an additional resource mining mod or something like that because I\u0027ve yet to tinker with the new-KSP, stock ore-mining. Thanks in advance for any help you all can provide! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
