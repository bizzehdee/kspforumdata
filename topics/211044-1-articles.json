I have a smaller suggestions that i think most will enjoy.

It should read like a story.\u00A0 In the year 2024 Jeb flew to X planet he has been there for 74 years he has yet to return etc. Thats just an example, however I feel alot of joy in the game is gained through trial and error. And to have to documented and read back to after hours and hours of gameplay is fun to see and share. Im sure it\u0027d be very fulfilling to the average ksp enjoyer. This as i said earlier isn\u0027t massive in scope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nirgal","CreatedById":211448,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-16T12:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this is a good idea, EU4 and such games have a similar system.

Could lead to some great forum posts with Program Timelines that tell hilarious stories through the logs.
