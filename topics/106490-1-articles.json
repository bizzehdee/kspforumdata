Hunt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m old hat at this game so that info isn\u0027t new to me, but I greatly appreciate having your answer and the level of detail you went into, that is surely a great service and deserves to be in this Q\u0026amp;A Section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy specific problem was there was some sort of bug with the \u0022R\u0022 key not turning on RCS, and since I had not done a rescue mission in a while, I was flustered that something may had changed in 1.0 and I didnt know about it. I re-loaded the game and switched to Janlinne, pressed \u0022R\u0022 and her RCS turned on, rescued moments later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, thanks for the information.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
