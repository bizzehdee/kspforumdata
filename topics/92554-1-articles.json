Goo/Mat bays need cleaning, EVA requires a Kerbal so that has to be manned, and the only low/high Biome in orbit item is Graviolis. I suppose you could use that for it, or go out of your way and put each experiment in its own return vehicle somehow and drop one off at a time for the contracts, but it\u0027s at least finite.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T01:27:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WanderingKid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WanderingKid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know Fine Print is coming in .090, but the procedural basis of the current contract system has a remarkably easily abusable loophole.\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Plant a Flag on X\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve got a Kerbal at X, you can just decline bad missions (like test underwater seamonkeys splashed on Moho) until this repops.
