I\u0027ve been playing with it and minus a few refinements am very happy with the result. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince code is basically wrapped up, it\u0027s time to unveil what will be the next USI mod (which will be released immediately after KSP 1.0).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n7QWMRG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022n7QWMRG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBasic overview stuff.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechanics wise, it\u0027s pretty simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals require supplies. Kerbals also require EC. these are both on the same timer, so I just check supplies for the status window. When Kerbals are done consuming supplies, leftovers, scraps, and \u0027anything else\u0027 is either tossed overboard, or (if storage is available) tossed into a \u0027mulcher\u0027. The resulting organic slurry is called \u0027mulch\u0027 and can be used to feed greenhouses, etc. at the player\u0027s discretion (or in the case of MKS, converted into Organics at varying levels of efficiency).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15 days out, the visuals go yellow (sorry, no auto-warp-slowdown-thingie, use KAC). When supplies run out, things go into the red. If you leave them unsupplied for 15 days...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell, they just say \u0027screw it\u0027, get grouchy, and quit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are still in the pod. they still take up a seat. But they can\u0027t fly, can\u0027t EVA, and essentially do the Kerbal equivelant of spinning around in their office chairs, refusing to work, until resupplied. This is a design consideration in that all of us, at least once, has just flat out done goofed, and lost a whole colony of Kerbals via glich or other sadness. Yes, death/despawn will be an option. Not the default one tho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce resupplied, they are happy as clams and will return to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the above is code complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the EVA, my plan is to put them on a similar timer (3 days vs 15 days). So stupendously long EVA times (Kerbals are durable). A kerbal left out longer than that will either go \u0027missing\u0027 and wander home as a new Kerbal (default) or death (optional). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly. Toggleable option (default is on) for your orange suited Kerbals to be immune to the ill effects of life support. They will still consume supplies if given, but do not leave the job. This always gives a player (especially a new one) an \u0027out\u0027 to test out a manned mission before actually committing your other kerbals, etc. to a horrible death of snack deprivation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it\u0027s a bit more \u0027Kerbal\u0027 than TAC-LS, but also a lot more predictable and with harder consequences than \u0027Snacks\u0027. It does, however, feel \u0027right\u0027 (at least to me) from a design standpoint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts wise: Four. Three inline storage compartments and a radial tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo extra recyclers needed. No resourced added to pods (the 15 day window covers all of the Kerbin SOI so no point). No random contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMKS/OKS Changes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMKS wise, closed loop just got a lot harder/more interesting (depending on your point of view).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old C3 (now renamed to the Pioneer Module) will have a basic mulcher and greenhouse and can do recycling at 50% efficiency for up to four Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbitats operate at 75% efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk-IV modules (the giant biodome thingie you saw earler) operates at 90% efficiency off-world, 100% efficiency on the surface (pulling in of local material is inferred, no extra drills required).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupplies come from organics. Organics come either from mulched supply waste, or from a combo of water/substrate. So surface bases are easier to get to self sufficiency - if they are on water/substrate deposits. Orbital will always be a pain - so you will need to fly up fresh organics or keep large stores. And since organics creation is not tied to the life support loop, building large surface farms is also pretty easy now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDealing with hungry Kerbals\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you can do some very interesting things. Run a command pod to dock reviving supplies/snacks to a starved out colony ship. Use one of your orange-suits to lead a mission and conserve supplies. Note that Kerbals are pretty damn aggressive about getting their snacks - the only way to lock them out of the biscuit tin is to click that little feed button by the resource on a part (same way we reserve some battery power for a probe). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that a Kerbal about to starve (i.e. no supplies for 15 days) will in fact happily break open said biscuit tin. witty screen message included \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDesign side note:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo \u0027Mulch\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaste was used, and too generic.

Semi-replenishable through the use of a greenhouse, fully replenishable on planetside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo less \u0027one resource\u0027 (a jar of peanut butter) and more \u0027a combined resource\u0027 (like a peanut butter, jelly, and banana sandwich!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext... let\u0027s look at gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC-LS: I add six resources to every pod, and a tank with three full and three empty (in case I care about recyclers). Lack of any one of these has precisely the same effect. I add recyclers and such to extend, but in the end, I add, say, 1 ton of mass to travel around for three years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSI-LS. I add no resources to the pods, and a tank with one full and one empty. Lack of the one resource has the singular effect. I add recyclers and such to extend, but in the end, I add, say, 1 ton of mass to travel around for three years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do three resources add?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertainly not variety. Loss of any single one still has the same penalty (death). Probably the one thing that can be said (and I agree) is that for bases, it forces you to consider multiple resources. Oh wait... I did precisely the same thing with USI-LS for base building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC-LS with MKS in 0.90: Find a source of water and substrate so you can make biomass to turn into food, with your greenhouses and purifiers handling the water and oxygen side of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSI-LS: Find a source of water and substrate so you can make organics to turn into supplies that represent all of the stuff a Kerbal needs to live.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain... I am finding no benefit still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are not different effects (like better food or super oxygen or something) like RealFuels... just... well, three things that at the end of the day do the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC-LS: Penalty for losing food: Death. Water? Death. Oxygen? Death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSI-LS: Penalty for losing supplies: Inanimation or death, your choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife Support should be first about gameplay and interesting mechanics, with just enough of a resource base to make that mechanic work. It should not be about making a set of resources, then figuring out gameplay mechanics to make them interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone earlier in the thread put it best. Less tedium more funium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see what u\u0027re doing there...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when i think at life support for spaceship, i imagine to see lots and lots of machines interconnected into a complicate and efficient network created in order to recycle and reuse and don\u0027t waste potential resouces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we don\u0027t know anything about biology and physiology of kerbal\u0027s body, we can\u0027t do anything more than speculate about how a kerbal react about the lack of one of our basic needs, for example, the lack of food could put them in hybernation for years, or as kerbal are green they can be sentient plants beings, that need water, CO2 and nutrients like the plants of your greenhouse, instead of needing food and oxigen...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as we\u0027re not Squad, the majority of the community (or what i think is the majority) assume kerbals react in the same way that humans do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if they don\u0027t eat they starve, if they don\u0027t breathe they soffucate, and if they don\u0027t drink they dehydrate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, is established that a humans can survive plenty of days without food, but they survive less then a week without water and couple minutes without oxigen!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think u can generalize all the needs into one \u0022supply\u0022. \u0022Life support\u0022 pratically, doesn\u0027t exist at all... it\u0027s a generic classification for all the systems that keep kerbals alive... it\u0027s a collection of needs that must be satisfied all the time. U win if u account for all of them, either if u bring with u 15 tons of supply or u build a super complex structure that weigth 5 and recycle 0.5 ton of resources continuously. If u generalize, and put all this resources in one jar of peanut butter, jelly, and banana sandwich, u remove the meaning of be of a life support system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m perfectly aware that the lack of any of the resources means death but that\u0027s actually the point! It\u0027s not a metter of variety it\u0027s a matter of complexity... if i, player, want a Life support mod, i look at the ones that allow me to project, exploit and manage all the needs that my kerbal need on their missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look at MKS\u0027s TAC integration and i find it perfect, the more complex, the more efficient, the more valuable and satisfying the result. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to ask u: what is for u the funium in a life support mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs u go for manned missions with life support mods, u submit a silent contract to find a way to provide all the things a kerbal needs in order to come back alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me at least, the funium in a life support system is exactly this, find a way, efficient or not, to manage the multiple needs of my kerbals, and as life support is the biggest and the most complex system on a ship, the engeneering process to develop the most efficient life support system for a specified mission is the funium of this kind of mod. Add needs that must to be satisfied adding things. If u generalize, u minimize and this lead to something that i\u0027m not attracted anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the funium of the game iftself: engineer always better and more complex contraption that can go further.

The only difference between them is the amount of time that a Kerbal can go without them, and that\u0027s still a pretty small difference. But if you prefer TAC-LS\u0027s approach, you can just keep using that - it\u0027s not like RoverDude is dropping support for it, and I won\u0027t hold it against you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
