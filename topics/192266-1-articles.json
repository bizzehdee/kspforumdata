One, boosters spend a lot of their lifespan in the low atmosphere surrounded by the ambient 14.7psi. Not just flight, but stacking, fueling, defueling, destacking, lots of potential abort situations etc. Many\u00A0rocket stages will collapse under their own weight if they\u2019re not inflated with substantial pressure inside. Then in flight, the volume of fuel getting sucked into the turbopumps needs to be replaced with something - pressurized gas - or the internal pressure will drop below the external ambient pressure (while still in atmo at least) and the tank will implode. Bad news. This is the routine reason that applies to all rockets. The gas could be compressed nitrogen; Saturn/Apollo used cryogenic helium, some rockets even use a fraction of their own propellants that run around the engines as coolant, turn from liquid to gas, then get routed back to the tank as pressurant.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe headlines about Starship pressure tests are another reason having to do with the particular propellants chosen. Oxygen and methane are gases at ordinary temperatures. Cool them to very low (cryogenic) temperature and they turn liquid. But how to keep them liquid on a hot Florida or Texas afternoon? \u00A0Insulation helps (the orange stuff on the outside of the space shuttle external tank\u00A0is foam insulation). But increased pressure helps a lot more - if you can hold the tanks at high pressure, the tendency of cryogenics to boil is much reduced. Then there\u2019s a safety factor - imagine the pressure relief valve that maintains that desired pressure fails and sticks closed, let\u2019s say on the hottest Florida summer day with hours and hours of launch delays. The cryogenics are going to continue to slowly boil and increase pressure in the tank, and you definitely don\u2019t want the tank to rupture and explode - especially when there will be people on top. \u00A0So you design for the pressure you need to minimize boil-off, then add a safety factor (and triple up on safety release valves too).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Starship that safe pressure level looks to be 8.5bar (about 125psi). SpaceX has been experimenting with new methods of tank construction, and testing their experimental tanks to destruction. \u00A0Some of those tests, rather than using explosive propellants, have been done with inert nitrogen instead. Now it looks like they\u2019re starting to test with real propellants, which they have to do eventually because they\u2019ll be different temperatures than liquid nitrogen. They need to prove to NASA or the FAA or themselves that the tanks are safe.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut none of it is to cram more propellant in the tank by compressing it to make it more dense. SpaceX does, however, cram more fuel and oxygen\u00A0in its Falcon 9 tanks by making them more dense - by making them COLDER. This works, and gives you a few percent more fuel for the same volume tank. This is one of the reasons the Falcon 9 payload has gotten upgraded significantly over the years. The downside is if there is a launch delay, the propellants warm up and start to boil off more aggressively. \u00A0Delay too long, they have to call an abort, detank and try again with a fresh batch of super-cold LO2.\u00A0 Not only that -\u00A0but usually a rocket is filled with propellant with no one on board and minimal staff around in case of an accident.\u00A0 Then the long and complex process of boarding astronauts and sealing up the cockpit happens.\u00A0 But that takes too long with super-cooled densified propellant, it\u0027ll warm up and boil off too much.\u00A0 So SpaceX has to board and seal up\u00A0the crew first, then fill up the rocket with them on board (they call this \u0022load-and-go\u0022).\u00A0 Lots of people consider this more dangerous; some don\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts a complex topic and easily mixed up!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-18T20:09:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2020 08:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by fourfa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
