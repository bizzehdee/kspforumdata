We are told it is going to be a custom built vehicle with ample seating, room for snacks, and have a built in hab module. I have yet to see the new vessel but we are all looking forward to whatever this fine craft might be.

I have decided to take on the Elcano challenge and would like you all to join in on the fun. i will hopefully update this log daily until I have completed the challenge, or given up. As long as you guys think its good, i will continue this format where i post the actual mission and photos as logs, and then at the bottom talk about what\u0027s taken place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far we\u0027ve had a good start. i built the Mountaineer with only mountainous terrain in mind and completely neglected the fact i would have to cross water. Not realizing that until 40km out i was extremely disappointed and decided that i would need to at the very least recover the original crew with a new truck because i didn\u0027t want the first trip to mean entirely nothing. now im faced with what i should do with the Mountaineer. part of me really wants to take it up to my base at the north pole because im pretty proud of that vehicle, but at the same time that will almost double the time it will take me to complete the challenge, and over 600 parts in close proximity while driving is pretty hard even on my machine; should be fine as long as they are always 3km apart though. I\u0027d like some input on what i should do, because personally I\u0027m leaning towards taking it to the pole but cant decide.

Almost as mind\u00A0numbing as time warping to eeloo. \u00A0I give props to anyone giving it a go. \u00A0Until the game is enhanced to support land traverse in a more reliable way, I will continue to look at efforts like yours in awe. \u00A0Well done for the attempt!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks man. It\u0027s definitely going to be a rough journey. They really need to fix how rover wheels hang on things. Seeing a wheel drag behind and then snap back is never an easy sight to deal with. Every time I tense up and\u00A0scream\u00A0BRACE FOR LAUNCH. luckily it seems to happen less since 1.0.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222315699\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127157\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449704111\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022108287\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stratzenblitz75\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, Stratzenblitz75 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m enjoying your adventure so far!\u00A0Its really interesting to see all the crafts you\u0027ve built and how they create this infrastructure to support your circumnavigation. Looking forward to seeing that polar base!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso,\u00A0through my adventure,\u00A0I\u0027ve also noticed that the coasts on Kerbin have very rough terrain. I can\u0027t say that this is true everywhere, but every coast I\u0027ve come across has these huge, jagged hills. It doesn\u0027t seem to matter where the coasts are either; the terrain inland can be really flat, but the coasts nearby are still jagged. So, if you want to continue avoiding rough terrain, then I\u0027d recommend to avoid all coasts entirely (Unless the Kerbals are aching to go to the beach. In that case, go right ahead!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, glad you\u0027re enjoying it! I tend to do things on far too large of a scale but this time it just feels like it needs to be done. It\u0027s really nice to find uses for these craft that I thought where going to waste away in the sph save file, so it\u0027s definitely good to see things working out like they are.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was\u00A0incredibly disappointed with how rough the coast was. Thanks for the heads up - i will avoid coasts like the plague.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow unfortunately, I\u0027m spending a few days away from home and there won\u0027t be any mission progress until I get back. However, since I do have my laptop (and since I found an excellent spot for both the base and dock/seaport) I\u0027m continuing work on the base while I\u0027m away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUbiowelder has become a life saver for this project. If it wasn\u0027t for that this would probably blow up my laptop. I\u0027m in need of another mod though. I need something that has crane parts like a cable winch and hooks or something that functions in that way. IR is great for robotic claws and even for the crane arm, but I need the lifting parts for it. If yall can point me in the right direction for a mod like that I would be forever greatful. Anyways, back to the sph!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T20:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKAS offers winches and grapples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
