Is there anyone who has ever done a serious investigation of how to build efficient infinigliders that could offer me some advice?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazro","CreatedById":55825,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T14:39:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not technically an infiniglider, an infiniglider is a craft that can glide infinitely without any kind of thrust at all, even from control surfaces. They are a known bug and will probably be fixed with changes to the lift and drag simulation.
