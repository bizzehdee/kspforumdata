I now find that this seems to cause all control to be lost the instant that ship loses the focus. For example if there are 2 craft 50 meters apart (well within the physics unload distance) and I switch between ships the ship that lost focus loses direction, thrust and nearly any other type of control. By this I mean all vanilla KSP control (except SAS hold it seems), not just MechJeb control. I am still investigating but it looks like I am going back to using the AR202 part because of this. If I remove the MechJebCore statement and use the AR202 then I can do things like, for example, instruct both ships to SmartASS orient towards each other as target while I observe at a distance on EVA or have the ship without the focus to move in and dock to the ship with the focus. I can only report this bug, I have no clue as to why adding MechJeb to the part.cfg should be behaving differently to slapping an AR202 part on the outside of the command pod.

I put separatrons on it for a terminal boost phase to see how much accurate range* I could get. Well, with the missile\u0027s liquid fuel engine as its first stage and the separatrons in stage 0, MJ will fire the sepratrons at the same time as the orbital insertion/maneuver stage. Rocket explodes. Swap the positions of the missile\u0027s engines in the staging and it doesn\u0027t fire the liquid engine. Deactivate the engine on the OIMS, throttle up then pop the space bar. The sepratrons light and burn out then MJ fails to automatically light the last stage. Pop the spacebar again and it lights. This also happens with some landers even though the stage 0 engine is paired with a decoupler. Going down on stage 1, it burns out and MJ won\u0027t cut it loose, but will put the gear down and let the ship crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Best so far, around 3,000 meters against a booster stage with 4 orange tanks in parallel. Can also hit non-bundled large diameter targets from 2,500 meters. Small diameter, got to be closer. Tiny diameter? Forget it. The \u0027secret sauce\u0027 is the KSPX tiny size reaction wheel.

Common sense to always check and make sure it\u0027s not set that way. Crazy things happen when it is. I always check it when I change rockets, don\u0027t know when it\u0027s going to pull out some different ascent path settings since I started fiddling with that instead of trying to make every flight work with the default. If MJ could save the ascent path as a small file with the same name as the craft file, that would be very useful. No more having to check and adjust it once it\u0027s dialed in because it\u0027d automatically apply the settings to match whatever\u0027s on the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T04:04:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, so this is interesting, after the experience I described with docking, I decided to experiment a bit to make sure that wasn\u0027t a fluke.

It doesn\u0027t work so well when you try to have two or more ships at once under MJ control. I tried a few times to aim a few boosters and a manned ship at KSP so I could watch a landing amidst a rain of crashing stuff. Didn\u0027t work. Would spin the manned ship around but wouldn\u0027t fire the engine. Pretty much dead in the water until the first one I sent down had impacted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can have multiple *unguided* things going down to crash at the same time. Either aim retrograde and burn until the orbit intersects the ground or use landing guidance to start, then abort. Switch to a different ship before the first one drops to far below 70KM. With practice and starting from different altitudes it\u0027s likely possible to drop several things onto close to the same place, but only if just none are being actively guided.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night I was sending my 2nd Kethane mining rover to the Mun. I tapped a tanker almost dry to refuel and dumped it. Just used smart ass to aim retrograde and did the burn manually, then turned off smart ass. I figured it\u0027d do burn and forget. Nuh-uhh! Until that tanker had hit the surface KSP wasn\u0027t letting me go anywhere else with anything else, not any way but manually. Could not target anything. Click on Mun, click set as target, it\u0027d flash the orbit green then back to grey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I haven\u0027t tried is a \u0027no look\u0027 MJ guided landing. In other words, using a ship that MJ has no issues with on staging, start from a high enough orbit so you can switch to another ship before entering the atmosphere, then start the automatic landing and switch to another ship and *don\u0027t try to do anything else*.

MJ functionality added via modulemanger, no AR202. I havent seen it do that in a while. It\u0027s Conti\u0027s branch I think with no changes from myself save cosmetic.

Adding MJ functionality to the pod part.cfg no longer appears to be responsible for unfocussed ships having or not having MJ control. I have kind of given up trying. Sometimes I get MJ control on the unfocussed ship and sometimes I don\u0027t get it.

I am currently suspicious about another mod interacting with it but I don\u0027t have enough information at this time to be sure.
