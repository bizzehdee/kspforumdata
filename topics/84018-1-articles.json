The Gilly refueling lander is also launched on the same rocket, built atop a massive ThunderMaximus 288 tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first assembly phase brings up all four sidesaddle boosters at once (coupled under a Kerbodyne scaled 1-to-4 adapter) then docks to the core so the boosters can be moved over one at a time. The same launch also brings up a pair of small Kethane scanning satellites to put into Eve orbit. The Gilly lander has scanners so it\u0027s its own satellite when not landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe booster carrier is deorbited so the Eve lander can be launched and docked nose to nose with the transfer ship. Much use is made of Quantum Struts, also Omni Docking ports to have 3 concentric docking connections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter boosting to a high enough orbit to be able to attain high warp speeds, a couple of tankers top up the fuel, oxidizer and mono, then it\u0027s ready to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest results were mostly as expected, since nearly all parts had been tested and developed multiple times using hyperedit to place the components in the correct locations to confirm proper operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover and lander for Eve use nowhere near the full capacity of their fuel tankage to land so I move enough to the ThunderMaximus tank so they\u0027ll be touching down nearly on fumes. The rover\u0027s tanks and engines must be emptied and jettisoned before raising the landing legs or the short drop will damage wheels and make some parts fall off. Solar panels must be retracted before making any movements with the rover!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hesitate to reduce the tankage on the rover because without taking most of its fuel to the big tank, the core and can might not have been able to get to Gilly. But doing so might save some fuel going from Kerbin to Eve due to less mass to push. I am going to remove the RCS thrusters and mono tanks from the rover since it doesn\u0027t need to dock now. They are a vestige from the original plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key to the successful ascent from Eve is the group of six Hooligan Labs inflatable \u0022parachutes\u0022. MechJeb\u0027s default/automatic ascent profile for Eve is just flat out incorrect. I use a gravity turn start of 35KM, 52% shape, turn end 100KM at 0 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent process, after refueling, EVA to repack radial chutes on lander can and remove/discard the ladder. Board then stage to dump the 6 chutes on top of the side boosters. Hit 0 to inflate the bags. Stage around 2KM to drop the landing legs. Wait until altitude reaches ~24KM and speed is still 100\u002B meter/second then engage Ascent guidance. About 2KM later stage to jettison the airbags then sit back and watch Mechjeb take it on up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis works without Stock Drag Fix. I built the lander before that existed. However, with SDF the can makes it to orbit with some fuel left in the T800 tank instead of just a somewhat less than full T400 - so rendezvous is no worry with SDF. SDF also saves a bunch of fuel in the launches from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one part that was a bit nail biting was getting the Gilly lander out from between the Eve lander and Rover/transfer. The Eve lander only has a total of 120 units of mono and RCS jets only on the core parts. I just used SASS to TGT\u002B on both and carefully scooted in to a manual docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final test prior to launching the full mission was \u0027porting the core with Eve return stage on top to Eve then flying back to Kerbin. Somehow I managed to get a Mun encounter which screwed things up to where I was just able to get into a very high Kerbin orbit then send up a tanker. How it did that when Eve and Kerbin/Mun aren\u0027t in the same plane and I was coming in well off the ecliptic...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part that did NOT go well was refueling at Gilly. The larger lander was still too small VS that giant Thunder Maximus tank and due to the warp limits and Rendezvous Autopilot having some issues at such tiny orbit diameters, it would\u0027ve taken a week of realtime to refuel. I saved the VAB folder and mercilessly deleted that mission folder rather than use hyperedit to fill the return vehicle, since I already knew it could make it back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I didn\u0027t drop the second pair of sidesaddle boosters until circularizing into an orbit just outside Gilly\u0027s Apoapsis, I\u0027m going to attempt to equip them with more docking ports and lander\u002Bkethane parts on top to move to their sides to convert them into a pair of very large fuel tankers so the big tank can be filled in far fewer flights. I\u0027ll then be able to directly dock the Eve lander to the rover and won\u0027t have to get a lander out from between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d thought about dropping parts at Gilly to convert the entire core into one massive, self refueling, lay-down lander, but that\u0027s perhaps a bit too crazy.
