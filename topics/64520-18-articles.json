What I\u0027m seeing is that the Right wing is adding lift to the LEFT rather than the right, and the left wing is adding lift further to the left as well, placing the center of lift well off the center of the craft to the left. I will test again without NEAR installed. Lift for each wing needs to be centered on the wing. Neither wing currently does this in FAR/NEAR. This suggests that FARWingAerodynamicModel, for both parts needs work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the right wing attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kdXCHSa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kdXCHSa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand here\u0027s the left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R1y1Xgo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022R1y1Xgo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, here\u0027s both wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UBpq3qr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UBpq3qr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sage Sagan","CreatedById":102159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T13:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been looking at the FAR configs that are in the wing files, they are identical to each other.
