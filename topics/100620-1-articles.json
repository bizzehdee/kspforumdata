It contains a lot of science. You have been warned!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo have full coverage of whole Duna (for communication for example between base and far-away lander) we need to send bunch of sattelites. We need even more of them if we want continuous link between Kerbin and Duna. If we place them on equatorial orbit on high enough orbit, they provide you coverage of whole planet, excluding polar areas. Picture below can give you rough idea on how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart of boring theories \u003Cstrong\u003E--\u0026lt;\u003C/strong\u003E However even if we have these things covered, there are still problems remaining. If Duna and Kerbin are as closest as they can be, light will take about half a minute to travel this distance. And if they are furtherst they can be? That will take light 2 minutes if you don\u0027t think about fact that in these positions, Kerbol is inbetween them. So live communication is impossible. You have to wait approximately 2 minutes to get your answer (1 minute send message and 1 minute to receive answer). \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0026gt;--\u003C/strong\u003E end of boring theories\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ju7RXAa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ju7RXAa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make it more clear:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Imagine two near (2 km away) objects on flat land. They can communicate easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Imagine two further (100 km away, which is much more on Duna than on real-life Earth) objects. You can still make direct link between them using really (really) strong antenna, but why, when you can send signal to satellite above you in direct path and that can send signal to second object?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

I have named them Ion-Comms I and sent them to orbit. They have very simple construction. Probe core, battery, solar panels, antennas, xenon tanks and ion engine. As they are fairly small, lifter was also small. Each has different code name - Ion-Comm Ia, Ion-Comm Ib and Ion-Coom Ic.

It needs high precision to make them orbit synchronous and keep them in desired positions for as long as possible. If one of satellite would have orbit 2 km lower, he would meet other satellite after some time. I have synchronized them not in terms of kilometers, but in terms of meters. At 800 km around Kerbin. Now you may have realized why I found ion engines inprecise. On these images you can barely see (nearly) perfectly synchronized Ion-Comms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XB5F7Oa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XB5F7Oa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be really precise I have first get each probe at absolutelly stable orbit (~179,979 meters). Then I have counted exact distance of probes from each other in triangle using this formula:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OPkpDD6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OPkpDD6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit is basically just expression of \u0022a\u0022 from formula for radius of circumscribed circle of an equilateral triangle. It is 2,424 km for my probes. If you would ever need this, remember that R is your orbit height \u002B radius of body you are orbiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FHZiAnV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FHZiAnV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith my precision it should cover whole Kerbin equator for years, maybe decades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are results of synchronizing (on Y1, D7, 2:19).

Their documentation was so complicated that they rather sent him to space with each probe to activate it than asking him stupid question.
