A chronicle if you will of his brave exploits that have brought many a space program back from the brink of disasters. Feel free to share tales of when no other pilot would do. When disasters struck dooming the mission and only one kerbal could get the crew back alive! Or tales of when our humble hero took it upon himself to go where no other kerbal was able and made it home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe only rule with this is to have fun but only include missions where Jebediah was directly involved and came back alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal Jeb story comes from my first mission in KSP. I haven\u0027t been a player of KSP for as long as some of the old hats who remember flying without asas, or even a docking port.. but that didn\u0027t stop me from designing the perfect station core. It had everything a kerbal could ask for crew storage, command pod, RCS, you know the likes but there was indeed one problem that was not foreseen at the drawing board, the utter lack of docking ports on the six way adapter. It was quite the embarrassment and some time was taken to debate if the mission should be scrapped or not. Fortunately someone noticed that on the opposite side of the craft was a small clampotron Jr. docking port that had been left on in a previous design phase. A plan was quickly hatched to approach the station with a new six way adapter that had fully useable docking ports. Upon Rendezvous to the station with the new replacement node another dire mistake was noticed, the ship carrying the replacement part had previously jettisoned it\u0027s ASAS unit which was in a previous stage. At this time no one in mission control thought it would be possible for a single kerbal to take a severely unbalanced craft and maneuver it in for a docking without any computer automation. That was until Jebediah took the middle seat, He had just returned in the capsule after having gone out to see if there was any way to rejoin the defunct asas unit to the courier ship and had a plan. Since repairs would be impossible because of the bad planning he knew that only he\u0027d only get one shot to achieve docking in a tumbling ship. With only a shimmer of hope that this mission would be successful he carefully edged in, at first trying to use RCS to keep the port in line with it\u0027s tiny counter part. Bob meanwhile gave a live readout of monopropellant levels, and as he frantically reminded jeb that they where down to their last few liters the idea hit him. He\u0027d only fire short bursts for translation, disable RCS and rotate with the internal gyros of his three man pod. The bold ploy worked leaving mission control cheering and enough propellant to safely depart the station and bring home Bill Bob and the hero Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(ps. sorry for any grammatical mistakes i left. Came up with the idea only a few minutes before passing out at my desk. But please do share your own!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bogpad","CreatedById":70927,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T09:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewouldn\u0027t this be better placed somewhere around \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forumdisplay.php/40-KSP-Fan-Works\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphox","CreatedById":32691,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T09:41:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bogpad\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bogpad\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewouldn\u0027t this be better placed somewhere around \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forumdisplay.php/40-KSP-Fan-Works\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsk and you shall receive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, accrsd, and nice read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeels like a fanwork to me.

He then didn\u0027t turn up for ages, must have had work to do at his junkyard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, one day, I was testing a plane, and there he was! The test flight went well, then Jeb decided to go for a walk. In flight. The results of this activity taught my space centre that aeroplane EVAs were a bad idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet he survived the landing somehow, clinging on to the control surfaces. Then, I gave him a job. I had two kerbalnaughts stuck on the moon, so Jeb was given a Z-4 Munar Rescue rocket, that was very much the workhorse of my program back then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trip to orbit went pretty normally, and the transfer burn as well. But somewhere between Kerbin and the Mun, Jeb had a little adventure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was standard procedure to extend the ladders mid-flight, and make pilots walk down them, to stretch their legs. Jeb took this to the next level. He went all the way down the ladder, and let go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe then pioneered Jetpacking in space, something no kerbal had been brave, or dumb enough to try before. But against the odds, he ended up back in the pod before too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe set the ship down within 2 kilometers of the stranded kerbals, then flew over and greeted them each personally. They were very excited to meet one of the first kermen to go to space. After about a day on the Mun (first time he actually made it). Jeb and the others moved back to his ship. Jeb remained in his favorite one man pod, but still scared the others with his famously manic grin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fight back went perfectly, and featured a few more EVA stunts from Jeb, then they landed safely just a kilometer out of KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n8U7PWW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022n8U7PWW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s my contribution.
