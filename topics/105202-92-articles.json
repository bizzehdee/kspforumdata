By default, all Kerbals are treated the same (same effects for vets and normals). The default effect is that they get \u0022grouchy\u0022- they become a Tourist and can no longer EVA, control the ship, etc. They can still be transferred from one part of the ship to another.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-05T17:21:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2016 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by jofwu**"},{"CreatedByName":"autumnalequinox","CreatedById":114782,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T19:13:39Z","Content":"Does EC/per second setting apply to Kerbals in spacecraft?

But i stil want to use yours but this problem with the config file might make me change my mind again.\n\u003E \n\nNot sure what \u0027Radicolous\u0027 means - best guess is that it\u0027s shorthand for \u0027properly balanced since USI-LS does not assume any recyclers by default, and also accounts for the sizeable amount of water lost due to hygeine, etc.?\u0027\n\nKidding aside.  This mod is not TAC-LS.  If you dramatically lower those numbers, things are going to get really weird when recyclers kick on and drop them a further 70%-90% down the road.  Odds are you have multiple configs lying around, because USI-LS takes the most pessimistic view when it sees multiple config choices."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T21:18:37Z","Content":"I might just knock up some custom configs to give certain parts lolhuge hab values. Basically my concept is that something big enough can effectively \\*be\\* \u0022home\u0022 for the Kerbals on board.\n\nI had a concept along the same lines for USI-LS, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s currently supported: Recognise a certain combination of parts in a single vessel as making it a second home, meaning that the Kerbals present (up to a limit) will have indefinite hab and home time. I\u0027m imagining it would be used by the largest base and station parts, for example the stuff from Civilian Population would fit the bill, or UKS\u0027s upcoming Mk IV parts."}]}
