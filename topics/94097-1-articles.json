However that\u0027s not really an issue. I stick with the SRBs, even if they look a bit small. They\u0027re lightweight, high thrust, and have a much better aesthetic, not to mention being that bit like the real thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mass issue, you\u0027re forced to use a segmented tank, which means fuel management becomes an issue that it wouldn\u0027t be for a real shuttle - the CoM for the real shuttle and tank would move linearly (excluding the SRBs). For you it won\u0027t. I\u0027ve found it\u0027s best to experiment. My current design drains the bottom tanks until SRB separation, then drains top down to prevent overbalancing the other way. Keep an eye on the steering needle guages in the bottom left, particularly pitch - once you understand how the SAS pitch responds to shifting fuel mass, you can start to transfer fuel to correct (again, the real shuttle wouldn\u0027t have to do this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thraeorn\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thraeorn\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThird, Release.\u003Cp\u003EHow long should the SRB\u0027s burn before I release them to rely on the ET.

They also need to stay on until the fuel mass has shifted such that the orbiter main engines are thrusting through the CoM. I current drop them at about (from memory) around 6-7000m, and keep up a more-or-less vertical trajectory. I don\u0027t start the gravity turn until my orbital prograde marker has reached at least 45 degrees from vertical - this is usually around 13000m. The reason for this is if my vertical speed is too low when I start the gravity turn, I\u0027ll fall back to the surface before I build up enough horizontal speed to reach space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes the ET stays on almost to orbit velocity. It should only take a little push from the OMS engines to make a final circularisation, so that the ET will fall back to Earth.

You make a right-side roll manoeuvre at the edge of space before dropping the ET. It makes a difference because when you lose SRB thrust, you basically have to heft the tank up onto orbiter\u0027s thrust. Also, the draining fuel will tend to make the ventral side of the shuttle progressively lighter than the dorsal side over time, to the shuttle will tend to dorsal rotate anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineer the shuttle with a representative payload (like a Jumbo fuel tank or something lighter, depending on your planned typical payload mass) already in the bay.

You\u0027ll need two sets of engines: orbital engines pointing to the COM of the shuttle, and ascent engines pointing a bit below. It works better if you have two \u0022layers\u0022 of ascent engines (I use two pairs of LV-T45s for MkII and three Mainsails in a triangle for MkIII);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Add wings to the shuttle. Make sure the center of lift is a bit behind the COM, even with the shuttle unfueled. You\u0027ll probably want to do a test launch using infinite fuel to see if the shuttle can glide well with no fuel and no cargo;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- Add a decoupler under the shuttle and attach fuel tanks. A fuel line should take this fuel into the shuttle. If your shuttle has strong enough engines and reaction wheels, you only need a fuel tank to be discarded. Make sure to plan the fuel flow so the fuel flows toward the center of the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- Take the fuel off the drop tank to see where the COM is. Reduce the thrust from the orbital engines and the \u0022top layer\u0022 of ascent engines to 0. We want to rotate the \u0022bottom layer\u0022 of ascent engines (currently the only ones active) so the center of thrust points to the current COM;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- Now we activate the \u0022top layer\u0022 and fill the drop tank, and rotate the \u0022top\u0022 engines so the new COT points toward the new COM. We can then use this to our advantage: we can either set up an action group to toggle the \u0022top\u0022 engines on and off as the COM changes mid-flight, keeping the thrust roughly balanced, or we can do it by reducing the thrust of the \u0022top\u0022 engines mid-flight as the COM moves (though the second option is trickier and works better if you have only a single engine on top);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5- Add the pair of decouplers and SRBs to the sides of the drop tank, making sure to pay attention to the shifts on the COM and COT. We want to keep those aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6- Point the whole ensemble upwards, with the top of the shuttle pointing to the direction of the orbit (usually east), and launch. A good strategy is to drop the tank just before circularizing the orbit, finishing the burn with the orbital engines. Make sure to set up action groups to switch off the ascent engines and turn on the orbital ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis set up works wonderfully with MkII parts. It\u0027s trickier with MkIII, because the parts are heavier and there\u0027s a greater chance of spontaneous disassembly during flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
