If I already have other mods installed in Game Data, truly \u0022overwriting\u0022 that folder will destroy them, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows has this extra convenience where the action of replacing a folder gives you the option of merging them... so your instructions make good sense in that context. On a Mac, unless a user specifically tries to copy the folder (a drag-and-drop operation is a move), it does not even attempt a merge, it only asks you if you want to replace the folder that already exists with the one you are moving. This would result in the deletion of already installed mods. I haven\u0027t tried under linux.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize it\u0027s not at simple as what you use right now, but in the interest of I\u0027m offering the following wording:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Place the contents of the B9-Aerospace-Pack \u0027GameData\u0027 folder into the \u0027GameData\u0027 folder in your KSP directory. Place the contents of the B9-Aerospace-Pack \u0027ships/SPH\u0027 folder into the \u0027ships/SPH\u0027 folder in your KSP directory. If you have previously installed the B9 Aerospace Pack, you will need to overwrite the existing files in those folders.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to be a pain in your ass or spark a windows/mac thing (well there\u0027s a 70% chance of that happening, but I just ignore replies that focus on platform wars instead of the substance of my comment), so by all means ignore this comment entirely this if you don\u0027t like the suggestion, do not feel the need to explain your reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, thanks again for the incredible parts, they are absolutely amazing. And I\u0027m completely psyched to see the new SPH you\u0027re working on!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"6677","CreatedById":890,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T16:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xvdBanksbvx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xvdBanksbvx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure if this is a bug or just how the engine works, but the FS1PE propeller engines centre of thrust is no centred on the engine but about 2/3rd\u0027s a propeller length above.
