I never had to adjust the thrust limiter by right clicking on an engine, and I had to at the very first mission I ran in KSP2 with a simple LV909 and an accordingly sized module above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have All-or-Nothing input for 100 and 0% thrust, so we don\u0027t need thrust adjusment to be \u0022fast\u0022, instead we need it to be precise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would say that \u0022Green-Clock real time playing\u0022 in KSP1 is about 3.5-4s to go from 0 to 100% for the thrust gauge. It seems like it\u0027s about 1-1.5s for KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silent_prtoagonist","CreatedById":1927,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T09:56:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I agree that the sensitivity on the keybinds could stand to be turned down, you can also just grab the throttle with the mouse now, which allows for \u003Cem\u003Every \u003C/em\u003Efine adjustment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazooka","CreatedById":226666,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T12:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find the throttle for KSP 2 perfect. Its much more controllable than in KSP 1 and having the added mouse clickability for fine-tuning is a great addition\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechDragon","CreatedById":188807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-04T06:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree its better in a lot of ways, but I too find it far too sensitive with the keyboard throttle. I think we still need the time for throttle up from 0 to 100% to be longer, I want to be able to just tap up my throttle a bit, for fine control while landing, not have to carefully adjust it with the mouse, when I simultaneously need to use the mouse to adjust the camera to check my ground clearance and other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rpatto92","CreatedById":145732,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-12T22:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was actually possible to scale throttle control in KSP1 using a KAL controller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seem like something that should be a base function of the action group manager in KSP2. Perhaps even scaling per engine so one could balance thrust more easily; which leads me nicely into Split Throttle functionality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot of HOTAS support split dual throttling, so adding two throttleable controllers would seem reasonable. (left ctrl \u002B shift and right ctrl \u002B shift to split throttle maybe) (ALT \u002B X reset same as trim)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kim Hanson","CreatedById":202726,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T22:58:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetter still would be the ability to use a console type controller or flight sim controllers.\u00A0 Finer control and much more intuitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
