Then I decided to switch out the main command module for another one, and now the default module used on launch is the one that faces the wrong way, even though the new main cockpit is the root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I forget to press \u0027control from here\u0027 on the main cockpit, the plane crashes upon takeoff. Not a big deal I guess, but it\u0027s a bit annoying. Luckily I don\u0027t play on hard mode. Is there a way to have a certain cockpit preferred on launch, or is it always the one placed first?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T14:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry setting the preferred cockpit as the root part in the VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure, but that might work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T23:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d just make the rest of the rocket a subassembly and rebuild the command modules to fix that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
