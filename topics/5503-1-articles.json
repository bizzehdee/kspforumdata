It has a range of 600Km and can sustain constant power at 50% for 12 minutes. In order to make the flight easy on the pilots, it uses a TiberDyne-sponsored avionics package, which steadily holds the aircraft\\\u0027s vector while allowing for some degree of manual control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Requires TiberDyne ASAS, the radial parachutes were removed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlans to make a Block 20 variant of the Harbinger became a possibility after recieving a shipment of the new 2nd Generation C-7 engines. However the test craft, named SIX-01-20 (X as this was a prototype) was presumably lost near the north pole of Kerbin after an unauthorized flight took place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese following images were aquired from the black box of the test aircraft shortly after takeoff:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l223/SpootKnight/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot78.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot78.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l223/SpootKnight/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot79.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot79.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmediately a prominent feature is seen in these two images: No engine flame. The Block 20 Harbinger is to use what were described as \u0027Compressed Ram Engines,\u0027 which have low thermal emission and lower fuel consumption, for only a marginal cost in maximum thrust. Because of the space taken by the new intakes, the TiberDyne avionics package had to be removed, and a standard C-7 package was used in its place, which unfortunately proved to be faulty in maintaining stability at low altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe information from the black box told the KSC that within the same altitude, the craft was able to hold a similar speed to the Block 10, while gaining an additional four minutes of engine life. Because of this, its range increased by 360Km, up to a maximum traveled ground distance of 960Km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional images during its flight, after leaving the coast:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l223/SpootKnight/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot82.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot82.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l223/SpootKnight/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot83.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot83.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l223/SpootKnight/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot85.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot85.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the last image taken before the aircraft quit transmitting data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite the fluff I made up, I\\\u0027m going to post both models, even though it\\\u0027s laughably easy to change it from one to the other.
