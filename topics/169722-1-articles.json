That\u0027s the opposite of how it works elsewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#1A: there is a huge difference between fast and slow. it would be great if maybe LB could toggle between 3 speed scales, maybe minutes, hours, days, something like that\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2: when you are adjusting your axes, there is no fine tuning, since LB switches axes. You have to be very careful with the thumbstick to make small adjustments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be great if another button could cycle axes, and LB could be for fine tuning. And as I said, it might be nice to have three speeds, like fine, normal, fast maybe changing by a factor of 10 with each or something\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-18T05:44:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2018 05:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by palesius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emake title clearer\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-18T08:44:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the suggestions, we will see what we can do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
