Sometimes the Mk2 Illuminator looks better, say, as the headlights in a car-type rover vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, the Mk1 is meant to have a stronger beam used to illuminate things at longer distances- This is useful for when you want to perform a landing on a celestial body either at night, or simply if you want to have a better judgement of where the ground is and what the slope looks like to fine-tune the landing. Mk2s are what I mount on crafts for docking in low-light situations because it illuminates crafts fairly decently without making everything blindingly bright.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T00:09:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use mk1 for landing and docking.
