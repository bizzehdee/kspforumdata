According to Wikipedia, the Juno-I booster should burn for 155 seconds (using hydyne/LOX), yet I encountered a total burn time of 55 seconds. My fuel tank was full (I made sure to refuel on the pad as well), and I don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening. I\u0027ll check again later, and tell you if I find anything.

Stock offset doesn\u0027t work and only makes it worse.

I finally removed the retro package and straps from the Mecury and was able to use the Atlas to get the capsule up (nearly into a sustainable orbit, actually). Of course, if I manage to make orbit without the retro package, Jeb would be stuck in orbit till is life support was gone so this is probably not a good work around. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: So I may have found a work around. Normally with the Atlas booster I\u0027ve started by Gravity Turn when I hit about 150m/s. With the Mercury/Atlas, that means I\u0027m barely at 1500m off the gound. This flight I tried staying completely vertical until I was at 10km, then start my gravity turn. I\u0027m doing a far more significant 500m/s by this point, but I managed to tip over to 60 degrees without issue. I then finished my slow turn and managed to put the capsule into 148km x 3.5Mm orbit. Maybe the issue was simply that I started my turn too soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-11T19:11:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2015 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by chrisl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T18:35:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, I keep seeing people mention this, CKAN...What is it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight make a new save dedicated to this just to try it out...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enevermind on my question, just figured it out on my own! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"s10w10rr1s","CreatedById":107143,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T20:19:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis there a way to get real plume without RO?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T14:50:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas bac9\u0027s procedural wings pack support been deprecated?
