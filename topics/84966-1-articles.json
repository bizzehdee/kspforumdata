If your that close, u just need to thrust slowly towards it and line up your docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf lining up is a problem, I can suggest using RCS, and design it so it moves you up,down,left and right relative to the direction your traveling in. Selecting the second movement mode, the one underneath stage mode, this will make your rcs move along vertical and horizontal axis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd suggestion. When u select a target you can face the other object with the pinkish icon on the navball. If u do this with both craft, u can have them pretty much lined up exactly.

The RCS thrusters that look like 4 engines like a flower are good for docking, because u can also thrust forwards or backwards increasing and decreasing speed towards target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8th suggestion, the pink icon on the navball indicates the direction of the target.

I also highly recommend Docking Port Alignment Indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you are having problems with the rendezvous, try this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Target your target. In map mode, find the little chevron marked AN (or DN). Put a maneuver node on it, and then note the number it gives you; this is how far off the plane of the target you are. Pull on one of the little purple triangles - if the number goes up, you\u0027re pulling on the wrong one. Get that number down as close to zero as you can manage. Make the burn when it comes up. Rinse and repeat until you\u0027ve got it at 0.0 or NaN (NaN means \u0022not a number\u0022, which means you\u0027re so close to the plane that the programming language is barfing - it\u0027s \u0022better than zero\u0022 in this case, though zero is quite enough).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Look for the little intercept chevrons. These will tell you where exactly you and the target will be when you come closest to one another. Look at the distance it\u0027s telling you. At your next apsis, put up a maneuver node and pull either prograde or retrograde. If the number goes up, start pulling on the other -grade. Do this slowly - you will reach a point where the number will start going back up; that\u0027s fine. Make the burn. Rinse and repeat at the next apsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECAVEAT: Don\u0027t let you periapsis go below 69,000 while you\u0027re doing this; if you de-orbit, docking will be a tad difficult. You also don\u0027t want to start trying to close the gap until the target is within a hundred kilometers or so; if it\u0027s more than that but the distance is still closing, wait a few orbits until the distance becomes a little more managable. You\u0027ll save fuel in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) There will come a point when you won\u0027t be able to do anything more useful by going prograde and retrograde at the apses. You have two choices then - either do a radial burn at an apsis, or go prograde/retrograde at a midpoint between the apses. Pretty much the same as step number 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately if you keep this up, you\u0027ll get an intercept less than 2.2 kilometers. That\u0027s all the closer you need to get for a rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen comes the actual docking process. Your speedometer should switch over automatically to target mode as you approach - if it doesn\u0027t, click on it until it\u0027s up. This shows the relative velocity to the target. You want this number low (you\u0027re still travelling hundreds of meters per second, but you want to be travelling at roughly the same speed as the target and this tells you how far off you are). Mind your distance to the target. If your distance starts increasing, zero out the relative velocity (burn retrograde in target mode until it says zero), aim at the pink meatball on the nav ball (this is the direction of the target - make sure you\u0027re aimed at the meatball and not the little trifoil icon, which is the direction \u003Cstrong\u003Eaway\u003C/strong\u003E from the target), and thrust forward. You want to be using RCS thrusters while docking unless you\u0027re still a good ways off - though when it comes to re-aiming at the target, you want RCS thrusters off (so it doesn\u0027t give you little annoying sideways motions). Zero out your velocity at 100 meters. At 50 meters, you want to have your target\u0027s docking port selected, and preferably you want it aimed at your craft. Easiest way to do that is to switch to the targer craft, target your ship, turn in the direction of the pink meatball, set SAS, and then go back to your ship. You\u0027ll probably need to re-target your target at that point but it should be pretty close to directly in front of you anyway. Keep up the pattern of aim-thrust-zero at regular intervals and you should make a successful docking operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lincourtl","CreatedById":72218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-19T17:23:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBlizzy has a great \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/41851\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ein-game docking tutorial\u003C/a\u003E mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-19T17:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you just want to practise docking without having to go through the process of launching something in to orbit first, I created a set of scenarios that you can reset as often as you like until you are happy you can do it successfully.
