It does away with all aesthetics, very low part count and a very affordable price tag.\n\nThese crafts will tickle in here on the Exchange in a slow rate and will be part of a larger collection of budget-lifters built by yours truly. \n\nFirst in the line of crafts I have in mind is the small rocket named \u0027Kobold\u0027. I will be using the names from the \u0022Dungeons and Dragons\u0022-lore for the rockets. \n\n![2015-03-10_00002_zpsuzdvqlfw.jpg](http://i357.photobucket.com/albums/oo19/TimePeriod/2015-03-10_00002_zpsuzdvqlfw.jpg)\n\nDragonforge Technologies (DFT)\n\nCargo Launch System (CLS)\n\n0-5T \u0027Kobold\u0027 (A3) *A3 Refers to the model number and the specific version of that model.* \n\n19.000$$$\n\nLow Kerbin Orbit 5.0625T ~ 176 dv\u002Bexs.(70-71km) *This line refers to the actual payload tonnage, excess dV left after orbital insertion and the actual orbit achieved.* \n\nLaunch time to LKO: 10 minutes.\n\n46 parts(-3) *This line refers to the final tally of parts and the number of parts used as payload weight estimation*\n\n48,7T AL *At launch*\n\nLaunch procedure will come later. \n\nI will make a spreadsheet of each lifter at some point with a launch procedure feel free to comment and ask questions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T19:18:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 07:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TimePeriod**"}]}
