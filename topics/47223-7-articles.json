To that end, I added a poll to the thread - feel free to vote. I want to do *all* of these, the poll would only reflect priority really. Multiple choice was enabled, so let me know what *your* priorities are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a detailed description of the poll options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENTRs\u003C/strong\u003E: this is pretty dependent on finding some art designs I like, but sometimes I get these PMs and I\u0027m slowly warming to the idea. I think it would be a set of several engines in various size categories using my nuclear resources. Some would be bimodal, some unimodal... some mechanics with radiators would be included for bimodal power generation, these would set them apart from Kommitz\u0027s FtMns. There could be some liquid core and some solid core (and maybe gas core? but there\u0027s like no way to balance those in KSP, they\u0027re too awesome).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStructural Trusses\u003C/strong\u003E: Well, I made some trusses that people like. Why not make more? This would include a 0.625m truss set to fit with cubic octagonal struts, maybe a few more bits to fill out the stock 1.25m trusses, maybe some more additions to my octagonal set. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDeep Space Ship Parts\u003C/strong\u003E: This comes out of that landing CSM that I\u0027ve done. I like the CM, and wouldn\u0027t mind making some more parts that are oriented towards a nearly futuristic deep space ship. One thing that might fall into here is deployable ring solar panels (cool, they would be). And more things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStation Parts\u003C/strong\u003E: Because Connected Living Space is pretty cool, I\u0027m interested in making some base parts like the mockup earlier in this thread. This would probably take the form of structural and crew-containing tubes, with a couple of crewed hub-type pieces in a stockalike style. This also might include some landing legs that look more \u0027permanent\u0027 than the stock ones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EORS Integration\u003C/strong\u003E: This is a big one. I\u0027ve been trying to work out other uses for all the electrical stuff other than engines, and the only options tend to be science and ISRU. Additionally, some time ago I promised Fractal some mining parts (and a magnetic nozzle, whose model I still hate) for KSPI, and I\u0027m considering moving those potentially as a download for the ORS system. A number of variously-sized drills, scanners and processors that could be used by people who want ORS implementations would be the thing here. A set of these with specific properties would become part of Near Future for extracting HydrogenGas, XenonGas, ArgonGas and EnrichedUranium. I call this the \u0022most useful to the community\u0022 option. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETech Tree\u003C/strong\u003E: A new set of endgame nodes for Near Future!
