reasons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMost players have no idea that the feature even exists.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt applies to spacecraft in outer space, via reaction wheels, which (IMHO) is completely useless and pointless for a feature that was intended for airplanes in atmospheric flight.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s easy to accidentally trigger the feature, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewithout realizing that you\u0027ve done it\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(it\u0027s activated via Alt plus one of the WASD keys, so it\u0027s easy to accidentally do that if you\u0027re piloting your ship and are a little slow to let go of the Alt key when doing something else)\u003C/span\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere\u0027s no visual indication that the feature is active.\u00A0 (Or, indeed, that it even exists.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOnce it\u0027s active for a craft, it stays active, including when saved and re-loaded (so restarting KSP doesn\u0027t fix the problem).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOnce the feature is active, there\u0027s no obvious way to turn it off, unless you happen to know the magic incantation Alt\u002BX.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n...Personally, I wish they\u0027d just remove the feature entirely.\u00A0 In the 2\u002B years that I\u0027ve been playing KSP, I\u0027ve never \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eonce\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E activated it on purpose (admittedly, I\u0027m not an airplane guy), but I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehave\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E activated it accidentally several times... and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eevery single time\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E I do it accidentally, I end up tearing my hair out over it until I discover (again) that \u0022ohhhhh, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etrim\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\u00A0 (The accidents happen infrequently enough that I always forget about this feature by the time the next incident occurs.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut at the very least, even if they do keep the feature... I really wish they\u0027d give it an explicit UI so that people who don\u0027t know and don\u0027t care about trim (i.e. the large majority of KSP players, I\u0027d guess) won\u0027t get bitten by this.\u00A0 For example:\u00A0 a small graphical UI that pops up when the feature is activated, and goes away when it\u0027s not.\u00A0 The feature would have a dot or crosshairs or something, whose 2D position would indicate the trim setting.\u00A0 There\u0027d be a visually obvious \u0022cancel\u0022 button on the feature.\u00A0 That way, when someone accidentally triggers it, the scenario would go like:\u00A0 \u0022Hey, what\u0027s this thing that just popped up?\u00A0 And hey, my ship is acting funny.\u00A0 Well, I\u0027ll push this button here... okay, it went away.\u00A0 Don\u0027t know what it was, but my ship stopped spinning, so whatever.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I digress.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 Anyway, the existence of the \u0022trim\u0022 feature is something worth knowing about, even if it turns out not to be the problem in your particular case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNO NO DONT DELETE TRIM! It\u0027s essential for actual plane flying! And for visual identification of it, I think it should work like with time warp (a window opens telling you what happened, and you can press ok or press dont say\u00A0this again) so that people who use it a lot don\u0027t constantly get annoyed by some stupid windows while people who don\u0027t know can still know about it. Another good solution, probably much better one,\u00A0is simply telling people about this in one of the in-game tutorials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222713643\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022145673\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470943857\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157505\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022something\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n29 minutes ago, something said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrim is off.
