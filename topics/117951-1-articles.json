There\u0027s a variable called \u0022minDistanceToReengage\u0022, set to 1f, which I think means that once the ports have docked they have to be moved 1 meter apart before magnetism applies again, so that you\u0027re ships don\u0027t redock themselves on undock. I\u0027m currently working on another way to restart drives, so I\u0027ll see how that goes.\n\n-The variable \u0022acquireForce\u0022, which I assume determines the amount of magnetism, is set to 2f by default. I think this means all the docking ports have the same magnetism strength, so a Jr port based drive should be as powerful as a Sr based one. I am by no means sure about this though.\n\n-The variable \u0022acquireRange\u0022 is set to 0.5f by default, so half a metre should be the max distance between docking ports for the drive to work. I guess this could be used for a sort of clutch or neutral gear.\n\n-There is also an \u0022acquireTorque\u0022 variable, set to 2f, which I assume refers to the torque that lines up docking ports. I don\u0027t know what this could be used for, but I\u0027m sure there\u0027s some way to exploit it.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nFirst ever warp drive equipped pickup truck:\n\n![BK583yV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BK583yV.jpg)"}]}
