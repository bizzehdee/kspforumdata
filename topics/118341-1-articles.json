When actually initialized, the Part term gets replaced with whatever reference you are using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epart is the actual reference in a partModule to the parent part that partModule is attached to, so part is an actual reference and replaces the Part term to tell KSP which part you are executing the .RequestResource() method on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny reference that is a part can use it though, one of the more common ones being just p in a foreach statement.
