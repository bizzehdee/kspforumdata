It\u0027s a KSP bug that has been around since forever, and it\u0027s *really* annoying.\n\nWhen you set your *target* as the other docking port, it does correctly target the actual physical location of the docking port, not the target craft\u0027s center of mass, so that\u0027s good.\n\nHowever, that\u0027s not tomf\u0027s problem. The problem is that the navball uses your *own* craft\u0027s **center of mass** as its where-am-I location, regardless of what your \u0022control from here\u0022 setting is. If you do \u0022control from here\u0022 on a docking port whose axis doesn\u0027t pass through your center of mass, then the navball *lies* to you. Setting \u0022control from here\u0022 adjusts the navball\u0027s *orientation*, but not its where-am-I coordinate.\n\nThis makes it really hard to dock, if the docking port on the craft you\u0027re controlling has an axis that\u0027s off your CoM.\n\nHorrible bug, really wish they\u0027d fix it. It\u0027s been there since forever."},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T16:37:38Z","Content":"I\u0027ve experienced this as well.

A lot of rotating the camera view to make sure the X and Y axis were lined up, and a very slow approach."},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T17:05:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve experienced this as well.

One suggestion is to move fuel around in the active ship to move the COM closer to the docking port you want to control from. That obviously won\u0027t help much on a vessel which has full fuel tanks."},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T17:19:53Z","Content":"Normally I discourage answers on par with \u0022There\u0027s a mod for that\u0022, but I find that [Docking Port Alignment Indicator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-1-0-x-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-%28Version-6-2-Updated-05-04-2015%29) is a must-have and should be stock.
