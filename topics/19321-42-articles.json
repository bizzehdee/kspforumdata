I just tried FAR \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC It does make the aircraft \u0027feel\u0027 much more aeroplane-like \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC and there is warning loss of lift before a stall and nice secondary roll when feeding in too much rudder. But it made everything keep way too much energy \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC it was almost like there was no drag at all. The stock Aeris was so floaty I could barely land it even power off \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC it was like trying to bring in a sailplane at the end of a good day, when virtually all the air around is rising slowly. So sadly I uninstalled after an hour or two. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA neat thing to add would be the ability to define control surfaces as flaperons, so that they droop down and add lift and drag (to allow a slower and draggy-er approach) like flaps but still continue to operate as ailerons \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACand allow us to leave off separate flaps or airbrakes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give FAR another go after the next update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AppleJacks69","CreatedById":61670,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T03:17:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah...

I generally use the control surfaces from Taverius\u0027 pack, pWings and either of the two default canards, and I\u0027ve not noticed problems slowing down.
