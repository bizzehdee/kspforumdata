Only use RCS for maneuvering or fine-tuning of orbits; do not rely on it for thrust. RAPIERs or similar modded engines must be used in air-breathing mode only.\n\n\\*This is fairly vague. For concreteness, suborbital flights will be judged according to apoapsis.\n\n**Leaderbord**:\n\n1. NikkyD, ~205 km\n\n2.

Use them.)\n\n2. Impact any celestial body other than Kerbin.\n\n3. Safely land on any atmospheric body other than Kerbin.\n\n4. Return from Laythe ... using only air-breathing engines!\n\n(These are where you might want to use RCS for fine-tuning.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T02:44:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 02:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Whovian**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:36:19Z","Content":"I think you might find that most of those intakes aren\u0027t doing anything.

I\u0027ll agree that it\u0027s a bit sketch; the intention is that minor delta-v from just having RCS thrusters is allowed, but relying on them for delta-v beyond \u0022acute course correction\u0022 is not.
