Currently KSP uses MOST of the PC keyboard. I don\u0027t even want to imagine trying to do stuff in KSP with anything even remotely resembling a console style UI.\n\nSo long as the PC version keeps it\u0027s much more capable keyboard \u0026 mouse centric UI perhaps with, omg, more information (customizeable KER style data readouts anyone?) then great.\n\nThe only thing I hope for from a console version is that it not take away from the PC version."}]}
