I had just finished a four-hour mission to Eve and Gilly. Saved, went back to mission control, and quit the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I reloaded KSP, I click the \u0022Resume Saved Game\u0022 option in the menu but nothing happens; it just highlights the text as if it had been clicked on, but the menu that displays the list of saved games doesn\u0027t display.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis happens with both saved games I have, not just the main one that I was playing with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can create a new game just fine, I just can\u0027t load anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is nothing in the logs. In fact, the logs themselves aren\u0027t even generated for some reason. (There is literally no output_log.txt to speak of!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had the S.A.V.E. mod installed. Thankfully, that backed up my saved games folder. The most recent backup was from two days ago and that runs fine. But, you know, I\u0027d rather not lose the last two days worth of gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this? I have attached my SFS files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully someone has some idea. I realise it\u0027s difficult to help without a log file...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDave\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4446393/persistent.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4446393/persistent.sfs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4446393/quicksave.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4446393/quicksave.sfs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
