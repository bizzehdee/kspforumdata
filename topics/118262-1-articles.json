I had just finished a four-hour mission to Eve and Gilly. Saved, went back to mission control, and quit the game.\n\nThen I reloaded KSP, I click the \u0022Resume Saved Game\u0022 option in the menu but nothing happens; it just highlights the text as if it had been clicked on, but the menu that displays the list of saved games doesn\u0027t display.\n\nThis happens with both saved games I have, not just the main one that I was playing with.\n\nI can create a new game just fine, I just can\u0027t load anything.\n\nThere is nothing in the logs. In fact, the logs themselves aren\u0027t even generated for some reason. (There is literally no output\\_log.txt to speak of!)\n\nI had the S.A.V.E. mod installed. Thankfully, that backed up my saved games folder. The most recent backup was from two days ago and that runs fine. But, you know, I\u0027d rather not lose the last two days worth of gameplay.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this? I have attached my SFS files.\n\nHopefully someone has some idea. I realise it\u0027s difficult to help without a log file...\n\nThanks in advance. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nDave\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4446393/persistent.sfs](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4446393/persistent.sfs)\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4446393/quicksave.sfs](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4446393/quicksave.sfs)"}]}
