One launch (IE I can reset to pad still, yeah this was in normal-sandbox, it was also a first for me), 1890 parts at launch, over 23 megatons, and a guaranteed destroyed launchpad. I\u0027ve uploaded the entire flight (what I captured in screenshots anyhow) to an \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/jkENw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eimgur album\u003C/a\u003E, but I\u0027ll go over the highlights here with a few choice images.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis craft is as yet unnamed, so I\u0027d love some good name suggestions for it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI did use a pair of mods, though all of the parts involved were stock parts save for the mechjeb AR202. I found it necessary to use FSHangarExtender due to the size of this rocket: 98.6 meters high, 71m x 71m in the other two axes. FSHangarExtender simply allows me to zoom out much further, to be able to place the outer layers. This isn\u0027t strictly necessary as you can move the rocket to one edge, I\u0027m pretty sure I had enough room for that, but it certainly does make it easier. Mechjeb I\u0027m sure most of you are familiar with, for those of you that aren\u0027t, it adds a lot of functionality which I\u0027ll definitely take advantage of. I can\u00A0(eventually, a lot of trial and error nodes sometimes) do all of the things I used mechjeb\u00A0for. Interplanetary transfers are a pain but I know how to do em. But without mechjeb, I probably wouldn\u0027t have completed the mission- at 23 megatons this craft still had barely enough fuel at 2 points in the process, where hand planned burns would potentially have used up that fuel.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo first, the rocket in the hangar, with fancy MSpaint lines to show which tanks belong to which branch of the fourfold symmetry the tank belongs to, as well as the stats screen. FSHangarExtender saved my sanity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222u9Slfj.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2u9Slfj.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe engineer\u0027s report is really something else, though I do have quite a few launch stability enhancers. Getting rockets this large\u00A0past physics load-in is a task in and of itself. Each tank is primarily anchored to the one it is staging off, with 6 connections each to that one. There are two additional supports in either direction between tanks in the same ring, though those primarily support rows outside, as once that ring starts staging, the circle is broken and stability greatly decreases. I lost quite a bit of thrust to cosine still, but I did want my computer to be able to eventually process the launch, so I had to limit the amount of stability I could add via struts.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nStill, it loads onto the pad. It needs time to settle down after physics load-in, time to stop the wobble, but after a few minutes because of framerate drop, it\u0027s stable.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OKwWoKY.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022580\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OKwWoKY.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis launch is exactly as ridiculous as it looks. And for what it\u0027s worth, goes mostly as planned. The mechjeb \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E stat page really tells the tale of a brief yet agonizing climb which took more than an hour to process 5 minutes worth of launch, and actually reach orbit.

It was at this point that I messed up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe two mammoths which are further back along the ship are to be staged rapidly, less than 10 seconds to burn in each stage as they each have only a single tank to burn. There is a rhino located above each of them. I decided to switch to orbital alignment at this point, which nearly blew up the craft. One of the newly emptied tank\u002Bmammoth debris tagged one of the mammoths that was still burning and destroyed it. Luckily, the game was still moving at a snail\u0027s pace, so I could react quickly enough to save the launch.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI quickly shut off the engines and staged again, to blow off the crippled stage, before I resumed full thrust. I lost around 90 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E from this because I didn\u0027t get to use that stage, but that\u0027s much better than imbalanced burning and the pains which come with that. There was a slight fuel imbalance in the later asparagus stages, but it was apparently so little that I didn\u0027t have problems from misalignments during Eve entry. But now I\u0027m into first rhino burn stage, which will last 1 minute 15 seconds, starts with 0.98 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (because of my elevation, live SLT for rhinos is now maxed), and has over 800 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Here\u0027s what the craft looks like at that 600k circular orbit:\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YjiM7hA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YjiM7hA.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust 8 fuel tanks outside of the Eve lander itself, which you can finally see. This is my biggest development here, which is really just asparagus staging taken to an extreme: There are 52 Vector engines, equivalent to 13 Mammoths, mounted on 2.5m to 4x1.25m quad stack adaptors. Each quad Vector is the same thrust as a Mammoth, 4,000 kN, and though it does weigh slightly more, it also has better atmospheric performance, which is ESSENTIAL to this process. The 2.5m form factor allowed me to more easily use 2.5m fuel tanks, which helped quite a bit with keeping the weight still manageable.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe big secret is that the lander has 3.55 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E in Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E vacuum. The hardware is not payload- the fuel on it is payload, but the hardware is VERY \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E positive. The ship seen above, with the 4x8 fuel tank only stage, is still 13 m/s/s of acceleration!! Pumping fuel into those engines from the ground means that I need fewer engines to be staged off later, which allows me a much larger craft. Lifting off is about maintaining sufficient \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and angle for your current velocity- more thrust = more fuel hauling ability. The Eve lander itself is so net positive \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E that it can get the 4x8 stage off the ground alone, respectably even with 1.3 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft itself being forced to have so high a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E in order to lift off Eve and combat the heavy atmosphere down near sea level, can lift a lot of its own fuel. Two additional 4x7 fuel tank \u002B rhino stages, along with the mammoth on the first 7\u002Brhino stage that I showed earlier, is enough to actually achieve orbit around kerbin from 35k and 300-400 m/s, as well as to transfer to Eve and slow down enough to achieve low eve orbit with minimal use of the fuel on the lander itself. The booster stages were just there to 1) fuel the lander and the other engines as they went, and 2) provide additional thrust to get those large tanks up to 35km\u002B from the pad. Each 3 tank \u002B mammoth provides some net \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E bonus, but the 2 tank \u002B mammoth as a booster stage provides a much higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E bonus. The 1 tank \u002B mammoths were the last to be staged because of their position inside the rings, under the rhinos which would not have helped much at sea level anyhow, in order to keep \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E high at lower altitudes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is Asparagus staging taken to an extreme, really, with utilization (in design anyhow, I didn\u0027t fly it very well) of changing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E levels appropriately throughout the staging.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022T02K8op.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/T02K8op.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbital stuff\u0027s pretty normal orbital transfers. I had a quick transit so I didn\u0027t actually pass through a plane node, so I didn\u0027t bother to plane change. I did do a fine tune burn to get a periapsis of 100km at Eve.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229e78pMO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022572\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9e78pMO.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeorbited a bit too hard I think, should\u0027ve had less thrust at this point. The tale of this landing is a long and harrowing one best read in full, because highlights won\u0027t do it justice. This picture shows a critical error which almost cost me the mission, slowing down too quickly at too high of an altitude, causing me to plunge into the lower atmosphere too quickly, without enough fuel. There were other errors along the way before a last minute save at only 6km, with my drogue chutes destroyed, no fuel, and very little chance of aero effects braking me sufficiently for my parachutes to save me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GG5alRH.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022579\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GG5alRH.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fins!

I just don\u0027t see how it\u0027s even possible to make fundamental changes to sufficiently lose mass.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChanging the last stage to a 16x ion cluster, instead of the LV-N\u0027s, leaves me with ~4500 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, but at a third the thrust. It\u0027s also much, much lighter. The problem I see is that the vector engines are still necessary to this style in order to lift off Eve. It is possible to asparagus some 1.25m tanks with a single vector on the bottom, resulting in many more stages and no doubt a more efficient launch, but the number of parts would balloon quickly, especially if I were to attach separatrons to keep the stages close together. 1.25m asparagus is also simply not as strong as 2.5m, so for those reasons, I think the 2.5m tanks make launches much more feasible. Kerbin launches too, fixing the main 3 tanks to the Eve lander I used is much easier than a more awkward 1.25m setup.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis being said, even if I decrease the mass of the final return craft by changing to ion, the biggest problem is still the lower atmosphere. The LV-N stage brings my final stage weight to around 42 tons, where the ion cluster would be ~16t. But the *empty* mass of the stage immediately prior with 20 x 1.25m tanks and 4 vectors, the mass that\u0027s shed when the stage is empty, was over 18 tons, and carries 80 tons of fuel at its start. That\u0027s 98 tons, bringing the ion cluster\u0027s total weight at that point to around 114 tons, and the LV-N\u0027s to around 140T. This will give it a lot more thrust and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, to be sure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with that is, that it doesn\u0027t make very much difference in what I *can* bring for the lower stages. I\u0027m still likely going to strap on the same red booster stages. Tsiolkovsky\u0027s gets me a great return for the ion switch, *if* I can shed the rest of the mass. Switching to 1.25m tanks is problematic but possible, but if I use the same red booster stages, the final mass of the craft isn\u0027t going to change very much. I will have higher thrust (not by much, not enough to switch to 3x vectors instead of 4x, I don\u0027t think) and better fuel efficiency, but from my new experience with variations on Vector designs, and lifting off Eve, the vast majority of the fuel goes into the lower atmosphere, either into aero forces or into maintaining terminal for so long.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve takeoff needs a lot of thrust, for a long time, which needs a lot of fuel. I think the extremeness of this atmosphere problem does a number on the Tsiolkovsky gains you make from switching to ion cluster, to the point where\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eviable liftoff\u003C/em\u003E configurations which will lift small payloads to low Eve orbit don\u0027t benefit much from the mass being 16T instead of 42T, despite Tsiolkovsky\u0027s law. I don\u0027t know how much fine tuning can go into making the Eve launch more efficient, as there is a long phase where 1.1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is all that\u0027s required. Setting up a rocket to 1) have 1.1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for that period, and 2) being able to quickly boost to that point prior to that, would be a way to potentially remove 4 or even 8 vector engines by switching to tristacks instead of quad, so it\u0027s possible that more weight could be shaved off there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the dry mass at landing was nearly 500 tons, wet mass 1.6 megatons. It\u0027s playing a game of inches when the scale is in miles. I probably could shave 50-100 tons off wet mass of the lander by tweaking things using that flight\u0027s data, but then I\u0027ve got to get 1.5 megatons to low Eve orbit instead of 1.6. And with the amount of time it takes to launch this, as well as the complexity of reconstructing on any changes,\u00A0I\u0027m loathe to tweak designs as opposed to just constructing new. If I change the spacing on where the big 3 sets of tanks are, I have to redo almost every single fuel duct and strut, which means a lot get left behind and are extra parts doing nothing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, hope you guys liked it, I know I had a lot of fun and even though I made some mistakes in flying it, the mistakes didn\u0027t kill me. I might make another attempt at it in the future if I can drop the part count, or find a better way to launch from Eve. Please let me know what you think, I\u0027d love to get some fresh ideas on how to build these things!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NotAgain","CreatedById":150764,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-16T12:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrikey!

With\u00A0KSPI in particular I have had Eve landings and returns, but there are a few engines with nearly infinite \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, the thermal jets which use reactors and atmosphere to provide insane thrust, and the Quantum Thruster which only uses electricity. So the big one here for me is \u0022Stock.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) 3 kerbals, or at least 2 for the engineer bonus on refuelling. In one of my earlier unsuccessful missions, it took me almost 2 years to refuel on Eve\u0027s surface, so I wanted to do what I could to speed that up. The Mk 1-2 is for the engineer, and so I can have only one capsule w/ ablator for kerbin reentry. It makes a huge mass difference, it was a lot less fuel to get the mk1 back to kerbin\u00A0from Eve\u0027s surface, though that launch didn\u0027t make Eve orbit and had to be reset.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Be able to reset to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E because until this made it home, there were a lot of failures.

Haven\u0027t tested them though. So, a \u0022not-constraint\u0022 of using fuel to safely brake to landing speed rather than heat shields.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for splitting the craft... do you mean something along the lines of leaving an orbiter around Eve, so I don\u0027t have to haul my Eve-\u0026gt;Kerbin transfer up from Eve\u0027s surface? I\u0027m not opposed to transferring/EVAing\u00A0kerbals, and I suppose if the craft has reached Eve orbit again, I can safely give up the \u0022Reset to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 option.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been iterating over this design some more and I did manage to shed a lot of weight (and parts! I forgot what quick launches looked like, this is less than half the parts at kerbin launch) by switching to ion for return. Using ion to circularize like I did with the LV-N\u0027s failed a few times, to the point where I realized 1.8 m/s/s is simply not going to be able to finish circularizing and I had to get most of the fuel for orbit into the lower stages.

I couldn\u0027t get TakeCommandContinued to work. Downloaded the latest version and everything, not sure what\u0027s up with it, but I managed to get it to work even though it\u0027s a pain.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also discovered (though I am quite sure I am not the first) that a kerbal weighs 94 kilograms. The end mass of my smallest stage was 0.440t, prior to loading kerbals. Afterwards, it\u0027s 0.628t, giving them a combined mass of .188t, or 94 kilos each.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis painful discovery also causes a crazy\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E loss in the final stage. From ~3250 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E w/o the kerbals, to ~2575 with them. Without the kerbals, the spark craft only weighs 1.240 tons at the start, so the addition of 188 kilograms is a HUGE burden. For what it\u0027s worth, kerbals do not seem to add 94 kilograms to the weight of a pod, though they do weigh 0.09t in the map screen while on eva.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was also a little caught up on bringing the 2nd kerbal, but the only reason I was bringing the engineer was to make the refuelling process go faster. I only needed to refuel because I couldn\u0027t successfully aerobrake, but I decided to go the kerbtastic\u00A0route and simply affix more 10m heat shields to the rear so that the craft can do nothing but align correctly. This also has the benefit of providing a lot more surface area, and therefore drag, slowing the craft more at higher altitudes and making aerobraking even easier/less explosive. So I managed to get the 10m shields to work, even if it\u0027s on the wrong end. If it\u0027s stupid, but it works....\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113764-foxster/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022113764\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113764-foxster/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Foxster\u003C/a\u003E, I put together one of the craft you showed me that takes off from Eve.
