I decided to close the game and restart it in the hopes that it might have just been bugged and doing that would fix, but same result of not being able to recover Jeb. Reboot the whole computer and again same result. So I open up the log while loading into the game and I see this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETac.AddLifeSupport[5905E740][43.91]: The expected exception is still happening when adding the Life Support part module to the EVA: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003Cp\u003E at Part.AddModule (System.String moduleName) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at Part.AddModule (.ConfigNode node) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at Tac.AddLifeSupport.EvaAddPartModule (.Part part) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI uninstalled the part I thought might be causing the conflict, but still the same thing. I also notice when I EVA\u0027ed Jeb out it said in yellow warning text \u0022Error - EmptyEvaSuit-Cannot find VesselInffo for ....\u0022. Give me a bit and I will render up that section of video to show what I did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow Jeb is back on the on my list of available crew AND still out where he landed in this video. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/niDhvPMx6-Y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/niDhvPMx6-Y\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-26T18:29:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2014 06:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Liowen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
