Just never once on the runway at KSC. I still cannot pick the correct deorbit burn point from a 100 km orbit. I have always either undershot or overshot the runway. I also have RealChutes installed and have fitted two drag chutes to the rear of the KSO and they help reduce my velocity greatly for a nice gentle touchdown (like I said just never on the runway - usually in the water 20km east of the end of the strip).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helldiver","CreatedById":74755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T07:24:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGuys need to be a little patient.

I might not even use some of these for stations. With the way the IVAs are set up, they would work brilliantly as base modules. Also, does the Lab module have the Stock science lab functionality, or is it more like the functionality of interstellar?
