Rather than the boiler completely emptying and then refilling, the header tank immediately replaces anything that\u0027s used, so effectively it\u0027s the header tank that\u0027s drained, and until it\u0027s empty the boiler stays completely full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order for this to happen, when placing the hoses you should first click on the tank you want to be the \u0027header tank\u0027 and then on the tank you want to be the \u0027boiler tank\u0027. Basically, fuel flows from first click to second click.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand (assuming you\u0027re not playing career or you\u0027ve upgraded your buildings at KSC - I forget which one, might be R\u0026amp;D?), you can refill empty tanks from full tanks manually by right clicking on them in game. First right click on an empty tank, then hold alt and right click on a full one. Underneath the fuel level bars on the tooltip are 2 buttons, labelled (I think) \u0027in\u0027 and \u0027out\u0027. If you click \u0027in\u0027 on the empty or \u0027out\u0027 on the full one, fuel will be transfered through your ship from the full tank to the empty tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo transfer fuel from one full tank to multiple empty tanks, hold alt and right click on all the tanks (don\u0027t right click on anything else - if you do the in/out buttons won\u0027t appear and you\u0027ll have to start over) and then just click \u0027out\u0027 on the full tank. This will transfer fuel from that tank to all the others evenly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, on the right by the fuel level bars on the tool tips are toggle boxes that are either a green arrowhead or a red dot (again I think). The green means this fuel can be used by an attached engine, the red means it can\u0027t - you change it by clicking. It could be that one of these buttons accidentally got clicked during the build and that\u0027s why the fuel isn\u0027t being drained or transferred (by hoses) evenly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-17T00:55:04Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2015 12:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
