Makes sense\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 \u0022yeah, finally made it to Jool!\u0022 (BOOM in background) \u0022WTF, my fuel tank exploded? Now? #$#@!$#!$\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad idea. Got it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, problems can actually be fun to play (some of my best flight sim moments have been flying badly damaged warplanes home). Last night I was trying to move a small science station to munar orbit, and I screwed up my staging order. Long story short, my choice was to revert, or to dock with the now staged away part, and try to finish getting it to munar orbit. The docking ports for this are (stupidly) on the side. It\u0027s grossly unbalanced. Pushing it is nontrivial, in other words. I turned on my RCS to aid the gyro, and used low thrust to keep from spinning. Works OK unless you need a long burn at apoapsis. Still, a different problem, non-trivial, but what the heck, \u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E life isn\u0027t at stake \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt got me thinking of something I posted in another thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if the tech tree would unlock new, \u0022X\u0022 tech from one node ahead of the one you unlocked? That would be past the new stuff you just unlocked, but it\u0027s the alpha version. Not ready for primetime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlocking a new node in career mode would result in testing contracts for the new parts, or the parts would default to all having the \u0022test\u0022 bottom on right click, possibly. You\u0027d use them as usual, and and after X uses or test results (variable by the part), they\u0027d present a message that \u0022Rocketdyne engineers have realized their gross math errors, and have improved their engine!\u0022 or whatever. The part is now as advertised. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFailure chances would be random (most will work fine). Random failures would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELowered performance:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELower Isp, higher fuel use, lower capacity of tank, uses more power than expected, lower ejection force, lower impact resistance, etc. Some minor range. These might be the most common flaws. Results in test data, likely doesn\u0027t change mission success at all (unless you spam a new rocket with tons of X tech, maybe). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWrong performance:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGimble doesn\u0027t work, or locks at some angle., tanks leak fuel, etc. These are bad results that might compromise a mission. Cool graphics (fuel spraying out, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECatastrophic failure:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027d stay away from \u0022BOOM! ship gone\u0022 failures (no fun), but think Apollo 13 as a worst case. Engines stop working, fuel tank pops, etc. Stuff that makes you think of \u0022plan B.\u0022 If it is hilarious to have the very rare BOOM, by all means, add that as a 1% chance or something \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t use the X tech, after some time (or science gained, or a new node unlocked, something, it becomes regular tech anyway. This is a way to preview new tech by choice---at a risk. Worst case, you mount a rescue mission, or have to stage away the rocket, and do a suborbital flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
