My goal is to reconstruct these sci-fi ships and get them into orbit around Kerbin at minimum. There\u0027s been many that have failed (usually due to lack of parts available or just shoddy engineering - I\u0027m not an *actual* rocket surgeon) and a whole lot that succeeded, but I really want to get an idea of what is currently available.\n\nI\u0027ve been on Reddit and here on the forums checking things out for ages and I have found a Klingon Bird of Prey and a Stargate Daedelus class vessel that are pre-built. I also found a functional F-302 from Stargate SG-1 that can SSTO without a problem posted on reddit this morning.\n\nWhat I would really like to know are three things:\n\n1. What sort of ships would you like to see?\n\n2. Are there any pre-designed ships that are worth adding to Space Base DP-1?\n\n3. Are there any worthwhile part mods that I should look at for things like curved components or spherical fuel tanks? - I really want to make Starbug from Red Dwarf.\n\nThe ones I have made so far that have succeeded (well, some are incomplete) are uploaded to [kerbalX here](http://www.kerbalx.com/digitalpsychosis) and the goal is to make this the biggest crossover imaginable!\n\nI\u0027d love your help, fellow Kosmonauts!"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T02:44:37Z","Content":"Planet Express Ship?"},{"CreatedByName":"digitalpsychosis","CreatedById":138744,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T02:57:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Planet Express Ship?\n\nI tried that one out, but couldn\u0027t manage it.
