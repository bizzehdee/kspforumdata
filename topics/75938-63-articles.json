You can angle them, or course, but weird stuff tends to happen with really wide fields, which is why I sort of left it at 8m. That being said, I\u0027m happy to leave the repulsor test module live in the plugin for next release, which allows 64m, so you can config bash and play about to your hearts content with the 1.8 version. \u003Cp\u003EAnd generally, apologies for my hiatus.

The issue I have with them currently is that I can\u0027t set the strength high enough for ludicrously large crafts (~ 35,000 to 50,000 tons), so either I put 923859835938 repulsors (even with their strength tweaked to the max) or wait for the TweakScale goodness to arrive =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy usual disclaimer: no clue how any of this works, so I\u0027m just going to throw out some verbiage and see what happens. If the issue is the edge of the wheel colliders being more than 8 meters from the base they\u0027re attached to (presumably), could there be an invisible, collision-less base (imagine an invisible landing gear leg, or really just an invisible, non-colliding cube, or something) that gets added between the wheel and the visible repulsor when its scale is increased? As if the repulsor part itself were actually much bigger than it looks, while the wheel collider is still only 8m from the edge of the invisible bits now added to the visible part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes any of that even make any sense?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to the next release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T22:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHehe!

So once you get hovering \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; than vessel length, you tend to run into major stability issues, and things get rather counter-intuitive. You can move stuff around in the part, but then you get a hard limit on how close to the ground you can get, and if you turn them off the WC clips through the ground and will never make contact again unless you have another way of getting the craft lifted to clip back above the ground collider. They certainly won\u0027t ever make a a VTOL you can fly around at 5,000 feet I\u0027m afraid - it would need a totally different mechanic for that, and, well: wings \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGaalidas, you\u0027ll find that the RepulsorTest module has 64m height.
