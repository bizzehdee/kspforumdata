And then I changed the orbit to a 150 km orbit around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had no problems with redirecting it. The centre of mass was targeted perfectly fine and the onboard RCS and reaction wheels allowed for minor errors in targeting the centre of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, once I assembled my Gilly transfer vehicle and attached it to the asteroid facing the centre of mass, it spins out when I activate the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the album below, there are screenshots showing the alignment to the target of centre of mass before and after I connect to the asteroid. After I connect, the vehicle is not pointing through the centre of mass anymore. So I freed the pivot on the grabbing unit and rotated my vehicle to correct the direction its facing. But as you can tell, it looks so wrong. It doesn\u0027t look like it\u0027s pointing through the centre of mass. And the final screenshot is of when I\u0027ve activated the engine and the asteroid has begun to spin because of the force not being applied towards the centre of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/o2rwA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

As RainDreamer pointed out, one solution is to make the pulling vessel either long enough (with engines near the front and grabber on the back) so that the effect is nullified, or wide enough so that your engines fire next to the asteroid. Of course that last solution is kinda hard with E-class asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA third, and in my opinion quite elegant solution is to tilt your engines outwards. That way they fire next to the asteroid without the need for making a super-wide ship. Note that this does put extra stress on your structure and reduces the efficiency of your engines because part of the thrust goes to forces squeezing the ship together. The loss is related to the angle: the wider the angle, the more loss. For reference: you\u0027ll only have 50% efficiency if your engines are angled 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 outwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T07:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, your engines will have approx. 71% efficiency at a 45 degree angle. It\u0027s actually cos A, where A is the angle between the direction of intended travel and the direction of each engine. You may see this sort of thing referred to as cosine losses, along with some similar things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
