This is \u003Cstrong\u003Eoptional\u003C/strong\u003E. If you change those buttons to orbit increments, it will also change the time UT buttons to increment at 10x the normal rate (0.1x become 1x, 1x becomes 10x, etc...) with the expected GUI changes to properly indicate the current functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlex Moon\u0027s change is a no-brainer and Angavrilov\u0027s is purely optional, so they\u0027ll both be included in the next release. In light of these great additions I\u0027m going to set down my RSS fun and tackle some low-hanging fruit, and push another release as soon as possible.

I\u0027ll probably give an option whereby you can set the default UT addition to \u0022now\u0022 for new maneuver nodes (to default to five minutes from \u0022now\u0022, you\u0027d add 600 seconds, for instance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn between launching incredibly gaudy rockets, I\u0027ve been checking on methods to see if we have valid Apo-/Periapsis for the AN/DN buttons, but that is going to take me some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading, have a good one!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T20:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading, have a good one!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for sharing your vision on those improvements! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T21:00:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEverything sounds great, fantastic pending additions to this wonderful mod.
