I especially like the ion bike! When I run missions, I like to bring rovers along to milk science points, but those take forever. I think you\u0027ve invented a better alternative. Do you think slapping some RTGs on it would nix the electricity problem, or would it be too heavy?"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T13:59:00Z","Content":"Thanks!\n\nThe ion bike version in the video is a little outdated. I made one with 8 1x6 solar panels (4 on each side) that mitigates the electricity problem somewhat. You could also spam it with the smallest battery since it is massless and therefore doesn\u0027t reduce TWR.\n\nThe Ion Bike as it is has just an inchling more than 1.01 TWR on Duna. Maybe I get rid of one or two Xenon tanks (4800 m/s dV currently is probably overkill) so save weight so I can add more batteries or panels or RTGs."},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T22:23:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So I got bored with the way landing usually works: Using a transfer vehicle to the target planet/moon, land a lander, get back up and rendezvous and then continue on.
