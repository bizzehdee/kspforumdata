Check your KSP directories and make sure they are not set to \u0022Read Only\u0022. This is sometimes a problem with steam installs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t load a ship, this is usually because you have a corrupt .craft file. The .craft file can sometimes become corrupt if the game crashes, typically because it\u0027s in the middle of writing the file and not all of the information is present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually to fix this, you\u0027ll have to narrow down which file is broken and remove it. If you know you were working on a ship when the game crashed, you can start by checking that file first. If you\u0027re not sure, there are a couple things you can do...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bring up the debug log (Via MOD\u002BF2, ALT\u002BF2 if you are on windows). Then click on the \u0022Load\u0022 button. KSP should generate a message saying which file it had a problem with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If that doesn\u0027t work, move all of your ship files out of the appropriate ships\\SPH or ships\\VAB directory to somewhere safe, and try clicking on the load button again. If that works, move half the ship files back and try again. Keep moving ship files back until it doesn\u0027t work anymore and you should be able to narrow down the broken file. By the way, you don\u0027t need to restart KSP while moving the files. Just switch out of the game, move the files around, then go back into KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee if any of that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralAdama","CreatedById":131674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T20:08:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe buttons themselve refuse to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere should I be looking for these \u0027Read Only\u0027 files?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceJuice","CreatedById":129597,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T02:41:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a same problem, try taking all your ships out and adding them back one by one.
