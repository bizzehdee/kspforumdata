Powered by two RTGs and solar panels, it can transport three kerbals and any load attached to its two docking ports across any surface.  \n  \n**Information**  \n- Six-wheeled all terrain vehicle  \n- Capable of negotiating a variety of terrain obstacles  \n- Safe. The crew is protected by an impact tolerant shell (see video, where the crew compartment survives disassembly)  \n  \n**Operational Guide:**  \n1 - activate six wheel drive mode - best used for high speed long distance driving over fairly even terrain  \n2 - activate rear wheel steering - best used for low speed maneuvering  \n  \n*Do* ***not*** *activate staging, as this will lead to the rapid disassembly of the vehicle*  \n  \nTo enter the vehicle, drop down the rear ladder after activating the parking brakes. This will allow access to the front driver\u0027s seat.  \n  \n**Link:**  \n[http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/232370-prowler-c4c-atv-all-terrain-vehicle](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/232370-prowler-c4c-atv-all-terrain-vehicle)  \n  \n![r2E45Sm.png](http://i.imgur.com/r2E45Sm.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T00:22:15Z","Content":"Me likey!

Might have to take it for testing...\n\nThanks!\n\nIt\u0027s probably down to the fact that there are three layers of suspension:\n\n1: the wheel parts themselves have some suspension, which isn\u0027t very springy, but enough to negotiate small bumps in the terrain smoothly\n\n2: the stack decouplers extending from the main frame of the vehicle out to the wheel nodes. The lower set dampens lateral movement of the wheels (preventing them from drifting off-direction and causing a crash) while the upper set is the main \u0027vertical motion dampener\u0027 and is most efficient at high speed impacts\n\n3: chassis suspension, which is very springy, and gives the vehicle a very \u0027elastic\u0027 feel. It\u0027s mostly seen in high speed impacts as well, and dampens the shock of landing on the lower parts of the vehicle"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T15:19:13Z","Content":"Poor pilot - i could see him becoming green after those bumps from the chassis\u0027 movements \u0027 (oh wait, the pilot\u0027s a kerbal ^^)"},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:32:23Z","Content":"Just make sure to use the seat belts and everything should be fine.\n\n(Vomit bags not included)"},{"CreatedByName":"etopsirhc","CreatedById":109812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T06:47:40Z","Content":"with those air brakes i wanna call it the mad rabbit."}]}
