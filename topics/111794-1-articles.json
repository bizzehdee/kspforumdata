I am not even entirely sure this is what I think it is as my testing didn\u0027t show any appearance changes I could specifically determine.\n\nIf the UTaR/ToD field is not related to the appearance of each kerbal as it seems to be relatively unique, does anyone know (can they tell me?) what this field is and what attribute /does/ effect the randomized appearance of kerbals?\n\nI would very much appreciate this as I am trying to apply this to my existing mod that hires kerbals and to this point I can not figure out how to randomize their appearances in a way that is noticeable?\n\nThanks very much in advance. People in this forum have been incredibly helpful so far!!\n\n-OakTree42"},{"CreatedByName":"TheReadPanda","CreatedById":142617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T01:01:23Z","Content":"Should clarify, I am well aware of what a double type is.

Do you have any idea of what parameters are used to normally generate this value? Perhaps I will dig to see if I can find any new references to this in the C-Sharp api hook now that I know it relates to respawn."}]}
