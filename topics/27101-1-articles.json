I repurposed an early Duna lander for the mission: the Muad\u0027Keeb 6 (sometimes known as the Phallus 7; never stick a chute on top of a PB-NUK). To do that, I slapped on a trio of BZ-52s, added some TR-2V stack seperators, and stuck the rovers onto them.

Not a lot of room under the lander for getting them upright either. Fortunately I had the foresight to quicksave before letting them go. I blew up all three driving around the surface.
