Anyway some of the guys said, that they only add parts from mod they use and even only add high res textures for places they currently are at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the point is, installing even two or three of those part packages is too memory consuming for 32-victims.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat rp0 is doing is tweaking it to a good gameplay (yaaay!), but the components you have to pick out by yourself, which I find kind of odd.

If not I will go on install most mods and make a list of parts needed and a pruner list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually what I like to have is do-it-all-yourself, which relies on procedural parts only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, at least you need engines, command pods and the utilities like sience experiments solar panels, i.e. every part wich has a functionality you cannot mimik with procedural parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I dont want to have the all-in-one-part apollo/gemini pods, service modules, or landers, since it is my job to construct them.

As I know there was almost all equipment in the service module, in the pod itself only navigtion stuff.
