Player \u0027B\u0027 decides to \u0027catch up\u0027 with Player \u0027A\u0027s ship and rendezvous with it. Player B is successful, and decides to (like a troll) change the general ship\u0027s trajectory, so now it is in a generally circular orbit around Kerbol (because now the ship is past Kerbin\u0027s Shere of influence). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you caught the problem... Now 2 realities exist in the same server, one where the ship is on Duna, and one where it is in orbit around Kerbol. But also what happened to the Rover? It was disconnected from the main ship in player \u0027A\u0027s reality so it should not be affected, but It was still attached in Player \u0027B\u0027s reality so it should be affected.
