KSP is one of them. I\u0027m proud to be a member of the community here, too. For the most part, it\u0027s a great group, and I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll ever find a better one. \n\nHowever, after the release of 1.0 and its subsequent patches, the community seems to have become less unified and more angry. While some aspects of this anger may be justified, others are certainly not. So today, I\u0027m just going to give my two cents on the current state of affairs within the community, as well as how it can be improved. Take these opinions with a grain of salt (I\u0027m certainly not perfect), but give them some thought, alright?\n\nA Reminder to the Community.\n\n~~~\n\nI want to say that when it comes to being irritated, there are some times when your irritation is absolutely justified. However, your method of expressing this irritation is often rather extreme. Dialing back a notch would often do a better job of conveying your opinions to both SQUAD and the other members of the community.\n\nI know that many of you will defend loudly exclaiming, \u0022This part/system should be changed!\u0022 After all, it worked for the Round-8, for example. **That\u0027s not what I\u0027m here to talk about today.** \n\n**Instead, I want to discuss times when loud statements have no chance** ***whatsoever*** **of doing anything other than harming the community.** I *will* try to keep it friendly: after all, I don\u0027t want to fall under any of the categories below myself.\n\nSo, what can our community improve upon?\n\n~~~\n\n1. Attacking SQUAD for things that have already happened.\n\nThis has been one of the biggest points of contention for the Forum lately. After the release of 1.0, many Forum-goers have been irate about SQUAD releasing KSP prematurely, which has led to some heated discussion.\n\nIt\u0027s difficult to emphasize this enough: **1.0 has already been released.** It\u0027s out, whether you like it or not. There is nothing you can do to change this fact, unless you have a time machine. And even then, the paradoxes would be immense!\n\nIs it right to be irritated that 1.0 isn\u0027t as good a version as you thought it would be? Perhaps. But many people on the Forum are taking it one step further. Their argument is, essentially, that we warned SQUAD of the impeding problems with 1.0 and they didn\u0027t listen. Depending on who you ask, they could certainly be considered correct. But bringing up this point again and again is akin to gloating. At the end of the day, *what does it accomplish?* It doesn\u0027t make a better game and it doesn\u0027t make for a better community. Indeed, there have been some serious, often impolite arguments flying both ways.\n\nThe only argument you could make in favor of this gloating is that some are saying, \u0022SQUAD should listen to the community more! If it did, these things wouldn\u0027t happen.\u0022 But if we\u0027re just deadlocked in events of the past, criticizing decisions that have already been made, there\u0027s no real reason why SQUAD *would* listen to us. \n\nIt\u0027s time to accept that 1.0 is out, and that it\u0027s a much better use of your time to ask that SQUAD fixes things that *aren\u0027t* impossible to fix. Okay?\n\n~~~\n\n2. Claiming to know exactly how the game should be developed, and getting irritated when it is not so.\n\nThere was once an expression that went something like, \u0022The greatest experts are the ones in the stands.\u0022 I can\u0027t remember exactly how it goes, but you get the idea. (Anyone who could point me towards the real expression gets free Internet points!)\n\n**SQUAD, it is important to note, is doing what it thinks is best for KSP.** There are a few people who think that it is deliberately trying to make a bad game, and this is *simply not the case*. If SQUAD really was trying to make a bad game, I hope you can agree that the game would be much worse than it is now.\n\nThat being said, they sometimes don\u0027t listen to their community. And sometimes they are wrong. But they listen to the community quite often, and they are actually right more often than not. I don\u0027t think that enough people appreciate this.\n\nIs it reasonable to make requests to SQUAD? Absolutely. Is it right to get irritated if these requests are not fulfilled? Not really. While SQUAD\u0027s opinions on what make this game great may be different from ours, it has full control over the game and nothing will change this. In addition, the community\u0027s interests and SQUAD\u0027s interests often align well, though they may disagree when it comes to the minutiae of the game. There\u0027s where the \u0022SQUAD isn\u0027t listening to us!\u0022 argument comes into play. (I know there are exceptions to this, but it seems as if many quibbles are over surprisingly minor aspects of the game.)\n\nI would also say that few other developers work with the community at all, including indie game developers. SQUAD is doing us a huge favor as it is. When we\u0027re yelling things at SQUAD, we\u0027re going a little too far. And when SQUAD doesn\u0027t unconditionally try to work on what we want and we get irritated, we\u0027re behaving like privileged children who don\u0027t know how lucky they are. I\u0027m sorry to say this, but it negatively impacts the community. And I don\u0027t think anyone wants that to happen.\n\n~~~\n\n3. Posting harsh things to other Forum members.\n\nThis one is a given.\n\nAs a Forum and a community, we should do our best to get along. There will be disagreements, there\u0027s no doubting that. But some people take these disagreements to a whole other level.\n\nMaybe yelling at SQUAD will make them \u0027Bring Back the Round-8,\u0027 but yelling at other forum members *will not change their mind*. As a matter of fact, it will make them even more opposed to your point of view. Being hostile does not encourage rational thought, but instead personal attacks and other such travesties. This behavior will never be acceptable.\n\nI\u0027m not going to talk about this one too much, as I\u0027m sure you already know all about it. But it is certainly something to consider before hitting the \u0027Post\u0027 button.\n\n~~~\n\nWell, that\u0027s my two cents. If you agree with them, I\u0027m happy we\u0027re on the same page. If you disagree, having a rational and well-thought-out discussion would be great. (Anything less productive will not be tolerated. I hope you understand where I\u0027m coming from here.)\n\nI look forward to hearing what you have to say on this. Thanks for taking the time to read it!\n\n-Upsilon\n\n(P.S. I wish I could have posted this earlier. I\u0027m having ongoing computer troubles, and thus I wasn\u0027t able to get this guy out when it was most needed. But better late than never, right?)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T16:27:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 04:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by UpsilonAerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T02:28:47Z","Content":"^^^^^^ This, \u002B1.\n\nConstructive commentary gets things done.

When has that ever been a convincing argument? The moment you do anything it\u0027s already in the past. So what?\n\n**2.** This whole point is a bit of a strawman and a red herring. I can\u0027t honestly believe you think anyone in this community ACTUALLY BELIEVES SQUAD ARE SABOTAGING THEIR OWN PRODUCT. Come on... As for Squad doing what\u0027s best for KSP, well it\u0027s not that simple. Squad are a capitalist organisation (otherwise known as a business) and as such they are doing what they **think** is best for **Squad, not KSP**. KSP being good or bad is just a vehicle for that, as is our enjoyment of the \u0022finished\u0022 product. Which brings us back to point 1.\n\nNow if you think that a game has to be good for large masses to buy it then you\u0027ve not been paying attention to the game market in recent years. Many studios that I would consider reputable a few years ago now put out unfinished garbage, lackluster DLC or pay-to-win nonsense, which should tell you just one thing. Gamers will buy ANYTHING.\n\nI\u0027ve heard some commentators say that another game market crash is approaching because of this over-saturation. I kinda care about Squad and I\u0027d like them to survive, which is why I\u0027ve been critical. It\u0027s a good thing. KSP being the first game of it\u0027s kind deserves better.\n\nAs consumers we have every right to express our experience. That\u0027s what a free market is. You buy something. You enjoy it. You talk about it, and get Squad more exposure and more business. You don\u0027t enjoy it, You also talk about it to warn others to be more cautious when considering the purchase.\n\nTo complain about the fact that we are complaining is ridiculous.\n\n....\n\nLet me know if I\u0027ve misunderstood."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T03:45:39Z","Content":"I\u0027ve intentionally tried to tone down the snark recently.

I\u0027ve played it more than I think I\u0027ve played any other game in my life..this is probably because I have wanted to build spaceships since I was a little kid. KSP lets me build them...it doesn\u0027t let my fly them they way they should fly but due to (probably a mental illness of some kind) my personality that is *almost* enough to make me happy....or at least it was...maybe I am so angry over 1.0 because I feel myself burning out on building ships and wanted something...anything...to keep this game relevant as a game and not just a building set. \n\nThankfully, there are not as many pacifists in this forum as I feared so something good probably will come our way as long as the flame keeps burning.
