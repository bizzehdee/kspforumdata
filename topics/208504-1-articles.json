Does it just quietly close to the desktop, or do you get a small Unity error window for a few seconds?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you install all the GU dependencies, picking versions of those mods that are compatible with GU and your KSP version? (I haven\u0027t used GU but I many planet packs need Scatterer v0.77xx not v0.8xx).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease share your log files. That will reveal a lot of information including what mods you use, KSP version, operating system, and mod error messages.

I\u0027m using only GU and its dependencies, I\u0027ve joined the GU discord and asked the owner for help and he doesn\u0027t seem to know what to do.
