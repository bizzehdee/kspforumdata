Secondly, even if it WERE possible to create a copy of yourself accurate down to quantum scales, the chaotic nature of the brain would mean that even two exact quantum copies of a brain, subject to the exact same stimulus, would slowly diverge, as quantum indeterminacy is fundamental to the universe, and thus the particles that make up the brain would make different choices as to what states to be in, subtly and slowly changing the behavior of the two brains.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T18:11:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022 data-cite=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuantum indeterminacy has an effect on our behavior\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes it?

Our decisions are based on very sensitive electrical potentials set up by chemical reactions. These are quantum phenomenon, if you look closely enough, there is noise in them due to quantum mechanics. Quantum indeterminacy creates noise in ANY system. Our brains are affected by this noise just like everything else, and since our \u0022logic circuits\u0022 are rather small, and they are analog, they would be affected rather strongly as compared to more macroscopic systems. One doesn\u0027t need direct evidence specific to human brains, just as one doesn\u0027t need to fly to Alpha Centauri Bb and drop something to say that gravity makes things fall down on an Alpha Centauri Bb.
