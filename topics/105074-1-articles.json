This was clever. On his KSP 1.0 livestream today, Scott Manley made a rocket-powered air surfboard (airboard?) which he lifted aloft inside the cargo bay of a jet.\n\nHe also discovered an interesting bug with Squad\u0027s new aerodynamics model. By design, when parts are inside closed cargo bays, they are occluded from having aerodynamic forces act on them. Open the cargo bays, and they become part of the aerodynamic physics. Makes sense, right?\n\nExcept on one trial, Scott closed the cargo bay doors on the carrier aircraft, and the surfboard immediately fell out of the sky. Apparently the occlusion flag never gets unset when parts **leave** a cargo bay. I wonder if that works in reverse too -- if you put parts not previously inside a cargo bay inside, and close the doors, will the resulting system continue to act as if all its parts are subject to aerodynamics?\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

When you peel that onion, you typically find minimal linkage to requirements and use case based test scripts and scenarios.

Despite a really good test coverage. It was a corner case, and not generating any breakage (unlike the bug we\u0027re talking about here).\n\nEdit:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Still better than 20.000 useless \u0022bug reports\u0022.\n\nWhile i agree with what max said about people doing bad bug reports... look at how this bug was reported! It wasn\u0027t even reproduced, he just said that closing the doors seemed to have made the surfbord loose all aero properties. In a live stream. Yet that was enough to get the bug fixed. So this is a counter example.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T22:15:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 10:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain H@dock**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T22:14:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Still better than 20.000 useless \u0022bug reports\u0022.\n\nBut not better than that one bug report that contained the issue."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T22:51:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Then they should simply take their time, *or* release the current version as 0.99, then in a week, release 1.0.\n\nHere I agree they should release the current version as 0.97, fix the bugs who showed up and then release 1.0, this would cause new bugs to show up. \n\nHere is an bug for you: Back in 1997 probably scanners used scsi to communicate with the pc. \n\nI added scsi card into an isa slot, added scsi and scanner software and scanned, put the hood on the pc and delivered to customer. At that time almost all pc had an inverse U shaped cover and not two side covers as is common today on towers. \n\nCustomer come back next day, scanner did not work, tested and found no scsi card, off with hood, I moved the card to another isa slot, booted and it found the scsi card.\n\nOn with hood, then I thought I wanted to check the scanner too, started pc no scsi card. \n\nOff with hood and scsi worked, I found that then I added the last of the 6 screws at bottom front the scsi card failed: no it did not short anything, neither did it add any tension on the case, I could screw it in with my fingers.\n\nI skipped the case with 5 screws, customer was happy, this worked for multiple years as in customer never came back. \n\nHowever never found out that caused it.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But not better than that one bug report that contained the issue.\n\nAn useless bug report is typically: game does not work, this is ..... \n\nAn bug report stating that all aerodynamic is disabled on an object who was launched inside an cargo bay then the bay is closed is very useful. \n\nAnd yes this is useful for special uses mostly weapons. \n\nIts probably pretty easy to fix but not something who will be fixed before 1.0"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T23:13:42Z","Content":"Maxmaps just posted this in the AMA on Reddit:\n\n***\u0022There already was!
