Tylo\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...You could do that, but it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E not a great idea from an efficiency standpoint-- you\u0027ll find that engineering it is really hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy?\u00A0 Because Tylo has \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esuch\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a deep gravity well; orbital velocity is comparable to Kerbin.\u00A0 Look at it from the tanker\u0027s point of view.\u00A0 It\u0027s landed at the fueling station on Tylo.\u00A0 It fills up its tanks.\u00A0 Now it has to spend \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eover 2000 m/s\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E just to get to low Tylo orbit... and even then, it can\u0027t give all its fuel to the thirsty ships in Tylo orbit, because it has to save \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eanother 2000\u002B ms of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E so that it can land on Tylo again for the next refueling cycle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you\u0027re looking at close to 5 km/sec of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E flushed down the toilet every time your tanker wants to land or take off... so the only fuel it can \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eeffectively\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E transfer has to come \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eafter\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that.\u00A0 And, since you want this to be a reusable craft (right?), it has to be \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E-- it can\u0027t use drop tanks or stage away things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to pull off a mining base on Tylo, you\u0027ll need a craft that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esingle-stage\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and also which

the really high-Isp engines are hard to use because of low thrust)... and this craft needs to have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eover 5 km/sec\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and the fuel it can transfer on each engineering cycle will be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eafter subtracting\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that 5 km/sec of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDesigning a craft that can do that is a challenging engineering hurdle.\u00A0 You\u0027re really making life difficult for yourself if you do that.\u00A0 Just making an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E that can land and take off from Tylo, at \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eall\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, is hard.\u00A0 Even if you pull it off, you\u0027re likely going to have a craft that requires huge, time-consuming amounts of refueling on the Tylo surface, just so that it can deliver a few teaspoons of fuel to Tylo orbit each time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven Vall is somewhat challenging (its escape velocity is the third-highest of any vacuum world in the game, after Tylo and Moho), but doable-- you just have to resign yourself to wasting lots of fuel on every landing/takeoff cycle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, if you\u0027re considering a refueling base in the Jool system, here are your options:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPol or Bop.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Nice low gravity and escape velocity, very efficient for refueling operations.\u00A0 But they\u0027re located rather inconveniently, so you\u0027d need to be patient (e.g. allow long transfer times, waiting for launch windows, etc.) for exploring the other moons.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVall.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Very conveniently located.\u00A0 However, has an escape velocity that\u0027s somewhat inconveniently high, for a vacuum world.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELaythe.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 You can use airbreathing engines for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E goodness, and it requires basically zero \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to land since you can aerobrake.\u00A0 On the other hand, there\u0027s a limited choice of land area for placing a refueling base, and even with airbreathing engines, Laythe needs a fair amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get to orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETylo.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Horribly high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirements to land and take off.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Tylo would be about the worst possible choice you could make for a refueling base.\u00A0 Any of the others would be a reasonable

Strange though, considering how I\u0027ve seen blank spots on my Duna transfers from Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, everything has gone to plan. I set up the base, landed the tanker, the refuel rover, and my lander. I EVA\u0027d the Kerbal into the lander command pod. I took it to orbit. I tried to EVA the Kerbal again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHatch obstructed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGod dangit. I find if I spin the ship fast enough at 4x physics warp the parts glitch and separate enough to let the Kerbal EVA out, but that is a massive pain in the backside. I can\u0027t do that while landed. It\u0027s even more stupid because there is plenty of space for the Kerbal to get in, but once inside they are trapped forever without glitches or docking claws.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022z4cPHuN.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z4cPHuN.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcuse my horrible-looking lander design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way I can force the Kerbal out, cheating or not? I will eventually get a replacement lander in here, but until then... well... there is clearly enough space there. I had a quick dive through the Cheats menu, and all of F12, but couldn\u0027t find anything. Thanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd also, my goal for this is pretty much to get as much infrastructure around every place as possible. That way all I would need is the Delta-V to get to each new place, rendezvous with a fuel depot and continue. As well as checking out loads of anomalies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-09T08:15:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2017 08:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by digger1213\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-09T14:27:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223050225\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160351\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221494317626\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176898\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022digger1213\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, digger1213 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHatch obstructed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s even more stupid because there is plenty of space for the Kerbal to get in, but once inside they are trapped forever without glitches or docking claws.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a design where they can get in but not out, that sounds like a bug to me.\u00A0 Have you \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ereported it\u003C/a\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
