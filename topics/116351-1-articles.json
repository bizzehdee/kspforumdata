However, I\u0027ve not seen any evidence in the pictures that actually indicates that there\u0027s some sort of problem from this. By that I mean that yes, the lines are not of equal size. However, I don\u0027t see evidence in those pictures that the airplane is having to do anything to compensate for it.\n\nSo, not to be dismissive, I went ahead and gave it a try, replicating the basic layout of so many of these planes with one exception. I used a single engine instead of multiple. That eliminates any potential for asymmetric thrust.\n\nHere are two pictures which do indeed show asymmetric body lift lines from the mirrored FL-T800s. However, if you look at the trim state, the airplane is not compensating for this in any way. I\u0027ve also turned off SAS and flown it around and it does not exhibit any rolling/yawing tendency when straight and level or turning.\n\nAdditionally, I flew it up to max speed (~1300m/s below 20km) with zero yaw or roll reactions. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/mEc3k)\n\nSo to further my analysis, I also flew the plane without extraneous parts on the FL-T800 and took a couple pictures. Look below, and my thoughts are still that this is related to a vector display problem, rather than an actual force application problem. It might not be obvious while playing the game, but there are two sets of code. One that calculates and applies the forces, and another set of code that calculates and draws the lift lines. Because of this, it\u0027s not guaranteed that the lift lines are a direct representation of the actual forces applied.\n\nNote that at higher AoA, the body lift lines are equal. It\u0027s not obvious from the pictures, but there is no lift line on the left tank until the craft reaches a high enough AoA. Then the lift line suddenly pops into place.\n\nAlso note (in the second picture) that there are more body lift lines appearing on the right than on the left. Then look at the trim indicators in all of the pictures. In no case is there any reaction in yaw or roll, nor was there any \u0022strangeness\u0022 in flight.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I am not sure this is an asymmetric thrust issue.\n\nSure, and that\u0027s a good video to start with. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s definitive proof that the aero overlay is showing the source of the \u0022pulling to the side.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Most people who notice ill effects generally have built much larger craft than has been used to demonstrate the problem.\n\nWell, that\u0027s some of my point. There are a lot of things that can explain the \u0022pulling to the side\u0022 behavior (not just asymmetric thrust, which I didn\u0027t mean to implicate as *the* culprit). Large craft have their own brand of problems: bending, drag, not enough tail surface, etc.\n\nI just think too much hat is being hung on the aero overlay. I\u0027m not saying that it isn\u0027t indicating a problem. But just because the one line looks incorrect doesn\u0027t point to that as the source of the problem. It might be showing the problem, but there needs to be a lot more elimination of other things first.\n\nHere\u0027s the other thing. If the lift there was actually asymmetric, then I would expect roll induced yaw (or some sort of control coupling), which is not what is happening in the video. But, in order to test that idea, this is what I would do (if I had the craft).\n\nI would go back to the SPH and attach a single lifting surface on the right side of the plane, on top of that FL-T800. If I was really bug hunting, I would start splitting hairs on making sure the control surface lift corresponded to the body lift. ...Also, I would remove those structural intakes, so that I\u0027m not confounding the lift lines between the FL-T800s and anything else (as I did in my own pictures).\n\nThen go fly and see how the plane really reacts. If it wants to roll, then I know that the reaction is different than what is happening in the video, which looks to be all yaw.\n\nIt\u0027s not that I disbelive you guys. It\u0027s that I disbelive the data until proven otherwise. It\u0027s about removing possibilities until you discover what the actual cause is.\n\nMy smaller craft can be seen here, reacting to the addition of a lifting surface.\n\n![uyYBWlS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uyYBWlS.jpg)\n\nThere is definite roll with this plane, and some yaw response as a result. You can see some SAS input in roll in this picture as the plane pitches up. If I remove that control surface, I can do a full loop with no issues, and I can pitch up and down with no cross coupling.\n\n---\n\nSo perhaps post some craft files, so that others can fiddle with them. Post the things that you have removed as potential causes. Such as reducing that drag in front of the plane, and anything else you can think of. Show me that it\u0027s the body lift causing the problem, instead of assuming that the overlay is perfect.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T04:10:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 04:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T04:17:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Most people who notice ill effects generally have built much larger craft than has been used to demonstrate the problem.\n\u003E From my point of view, I find the behaviour of the overlay odd and I do not feel it is a problem with the overlay directly as when FAR is installed all forces appear to be shown as one would expect.\n\nsame this evening with some liquid fuel tank on a MK2 part , *i solved this fixing the parts along main Mk2 axis then offset/rotate instead of final position attach* (\u003C= reproduce steps).

(This might point to the problem given FAR displays correctly while the stock aero does not)\n\nI do not know how FAR is set up (code wise), but I do know how the stock code does it. In stock code, there are two separate sets of calculations going on. Even if one were to assume that the code calculating the lift is perfectly identical, there\u0027s still the problem that the Unity physics engine (that applies the force) is using different code than the stuff that spits out the overlay. It\u0027s not the same code, so my personal opinion is that I cannot assume it\u0027s telling me the truth all the time, until proven that it\u0027s telling me truth in this instance.\n\nIf I knew that FAR used the same display code and physics code, then this *could* be an indicator that the display is telling the truth.\n\n\u003E That said, I am more confused than ever now Wink has posted a craft showing MK1 jet fuel tanks displaying this anomaly. Until now, I\u0027d kinda figured it was something related to the parts and how the aero models or overlay were analysing them. Though this does swing me back to my initial though that it is something to do with how the editor creates the craft.\n\nThe body lift system uses the drag cubes. Drag cubes are based on part shape, but individual parts should not be getting treated differently. I would suspect that you could somehow start lining up parts on both sides of the plane and see this behavior. It might be related to how the parts are connected, or how they are symmetric, or a multitude of other things that might be throwing off the rotational and translational calculations. This is what the process of \u0022narrowing down a bug\u0022 entails.\n\nAnd on that note, I would also like to say that I\u0027m still confused about what the actual problem is here. Up until now, it sounds to me like it\u0027s a \u0022the display overlay is incorrect\u0022 problem. In which case I would say that it\u0027s unlikely that this bug would be fixed.\n\nIf, however, someone is trying to assert that the cyan overlay is the smoking gun for large plane instability, I am still unconvinced. It\u0027s a possible indicator, but (in my mind) that is far from proven.\n\nThis is why I keep pushing for people to do more analysis, more digging, post craft files, share thoughts and ideas (as you are) and prove or disprove each other. I have to do this whole process when I\u0027m digging at the bugs for my fixes, often by myself. Sometimes the bug is in a very bizarre place, that I wouldn\u0027t have expected when I started.

All lift lines appear in cyan and to my surprise, fuel tanks did not display any body lift at all, at least with the craft and speeds I was testing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T22:05:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 10:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Manwith Noname**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T06:29:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E the strange thing is that with craft (02 ?) 03 and 04 not all the light blue vector move the same while rolling (intake stay parrallel with the body but fuel tank vector rotate)\n\u003E for the vectoring inclinaison my own bet as said is that it\u0027s mostly related to the linkage from one part to another\n\u003E \n\u003E binded unity part main axis // surface attach relative axis. \u003C= this tend to cause weird vector move while pitch\u0027 date=\u0027 yaw, \u0026 roll (so probably might as well be related with relative absolute system calculation and use at some point in the source)[/quote\u0027]\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d say that this is a possibility, given the history that the overlay was simply a quick debug tool to start.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E I now believe FAR does indeed manipulate the overlay in some way.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Okay.

I can 100% assure you this bug DOES have something to do with how the aircraft flies, as with anything in this situation the bug and its effects are greatly increased/magnified when you start to build larger aircraft. - Such as large complex aircraft using HUGE rocket lifting bodies extended quite far onto the wings such as skylon to increase the leverage effect.\n\nFor instance, the large aircraft I mentioned in the main post will always have the right wing for no reason rip off first under load, or that at high speed/high altitude it pulls VERY harshly to the right and up. An odd pull effect that is VERY noticeable. - When I did tests with just 1 giant rocket engine and no fuel pylons the aircraft had no such issues. See the steam discussion I linked in the OP for some more in depth detail if you\u0027re interested. On the surface with a smaller aircraft I can see why you don\u0027t feel it having a real pull but I can assure you it definitely screws over larger/more complex aircraft. Such issues do not exist in FAR, or when the problem parts are removed from the aircraft (The rocket fuel tanks)\n\nIn particular my aircraft uses 2 MASSIVE rocket tanks and has quite a lot of lifting surfaces, when it pulls at high altitude its often impossible to steer out of. Its unlikely that you\u0027ll notice this effect when using such small tanks/lifting bodies on rigid aircraft.

Its unlikely that you\u0027ll notice this effect when using such small tanks/lifting bodies on rigid aircraft.

I\u0027m trying to convince everyone to not immediately bite off on the display, assuming it is 100% accurate.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hi Claw, below a video of my craft and [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fnqhztn055talf5/33%20T.craft?dl=0) the craft file itself (full stock).\n\nOkay, you are indeed correct. Your plane does not appear to suffer from asymmetric rollback or flameout (at least in the profile I climbed). I was going to write up a huge assessment of my flight with your plane, but it\u0027s getting late and there\u0027s a lot more that I want to write up. From the first post I assumed your craft would exhibit some lateral directional instability (in yaw) because you have a relatively small tail for such large intakes out front (the quad couplers). This is going to cause some \u0022hunting\u0022 around. At high altitude, where you are likely at high speed, this hunting eventually turns into a yaw excursion and departure.\n\nSo, to test my instability theory (which may not be complete, I\u0027ll grant), I simply capped the side fuel tanks with a nosecone and moved the eight intakes onto the tail. Two fold change here: Removes drag from up front, and increases stability in back without adding more tail.\n\nThe result is that flying with the modifications made for a more directionally stable aeroplane. I did NOT fly this through the whole envelope, so I don\u0027t swear that this fixes all of the problems. Just trying to show that there\u0027s more than one thing at play here.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/efFV5)\n\nThere\u0027s actually a lot of stuff to point out in these pictures (a lot), but I simply don\u0027t have time. One of the interesting things is that more lines were disappearing than the one that we\u0027ve been posting about.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nNow, that being said, to show what I mean about two things...\n\n1) I don\u0027t believe the aero overlay is perfectly telling the truth\n\n2) Demonstrate what I mean by \u0022experiment and uncover the truth\u0022\n\nI spent a lot of time this evening flying the above plane around. Upside down, spins, stalls, high atmosphere, dives, increasing and decreasing body lift, all kinds of things. It\u0027s a fine plane, and hunts around a bit, but I\u0027ve already discussed that. My point in this post is going to be aimed at the overlay in hopes to show you how to dig at something and to also show that I don\u0027t believe you guys ought to be trusting the overlay as a smoking gun answer to your concerns.\n\nWhat follows is a shortened and condensed version of my testing, again because it\u0027s late and I\u0027m sleepy.\n\nSo, in order to attack the overlay I did I simply built a 4x symmetric rocket around a central core in the VAB.\n\nThen I flew it east, south, and west to see if the lines showed any difference (due to craft directional orientation). I didn\u0027t bother with North, since the other three directions matched. For completeness, I should have...\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/pEO8I)\n\nThen I tried rolling the craft into different orientations, and in those movements you can see that the line blinks into and out of existence. There\u0027s only two pics here showing the change.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/5t7lo)\n\nSo, roll orientation matters!\n\nThen I flipped the tanks around in the VAB, so that the bottom of the tank is at the top of the rocket.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/s5jhj)\n\nWell, that seemed to matter quite a bit. Everything basically flipped with the tank orientation.\n\nHmm, so what about FL-T400s?\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/PX73y)\n\nSo that\u0027s even more strange, but notably, the lines are only flipping around on the surface mounted parts...and not the stack mounted ones.\n\nSo, lets try the Mk1 fuselage, since someone said that doesn\u0027t suffer from the same problem.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/oskLL)\n\nSo it actually DOES suffer from the same problem, except that it\u0027s happening in a different place...under the belly, instead of the right wing...\n\nSo what\u0027s the same between the FL-T800 and FL-T400, but is different than the Mk1 Fuel tank?\n\nLets look at the part files, shall we? Turns out there\u0027s a lot of differences, but lets cut to the chase and look at the node\\_attach, which controls surface attachment.\n\nFL-T800\n\n    \tscale = 0.1\tnode_stack_top = 0.0, 15, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\tnode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -15.1, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0\tnode_attach = 5.01, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1\n\nFL-T400\n\n    \tscale = 0.1\tnode_stack_top = 0.0, 7.72552, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\tnode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -7.3, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0\tnode_attach = 5.01, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1\n\nMk1 Fuel Tank\n\n    \tscale = 0.0125\trescaleFactor = 1\tnode_stack_top = 0.0, 75.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\tnode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -75.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0\tnode_attach = 0.0, 0.0, -51.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1\n\nTurns out Mk1 fuel tank attaches via the Z coordinate and rotation, vice the X coordinate and rotation. X is the \u0022left/right\u0022 of the plane, and Y is the \u0022belly/top\u0022 of the plane.\n\nAlso, to add the the wackiness, turns out that the \u002B/- (sign) value is important too.\n\nSo what other part is similar to the Mk1 Fuel tank? Ah, the Mk1 structural fuselage.\n\n    \trescaleFactor = 1\tnode_stack_top = 0.0, 75.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\tnode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -75.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0\tnode_attach = 0.0, 0.0, -51.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1\n\nSo I also tried the Mk1 structural fuselage, and it was the same as the Mk1 fuel tank. I\u0027ll spare you the pictures of that one...\n\nLets take all that together then, and see if we can build a craft that shows zero body lift on the booster parts.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/cWyX4)\n\nAlmost, but not quite...\n\nAnyway, hopefully you can see that there\u0027s something else going on here, and it\u0027s not quite a smoking gun. Otherwise all of these wacky contraptions would probably be going out of control at some point. But if you roll one of them even slightly, all the lines show up. Not to mention that if I send the things out of control, the lines start pointing everywhere.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/8Ejfu)\n\u003E \n\nSo, all of this work and time spent, and really all I\u0027ve (hopefully) shown is that the overlay isn\u0027t necessarily trustworthy. I think the craft would have flow much differently from each other if the lines were accurately showing what\u0027s going on under the hood. So, this doesn\u0027t (in any way) discount that something else might be going on that\u0027s causing yaw problems. Especially since I can show you yaw drift with rovers, planes, rockets, and unpowered gyros. There\u0027s a bias built into KSP somewhere that causes things to bend in their flight path, not to mention all the other physics things going on.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
