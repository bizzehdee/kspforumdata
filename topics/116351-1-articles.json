Look below, and my thoughts are still that this is related to a vector display problem, rather than an actual force application problem. It might not be obvious while playing the game, but there are two sets of code. One that calculates and applies the forces, and another set of code that calculates and draws the lift lines. Because of this, it\u0027s not guaranteed that the lift lines are a direct representation of the actual forces applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that at higher AoA, the body lift lines are equal. It\u0027s not obvious from the pictures, but there is no lift line on the left tank until the craft reaches a high enough AoA. Then the lift line suddenly pops into place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note (in the second picture) that there are more body lift lines appearing on the right than on the left. Then look at the trim indicators in all of the pictures.

There are a lot of things that can explain the \u0022pulling to the side\u0022 behavior (not just asymmetric thrust, which I didn\u0027t mean to implicate as \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E culprit). Large craft have their own brand of problems: bending, drag, not enough tail surface, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just think too much hat is being hung on the aero overlay. I\u0027m not saying that it isn\u0027t indicating a problem. But just because the one line looks incorrect doesn\u0027t point to that as the source of the problem. It might be showing the problem, but there needs to be a lot more elimination of other things first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the other thing. If the lift there was actually asymmetric, then I would expect roll induced yaw (or some sort of control coupling), which is not what is happening in the video. But, in order to test that idea, this is what I would do (if I had the craft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would go back to the SPH and attach a single lifting surface on the right side of the plane, on top of that FL-T800. If I was really bug hunting, I would start splitting hairs on making sure the control surface lift corresponded to the body lift. ...Also, I would remove those structural intakes, so that I\u0027m not confounding the lift lines between the FL-T800s and anything else (as I did in my own pictures).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen go fly and see how the plane really reacts.

Your plane does not appear to suffer from asymmetric rollback or flameout (at least in the profile I climbed). I was going to write up a huge assessment of my flight with your plane, but it\u0027s getting late and there\u0027s a lot more that I want to write up. From the first post I assumed your craft would exhibit some lateral directional instability (in yaw) because you have a relatively small tail for such large intakes out front (the quad couplers). This is going to cause some \u0022hunting\u0022 around. At high altitude, where you are likely at high speed, this hunting eventually turns into a yaw excursion and departure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to test my instability theory (which may not be complete, I\u0027ll grant), I simply capped the side fuel tanks with a nosecone and moved the eight intakes onto the tail. Two fold change here: Removes drag from up front, and increases stability in back without adding more tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result is that flying with the modifications made for a more directionally stable aeroplane. I did NOT fly this through the whole envelope, so I don\u0027t swear that this fixes all of the problems.
