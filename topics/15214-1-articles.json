It would be a net loss to go out into space and then bring stuff back anyway in almost all cases. Mining for volatiles in order to make rocket fuel, however, is a very valuable ability to have if you wish to undertake large missions. Instead of lugging a huge, fuel filled ship up at once, or even a bunch of tiny bits of fuel up at once, you can bring up one empty ship, then fill it with mined fuel from a designated mining craft, which would also take some fuel for itself in order to get back to another asteroid and start the process again.
