But as it is - people are asked to pay the price of a AAA title for an EA game - and EA always also means risks for the buyer regarding if and in what state a game gets finished - thats the whole point of EA and why its usually way cheaper than a full release purchase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this game has huge issues in regards to the future (the bad start, the way too expensive price, the fact that its alweady fallen behind the player numbers of KSP1, the hardware requirements) - and a lot of those could have been avoided and its beyond me why they werent avoided - and i also dont understand why reading this form it seems as if 99% of all posters here compared to all other sites are trying to hide critique in overly positive statements. I dont think it will help anybody if people arent sincere and try to be nice. This launch was bad - and its important to realize that and do something about it to save this game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFrom my point of view this game now is at a turning point \u003C/strong\u003E- looking at the steam numbers its already falling behind KSP1 in player numbers - just days after EA-release which usually is the time when it has the most players - the mixture of a lack of players, the high price and the bugs - and the hardware requirements probably also hinder future modding which is very important for a game like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EI would really like to know what the plan is - as it is now if the price stays at 50 Dollars i dont see any future for this game - especially combined with all the negativity, the bad press etc.\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhats even more absurd to me is the statement in the FAQ that this isnt even the final price - seriously - is tehre really anyone thinking that this game can be sold beyond the price of a AAA game and be a success? And im not even talking about all the other issues this game has - for example - in my opinion- the awful EULA in regards to privacy and also especially in regards to modding - in a game that requires modding to become a success ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd as i stated - i have no idea why they did this - selling a game in a state like this as EA at a price of 50 Dollars was a guaranteed flop with negativity - obviously people will look at things differently and be way more lenient depending on the price.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really want to see this game succeed but as it is now and even though im a huge fan of KSP and bought all content of KSP1 i cant see myself buying this at this price. And to be honest seeing the price they are selling this EA to their fans i also have lost a lot of trust in this company that built a lot of good will and reputation over the years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest - i think if they would just haver sold it at a reasonable price like 30-35 Dollars we would have tons of positive feedback, lots of sales and no bad press now ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chilkoot","CreatedById":175911,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T14:31:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224248613\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214055\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677675794\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227067\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moons\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Moons said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest - i think if they would just haver sold it at a reasonable price like 30-35 Dollars we would have tons of positive feedback, lots of sales and no bad press now ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValve has some pretty strict restrictions on price changes.\u00A0 I\u0027m not sure if or how often the publisher can change the price of an EA release on Steam, which will be the lion\u0027s share of sales.\u00A0 It does make sense that the price would start lower for bare-bones EA and then ramp up as features are added, but that may be disallowed by the TOS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeekzeek22","CreatedById":223169,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T16:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are *so many disclaimers*.

If there is no resistance because people believe this is a situation of mutual understanding and interrest than everything will just get worse for consumers until they will react.

Which preorders also do. Like yeah, using players as free QA is greedy when your company is big, but, none of us have to do it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think Intercept did communicate a lot of the situation: they said they had a feature-completish somewhat-playable build internally, but that they would be disassembling it to use EA to bug-hunt in sections. They didn\u0027t communicate HOW bugful it would be, but they were clear about what was up. I think we all assumed that if they were playing internally, it would have QOL features like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E managers and non-finicky maneuvers, and that the kraken wouldn\u0027t be everywhere. I certainly assumed that and was surprised.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly...isn\u0027t Private Division a mid-sized publisher that exclusively publishes games made by small-to-mid-sized indie developers? Intercept isn\u0027t indie, obv. It\u0027s in-house. but it\u0027s still a small business and a small team. KSP2 is not from a AAA developer, it\u0027s not being published by Take Two directly. The corporate relationships are there but I\u0027ve definitely learned within my own industry that subsidiaries of huge megacorps can still be as simple as mom-and-pop shops. For example, some of my favorite local small-batch craft breweries were bought by Anheuser Busch...but their product is still what they were before. Being owned by a publisher that is owned by Take Two doesn\u0027t make Intercept a AAA development studio. So all the AAA talk is misplaced. Re: \u0022AAA pricing\u0022...I personally think indie games can be priced whatever they want and whatever makes sense for their budget, but that\u0027s a to-each-their-own opinion, not a declaration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T17:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224249139\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214055\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677704187\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227067\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moons\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Moons said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the little things i know about the legal system of most countries - especially when it comes to consumers - terms that give one party the right to change an agreement afterwards however they want simply dont work.

The problem is most of these things never go to court since each individual case isnt worth it and chances are that even if you have a legal insurance they will simply pay you the damage instead of paying for a lawsuit - which makes sense - if the damage is for example below 50 Dollars and a single hour of an attorney costs 200\u002B its probably not a hard decision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest - i never understood how this industry managed to strip consumers of pretty much most rights consumers normally have.
