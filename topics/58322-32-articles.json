They tend to corkscrew when they don\u0027t have enough time to accelerate before they track. If you watch the air-air video I made you\u0027ll see the last missile hit there was no corkscrewing as it had a little more lead time. Try it out again and let me know how it goes. The Zephyr is easily good out to 5km, while tracking behind a moving target that range of course is reduced. I never really intended any of these to be air-air missiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Switching vessels while a rocket/missile is in flight isn\u0027t supported, they have no memory, they track whatever the active vessels target is. This may change, a new missile might have this capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I can\u0027t really do that as they are all weighted accordingly. The Zephyr is 0.085 mass, which equates to 80kg or 176lbs. I think it might actually be a little light for the damage it does. Any load reduction will cause this, but not just the load, the reduction in drag also has an effect. My advice is try to mount the rocket hardpoint as close to the center of mass as possible in the lengthwise axis. This means the center of mass for the vessel will not change as much once dropped - therefore not affect pitch change in the firing aircraft. Another tip is, try making your aircraft a bit heavier. Before fuel and before any other dispensable mass is added balance the aircraft empty. Then add dispensable mass and try to distribute evenly. Dropped mass has less effect on an aircraft if the aircraft itself has more mass to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-06T00:59:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2014 12:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by InfiniteDice\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira","CreatedById":10884,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T02:11:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow can I get these to work with your Boat Parts mod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostbenjamin","CreatedById":107239,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T02:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gojira\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gojira\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow can I get these to work with your Boat Parts mod?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou cant hes still working on the compatability issues so you have to wait till R5 of his boat parts mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostbenjamin","CreatedById":107239,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T02:29:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey ID ive encountered a similar problem to another person a few posts ago where I am no longer able to turn any turrets.
