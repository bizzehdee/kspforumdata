The newer (more recently unlocked in the tech tree) antennas use more power and the transmission interval is shorter which I think is good (?) but there\u0027s also something called total throughput. That decreases with every tier of antenna. Isn\u0027t more throughput positive or is having a smaller number for throughput better? And what does this even do? I thought it meant that an antenna with higher throughput would be able to send more complete data packets so that you get the most possible science points but no matter what antenna I put on my ship, it always gives the same percentages in that little popup window you get after doing science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould someone explain all this to me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"running","CreatedById":82033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T11:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETransmission times decrease and electricity usage increases with the \u0022better\u0022 antenna\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you have the battery power, you are doing a rapid decend in an atmosphere and you are doing science, a \u0022Faster\u0022 antenna could be worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime acceleration doesn\u0027t speed up transmission times, if you are doing a lot of science you also like to have a \u0022faster\u0022 antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T12:02:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022running\u0022 data-cite=\u0022running\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E..., if you are doing a lot of science you also like to have a \u0022faster\u0022 antenna.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say - not \u0022doing a lot of science\u0022 but have a huge amount of electric power.
