I did the thing to update hilo.dat using the Dev build, then switched to the \u0022unofficial\u0022 update (older) version.

I got this game wanting to build and launch rockets not actually fly them.

I\u0027d like to try Hooligan\u0027s Airships, Chatterer, Romfarer\u0027s mods, and Firespitter\u0027s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think that Telemachus and KLF would add some nice fun and interactivity to the game (especially KLF, making it less lonely.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith my system, I\u0027m more concerned about plugins using up memory, I have a feeling that simple parts are less of an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering I have 4GB max, no discrete video (that\u0027s right!
