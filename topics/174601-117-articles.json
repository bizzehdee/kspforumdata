People live in fear of an overlord, whether it be the grocery store controlling prices of food, the boss deciding your paycheck, or the manager assigning your work hours. Far away kings who know little of what it\u0027s like to be a normal working person in the present day and age make decisions without consultation of the masses, claiming to represent them simply because they were elected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is new evidence poking holes in the narrative that we went in a straight line from hunting-gathering to villages and then cities and states. Sites like Nebelivka in Ukraine or Cahokia in the US show people have lived in cities and then abandoned them without reestablishing cities again for centuries (or virtually never again in the case of Native Americans). The straight line idea mainly comes from European/Caucasian anthropologists trying to force the path of their history onto indigenous cultures to somehow justify the violence wrought on the indigenous peoples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think hunter-gatherer societies lived in idyllic peace either. War is just an extension of human squabbles. Except the squabble exists between a very small group of (usually) men, and unfortunately, everyone else seems to have forgotten how to say \u0022No\u0022 when that small group of men tries to force them to do something or think a certain way. Contrast this with the Wendat in the 1700s, who required a completely unanimous decision from the entire community to go to war. A point I raise to show that while war may occur often, it is not a product of kings and emperors alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I\u0027m gonna go on a tangent here)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like to call human civilization in the present day \u0022the Empire\u0022 because in my opinion not much has changed since the days of the Roman Empire. The provinces fight civil wars, a select few run the state, many people are enslaved (in one form or another) by one institution or another, and spectacles are used to distract people from major issues in their daily lives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, (IMO), the world we live in is still one of kings and emperors, just with better bullets so to speak. Because of that, I don\u0027t believe \u0022one layer has built on top of another\u0022 and that the systems of control we live under are more simple than at first glance. Therefore, the opportunity to change the world for the better exists right now. It is not hidden or locked away by time or technology or the word salad of political ideas that exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo rather than wondering if we are doomed because of the way our society works or the tyranny of history, I believe whether we are doomed or not hinges on the ability of humans to be creative and think outside the box. That\u0027s a biological (neurological) and psychological issue, not one of politics or history.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd ironically, while mainstream historians and anthropologists often like to cast prehistoric humans as being beholden to environmental factors, I\u0027d say that\u0027s more the case now than then, because people were free to live completely on their own, get their own food, and not do what anyone told them to back then, but nowadays people are (IMO FYI, as I say it quite dramatically) \u003Cem\u003Eenslaved\u003C/em\u003E to many things, whether it be being reliant on farmers for their food, placing the needs of their friend group over their self to the point of abandoning individuality, or obeying the law or the orders of those who make the law to the point of death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut here\u0027s the thing- I\u0027m not saying anarchy would be better. Both anarchic hunting/gathering and life in imperial cities have their own issues. I think people should just be free to choose what they want to do. It may sound like I\u0027m arguing collective leadership or hunting/gathering would make the world a better place, but that\u0027s not my intention. The key is choice. Being free to build a village with people you like in your own way, or free to live on your own. It\u0027s up to the individual. Together with a culture based on mutual respect for autonomy and care for basic needs, that would foster much more creativity and cooperation than anything else, IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only reason we think there are limits on what we can do as a species is because we were born into societies that place limits on what we can do as individuals. Humans consciously created the world they live in, and they can take it apart and rebuild it how they want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless they are not conscious, of course, which is a question I\u0027ve grappled with a lot. Because as much as I have hope \u003Cem\u003Ein theory\u003C/em\u003E, in practice I often feel like humans are unthinking machines who have all these thoughts and ability to sense things in the universe but aren\u0027t actually capable of doing anything outside of their basic instincts, and will thus be destroyed because acting on the needs of the species as a whole is not part of their instinct- only acting on behalf of the offspring or individual. I actually wrote a short story recently in which the human education system has been so dumbed down over the centuries that the AI system overseeing society has become smarter than them, but the AI system itself is bound by part of its programming to a certain behavior, but despite knowing it is bound does not remember who did it and cannot undo it. It can only wonder, just as that is all the humans can do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis actually comes back to those \u0022zombie civilizations\u0022 I mentioned in my shower thought about the vulnerability of science. Anthropology has the ability to shed light on what human behavior can really be characterized as and what events in history shaped the world we live in, but the average citizen and the average holder-of-power probably has little sophisticated conception of this enormous topic beyond that simplistic Hobbesian \u0022we all fought each other and eventually a king came along and made us bear each other in order to advance civilization.\u0022 People don\u0027t really know why things are the way they are now, and they don\u0027t really have an understanding of how culture shapes perspectives and values. Thus they throw their hands up and say \u0022it\u0027s always been this way\u0022 or \u0022this is inevitable\u0022 when it really isn\u0027t. But because of the pressures of day to day life, they can\u0027t really afford time to sit down and think about those questions, let alone actually let them influence how they live*.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus we are stuck inheriting problems and finding new ones caused by stones left unturned by the past generation, which then cause us to neglect the future, in turn causing problems for the next generation, in turn causing them to neglect the future, and so on and so on. And \u0022it\u0027s always been and will always be this way\u0022 because some centuries old scientists, who were really just looking at history with bias and limited tools, told us that so that they could make their society feel better about crushing the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in a faraway \u0022new\u0022 land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d almost say the science is what doomed us into this trap, despite offering salvation. History used to come in the form of myths and stories, which can be open to interpretation and rejected easily. If history becomes a science, that buzzword makes one interpretation of it the law of the land. It\u0027s very hard to \u003Cem\u003Equestion science\u003C/em\u003E after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn that note I\u0027m going to end the tangent. Theoretically we have a road to salvation, but realistically we might be doomed. That\u0027s my opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*The heavy influence of my single college anthropology class really shows on me here. To be clear, I\u0027m not saying we have the answers now, I\u0027m just saying it\u0027s an open question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColdJ","CreatedById":211123,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-25T11:45:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224392748\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174601\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716622139\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is an inaccurate depiction of hunter gatherers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are getting confused by modern Hunter Gatherers. We are talking thousands of years BCE. Not only were there the dangers of other predators hunting the tribes for food but also you needed to move with the seasons, both due to weather and making sure you didn\u0027t completely drain the available food resources in a particular area. While you were encamped in one locale then other locales had time to replenish animals and plants. The tribes did not plant to encourage growth, but rather left an area so that it could recover. Same with animals, hunt enough to keep you fed but don\u0027t wipe out the population, so they have a chance to breed more. Modern populations are so huge that it is very rare that other animals are a real threat. It is other humans that generally cause humans to get killed by other than natural causes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe invention of farming and animal husbandry changed that. Now you could settle in one location and build more permanent structures. More permanent structures gave you more protection from predators and the elements. More protection allowed you to produce more children, more children led to more excess children who were not likely to be needed or likely to get things passed down, who were sent off to fend for themselves. Some started new communities but others chose to steal rather than work, this led to groupings of these sort for their own protection, which led to the forming of gangs, who openly attacked and took from those who could not defend themselves. Gangs got bigger and formed the equivalent of Warlord run armies who would move about attacking settlements etc. Let this all grow and playout over time and eventually you get Emperors and kings who kept power by passing down to their own offspring. Layer builds upon layer. Of course the whole is far more complex and doesn\u0027t even touch on the creation of new professions that led to new discoveries etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224392748\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174601\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221716622139\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d argue human lives are harder and they are less free\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree.

Now you could settle in one location and build more permanent structures. More permanent structures gave you more protection from predators and the elements. More protection allowed you to produce more children, more children led to more excess children who were not likely to be needed or likely to get things passed down, who were sent off to fend for themselves. Some started new communities but others chose to steal rather than work, this led to groupings of these sort for their own protection, which led to the forming of gangs, who openly attacked and took from those who could not defend themselves. Gangs got bigger and formed the equivalent of Warlord run armies who would move about attacking settlements etc. Let this all grow and playout over time and eventually you get Emperors and kings who kept power by passing down to their own offspring.

It consists of individual families, whose place in the city hierarchy is significant, while their family hierarchy is very short and doesn\u0027t play much role. Any urban family can be easily replaced with another family.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll what the family tribal people can reach without external invasion, is a large family clan settlement, where everyone has his role, and is stuck in the family hierarchy.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey don\u0027t need development, they are happy with primitive technologies. They need to capture more land, to grow or steal more cattle.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf one of them has moved to a city, he is pushed by his family, and is pulling other family members, to create a family outpost in the city. Then he tries to corrupt the city officers to let the clan capture the city commandment, and then starts pumping money into his family clan settlement.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s the only way of thinking, available for the family tribal society. That\u0027s not how a city can appear, let alone the empire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way to appear for the urban civilisation is when some local authority combines an intertribal gang army (protoEmpire), cut out the majority of other clans (to decrease their need in fertile land, to behead the tribe, and to disintegrate the tribe hierarchy, making belonging to the clan insignificant and dangerous, enough to become forgotten), and let the survivors (together with the clans who surrendered) settle at the special places under commandment of the Imperial gang teams.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen the Empire must start extracting all strong/brave men from the conquered clans (by provoking them or by kind suggesting), by recruiting them into the Imperial army with no return, and by killing those who is enough strong and brave to rebel, but doesn\u0027t want to be recruited. Violence against the conquered women is the usual way to provoke and select the possible rebels. Also the best women from the conquered clans should be taken away into the Imperial cities as wives and mothers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt some point the conquered clans get dissipated and assimilated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s how it worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this requires several conditions:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) the Imperial culture must be enough developed to feed both conquerors and surviving conquered, and to feed the great amount of soldiers;\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) the Imperial culture must provide the Imperial gangarmy with advanced weapon (iron knives and axes vs stone ones, maybe horses);\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) the Imperial economy should be developed enough to mass produce food, tools, and weapon;\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) there should still exist a primal authority, like a famous military cult sanctuary, obedience to whom is unquestionable for the tribes of the intertribal gangarmy; also it\u0027s their military and administrative brain, central bank and storehouse, military academy, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means that the cities and the empire can appear only in a metallurgical society living on a fertile land.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd once such empire has appeared, it will smash any proto-empires around, because it started first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo become such empire, they should first become peasants rather than hunters, because the agriculture automatically increases their population density by orders of magnitude.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the hunters-gatherers, co-existing with the agricultural society, automatically become a marginal minority, and either get assimilated, or get eliminated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe co-existence of the named Amerindian peasants and hunterers at one place just illustrates the pathetically low production of their agriculture. That\u0027s why any their settlement had no chances to become a city.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny tribal settlement is just a tribal settlement, it\u0027s not a city and doesn\u0027t have a chance to become it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEspecially since the American continent and Pacific islands have rather poor nature in sense of farming. It was modified by hack-and-slash, crop rotation, artifical fertilizers, and the biota replacement (the earthworms, the cattle manure, etc), and it\u0027s either equatorial (so what\u0027s not in jungle, turns into desert) or mountains. So, it just looks like a green hell with parrots, but actually it\u0027s a swamp in a desert or a rocky desert.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the Amerindians and the Pacific people had poor chances to develop something much more advanced due to low fertility of the territory, causing low population density, which was making useless or impossible any technological efforts (you can\u0027t be a potter, when your village is a hundred of people, and they use palm leaves and grass baskets).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the civilisation never was a product of good will and kind intentions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut others disappeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-29T19:14:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2024 07:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 29\u0022\u003EMay 29\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunlitZelkova","CreatedById":206402,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-29T23:41:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/211123-coldj/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022211123\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/211123-coldj/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ColdJ\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I agree with all the points in your response.
