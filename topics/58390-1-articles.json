How long have they survived for? Have you lost any vessels?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my only modular interplanetary ship; R.S.

Not having enough fuel to return into orbit around kerbin, I had to slam it straight into Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere from interplanetary space in order to save the crew. So, not that successful considering it was meant to be re-usable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut perhaps more interestingly, does anyone have any \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Epersistent\u003C/span\u003E shuttles and/or smaller ships? Something like NASA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s shuttle program is what I am getting at here. The way that the game deals with landed crafts sort of limits our ability to build re-usable orbiters that we could potentially become so attached to in a similar way to the five famous orbiters; Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone developed a way of getting round this particular mechanic?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s more, does anyone have any thoughts on perhaps introducing a system allowing for persistent orbiters. A system like this would allow a player to name a specific vessel, and when recovered the whole vessel would become an attachable object in the VAB/SPH, keeping any wear/damage it sustained in flight. This damage could then be repaired by swapping old parts for new ones. When economics are introduced, a player would not have to pay for re-used vessels in the VAB, only the fuel they use and any new parts. Would you benefit from having named ships that could be used time and time again?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour examples of crafts, stories about them and thoughts/opinions on persistent crafts as a game-play mechanic would be appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raikoutrio","CreatedById":78489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T16:56:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that saving vehicles in that sense would be really cool, and i expect something like that will show up once budget is fully implemented.
