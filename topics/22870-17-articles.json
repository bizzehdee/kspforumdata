Back in the day when the Internet was still in the early stages of going mainstream, all kinds of copyright issues were coming to light that we take for granted now. FASA, the game company found its material being used online for fan sites, MUDs and MOOs, etc. especially for Shadowrun. It was good for them, their gamers were happy but there was the issue of copyright. They were reluctant to grant permission en masse because of fear of unforeseen consequences. But they didnt want to issue Cease and Desist orders to their fans either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat they did officially was post a copyright notice for website owners to post that contained at the end \u0027\u003Cem\u003Eused without permission\u003C/em\u003E\u0027. Their trademarks and copyrights were considered protected and they generally agreed not to go after people as long as they used that notice while at the same time withholding explicit permission and everyone was happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enot that that is intended to have any bearing on the subject at hand nor to suggest a course of action (you should still talk to a moderator) I just wanted to share a story from the past.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-01T18:19:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2014 06:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Autochton","CreatedById":70134,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T08:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why open source and unrestrictive licenses are a good thing.
