The inventor, Dr. Robert Zubrin, the one who came up with Project Orion in the first place, said that this concept depends upon a steady stream of constantly-fissioning propellant, and water to shield the reaction chamber/nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the why, read on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I have read, a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of the engineering and startup/shutdown processes in any rocket engine are attempts to mitigate/eliminate transient events.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTransient events, or transients for short, are the bane of any system in spacecraft, most often fluid-carrying systems. They happen when you turn something on and things are in the process of starting, or the opposite, when things are in the process of stopping. Sometimes it\u0027s when you have almost reached full power, but have to literally wait for the pumps to catch up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe find this on Earth with normal plumbing. Closing or opening a tap/valve suddenly will cause a bang as the speed of a mass of an incompressible liquid (water) is reduced to zero, and the energy is dissipated at shockwaves ringing through your pipes. This is hydraulic shock AKA \u0022water hammer\u0022.\u00A0 If the system isn\u0027t engineered to mitigate it, such shockwaves can cause pipes to crack from the strain and bubbles of vacuum or vapour to form.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s like a couple kilograms per minute in a good water system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a rocket engine pumping hundreds of kilograms of propellant \u003Cem\u003Eper second\u003C/em\u003E, suddenly closing a valve that\u0027s feeding the propellant from the tanks is Bad.

Certain mixture ratios or allotropes or frozen/semi-frozen mixtures of fuels explode. You must run the engine lop-sidedly by feeding in one part of the propellant to wash away any trace of the other, and\u00A0 in the case of cryogenic fuel/oxidiser, do not boil when entering the pumps, causing vapour bubbles that the pumps will ingest, overspeed and then tear themselves to shreds. (This is what \u0022engine chilldown\u0022 is prior to a Falcon 9 second stage engine igniting.)

Because water (which we are using to cool the chamber walls) is a good way to slow down highly energetic neutrons so that they can split fissile uranium i.e. it is a moderator. So if a restart doesn\u0027t feed multiple swimming pools of water into it beforehand, it\u0027s going to suddenly produce much more radiation and then blow up in a very dirty explosion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
