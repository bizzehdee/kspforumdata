Don\u0027t need log files as this is in every version of the game. When doing physics timewarp when doing low thrust with the terrier engine, the game breaks in many ways. No1 it stops you from stopping the thrust of the engine, even when you are at 1x game speed, saying you cannot stop thrusting during timewarp. No2, the rocket starts spinning wildly. No3, you gain about 10 fps (idk why).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
