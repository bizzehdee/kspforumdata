One that that has always irked me with KSP is the lack of Eve landers (most likely due to the difficulty of landing on the planet). Another thing that has always bothered me is when people have built vessels needed to be launched from 7-8,000km above sea level. Realistically, I don\u0027t see someone sending living beings (kerbals) to another planet with a ship that won\u0027t be able to return if it lands off of it\u0027s target (which is very plausible with 1.0 now).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have built a vessel to solve all of these problems and more. using a series of aerospike engines with mainsail engines for initial take off, I have created a ship capable of landing at sea level on Eve and returning safely to orbit. After it gets off the ground, decouplers eject all of the parachutes, spare batteries, landing gears, and more safely from the vessel. The ship must be flow straight up the entire flight until 45-60km a gravity turn could be cautiously done. I also never go at full thrust as the ship wants to burn up and also causes aerodynamic issues, especially when ejecting the mainsail engines. This ship has a lot of\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EYouTube Preview:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/FG9irV0ZJ74\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/FG9irV0ZJ74\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: okay dumb video got corrupted (I\u0027m actually REALLY furious it\u0027s screwed up!), but here is the first couple minutes of landing and launch (it\u0027s still uploading but should be done soon). It did in fact make it to orbit though successfully. I\u0027ll see if I can make another one later at lower quality so I can record the whole thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLink to craft file:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/evespnkrii\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.filedropper.com/evespnkrii\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry if these are supposed to be uploaded somewhere else - apparently the forum isn\u0027t\u00A0allowing me to upload files.

I also did one reentry test with heat shields attached to all the rocket engines\u00A0and it made it successfully, although I think I\u0027m going to have to move the battery packs into a\u00A0storage bay as they currently burn up in re-entry. I\u0027m also thinking of adding more parachutes. Right now it descends at 5.2k/ms and sometimes this causes the landing legs to sometimes go\u00A0through the surface (I party blame Squad for not fixing that issue yet). As long as there is some space between the surface/engines usually launch doesn\u0027t have any problems.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-23T07:41:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually most people launching from 7-8000m is pre 1.0, the dV requirement dropped from like 12kms dV to about 7kms dV with the new atmosphere, still it\u0027s always awesome to see new Eve vehicles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake an account on imgur, its the best integrated picture sharing site, KerbalX is really good for craft sharing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-23T07:42:35Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2016 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by selfish_meme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
