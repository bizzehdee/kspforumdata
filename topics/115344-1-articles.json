Produces a ship with 13k delta-V, which is reasonable for a sun-dive. Alternatively, you can get a ship with about 7-8k of delta-V and use a bi-elliptic transfer; leave Kerbin heading for an apoapsis out towards the orbit of Jool. A year later when you get there, burn retrograde until you\u0027re rewarded for the contract. Then get back into a stable orbit and figure out what kind of burn you need in order to get back to Kerbin - a mod like Protractor will help with this last bit.\n\nDoable? Yes. Worth it?

Is there a sensible way of delivering this?\n\nLike IRL tourist-businesses: Just deny them. Really, there is absolutely not a single really-bad-idea which would not be missed by at least one tourist a season (goes for every tourist destination in the world, and hencefore tourist wherever from). On earth, space-tourism is still in its earliest stages. As soon as humans are as highly evolved as kerbals when it comes to space travel, we will have human space-tourists asking for sundives. I take any bet on this.\n\nAsk whoever you know who is working in tourism industry. They will approve on this subject. KSP models the reality in a frightening realistic way. But they seem to use some simplified form instead of the correct and more precise n-body-stupidity calculations. It still looking for the signs that larger groups are more stupid than smaller ones in KSP. Probably the later would put to much strain on even high-end PCs."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T08:35:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E On earth, space-tourism is still in its earliest stages.

You\u0027d then need to make a course correction to not impact, and then arrange further gravity assists to get back to Kerbin at a reasonable speed for re-entry.\n\nThere\u0027s a trick to those gravity assists. You cannot use a gravity assist at apoapsis to lower your periapsis, or at periapsis to raise your apoapsis. So what you need to do is get into an orbit round the Sun with an apoapsis somewhat \\*beyond\\* Jool\u0027s orbit, and then you can make the gravity assist to lower your periapsis into a Sun impact.\n\nIt will be a time-consuming mission but one with not unreasonable delta-V requirements. 3 km/s from LKO should do it. As ever I strongly recommend Precise Node for gravity assist work.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T15:33:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cantab**"},{"CreatedByName":"Moh1336","CreatedById":146789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T15:48:22Z","Content":"I wouldn\u0027t avoid the suborbital sun ones, you\u0027ll get the reward simply for changing the trajectory to suborbital and back again instantly. You don\u0027t really have to fly suicidally into the sun to do it. \n\nThe only time I truly go suborbital for tourists is if one of them also wants to land somewhere. Other wise I just do a quick retrograde burn to change trajectory and then prograde to keep it in the orbit/leave orbit. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E The first thing it does is make all tourists on one contract share the same travel itinerary, as they should.\n\nI suppose it depends how your view them. I don\u0027t see travel itineraries as something to be done all at once, but things to do over time. So having differing itineraries makes sense, no one said you have to take all the tourists together, so why should they all be forced to go to the same place?"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T16:13:02Z","Content":"It depends on how you see the contract, I suppose.\n\nFor me, it represents a group of Kerbals who are interested in going somewhere together. That\u0027s why they\u0027re on the same contract in the first place - because they signed up together and have the same goal. Like a family who books tickets to fly to Disney World.\n\nOn the other hand, consider your neighbor on the left wants to visit Kenya, your neighbor on the right wants to visit Norway, and you want to tour the Polynesian islands. Even if you do happen to meet in the street and talk about this, you\u0027re clearly not going to suggest \u0022hey guys, here\u0027s an idea, let\u0027s all sign up for this trip together!\u0022. That makes no sense, because you\u0027re going to different places. Instead, each of you will individually hit up a travel agency and get a booking independent from the other two.\n\nThis represents having multiple tourist contracts in KSP, each with one or more tourists wanting a different place.\n\nThere\u0027s nothing wrong with telling a large bunch of tourists \u0022hey, come hang out at the space center, I\u0027ll sort out who wants to go where and stage flights accordingly\u0022, per se. But it doesn\u0027t make much sense as contracts, then. It would work better with a system like the astronaut complex, which generates a constant stream of Kerbals with random stats for you to pull into your space program."},{"CreatedByName":"THobson","CreatedById":97709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T16:24:10Z","Content":"Thank you.
