I can do missions up to Minimus really well and my rockets and craft work perfectly and I can send rovers to other planets with ease. But for manned missions to other planets I get problems with size and fuel efficiency/capacity. So is there any mods that would be useful?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSuperintendnt","CreatedById":47102,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T16:00:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d recommend these \u003Ca href=\u0022kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26286-Nucleonics-Ltd-Rocketry-Division\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENucleonics\u003C/a\u003E: 2m Nuke Engines, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/23979-Kethane-Pack-0-7-7-Find-it-mine-it-burn-it-Happy-birthday-Kethane!-%28August-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKethane\u003C/a\u003E: Resource gathering, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25563-0-21-1-KAS-v0-4-1-Struts-pipes-part-storage-containers-merged-winches-more?highlight=.22\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/a\u003E: fuel transfer, base building and there is of course part packs (KW rocketry, NovaSilisco, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-13T16:03:59Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2013 04:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by TheSuperintendnt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrew Hansen","CreatedById":82311,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T16:21:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always loved ion engines because they\u0027re so efficient, but the stock ones take \u003Cem\u003Eforever\u003C/em\u003E to go anywhere!
