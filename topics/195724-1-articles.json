AFAIK, I never come across a mod that allows you to make xenon gas (I could be wrong though). But if you want mods for sustainable long range mission fuel material, I can think of 3:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Buzzard Collector: this mod adds a gigantic (and by gigantic, I mean it. They are roughly 3-5 times the width of ISS) deployable collector dish, available in S/M/L sizes. The dish is extremely fragile, and can only be used in space. When supplied with electricity, it can (very slowly) turn Kerbol wind into fuel (it only generates liquid fuel, which, in vacuum, can only be used by nuke engine). Think of it like a \u0022fuel panel\u0022 (that consumes electricity)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Solaris Hypernautics: this mod adds 2 new fuel resources: virtual particles and dust, alongside miscellaneous parts such as fuel tanks, boosters, and engines associated with those resources. It\u0027s easier to place on craft\u00A0 than buzzard because of much smaller part sizes, but the resource chain is more demanding and/or complicated. Virtual particle requires reactor that consumes electricity to generate said particle, and just that. The trade off is, the thrust is extremely low (even lower than ion) and the electricity demand is extremely high (even more than ion). Luckily, said reactor can also consume xenon to generate electricity (xenon consumption rate is roughly lower than ion engine and much more higher electricity output than fuel cell). The dust resource is more complex: it requires dust collectors placed on the outside your craft to gather dust particles (only work in vacuum) and storing them in dust tanks. The part gathers dust passively, but you can feed it electricity to speed up the process (mind you, the output in passive is so low you need multiple collectors to get reasonable output per minute). After that, you use dust compressor to turn said dust into ore (also costs electricity) before storing it on ore tanks, and then use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E to turn said ore into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/OX or monoprop. The hardest part is setting the balance of collector parts vs resource consumption, but if you did it right, your craft is essentially self-sustaining in terms of fuel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. GN Drive: this is the \u0022cheat engine\u0022 mod for KSP (pun intended). It adds GN particle resources, which can be used for propulsion. The engine is extremely broken because: it naturally regenerates the particle at no cost, sometimes at a rate much higher than particle consumption, act as a reactor with respectable electricity output, can be used as antigrav engine that allows your ship to ignore gravity, and can be overdrived to provide even more thrust. So broken that sometimes it\u0027s easier to bolt this engine on unflyable design than fixing it, and the design will fly with flying colors through sheer thrust. Any craft becomes SSTA (to anywhere) with this thing strapped on. The overdrive mode is also handy for testing aerodynamic heating (you can literally reach escape velocity in level flight). The only limitation is your design\u0027s resistance against aerodynamic heating and large G-forces (30G with this thing overdrived is normal) as well as it\u0027s massive price tag: 40,000,000 kerbucks apiece\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-20T03:56:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2020 03:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by ARS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Incarnation of Chaos","CreatedById":197414,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-20T04:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNear future suite and specifically Kerbal Atomics and Near Future Electric has some Uranium Reprocessing kit that can turn Depleted Uranium into Xenon.
