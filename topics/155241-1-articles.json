It will fly by mun and the ship will reach the PE of 40km of kerbin a few in games day later. I checked a few times everything was going right. But kerbals just disappear from the minmus returning ship after I jumped to another ship (probe) for something else. I went to astronaut complex and it said they are all \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Missing in action\u0022\u003EMIA\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Is there anyways I can protect my long range antennas during landing too? Since the planet doesn\u0027t have network yet and I need to remain connected with kerbin or I can\u0027t even control it.
