But it could cost a lot of money so that it isn\u0027t OP. I thought that it could be unlocked in the tech tree and it could be a part that is like a compartment with the materials that the kerbals could build to make the building. And their could be a different part for each building. Their wouldn\u0027t have to be mining involved or anything although it could go with it. Although it would probably weigh a lot so getting to your destination would be harder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FonVegen","CreatedById":105181,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T09:15:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying not to be rude here, but your suggestion is on the \u0022What not to suggest\u0022 list...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T13:31:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes it is, Squad is well aware of the idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
