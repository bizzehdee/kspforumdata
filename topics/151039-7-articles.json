This past week is a great example. I had a student come and see me during office hours because she thought I graded her exam way too hard. After all, as she put it, \u0022it\u0027s not like history is important to my major. I\u0027m an education major, after all...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe then proceeded to tell me that the grade I gave her caused her to doubt herself, doubt her intelligence and doubt her seriousness about education, after all, she \u003Cem\u003Efailed\u003C/em\u003E the exam. And because \u003Cem\u003EI gave her\u003C/em\u003E the failing grade, it really indicated that I was the one in error.

Your opinion, not mine. I look at the future and if Squad wants to survive in the games industry in the long run, they make sure to develop the architecture to be versatile. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe competition is watching and developing too.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve written it many times before and I\u0027m doing it again: KSP\u0027s main selling point is not the space sim side, it\u0027s the \u003Cem\u003Eeditor, being the easiest and quickest to use on the market. \u003C/em\u003EAlthough it lacks detail and precision, almost anything can built with incredible speed. Some might feel the editor is not important because they only build rockets using 30 parts. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/B04i8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOther people have a different standard. \u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI invented an engine using rocket/plane parts to build propeller planes and helicopters. Squad has adjusted KSP at my request multiple times to help the development of these engines. They\u0027ve promoted a topic about a car with a piston engine to thread of the month October. So ... are you gonna tell Squad how their program should behave and what their target audience should be?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nas i said above, it\u0027s ok, and i can totally agree with your comment, again, i go back to part of my post, every developer has a fantasy in his mind when he starts a game to be developed. now, if what you are asking for, fits into that fantasy image, why not, he will be all ears and fingers for typing the code, but when your request does not fit 100%, well, the response is depending on the amount of that percentage, if it is only 10% fitting, chances are, he will ignore you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso, don\u0027t forget, the future of game industries is not online abilities any more. games like skyrim came out without even thinking about multiplier and they still preatty much won the prize. also, as unity CEO told many many times during last years, the industry is switching toward mobile and vr. well, i am not that much concerned about those two in regards to ksp. even when mobile and vr would take 80% of the industry in future (maybe) there will still be some games that those devices won\u0027t be able to handle and would need pc or console technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-05T21:09:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nANYWAY.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what the Squad guys were working on this week.
