I started playing in career mod few day\u0027s ago , after that i found this mod which gives a bit more realistic feel to the game. So i started experimenting with satellites to set up a stable connection around Kerbin. Now i did that with 4 satellites on a 1Mm Orbit they work very well i have no black-out or something similar. I did this with Communotron 16 ( Satellite-Satellite , Satellite - Command Center ) and Comms DTS-M1 for Satellite - Mun communication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow in career mode i don\u0027t have the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator ( almost the last part in tech tree) only Photovoltaic Panels so on the night side of Kerbin i am 100% on battery power so each satellite have 6 x Z-200 battery to have enought energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that i want to place 3 satellite on Mun orbit but the Mun have a bigger night side after a rough calculation i will need 10 x z-200 battery to have enought energy on the night side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any other orbit configuration to get a smaller night side or to get the smallest black-out spot possible. If not i think i need to rely only on the day side of the Mun and have a complet black-out on the night-side and use the flight-computer for all executions on the dark side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx for any good tip \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-19T11:45:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2014 11:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by bandi94\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T14:55:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you put your satellites in circular, equatorial orbits, then you\u0027re pretty much stuck with long nights. About the only way to avoid long nights is to use highly inclined, rather eccentric orbits with Pes at low altitude and Aps out there a good way. The satellite will thus spend most of its time above or below the ecliptic, out of all the shadows, and when it\u0027s down near the ecliptic, it\u0027s moving very fast so its night is short.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T15:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to simply use bigger batteries.
