After loading kerbals on it, it noticed it looked weird with them sitting so high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus i dropped them, but realized two seats wouldn\u0027t cut it. So i cut out a seat and made it one seat. I thought it looks a bit bland, so i used some struts and the 1x6 solar panels to make a \u0022wall\u0022 or whatever you wish to call it. I thought it looked good, but there needed to be something on top, so i dropped a girder and called it good. Shortly after for the luls of it i put a air intake on, and actually liked it. I decided the back was dull so i put a wing onto it, just to spice it up. At that point it reminded me of a square Formula 1 car, so i decided to put some panels and make the car shapely, added girders and struts to the sides and it ended up with a shape i liked. I dropped the ride height a bit more and added a light. At this point i decided to test drive it, needless to say it was a bit wobbly. I threw some space tape around and went out again; All clear and sturdy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a bit more of tweaking i started to like the design more, which took the car from a project for the luls of it to a project i wanted to complete and make look good. Soon after I worked on the front, fixed the back some and added a few more struts and girders, a bit more space tape and a couple other items (barometer because it looks like a fire extinguisher for example) and kept going and testing. After about 2 and a half hours i finally arrived at the final product...a Race inspired single seat rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile its stable and works, it can literally self destruct if you hit the ground too hard, as there are a few parts that stick through the bottom including the probe it was built on. I took it for a drive and ended up driving about 10 km to the north of KSS and had absolutely no problems with bottoming out or self destructs. It turned well even at 25\u002B going down hill, but only in smooth turns, as you would expect. It turns reliably at 21 and below with almost 2.5 G\u0027s of force (poor jeb did a lot of doughnuts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf enough people request it, ill post a download link \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1328.photobucket.com/albums/w538/Brevillance/2013-09-08_00001_zps99a53f4f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-09-08_00001_zps99a53f4f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1328.photobucket.com/albums/w538/Brevillance/2013-09-08_00004_zps269fa594.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-09-08_00004_zps269fa594.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1328.photobucket.com/albums/w538/Brevillance/2013-09-08_00002_zpsf2a77b56.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-09-08_00002_zpsf2a77b56.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1328.photobucket.com/albums/w538/Brevillance/2013-09-08_00003_zps6cee1e5b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-09-08_00003_zps6cee1e5b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
