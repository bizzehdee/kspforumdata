Attaching value to post numbers or reputation scores has always seemed a race to the bottom, on whichever forum it may occur. However, it does seem a little ungrateful that the folks that spend a lot of time learning tools and then creating high quality content seem less recognized for their work (be it in the form of reputation or otherwise), while people (and I am slightly exaggerating) slapping a couple of craft together get lots of accolades. Though hardly an all encompassing scoring system, a more balanced result would just be a little token of appreciation to modmakers for their efforts and work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I expect it is, for a large part, just a misunderstanding of the efforts involved in creating original content. You see the same in the professional world, where less initiated are generally fairly blas\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9 about things that take a huge amount of experience and/or work to get to that point. A photographer is just a guy that presses a button, which we can all do, and a graphic designer is just a guy with Photoshop and Illustrator installed on his computer, which most of us could do, right?
