It seems simple enough except there is a problem with it so I thought i would make a comment on it in Kerbal SpacePort. To do that I need to log on, to do that I need to register, but when I attempt to register it doesn\u0027t let me because I have not specified an avatar file (even though this is not a compulsory field). I have asked support at KSP to no avail. Can someone help me with an avatar please?
