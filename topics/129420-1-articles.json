That is to remind me of what I intended to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit 1-7-15, To expand on this, I docked a new part to my orbital station. I had the camera zoomed in close for the docking. After docking I zoomed the camera out and discovered the new part was on upside down and tilted off at an odd angle. Due\u00A0to objects jutting out of the main station, I had to un-dock and back up a good distance, rotate the part and re-dock. Not much of a problem for most people. I, however, am really bad at docking. I would rate a 3 on a 10 point scale for my docking skill. My new station\u00A0part had no RCS thrusters or reaction wheels\u00A0due to poor planning. The tug was under powered and sluggish, add in my lack of skill and you have a long, unhappy time. A large physical marking\u00A0on the docking port outer flange would be a visual reminder to rotate before completing docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-07T14:07:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2016 02:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by teatime\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T21:27:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a bad idea, I quite like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem I can see with having the mark on the docking port part is that it may be difficult\u00A0to get them lined up properly (or easy to forget to do) when building the ship, especially if you are building a ship that you want to dock with one already in orbit and can\u0027t remember where your mark was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne workaround is to add something like\u00A0a light (which will also help you to see when you try to \u00A0dock in the dark) to your ships which can serve as \u00A0alignment markers. You can add two lights to each ship to maintain symmetry and use the right click menu to change the colours, so red could be up and green down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T22:39:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, is there any reason docking ports couldn\u0027t pull and snap\u00A0to the nearest 45% when the magnets kick in?
