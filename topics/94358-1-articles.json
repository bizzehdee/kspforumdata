I\u0027ve never done rescue missions. but I have killed a kerbal in sandbox mode and loaded up a ship where he was saved as the crew and then he was in my crew again. This was Jebediah so it was unmistakable which one it was. I\u0027ve had the same issue with bill being put into orbit and then going back in my crew and not being in orbit anymore. I then had and still have the same symptoms by the sounds of it. It may be a bigger issue with anything that can auto yank a kerbil from a previous location. It\u0027s sounds like a more general game programming logic issue. they need to stop the game from allowing you to regain kerbals in these manners. And if they add a means to do so be able to recheck all data locations to make approprirate changes. I\u0027m guessing they have no large scale organized software to locate all data files associated with any given action(Nvm, I\u0027m guessing they just missed a peice of logic and are using a premade one. Same problem)? if they just place stuff into files and assume nothing will happen it won\u0027t. they need to organize all data files and add associations and the ability for any data changing action to modify and adapt to any situation through automated search functions etc. Especially via kerbil name possibly for this type of problem. It\u0027s not hard. It\u0027s just like a sheet with pull downs will all associated files that can be used and the name of the functions etc that can use them. Could make a good gui for going over development logic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(and obviously the game needs to check those data spots and deny actions and other things appropriately.) BTW, organizing a tool like that is the best way to go over the overall logic of the software you\u0027re writing. You can see how many points you have to keep track of and the complete array and most complex type of logic being used as functions are changed/added. If you can maintain and stay on top that tool and the game logic you can program any part of it easily as you keep up with and understand what the changes you make do. Also makes it easy to modify faster if needed as you have the tool made. Should always have full knowledge of what the games total infafstructure is from a logical or mathematical/geometric standpoint. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr do they already have that type of development tool.

There are several ways for them to be deleted. The problem is that they aren\u0027t moved into an unused status, but are completely removed from the roster. With the way KSP stores connections for sake of keeping game history, missing entries from the roster are causing problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo firing kerbals, killing kerbals, and firing MIA kerbals are just a few of the problems. Once that\u0027s happened, any later references to those missing kerbals is disastrous to KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
