Let\u0027s start off with the one that will cause the most destruction\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRunway gap: Near the beginning of the runway, there\u0027s a gap (actually more of a tiny cliff) in the terrain, somewhat like that one on Minmus a while back, except this one is somewhere you\u0027d go for an actual reason, not just to fall through the floor or goof around. I\u0027ve tested it with a small rover\u00A0and can confirm that the gap is, in fact\u00A0a physical error, not just graphical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBouncy wheels: In some tests, wheels are extremely bouncy and make driving hard. A prototype for a submarine I built has a heavy payload spread out over a bunch of wheels, but when it spawns in, it bounces from side to side until the wheels shatter and have to be repaired by an engineer and begin the cycle all over again. This isn\u0027t just with heavy payloads, I haven\u0027t observed the phenomenon in a light craft directly, but there are some GIFs on the KSP subreddit of it happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStrange lines: This is the weirdest glitch I\u0027ve discovered in the day or so that 1.2 has been out: On most things in the game, faint lines can be observed, similar to those on the science lab, but more frequent. It occurs on parts, particle effects, the main menu, and even planets sometimes! They run across the screen vertically no matter what position the craft or camera is in. If it matters, I\u0027m on Mac and KSP is the only thing this issue has occurred in, with and without mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlow framerate and response editor response times: Even though I have relatively few mods installed, the game seems to be moving slowly - at most 23 frames a second, probably closer to 19 or 20 (the slowest framerate the human eye can perceive as motion is 24). Though it may not seem like a big deal, it is. It lowers the enjoyment factor of the game drastically and I don\u0027t even want to see what happens if I try to record it.

My screenshots are just rainbow static - COMPLETELY unrecognizable as anything. I wanted a new wallpaper for my desktop (this postcard-style wallpaper is getting old), but I can\u0027t get any screenshots that actually look like anything. I might be wrong, but they\u0027re not even the right shape! This also makes it impossible to get thumbnails for videos, and might also affect recording, although I haven\u0027t tested it yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnnoying fairings: While not so much a bug as an annoying feature, the new fairing system tends to get in the way a lot more than it should. This is probably just my current building style, but it\u0027s worth mentioning.

A prototype for a submarine I built has a heavy payload spread out over a bunch of wheels, but when it spawns in, it bounces from side to side until the wheels shatter and have to be repaired by an engineer and begin the cycle all over again. This isn\u0027t just with heavy payloads, I haven\u0027t observed the phenomenon in a light craft directly, but there are some GIFs on the KSP subreddit of it happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a long-standing bug, reported here by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and confirmed by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/115992-squelch/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022115992\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/115992-squelch/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Squelch\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0in the chat of\u00A0the last Squadcast (asked by me, I\u0027m AlphaMensae on Twitch), in\u00A0the spring equations of PhysX, that causes the landing gear to be extra bouncy.

Many of the complications are caused by the necessary Squad code that tries to minimize the effects of the PhysX bug. There is also a known Unity bug that causes additional problems with craft with more than 20 wheels. When Nvidia finally fixes the PhysX bug, then all the wheel code can be simplified back down to something that works nicely -- or alternately when Squad gets sick of waiting and scraps Unity and PhysX to go with something else. The devs are under the impression that Nvidia will eventually fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe runway gaps are obviously caused by the current polygon system, and they are everywhere -- not just the runway. Yes, they need a fix, but it\u0027s going to probably be a tricky programming task. The bumps seem to be a random height. Examine the runway before each takeoff. If the bumps go up\u00A0in the wrong direction, then take off going the other way. It doesn\u0027t have to cause any damage, if you take the tiniest of precautions. It will be fixed when there is dev time available to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStaticy screenshots? Can\u0027t duplicate -- my screenshots work fine.
