In that case, your problem is probably insufficient pitch authority to rotate the nose up. One thing to remember is that IIRC the creation of lift requires there to be some angle of attack between wing and direction of travel so a wing that\u0027s perfectly horizontal generations zero lift. There are several ways to fix this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Move the landing gear so the thing sits slightly nose-up. As it moves down the runway, it\u0027s got some AoA and thus some lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Add some canards to the nose to help kick the nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Move the rear wheels until they\u0027re just barely behind the CoM, so the plane can rotate almost about its CoM instead of having to lever it up on main gear set too far aft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022sabre m engine\u0022-engines are not attaching to hardpoints\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, SABREs only attach as stacks, not radially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eforum- how do i attach pictures of craft/the craft file, i know file locations of these things, simply not how to add\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOthers have already said how to do pics.
