I imagine it would work much like Replay Mod works for Minecraft. I imagine it to be one of two ways, depending on some variables and how much coding the author wants to do:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMore difficult method:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EIf the file sizes required for the recordings are surprisingly small, then I\u0027d like the mod to track EVERYTHING to the point where you can return and watch as if it were a YouTube video, with time controls that act as time warp both forwards and backwards in time. Explosions, particles, animations, and crewmates are all recorded in real time. You\u0027d be able to toggle map mode and normal mode, and follow any craft at any time. This would be PERFECT for YouTube videos. I do understand how intensive this would be and how\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0would need to go absolutely\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eperfectly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0for this method to be remotely possible, which is why I proposed a cheaper and easier yet less awesome version below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEasier method:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EHowever, if file sizes for the recordings\u00A0are large, a more economic way of doing it would be restricting the replays to Map Mode only, and watching from there. This way you can determine the base facts about your mission, although lacking the cinematic shots. As you are stuck in map mode, you cannot watch any craft do any delicate operations, and so some things may be obscure when seen from the map, but this would still be satisfactory for me if executed well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFurther details:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EI\u0027d imagine this mod could track everything the in-game events tracker does, like when parts collide or kerbals are killed, and put those on a timeline of some sort for you to explore and recall back to. You could scroll through and find when Jebediah died, and remember how he died. This would be especially useful for mission reports, YouTube videos, and other similar content where you might forget or forget to record some parts, and never be able to figure out what happened at that point ever again. Plus this would mean unlimited cinematic shots for YouTube videos or images, meaning you can record YouTube videos without worrying about things like ugly shots or the HUD being in the way of your scenic Interstellar-esque docking scene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any mods like this?
