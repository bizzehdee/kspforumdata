Turning SAS on\\off also doesn\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea what can cause that. This started after I\u0027ve updated NovaPunch from 2.03 to 2.03.5, before that I\u0027ve made a successful launch with 3.75m SAS-radiator on a first stage. All possible perpetrators - Mechjeb, KJR, other mods (although I haven\u0027t any mods that somehow alter SAS behavior, except MJ) were updated earlier, and worked completely normal with NP 2.03.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmaller SAS (1.25m and 2.5m) doesn\u0027t suffer from this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat looks like a center of mass issue.

The problem there is even more severe, specifically in the latter, if you try to launch an Ares 1, straight up vertical as in your test it will veer off sharply eventually even somersaulting. And that\u0027s WITH SAS on. It\u0027s literally not even possible to compensate at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I think is happening to you, but I don\u0027t know why the effect would be present in 0.23.5 and not earlier versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you install the RCS balancer and set it to engine mode I think you\u0027ll probably see that part is off balance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T17:06:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tiberion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tiberion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlright, here is 2.03.5 test #2.
