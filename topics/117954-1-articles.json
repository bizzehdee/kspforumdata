And often, at least one wheel will instantly break upon repair, probably because too much weight is sitting on it. It\u0027s hobbled its way up, risen about a hundred meters and half a kilometer away from its original landing spot in the foothills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m trying to see if I can JUST make it from where I am.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing SMARTASS to keep the ship angled up, I\u0027ve managed to engage the ascent guidance after the thickest atmosphere, and ALMOST make it to a 100km orbit. Only 8 seconds of burn between me and an orbit my mothership can collect the vessel from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of course, angling straight up forever and doing a gravity turn that late is bound to be inefficient. If I did the turn somewhat earlier, I could optimize the ascent. Ascent guidance could almost certainly do it... it just isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know why, but attempting the autopilot from landed provokes some weird, useless behavior. The ship slowly spirals upward and harsher and harsher angles, until it finally flips over. Usually it catches itself and is upright after a few seconds, but the ascent is by then a total failure for the fuel and momentum wasted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not even in a consistent direction. It almost looks like over-correction and a propagation of error. Even engaging the ascent autopilot ANY time before being CERTAIN you\u0027re in the upper atmosphere is likely to provoke this effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne wonders if there was a simple issue in the ascent profile gumming things up from the Kerbin Launch, but as this isn\u0027t Kerbin, I have no way to edit the profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Or do I?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, I\u0027ve SEEN videos of Mechjeb users editing the ascent profiles on other planets... but I can\u0027t for some reason. When I open the profile window, I get a blank window I can\u0027t close without hitting the button in the Ascent Guidance control panel again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m starting to suspect this isn\u0027t normal, though I\u0027ve deleted and redownloaded the entire game and reinstalled Mechjeb a number of times by now.
