It would be nicer to write down all these coordinates and my findings, AND how well the mission went IN GAME instead of in a tiny little notebook. I\u0027m sure others would find this useful and I definately would, too. It would probably have an infinite amount of pages, too. It wouldn\u0027t be hard to add to the game, just a little thing to type words in to and save what you wrote, so you can continute next time. I would greatly benefit from it and it adds a certain \u0022homliness\u0022 to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T21:24:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESuggested last week\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50502-comment-on-vessels-like-you-do-with-flags\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50502-comment-on-vessels-like-you-do-with-flags\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast month\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49336-Notepad\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49336-Notepad\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease use the search feature before creating a new thread.
