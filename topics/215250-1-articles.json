It seems to happen more often with spaceplanes, and mainly when they are in space, just coasting along. Loading a save, even a previous save, often doesn\u0027t get the parts back. The crafts behave normally in space after losing these parts, aside from losing the functionality of these parts, but after losing some canards to this bug, the craft became less\u00A0aerodynamically stable instead of more stable/too stable, even with all the remaining fuels pumped forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy pc specs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOS: Windows 10 Home, version 22H2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCPU: 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-12400F \u00A0 2.50 GHz\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPU: AMD Radeon RX 6600\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRAM: 16GB\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome pics of the problems:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/M8aMNeO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/gallery/M8aMNeO\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/6AUk85o\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/gallery/6AUk85o\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razor235","CreatedById":16436,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-17T04:53:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had wings just fly off my high-performance jets on mid-G (7-8) maneuvers they were able to do just fine pre-patch.\u00A0 This also instantly removes control and does the \u0022mission destroyed\u0022 dialogue box as I helplessly watch my mostly-still-intact plane fly off into the ground in the distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Garrett Bennett","CreatedById":228301,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-28T04:15:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the same issue, I had a spaceplane capable of reaching the mun, but after the patch it falls apart on the runway or during take off, no amount of struts have fixed the issue.
