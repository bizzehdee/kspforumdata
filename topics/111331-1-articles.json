I get to the 80km test range and testing goes well. When I come in from orbit both types of parachutes just burn up even when I have the heat shield taking the brunt of the heat. I have tried both types of chutes as well different angles when I enter the atmosphere. Nothing helps did 1.0.2 break this?
