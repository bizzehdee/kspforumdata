Using new fancy two-mode engine won\u0027t be as much fuel efficient, imho. I\u0027d try to use turbojet stage with lots of ram intakes and amount of fuel just enough to get to upper atmosphere (1 mk1 fuselage per engine may be enough), but it may not be efficient and reliable anyway: jets take time to heat up, when they start turning off because of lack of air their may cause instability of your rocket and they won\u0027t be able to get you out of atmoshere (I\u0027m not talking about smaller payloads like satellites, it may be sufficient for them). I\u0027d also start making gravity turn earlier in order to squeeze all what jets can in atmosphere before their fuel runs out, then start quick ascent just before jet fuel is finished, then switch to rocket.

I\u0027m using the mods B9, KW Rocketry, FAR, and DRE. Unfortunately, it will be a couple of days until I\u0027ll be at my desktop again (which has the save files), so I\u0027ll describe the craft as best as I can. I\u0027m using the vehicle for a Munar mission, with an 1 seater service module \u002B lander, so once it\u0027s in orbit, it\u0027s fairly similar to an Apollo style mission. I figure that will be a good enough proof of concept that I can use what was learned for other craft later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the craft looks like an up-scaled SR-71, with the engines, their fuel tanks, and air intakes mounted in the wings. The center fuselage has a forward and rear fairing (so it\u0027s aerodynamic), with the forward fairing containing the lander and service module, each connected to a set of structural elements via decouplers, and the lander is attached to the fairing base via decoupler. On the outside of the front fairings, canards are mounted, while wings are moutned to the rear fairing. The rear fairing also covers the rocket engine (which is probably not an optimal design decision, but it does allow me to quickly shed the control surfaces with the fairings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s some of the problems I\u0027ve faced:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The SPH while really good for space plane construction, and the VAB is really good for rockets, neither are good for a hybrid project of this nature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Using assemblies to get parts built in the VAB and then attached to the SPH does interesting things not only with staging, but also gives you Schrodinger\u0027s Struts if you also import assembly with the fairing already in place (and canards or wing pieces attached to the fairing). Typically speaking, you will need to restrut the assembly once it\u0027s in the SPH - and this is something that I was discovering shortly before I had to shut things down for the weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* SPH symmetry mode does interesting things to fairings, like components mount to the outside and inside of a fairing piece, but not to the other fairing, or at least, from what I recall of working with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Oscillations of the cargo in the fairing in flight, which leads to cargo ultimately swinging through a fairing, which then cause FAR to do nasty things to the structural integrity of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, anyone wants to give a crack at it, and see if I\u0027m doing something wrong, or if this is a deceptively hard project, it\u0027d be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T22:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you need is \u003Ca href=\u0022forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38768-0-23-Editor-Extensions-v0-6-5-Aug-(EdTools-Editor-Tools-replacement)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEditor Extensions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.
