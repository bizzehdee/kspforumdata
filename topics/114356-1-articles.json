So from now on I\u0027ll post them all to this one release page, a sort of blog on a post. Some of my facebook friends in the KSP group suggested doing this so here it is.\n\nAll the tanks shown are fully stock and require no mods to operate. Photos were created using GIMP and PIXLR, image manipulation programs. These craft were built to replicate first, operate second. All turrets are designed to move and wheels to move, although performance varies from tank to tank. Part count is also high (400-700) on most tanks due to the detail required in a replica.\n\n**The Current tanks in my collection:**\n\n[**T-34 1940**](http://www./download/2g48anb9kxyfwv9/T-34\u002B1940.craft)\n\n[**T-34 1942**](http://www./download/u0oipf48dbz02a5/T-34\u002B1942.craft)\n\n[**T-34-85**](http://www./download/joyo8tl768ornuk/T-34-85.craft)\n\n[**Iosif Stalin 4**](http://www./download/uvsd2s5siokoujc/IS-4\u002BD.craft)\n\n[**SU-85**](http://www./download/pnxnjng734dkkg2/Su-85.craft)\n\n[**Su-100**](http://www./download/b747he5b1ehvhob/Su-100.craft)\n\n[**M46 Patton**](http://www./download/m3m7u9xn3qa0u80/M46\u002BPatton.craft)\n\n[**M26 Pershing**](http://www./download/0bed6tyqt617ido/M26\u002BPershing.craft)\n\n[**T26E4 Super Pershing**](http://www./download/cti1zzqalordjcu/T26E4\u002BSuper\u002BPershing.craft)\n\n[**M4A3 Sherman**](http://www./download/948rczmh9f1yk52/M4A3.craft)\n\n[**M4A3 HVSS Sherman**](http://www./download/nocex6tum0asy7g/M4A3\u002BHVSS.craft)\n\n[**M4A2-76W HVSS Sherman**](http://www./download/4ayc1l6pcnre0ln/M4A2-76W\u002BHVSS\u002BSherman.craft)\n\n[**M4A3E2 Jumbo Sherman**](http://www./download/2f4bm7nzkz06kdj/M4A3E2\u002BJumbo\u002BSherman.craft)\n\n[**M4A3E8 \u0022Easy Eight\u0022 Sherman**](https://www./?5l1yb20rlk1dxok)\n\n[**Achilles Tank Destroyer**](http://www./download/nbobdrs1c2h7gm5/M10\u002BAchillies.craft)\n\n[**T34 Calliope Sherman**](https://www./?v9vfdb7j21vbd07)\n\n[**Sherman VC Firefly I**](https://www./?kuv2dt2b9btufoe)\n\n[**Pz.KPfw.
