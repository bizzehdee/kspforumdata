Just to peak about what parts I should unlock next in my carrier.\n\nCarrier is for event driven science even if it is a contract given stuff or \u0022accident\u0022 driven or even (What the given player builds) so planes built from basic plane parts should unlock researchability for more and even better plane parts. \n\nRocket launches should open more rockets related research possibilities.\n\nAccidents and/or reached milestones could give us more advanced stuff for the given event. \n\nAnd for make it not just a two day game: !everything! researched should get 2-5 more level of research to upgrades. For example basic jet engine with 50KN thrust at first and 150KN when 5 times upgraded later on science wide.\n\nYou have contracts like reach 10Km basic jetengine can barely go up there with an ultralight plane. and the basic rockets should just reach that with a GOOOD design. \n\nTech tree unlock possibilities? \n\n1. Reached? With planes? =Better planeparts, or engine upgrade... With rockets? Bigger rockets, bigger fueltanks, and/or better thrust as an upgrade for the Rocketengines.\n\n2.

I barely should haul at most \u002210-20\u0022 different part on the ship at once.\n\nIf browsing and getting out \u0022accidently\u0022 an old part I could wait a sec or two to load it into the memory.

Orbital scans might reveal the course location, you\u0027d find the detailed locations on the ground. Some could be set and permanent, others might appear and disappear with time. Your scientists might give pointers to help you in the right direction, E.G travel in the direction that makes [sensor readings A \u0026 B] increase, but it\u0027s up to you to actually find them, putting you in the role of planet investigator.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u002B1 Plus it would give the player incentive to explore planets (which is completely lacking atm). \n\u003E \n\u003E I also believe that splitting up tech vs science would be a great step in making science and visiting planets interesting. Tech are the parts which you\u0027ll have to unlock by paying and then testing flying them. Science is what you learn about planets/the universe, e.g. what height does the atmosphere end, what is the gravity of the heavenly bodies, how much delta V does it take to get to orbit (fits in nice with the upcoming delta V report), how old are planets/impact craters, where are resources located (sat for general indication, ground work for specific location), etc. All the while increasing planet resolution and info as you gain knowledge to more effectively plan your missions. Combine this with TW1\u0027s suggestion above and i think we\u0027d actually have a fun career mode and this also fits in nicely with the current in-game modules.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T11:34:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 11:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yakuzi**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T12:16:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I did the same thing.
