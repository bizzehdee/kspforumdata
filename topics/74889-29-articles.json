Part of why that bug is so hard to track is that it has to do with ships without command parts and hierarchy order when undocking, to the best of my knowledge, and I have encountered it many times. The game forgets to add the \u0022undock\u0022 option to a docking port thinking it is no longer docked or something. If, however, the bug is related to phantom forces upon docking... well, the Whack may have build a glitched ship due to part clipping, docking ports on struts/clipped docking ports usually does that. It could also be a matter of some part picking some weird parent on the VAB, that also happens (ever pulled a part only to have a totally unrelated part also come off the ship?
