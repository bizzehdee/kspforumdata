Bravo!\n\nA couple of questions and comments, specifically about the Air Augmented SRB\u0027s:\n\n- \u0022size 0.0 0.2\u0022 Both AASRBs are missing a number of equal signs in the effects sections; iirc it was something like 12 in the Boost-O-Tron and probably the same in the other one.\n- Putting a decoupler module and an engine module in the same part causes Kerbal Engineer to not register the added deltaV from that part in the editor (at least it used to work this way a couple of versions back). This might not be of a concern to you, but I figured I\u0027d mention it in case someone files a bug report about it. Basically KER assumes the Engine gets decoupled before it gets used (even with staging = false)...I once put decouplers in all SRBs and it drove me nuts trying to figure out why they seemingly wouldn\u0027t \u0022work\u0022 in the VAB.\n- Are they supposed to be throttle locked/allow shut down false?\n- I only really looked at the Boost-O-Tron closely, but are the um, Mutli-modal thrust figures backwards? I say this as some one who doesn\u0027t really understand curves and such, but on first blush, it seems like the Standard mode of the SRB *always* puts out more thrust and *always* produces less heat than the Air-Augmented mode (again, that is assuming there is no fancy magic happening with curves). I guess my frame of reference is the LOX Boosted multi-modal Atomic engines from various mods, just with different resources. That might be a bit of a stretch, but it\u0027s the only example I can think of off the top of my head, and probably explains my confusion. Please clarify if I\u0027m wrong, as I really like this idea.\n- edit: setting a min thrust value above zero can be bad voodo as it makes it so the user can\u0027t scale back the SRB thrust in the editor (KW rocketry has that issue big time)\n- edit2: you\u0027re also packaging an out of date MM version (.23); latest is (.24) and earlier ones won\u0027t work at all with 1.1.12 I believe.\n- edit3: I believe \u0022thrustProviderModuleIndex = 0\u0022 actually refers to the MultiMode Module, as it throws an error in the log (no thrust provider module found at index 0).\n\nAll I got at the moment relating to those.\n\nCheers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-10T20:46:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2016 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Deimos Rast**"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T21:41:46Z","Content":"[@Deimos Rast](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157420-deimos-rast/) I haven\u0027t noticed issues with the FX in action, so I don\u0027t think there\u0027s an issue with them missing, but I can add them in.  \n\n-Was unaware of the KER issue; I haven\u0027t gotten any bug reports about it yet, but I\u0027ll keep it in mind.  \n\n-No, because dual cycle engines and AllowShutdown = False don\u0027t play nice with each other  \n\n-There is fancy magic happening with the curves, thrust and ISP scale with mach. Looking at previous versions, it looks like the lowered thrust was a result of buffing the engines and missing/forgetting to buff the augmented mode. I\u0027ll have to fix that.  \n\n-The minthrust value came about at the same time AllowShutdown was removed, at the time I thought Throttlelocked needed to be removed for dual-cycle SRBs to work, and the Minthrust value was added as a workaround to it being removed. A quick test shows that either I was wrong about that or 1.1 changed things; since it\u0027s messing with editor thrust scaling, I\u0027ll fix it.  \n\n-MM version will be updated.  \n\n-Yeah, looking at other configs, it needs to point to ModuleEngineFX, Which it isn\u0027t for the AAREs, One more thing to fix.\n\nThanks for the feedback!"},{"CreatedByName":"Galenmacil","CreatedById":118681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T06:26:08Z","Content":"Not sure if this is relevant since CLS is not updated yet for 1.1.2, but I think these lines found in the file M2X\\_CLS.cfg are not right:\n\n@PART[M2X\\_TunaCockpit|M2X\\_BladeCockpit|M2X\\_DropshipCockpit|M2X\\_RavenCockpit|M2X\\_ViperCockpit|M2X\\_Hub|M2X\\_THub|M2X\\_LHub|M2X\\_SmallLab|M2X\\_ShieldedDockingPort|M2X\\_SCRCS|M2X\\_Endcap|M2X\\_AligningDockingPort|M2X\\_EngineShroud|M2X\\_RadialMountA|M2X\\_RadialMountB]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]]:FOR[Mk2Expansion]  \n\n{  \n\n    MODULE  \n\n    {  \n\n        name = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace  \n\n        passable = true  \n\n    }  \n\n}\n\nSpecifically: **:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]** \n\nHere an excerpt of the log file showing errors and warnings:\n\nSpoiler\n\n[LOG 00:42:58.589] PartLoader: Part \u0027Mk2Expansion/Parts/Aero/AdapterIntake/part/M2X\\_InlineIntake\u0027 has no database record.
