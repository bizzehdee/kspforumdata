You are completely factually wrong then, BTW. The F9\u0027s second stage \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E take the coast and relight to make the full GSO insertion, as the one on v1.2 was tested to do so in the very last flight. It made the news, even, right at the end of some of the more in-depth articles. And Centaur is not a \u0022high thrust\u0022 stage, it is a high \u003Cem\u003EIsp\u003C/em\u003E stage, which means it has \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E thrust if anything. It also has heavy insulation, and leaks fuel as it makes the climb to GSO, like any deep cryogenic tank, and of course has a relatively awful mass ratio compared with soft cryogens like LOX, or storables that can get crazy tankage mass ratios.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo need to, the Merlin has a great capability to restart multiple times, and they should get little to no boiloff.

If the battery was enough and they don\u0027t lose too much pressurant, Falcon\u0027s upper stage (which really needs a name, IMO) could be relit to insert around the moon...

The relight test was for GTO, not for GSO, which is why the stage was re-lit after 20 minutes, not after 6 hours. Take a look at the actual documentation from SpaceX:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/falcon_9_users_guide_rev_2.0.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/falcon_9_users_guide_rev_2.0.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPage 14, table 3-1. It is not an omission that GSO is not listed in these tables, it\u0027s just not a service that the Falcon family offers.

Not to mention, that most popular sat busses are much heavier, in the range of 4,000-5,500kg per sat. If we run these calculations with a\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E4,750kg\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Esat, to be in the middle of that payload range of the business that SpaceX really wants, we only get a residual delta v of \u003Cstrong\u003E587 m/s.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what of the Falcon Heavy? Doesn\u0027t it\u0027s increased lift mean we can do GSO missions with that booster? Not really. The limiting factor here is not lift, but SpaceX\u0027s dedication to re-usability. The top quoted staging velocity that they can expect recovery from has been quoted as\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E3,430 m/s\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0(mach 10). So using our same average payload of\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E4,750kg\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0we get a residual of\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E1,797 m/s\u003C/strong\u003E. So a Falcon heavy might possibly be able to do a GSO insertion, assuming\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ESpaceX is willing to risk making a customer specific modification to the second stage for the extended coast time, which may soil their second stage track record. If we look at something more sensible, like a\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E10,500kg\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Edouble satellite stack to GTO on the heavy, which would put it in competition with the Ariane 5, we get a residual of\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E258\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0m/s\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0on the Falcon Heavy. It\u0027s almost like that\u0027s exactly what it\u0027s designed to do!

The kind of staging velocities which you can achieve on the Altas V are much more conducive to this, especially when paired with the Centaur, because they don\u0027t want to reuse it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"saabstory88","CreatedById":110598,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T16:41:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple other notes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Merlin series of engines use TEA/TEB for all engine ignitions.
