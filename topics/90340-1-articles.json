I\u0027m an engineer nearing retirement age, and I have been playing KSP long enough to have completed a dozen career modes, and in general I know my way around KSP pretty good. I\u0027ve been building/designing computers longer than most of you have been alive. I\u0027m here because KSP is the first game to attract my attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I don\u0027t know beans about joysticks, or flight controls. I got my first modern joystick today. I got it because the keyboard sucks for many types of maneuvers. At least that is what I was thinking when I purchased the joystick... But now the joystick is taking the joy out of the game... I\u0027ve searched the forums on the subject of setting up a joystick, but I mostly see people talking about it, but not actually explaining it. It seems most of you have been around joysticks for a while, and this is not the first game you have ever tried to map to a stick. So when someone starts a thread talking about it, there are few specifics discussed, only that it is easy, and several tools are out there to improve things so they are even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoogling this subject, and it seems most games have the stick pre-mapped, so most people are only changing the defaults, not creating a mapping from scratch. Mapping from scratch is a tall order, when you don\u0027t know pitch from yaw. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a good resource out there for someone that has zero joystick experience?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went through the configuration screens, but I\u0027ve managed to make flying from a keyboard seem easy compared to the stick... So clearly I got started on the wrong foot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have an extreme 3d pro (based on recommendations here) but I really need a basic, but mostly complete guide on what mappings to configure as a starting point. I\u0027ll save the sophisticated tweaking and third-party tools for the threads that already exist... I\u0027ll get to that next week after I master basic flight controls with a stick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is a file with the basic mappings that I can just get a copy of, I can probably use that as a good starting point... But starting from scratch is difficult when there are no defaults at all. I\u0027m /not/ asking for flying lessons. I only want a starting point for an initial mapping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T08:12:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile some may disagree with me, control mapping in general leaves much to be desired in KSP. There is a lot that cannot be mapped to the joystick without external software, key binds that can\u0027t be changed, and the things you can map to the joystick overlap in odd ways. That being said, it\u0027s actually a lot easier than you might have thought. Simply go to the main menu, click settings and select the controls tab. This is all you need to set up your joystick. You\u0027ll probably just want to set up your \u0027staging\u0027 controls for now, and it\u0027s as easy as picking an axis, then moving that axis on your joystick to map it. You can then adjust sensitivity and invert the axis if need be and that\u0027s it. The axis are labeled as pitch, roll, yaw and translation vectors so I doubt you need a list for this. You can set it up however it\u0027s comfortable for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"keoki","CreatedById":91957,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T15:21:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESimply go to the main menu, click settings and select the controls tab.

Is that /really/ enough information? You sum up the information I am looking for without providing any information. You walked me up to the door I\u0027ve already been /through/. Almost as if you only skimmed my first post without reading it. I appreciate your spending the time to answer, and I get what you are trying to say. But my questions were about what I should do AFTER I click settings and select the control tab. And I don\u0027t mean how does the settings UI work, I did in fact set-up my stick. But the words pitch, yaw, roll, etc... I\u0027ve heard those words before, but they may as well be words from a foreign language. There is a TON of information on these words when you google them, but that doesn\u0027t translate into what axis they should be applied to. Obviously I haven\u0027t found the page I\u0027m looking for yet, because 99.9% of the pages that talk about this stuff don\u0027t display a mapping of those words to a flight stick. If I\u0027m lucky, I\u0027ll find a page that mentions pitch and illustrates it... So I have that ONE. Roll and yaw seem interchangeable, in fact some pages talk about swapping them. All of the discussions start from the point that the controls are already mapped, OR the person reading has mapped controls before. One post here looked really promising, he covered pitch and yaw, and followed that with \u0022and so on...\u0022 . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need the \u0022and so on\u0022 part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next almost promising post (from a different game discussion I googled into) put yaw on a completely different axis, and the next one discussed switching yaw for roll, but didn\u0027t relate either to an axis. Most resources talk about it, providing little more than the \u0022and so on\u0022 with regard to specific details. I\u0027m just looking for a documented starting point that includes the words used in the settings UI, so that I\u0027m not left just guessing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously I should start gaming with a game that already has a basic mapping done. Everyone has to start somewhere. The problem is I\u0027m starting HERE, and have no interest in games. I\u0027m here because the orbital dynamics simulation is interesting, not because I want to play a game. I\u0027m posting this because landing something is rather difficult without a joystick, and using the landing mode of the mechjeb totally avoids me having to learn flight controls (and doesn\u0027t always get good results) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I understand it from the experienced person\u0027s point of view as well, I used to have to teach people the use of vi. vi comes naturally to me, but only because I\u0027ve been using unix for 35 years...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T15:44:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere\u0027s the difference between pitch, roll, and yaw.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPick up a ruler.

For the throttle - if you have one on your joystick - that is not needed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe translational movement (pushing your ship in space in the desired direction for docking purpurses without rotating it (keys are I,K,J,L,H,N)), is not used by me to avoid conflicts with the rotational movement (pitch/roll/yaw), because this would be the the same axis on the flightstick.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou can try however to set it up in settings/input/docking UI. Activated with the key \u0022delete\u0022 you have to change between the rotational and translational movement with the key \u0022space\u0022. Therefore there shouldn\u0027t be a conflict with the axis on the joystick. But honestly i never used this mode.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]You can map - rotational movement - to your kerbal under settings/input/kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]Possible is to map the controls for a rover too, under settings/input/rover. But be aware that the analoge controls are inverted! You have to move your joystick in the opposite direction or invert at least the steering in the VAB/SPH editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]The last thing, and very helpful for flying planes you will find unter settings/input/misc. If you have a hat (a switch witch moves in four directions at least) on you joystick you can map that as camera control (up/down, left/right). Or if you have a device like \u0022TrackIR\u0022 for head movement detection you can also map it here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnnotation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be that your joystick was delivered with a progam witch enables you to map the keys/axis outside from KSP to the joystick for a chosen game (in this case KSP). If that\u0027s the case and you prefer to map the functions with it, you should read the guide for it. It may be that - like mine flightstick - it give you the possibility, to map the buttons on your flight-/joystick with a second set of key-bindings (128 instead of 64 possible keys mapped).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is not needed for stock KSP in my opinion, but when you are playing with many mods or a games like FSX or Orbiter it come in handy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mdkendall","CreatedById":114550,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T04:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the same joystick as you, and I got it in order to be able to fly planes.
