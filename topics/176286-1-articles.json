Other stars exist that are off of it and fusing other elements, or else are dead or dying. These types have varying letters (spectral classifications) applied to them, with numerical sub-groups and a corresponding informal color (you can see the color in a good telescope). The higher up the scale, the bigger (and brighter) the star, but the faster the rate at which the hydrogen in them is used up and so the shorter their lifespan. For a number of reasons, very large stars - called giants, supergiants and hypergiants - like to live at the extreme ends of the spectral scales. Giant stars really do not like to be classes F or G, seeming to stay there for a very short time while heating up or cooling down to either extreme. There are a few known, but are decidedly in the minority. In general, most of the visible giants are either class-M or rather cool class-K (Betelgeuse, Arcturus) red giants, or class-B (Eta Carinae, Rigel, Deneb) blue giants.

We instinctively expect the air to be breatheable, the temperature to be liveable, the gravity to be 9.8 m/s2, the days to last 24 hours, trees and grass, animals and plants and fungi, et cetera, et cetera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sad fact is, though, that no other planet we\u0027ve detected thus far is even remotely habitable by human standards. The bigger ones are Jupiter-like balls of gas, while the smaller ones are almost universally airless balls of rocks or balls of ice. The few worlds we\u0027ve found that\u00A0do\u00A0have both an atmosphere and a solid surface have been blanketed in gases that no human can breathe, at pressures anywhere from\u00A0near-vacuum\u00A0to\u00A090 times Earth\u0027s sea level. While it\u0027s theoretically\u00A0possible\u00A0that a planet out there might harbor life as we know it, it would have to fit a long, narrow list of parameters, and even then, the kind of life that might have actually evolved there will most likely be very different from the multicellular-eukaryote-rich biome inhabiting Mother Terra.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order for a planet to be able to support life as we know it on its surface\u00A0at all, it will have to lie in a very narrow range of distances from its parent star. Too close, and any water would evaporate. Too far, and any water would freeze. Liquid water \u2014 and life as we know it requires liquid water \u2014 can only exist if the planet lies within that narrow zone where it\u0027s receiving just the right amount of energy from its star for the surface temperature to allow it. This is called the star\u0027s \u0022comfort zone,\u0022 or \u0022Goldilocks Zone\u0022 (as in: not too close, not too far, but juuuuuuuust right). The exact width of a star\u0027s Golilocks zone is a matter of some debate, due to the fact that some atmospheres can trap heat (Venus) and some can\u0027t, and a number of other factors that astrogeologists can make whole careers out of. All we can say for sure is that, for a star as bright and hot as the sun, Venus is too close, Earth is clearly within the Goldilocks zone, and Mars is\u00A0probably\u00A0close to the tail end of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow far away from the star the Goldilocks zone is depends on the star\u0027s energy output. A very dim red dwarf star, like Wolf 359, would require a planet to be only about 1.5 million kilometers away from it to receive as much energy as Earth does from our sun \u2014 that\u0027s only 0.01 A.U., 1% of the Earth-sun distance. A bright and powerful star like Sirius A, on the other hand, would require a planet to be 5 A.U. away from it to receive as much energy as the Earth does from the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly, both of those distances have potentially disastrous consequences. If a planet is only 0.01 A.U. away from its star, the star\u0027s tidal influence is going to be enormous. The strength of tidal forces varies directly with the larger object\u0027s (i.e. the star\u0027s) mass, but inversely with distance\u00A0cubed. The tidal forces on a planet only 0.01 A.U. from a star 1/10 the mass of the sun are, therefore, going to be 0.1 / 0.013\u00A0=\u00A0100,000\u00A0times as strong as the tidal forces the Earth experiences from the sun. This all but guarantees that the planet will be locked in synchronous rotation with its star \u2014 that is, its rotational period must match its orbital period, so the same side is always facing the star. One side of such a planet would be in perpetual daylight, while the other would be in perpetual night. The climate on such a world would be much different than the climate on Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDim stars also have the disadvantage that their Goldilocks Zones are going to be narrower. There is disagreement as to exactly\u00A0how wide\u00A0the Goldilocks Zone around the sun is \u2014 different models compute widths anywhere from 0.5 A.U. down to 0.02 A.U. \u2014 but however wide the zone actually is, it will be proportionally narrower with a dimmer star (and wider with a brighter star). The star 61 Cygni is about 1/10 of the sun\u0027s brightness, so its Goldilocks Zone will be (the square root of 1/10) of the sun\u0027s, or a little less than 1/3 of the sun\u0027s Goldilocks Zone distance. But this means both the\u00A0inner\u00A0edge and the\u00A0outeredge of the Goldilocks Zone will be 1/3 of the distance compared with the sun \u2014 and that means the zone as a whole will only be 1/3 as wide. The narrower the Goldilocks Zone, the less a chance that a planet would happen to have formed within it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorse, many red dwarf stars \u2014 Wolf 359 included \u2014 are\u00A0flare stars, which emit semi-regular bursts of X-rays every bit as powerful as those emitted from a flare taking place on the sun. At 0.01 A.U., that much ionizing radiation can easily disassemble the organic molecules necessary for life. And X-rays can scatter.\u00A0Regular flare outbursts so close by probably means that any life would have to be buried underground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA planet orbiting Sirius A at 5 A.U. wouldn\u0027t have any of these problems, of course, but it runs into another issue. Sirius is a binary system. Sirius B (a white dwarf) makes one complete orbit around Sirius A every half century, and at one point in this orbit the two stars come within 8 A.U. of each other. As any budding astrophysicist will tell you, the three-body problem is a chaotic one for which there is no solution. Any planet orbiting Sirius A farther away than 1/4 of this 8 A.U. closest-approach distance will be thrown out of the star system by Sirius B\u0027s gravity. The\u00A0farthest\u00A0a stable planetary orbit can be from Sirius A is, therefore, only 2 A.U. \u2014 which is barely 2/5 of the Goldilocks Zone distance. Therefore, no planet can exist in the habitable, liquid water zone around Sirius A. (A planet could theoretically orbit\u00A0both Sirius A and Sirius B as a pair, but then its minimum\u00A0orbital distance has to be at least four times the\u00A0greatest\u00A0separation distance between the two stars in their orbit of each other. Sirius B\u0027s orbit is rather eccentric, and at one point in its orbit it\u0027s over 30 A.U. away from Sirius A. A planet orbiting both Sirius A and B would therefore need to be at least 120 A.U. away from their common center of mass, and at that distance the combined brightness of Sirius A and Sirius B would be far too weak to keep the planet from freezing.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if a planet happens to lie within the Goldilocks Zone, that\u0027s no guarantee that it can harbor surface life \u2014 let alone that life will actually arise there on its own, or that said life will have had sufficient time to evolve to the point where space-faring beings can emerge. The atmospheric pressure must be high enough for liquid water to exist, and that can\u0027t happen unless the planet has sufficiently strong surface gravity to keep its atmosphere from escaping into space.\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EYou\u0027ll note that the Martian atmosphere is extremely thin, less than 1% of the surface pressure of Earth\u0027s atmosphere. One factor that contibutes to Mars\u0027s thin atmosphere is this low surface gravity. Despite being farther\u00A0from the sun than the Earth, and thus receiving\u00A0less\u00A0heat that could potentially boil its atmosphere away into space, Mars still has less of an atmosphere than the Earth does. A resonably strong surface gravity may be\u00A0required\u00A0for a planet to retain a thick atmosphere. There are exceptions in our own solar system, of course: Saturn\u0027s moon Titan has less than a sixth of Earth\u0027s surface gravity yet its surface atmospheric pressure is higher than Earth\u0027s, and while Venus is both closer to the sun\u00A0and\u00A0has only 90% of Earth\u0027s surface gravity its surface pressure is ninety times\u00A0that of Earth\u0027s atmosphere. But you need at least\u00A0some\u00A0gravity, and possibly quite a lot of gravity, to retain an atmosphere within the Goldilocks Zone.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother factor that can mean no life-bearing planets are possible in a given star system is the lack of heavy elements. The Milky Way galaxy is over ten billion years old. When it first formed, it consisted almost entirely of hydrogen and helium; almost no heavier elements (like carbon and the other elements necessary for organic life) existed. Several generations of stars have been born and died since then, and some of the more spectacular star deaths have peppered the interstellar medium with heavy elements synthesized by those stars\u0027 death throes. The sun, for instance, is a third-generation star \u2014 the cloud of gas and dust out of which it formed contained material expelled by a supernova which, in turn, had formed out of an earlier cloud that contained material from an even earlier supernova. This is why there was enough carbon, oxygen, silicon, iron, etc. to form solid, rocky planets and organic molecules. Astrophysicists refer to all elements heavier than helium as \u0022metals\u0022 (even if the element in question is oxygen or neon), and sometimes call a star system\u0027s heavy element abundance its \u0022metallicity.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy contrast, Barnard\u0027s Star (a red dwarf approximately 6 light-years from the sun) formed in the Milky Way\u0027s first wave of star formation. It has almost no heavy elements. If the star itself is metal-poor, that means the cloud out of which it formed was also metal-poor, and therefore any planets that would have formed out of that cloud would be metal-poor as well. There might be some Jupiter-like balls of hydrogen or helium orbiting Barnard\u0027s Star, but there isn\u0027t going to be anything with a solid surface.\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003ESo, to sum up, the requirements for a habitable Earth-like planet are:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The planet must lie within the Goldilocks Zone for its star.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The star cannot be too dim, since this will mean its Goldilocks Zone will be too narrow, any planet in the zone will be in synchronous rotation with the star, and the Goldilocks Zone will lie within the Danger Zone for stellar flares.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. If a binary star system, the companion star cannot come closer to the primary than 4 times the Goldilocks Zone distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. The star system cannot be metal-poor, or (if its metallicity isn\u0027t known) so old that it would have formed when the galactic medium was still metal-poor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. The planet cannot be too small or light, as this will prevent it from retaining an atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that if you\u0027re willing to accept non Earth-like planets, many more possibilities open up. For example, Europa, one of Jupiter\u0027s moons, is thought to contain liquid water despite being nowhere near the Goldilocks zone. A thick or rapidly rotating atmosphere like Venus\u0027s can distribute heat evenly around the planet, thus solving the problem with tidal locking mentioned above. Greenhouse effect atmospheres, tidal heating from a nearby planet, and internal heating from other unknown mechanisms can all lead to potentially habitable conditions in unexpected places. However, these all lead to new problems and obviously won\u0027t resemble Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor that matter, even liquid water might not be necessary. There are theories that life might be possible with alternate biochemistries based on liquid ammonia, methane, or even interstellar gases. Since all we have to go on is observations of Earth, there\u0027s no way to tell for sure if this is actually possible. But the less Earthlike you get, the more problems you have with an actual story involving anything other than\u00A0Aliens. A hypothetical ammonia based organism, for instance, would constantly argue over the thermostat with Earthlings given that ammonia boils at -28F.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want anything more interesting than bacteria to have evolved, another problem arises. The star must have been shining at roughly the same energy output for at least a couple billion years, in order to give time for complex life to have evolved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis last requirement is a real buzzkill, as it eliminates damn near every bright star you can see in Earth\u0027s night sky. Big, bright stars like Sirius A only live for a few hundred million years before they run out of gas. (The candle that burns twice as bright lasts half as long, after all.) Red giant stars like Arcturus had\u00A0a long, stable lifetime as a dimmer star in the past, but will only last for a couple of million years at the red giant stage \u2014 so if they did harbor life bearing planets in the past, those ecosystems were snuffed out when the star expanded to its current red giant state, and any planets in the star\u0027s\u00A0newGoldilocks Zone won\u0027t have long enough for evolution\u00A0to run its course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for our Sun, its core will run outta gas some 5 billion years from now, in the meanwhile, its luminosity will increase slowly as its core contracts to continue fusing the each time more and more scarce hydrogen. That will mean serious\u00A0trouble\u00A0for life on Earth in just around six hundred million years from now onwards. When this happens, the sun will inflate a lot. \u0022But wait!\u0022 I hear you cry. \u0022If the core is no longer providing any radiative pressure to support the sun\u0027s upper layers, why will it\u00A0expand\u00A0instead of shrinking under its own weight?\u0022 I\u0027m glad you asked. When the core fizzles, the layer immediately above the core will collapse down upon it, and in the process this layer will get more and more compressed until it ignites in nuclear fusion itself, forming a hydrogen-burning shell.\u00A0and consume at least some of the inner planets\u2014likely including Earth, causing a solar system level apocalypse. Even if Earth survived, its fate would be to lose whatever water remains and atmosphere, becoming a\u00A0planet covered by a magma ocean\u00A0under the intense light of the huge red giant Sun.\u00A0This inflation will take a time in astronomical terms and will be\u00A0very gradual by human-lifetime standards: computer models of evolution of Sun-like stars suggest the sun will need more than 2 billion years to grow from its end-of-main-sequence normal size to its full red-giant glory. Delta Pavonis, a star extremely similar and very close\u2014about 20 ly\u2014to the Sun is currently going through this phase. It started the process during the time that modern humans have existed\u2014possibly even during recorded history\u2014but only our descendants to the umpteenth generation will get to see the transformation in full. Astronomers have a mild interest in this star, since being the Sun\u0027s \u0022near-identical older brother\u0022\u2014as we put it\u2014its evolution will give hints about what\u0027s to come for old Sol.\u00A0After a couple of million of years in this red giant phase, it will shrink again in just a few thousand years as its core begins fusing helium into carbon and oxygen. Helium ignition is a\u00A0very\u00A0violent\u00A0process, liberating energies comparable to that of a supernova. However, all of that energy is used to re-expand the core and nothing unusual is visible from the outside. The Sun will be then a\u00A0red clump star, roughly fifty times as luminous as is now and eleven times larger, re-expand again\u00A0as red giant (as an\u00A0Asymptotic giant branch, to be more exact) when it runs out of helium at its core 100 million years later, and then finally shed its outer layers in a breathtaking display known as a \u0022planetary nebula.\u0022 So named because such nebulas appear as an extensive disc in a telescope, and can be confused for a planet by an observer who doesn\u0027t know any better.\u00A0What will remain afterward is the tiny, exposed core of the sun, now shrunk to a super-dense\u00A0white dwarf the size of the Earth, slowly cooling to a black dwarf over the next quadrillion years (more than 70 times the current age of the universe). More than a few astronomers and physicists have pointed out that at least by this point, the Sun will be harboring\u00A0one big-ass diamond. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMy prediction is, as the sun expands, the goldilocks zone would be pushed outward, roughly around the orbit of Saturn or Uranus, which could, theoretically make Titan habitable. Mercury and Venus is certainly being totally engulfed. As for gas giants, while the sun\u0027s size expands into red giant, it\u0027s temperature also become lower, so I cannot say for certain if the gas giants will be fully vaporized, but one thing is certain: gas giants WILL change.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EOne of the theory why gas giants is so large is, since outer planets that\u0027s classified as gas giants lies on the outside of goldilocks zone, which is referred as \u0022ice line\u0022. Water and other liquid froze, which causes them to expand in volume, so the planet-building material becomes larger, since it provides more material. So it\u0027s only a matter of guessing what\u0027s gonna happen to the gas giants if the \u0022ice line\u0022 is pushed outward further.
