So I\u0027m assuming the same is true for the Mun. Kerbin casts shadow on spacecraft, obviously, but not on other bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-28T21:34:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne Munar eclipse happens between every solar eclipse. They both happen once every munar month, on approximately opposite sides of the Mun\u0027s orbit. However, as sevenperforce says, Kerbin does not cast a visible shadow. So you can\u0027t see anything special. All you see, if you have a spacecraft at the Mun, is suddenly your EC generation goes to zero -- and you have to spend a few minutes \u00A0each time figuring out why.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
