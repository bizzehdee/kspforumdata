The local 7-11 has officially run dry and all that is left is the fuel stored in the tanks at KSC. Bob has now taken command of the KSC with a bold plan to supply their own fuel through widespread mining operations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Idea\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn optional difficulty setting to start out in sandbox mode with a limited amount of fuel requiring mining and recovering resources to keep your rockets fueled up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Execution\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would need to be an option under the Sandbox difficulties that you could enable to start the game with finite resources. The starting amount would be adjustable depending on the level of difficulty you want. This could range from allowing a Mun/Minmus mission or 2 to only having enough for atmospheric flight with jets. Options for removing ore from under KSC as well as a range around KSC should also be included. Ore and fuels recovered on Kerbin would be added into the tanks at the KSC but would fall under the same recovery rules for parts in career mode so Ore/Fuel recovered from far away will only give you a percentage of it. There would be an ISRU at the KSC to handle on the spot ore refinery. This could run at less efficiency than the actual ISRUs which would make refining the ore into fuel before recovering beneficial in some situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to hear peoples ideas and suggestions for my idea. I only ask that we keep the topic on this idea for sandbox and not on ideas on how to make this work for career mode. The amount of changes that would be needed to make this work in career is enough to warrant a separate thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd in a Class E asteroid aimed for Kerbin with an impact in 5 years, and call it \u0022No way to run, nowhere to hide\u0022.

It feels a little outside the scope of stock KSP though but could make an interesting scenario or mod type of game mode.

You would still have ore on Kerbin. You would use aircraft to mine ore and could return the ore/fuel to KSC or recover from the mining site for a % based on your distance form the KSC. A large cargo plane full of empty ore containers would recover a significant amount of fuel if recovered full of ore. The idea is that it would add a level of difficulty to the sandbox mode for people that wanted to use it. It wouldnt be a mandatory feature of sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
