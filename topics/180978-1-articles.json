It has a suitably thick atmosphere, abundance of natural resources (hydrocarbons and water); and is within close proximity of the resource-rich Saturnian system, which would make it a perfect center of in-system trade, as well as a great refueling outpost for interplanetary spacecraft.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut Titan still isn\u0027t 100% habitable. It\u0027s air, while similar in composition to ours, is still unable to support human life due to a lack of oxygen. Furthermore, it is so cold that no human being could survive outside the habitat without an outfit that could completely enclose their body and keep them warm -- basically a spacesuit without the need for pressurization. So it\u0027s pretty clear that this moon will need terraforming before billions of human colonists can comfortably call it home.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWarming Titan and adding oxygen are comparatively easy -- mirrors or lenses could focus sunlight, surface-built facilities could provide massive amounts of heat via nuclear fusion or the burning of the local hydrocarbons. Oxygen could be added in a myriad of ways -- I can think of a few things; modified lifeforms, artifical factories, etc. The real problem is this: Titan has no land.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, it might seem silly of me to say that it has no land when it clearly does -- until the land melts. Titan\u0027s surface is entirely composed of a multi-kilometer-thick crust of water ice, which encloses a vast Europa-like subsurface ocean. In other words, Titan is a waterworld waiting to happen. The rocky surface beneath the ocean is simply too far down to be accessible, as it\u0027s way beyond the crush depth of any present human-built submarine, even taking into account the lesser gravity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, how are we going to terraform this world? Are we just going to melt the entire moon and live in floating \u0022lillipad\u0022 cities, anchored to the sea-floor? Or will we only warm it up enough to survive, and accept it as an antarctic world? In the distant future perhaps we\u0027ll be able to ship all that water off Titan, exposing the rocky land; but I think that\u0027ll be beyond our abilities for the next few centuries unless we exploit the potential can of worms that is self-replicating semi-autonomous machines.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s a facinating world, ripe with possibility for humanity in the future, and for interesting stories now. What are your ideas?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-30T05:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea but now I want to play HardWar again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.myabandonware.com/game/hardwar-bh8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.myabandonware.com/game/hardwar-bh8\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngrybobH","CreatedById":165814,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-30T05:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbecause of this\u00A0 (from wikipedia)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTitan\u0027s internal \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field\u0022 title=\u0022Magnetic field\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emagnetic field\u003C/a\u003E is negligible, and perhaps even nonexistent.\u003Csup\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Titan#cite_note-Backes2005-25\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[25]\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand the fact that melting all that ice would probably result is the emission of far too many VOCs,\u00A0 Titan looks more like a fuel storage container than something to live on.
