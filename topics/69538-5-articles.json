Thanks for checking out the mod\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, first of course there is the question if a given experiment even interests oneself - sciencealert already implements filters for those, and i like them - especially the minimum science requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other reasons why displaying available experiments takes up a lot of space in sciencelib:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It displays the name, earned points, remaining points, remaining percentage and i think something else - for each experiment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The padding in the columns is quite excessive\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It not only displays available experiments, but also experiments already onboard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this adds up to a lot of space, especially horizontally. Most of the time, to decide if i should execute an experiment, i really am only interested in the kind of experiment (type), and how many points it would earn me. This doesn\u0027t even justify a table... its just two kinds of data after all. So, IMO sciencealert has already taken the efficient approach, and simply use one button per experiment, nothing else. The label of the button could simply be the experiment name, plus in braces the science points it would yield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my \u0022vision\u0022 actually isn\u0027t too different to what sciencealert already does. There are just three tweaks i\u0027d make:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Reduce the fontsize/buttonsize slightly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Show the number of science points on the buttons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Offer a way to keep the buttons visible, and to place the button container somewhere on the screen (not sure if that is already possible - didn\u0027t try doing that earlier today).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, its basically just some aesthetic tweaks, plus an option to keep the buttons visible and update them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Another way to keep experiment spam in check, might be to allow setting a maximum amount of experiments to show, and ordering them by science points.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-14T06:36:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2014 06:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by rynak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
