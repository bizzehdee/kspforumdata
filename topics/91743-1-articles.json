I drop a probe just off the seaside (east) end of the runway (as close as I can get it to the raised runway area without it actually being on that area), then repeat on the landward (west) side. I drive another kilometer west and drop another probe. I drive another four kilometers (i.e. five kilometers from the west end of the runway) and drop the last probe. I drive another five kilometers (ten kilometers from the west end of the runway) and park the rover. I\u0027ll relabel each drop probe and the rover itself as a base, usually with the name \u0022Meatball\u0022 and the distance to the end of the runway. Boom - an ILS system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, you don\u0027t *have* to use drop probes; flags work just as well, though I find they have an annoying tendency to explode/disappear more readily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how to use it - first off, fly with the camera in chase mode. Just hit the \u0022V\u0022 key a couple of times and position the camera right behind your craft (or close enough that you can still see what you\u0027re doing - sometimes the exhaust plume will restrict your visibility). I usually perform entire flights in chase mode; I find it helpful. Provided you didn\u0027t have much in terms of steering problems, the markers you set out should be on a rough straight line along the center of the runway, so what you want to do is line them up roughly mid-screen and keep them aligned as you go on final. That\u0027ll ensure that you stay lined up with the runway properly. For your glide slope, pick a marker. Add the distance of that marker from the end of the runway to your current distance to that marker, multiply that by a hundred and add one hundred - the final result is where you want your current altimeter reading. FOR EXAMPLE: Let\u0027s say you\u0027re 22.4 kilometers from the 10 kilometer marker. You want to be at ((22.4\u002B10)*100)\u002B100 = (34.5*100)\u002B100 = 3450\u002B100 = \u003Cstrong\u003E3550 meters\u003C/strong\u003E. From that you can tell if you\u0027re high or low. Actual altimeter elevation of the KSC runway is about 70 meters, hence the additional 100 meter correction; you could just as easily add 70 meters but I find 100 is easier to deal with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not adverse to mods, you could just install NavUtilities - it\u0027ll give you an ILS with adjustable glideslope settings. It\u0027ll also allow you to select your target runway; even has a setting for the VAB helipads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to the actual landing, just keep your wings level, engage your flaps, and try not to descend too fast (5 m/s downward is generally where you want to max out). Disable the brakes on the nose gear and engage steering; you want to do that in the SPH when you design your plane. Touch down wheels first, kill the engines if you haven\u0027t already and hit the brakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd practice, practice, practice. Landing is something you\u0027ll botch a lot before you finally get it right (just like the way it goes with most of us the first time we go to land on Mun).
