Navbal: Shows what you\u0027re doing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Map view: shows where you are and your current orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Staging/fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(the fourth is the eye candy: Looking at your rocket. But this hardly provides needed info)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEspecially when I\u0027m launching into orbit I pretty much need all three of those and you can not get them together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible solutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. (add to live view): Orbitersim has nice MFD\u0027s with gazillion numbers to check your orbit and also a simple line diagram to visualise the orbit. Do we maybe have something like that in Orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. (JUST swap views, not hud): Can\u0027t you just swap the live view 3d with the map view 3d and retain the hud for the live view?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother question: When you get into funky orbits, isn\u0027t there a 3rd view? The flat map projection (2d)? e.g. these tundra orbits. It\u0027s not easy to see the track of the orbit on the land if you dont have a 2d projection. Maybe I\u0027m wrong, I can\u0027t even achieve those :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(tldr) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after all that braindump: Why dont we have three views:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Live view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Solar system view (map view)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. 2d Map view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then depending on the view, there\u0027s some options of which hud elements you get.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T01:02:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t say that looking at the rocket is just eye candy; it provides me with extremely valuable information such as whether any parts have broken off. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would very much like to see staging and fuel information in map view, though. During the later portions of a launch I\u0027m usually watching map view; it\u0027s a little annoying that I have to keep switching back to main view to check if I need to activate the next stage yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I think mods like SCANsat provide 2D maps of the planet surface showing the satellite\u0027s orbit; it\u0027d be nice if something like that could be integrated into stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T01:34:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can get fuel information in map view: just click the resource pane button, and click \u0022Stage Only\u0022 to just get the fuel in the current stage. The three things you can\u0027t do are look at the rocket/terrain (which I find to be nice for basic spatial orientation; it\u0027s much harder for me to fly just by navball, and obviously landing by navball without a radar altimeter is a bad idea); easily check altitude (you have to hover over the craft, you don\u0027t have the nice display); and actually stage or otherwise activate/deactivate stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
