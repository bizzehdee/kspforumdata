The reason for this is that while fusion is very efficient, currently the only way we know how to make more energy from fusion then we put in is through this type of thermonuclear bomb, thus a fusion primary wouldnt really make sense. Some nukes have a third fusion stage triggered by the second (mostly experimental us nukes and maybe tsar bombas), and these further increase the efficiency greatly yet add a lot of weight (if you want a horrific thing to look into, shoutout to project sundial which would be a 10000 megaton nuke that would be triggered by a 1000 megaton nuke (project Gnomon)).

On the one hand, lots of experiments is very true to life in some ways; part of the goal of space exploration is the furthering of scientific knowledge; I know the ISS always has a ton of experiments running at any time (I recall a video with Chris Hadfield where he said at least 50-100 at any given time, I think), though that something moreso reflected by the research labs. On the other hand, as you said, doing the same handful over and over, just in different places, gets repetitive, not to mention that it doesn\u0027t always make sense to be running the same stuff over and over; something like taking soil samples in lots different biomes makes good and true to life sense but, similar to what was mentioned, taking barometer readings over and over in different orbits over different bodies wouldn\u0027t exactly add a whole lot to scientific knowledge. Then there is stuff like the nebulous \u0027mystery goo\u0027 and \u0027materials study\u0027, whatever those may be (really just an abstraction of a huge number of different things). Plus, on the purely gameplay side, doing stuff like building a biome hopper early on to cheese a crapton of science out of the moons (especially minimus) is, perhaps, not the most compelling gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a bit of contrasting opinion though, I thought there were too few, not too many, experiments in KSP (though I just added more with mods. Of course that would be overkill with how easy it is to unlock everything in stock, but CTT and other accompanying mods give me a reason to need all that sweet, sweet extra science), though perhaps for similar reasons, ie: gathering science feeling the same most of the time. On the other hand, I think you are right about it getting repetitive just cramming the same handful of parts into every vessel; though I do conceded that just going the route of adding a greater variety of experiments does have a cost/benefit there, because if the underlying framework of science gathering remains the same, then adding a greater variety of experiments is just adding dev time to create, model, and write all the text for them, for what amounts to a purely cosmetic benefit, really. So it\u0027s still back to needing changes to the underlying science system and gameplay treadmill for it to mean anything, really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, if was established that the existing science regime needs to be reworked or at least spruced up, then we must ask: what do you replace it with? Even if experiments are pass\u00E9, we need to gather science somehow. The research lab may be more realistic in some ways, but just clicking \u0027start research\u0027 and waiting is even less compelling gameplay. Not to mention that fact that the much greater scope of KSP2 and the accompanying parts and tech involved should mean a \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ebigger tech tree (which I am totally in favor of, by the by; pump that science grind crack right into my veins, baby), which should translate into needing way more science over the course of unlocking it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what then? Do you lower the science cost and instead have monetary and time costs, also? Do you make gameplay elements part of unlocking? For example: getting research from specific experiments, on specific bodies/biomes, to give our scientists enough to make greater discoveries in a related field, or maybe needing a certain number of launches, with certain engines, in order to give our engineers enough data to create bigger/better ones. For colonies, it would make sense that you would need to get to a certain level of size/complexity in order to reach greater tier of new fancy hotness. Etc, etc. Then, if you do something like that, does it then accompany the existing framework, or do you ditch the \u0027science\u0027 currency altogether? That does have of realism advantage, inasmuch as \u0027science\u0027 and \u0027reputation\u0027 as currencies are quantified numbers drawn from nebulous, and totally unquantifiable/subjective concepts, (now, that\u0027s not necessarily a bad thing; functional gameplay always requires some level of simplification and quantification, but it is a little incongruous when you think about it, and certainly invite more interesting replacements, if ones could be found and implemented).

There are a lot of interesting possible solutions. I do personally think the basic structure (find new places, conduct experiments, earn science, spend science on new parts) is not really the problem and Im happy to see them try to fix whats broke rather throw the baby out with the bathwater and come up with, as you say, a completely new system with all the same problems in a different shade of purple. At this point so near release Im sure these decisions are pretty well baked in, but there are some pretty important takeaways (I think) from the many, long discussions we\u0027ve had on this board on the subject.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) \u003Cstrong\u003EGet the Grind Out:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Oh, the grind.

Im psyched to see all the clever and witty things Jim and others have come up with as experiment results readouts, but it\u0027s vitally important to consider when to present these readouts so players can take a minute to enjoy them. Ascents and descents for instance are for most players really important, continuous experiences. You really want to have your hand on the wheel and your eye on the ball, and if the game is creating a critical incentive to take readings \u0022near above\u0022 and \u0022high above\u0022 you definitely don\u0027t want scroll through half a dozen or more experiment results and manually store or discard them, let alone hunt around and right click on individual parts to run things while in flight. Does that mean hotkey everything and store automatically and review only when you decide to transmit? Or is even transmission a more-or-less automatic decision? One way or another you only want to present those experiment results when the vessel is at rest in stable orbit or stationary on the surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMore than that though is eliminating \u003Cstrong\u003Efull-on redundant missions\u003C/strong\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EGrind = repetition\u003C/em\u003E. No more biome hopping to a dozen different visually indistinguishable places, certainly no partial results that require going back to the same place twice. Treat players time as valuable and only call a biome distinct if its really worth taking the time to go experience. I think some of the things Shana Markham mentioned about the iterative back-and-forth with the art department making unique geographies and tying those into the science system are really encouraging. Above all I\u0027d recommend quality over quantity. If Minmus had 3 main biomes and 3 anomaly specific mini-biomes that required some clever landing or rovers to reach I\u0027d call that about right.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) \u003Cstrong\u003EUseful information:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThis is much more obvious with things like resource scanning than it is with most of the experiments we\u0027re used to, but some mods like SCANsat have managed to tap into some experiments for biome mapping, altimetry, and anomaly detection that are way, way more compelling than anything stock. You could imagine a scenario where barometer scans unlock the ability to predict reentry factoring drag, and thermometers let you see heat bars and manage radiator usage, and EM booms let you know about dangerous radiation environments.

Probably because I never did it, cuz, like you said, it\u0027s awful and shouldn\u0027t be part of the game. And yeah, I always did feel a little weird sending someone out to get a EVA report in the upper atmosphere; yes, it\u0027s true that you can have an orbit where you just dip down and skim through the top, but it\u0027s still...disconcerting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thought would be to have biome\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecatego\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eries\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0as a scientific meta level above the specific ones, ie: could still have lesser/greater/great/etc flats on Minimus, which could be nice for locating things and for resource searching, but the meta-category would be \u0027flats\u0027, which would all be the same for science porpoises. It would allow them to actually \u003Cem\u003Eincrease \u003C/em\u003Ethe number of\u00A0biomes, for flavor and geolocation, but \u003Cem\u003Eat the same time\u003C/em\u003E also decrease the number of places you need to gather science. And of course, little specialty locations is a nice idea. Makes exploring fun and lets it be rewarding without just being a long-ass checklist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do think it could be cool for there to be same variation in what different conditions matter for different experiment, like the example of only being able to get science from a barometer reading in space one time ever, full stop. Though I do see an obvious danger there: even if it was cool and added realism, if there is too much variety, the inconsistency could easily turn into a time wasting hassle as far as keeping track of what works where, and then we are back to what you said about not respecting the player\u0027s time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRE: useful information. YES! There is a lot of good ground to be had there. There are some things in KSP that involve either a little TOO much trial and error, or just a straight up web search, that could be integrated. For example: first time sending a craft to land on Eve and wondering about parachutes? Right now: close your eye and guess or google it. But it would be so much better if instead you could send a satellite with equipment to do gravity and atmosphere analysis, maybe also have instruments that you could put on a suicide probe into the atmosphere to get useful telemetry with. Once you do that, now you can get information in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to help you. Perhaps stuff like safe deployment speeds and then like; at minimum have it show how low your final speed will be with parachutes fully deployed. Just one possibility, but there is some really interesting space there to take useful outside information people might look for, and make it diegetic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was just spitballing, but I did like the thought I had about having some scientific/engineering advancement from actual gameplay choices. Now, there certainly are potential problems if you tied it to full on node unlocking: the last thing you would want is for a player to lag behind on/be locked out of techs they want because unlocking them requires types of gameplay that they don\u0027t enjoy, but if it was just little bonuses even, that could be fun. They couldn\u0027t be unbalancing, and it would be best to have the requirements be secret and at least somewhat procedural (so you can\u0027t just look up a guidelist on the internet), but it could add neat little unexpected, occasional rewards. Say...maybe you like doing insanely fast re-entries, so after some of those, your team might figure out a way to make your heat shields a little stronger or have more ablative capacity. Or you \u003Cem\u003Ereally \u003C/em\u003Elike to use one specific engine, it might get some performance enhancements, or get an alternate version that can use a different fuel type. Stuff like alternative looks/clustered versions, etc, would be cool in brainstorm land, but not really not a good use of finite dev time in reality, but the other stuff doesn\u0027t seem like it would be too terribly difficult/time consuming to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike you said, though, at this stage in development, the science system/treadmill is probably fully ironed out and implemented, and just being worked on at the level of tuning and tweaking. I am definitely glad to hear that the signs you have been seeing are promising. Hopefully we get something that fixes the issues with the current system, and is fun and compelling (I\u0027d enjoy a few surprises, too)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-03T18:31:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EIf you ever want to moonlight, have so much\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elorem ipsum\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0flavor text!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
