I wanted to design a space plane for space missions on other planets (or moons). But since I wanted to have a spaceplane good for any conditions I designed it to be orbit capable, it was so much harder to make but more rewarding since I can actually use it to get back to kerbin from any planet. As the name suggests it has a nuclear engine on it, allowing for much longer distances to be covered in space. The nuclear engine made it way harder to design because of the weight (I had many failures). I finally came up with a design including all the stuff I would need for space missions and being SSTO as a bonus. The decoupler and parachutes at the front are only in emergencies (the thing spinning out of control at 400m from the ground).

I am now going to strap it to a rocket and see if I can get it to another planet (and back hopefully). For those wondering, the nuclear engine can take the fuel from the aerospikes. So it could actually cover quite a long distance. \n\nEdit: for some reason the delta wings on the side are not placed properly, they are supposed to be at an angle. I will redo the pictures and add one of the nisp orbiting the mun\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-01T05:07:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2012 05:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by kepicness**"},{"CreatedByName":"Suzaku","CreatedById":40800,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T01:04:20Z","Content":"So I got a 11.2 Ton SSTO into orbit.

Maverick has avian lines reminiscent of your White Raven craft, though it is a lot smaller and yet has a large 3 Kerbal cockpit integrated which reminds me a little of the tadpole look of the U.F.O. series [SHADO moon shuttle](http://www.cloudster.com/Sets\u0026Vehicles/UFO_MoonShuttle/ShadoMoonShuttleTop.htm) craft. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nkepicness, thanks for entering your spaceplane into the K Prize challenge and well done on integrating the NERVA engine into it. That is a tricky engine which doubles the dv value of any fuel it can use in space but halves it below about 3000m on Kerbin and weighs 2.25 tons, as much as a full 400L tank, these are the difficulties you overcame. In theory it could be the key to raising the range of spaceplanes in v17. I note with interest that you placed the engine quite far forwards in the craft which must have helped with controlling the ship by shifting the center of mass forwards when the tanks were empty. So thanks for a groundbreaking mission which all can benefit from and congratulations on winning the K-Prize.\n\nSuzaku, they keep getting smaller! You have taken the tanks down to 3x400L, which is the minimum for a no frills aerospike rocket to orbit and lifted an additional pair of turbofan engines and wings, good going!

Although I think I\u0027m a little behind seen as though some of you getting to other planets. Anyway, the Orbiter Mk III (there are no prizes for original names) is the most stable/largest craft I\u0027ve built and easily the best looking in my fleet so far.![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif) Has a slight list to the left when flying (cause unknown) and has a tendency to lose two of it engines on takeoff (a very shallow take-off angle required). It also isn\u0027t perfectly balanced so when using the aerospikes in orbit the nose drifts up a little. I put it in an orbit of around 95km and 77km although it can go higher with around a quarter of fuel left for each engine. Did several orbits waiting for s solar eclipse to occur. I re-entered a tad early on this flight and was left with 70km to go to the runway at 7000m with no fuel, which it happily made with a little to spare. No idea if that\u0027s a good glide ratio for KSP but I was pleased (even if it did take something like 20 minutes). \n\nOrbit\n\n![screenshot38.png](http://i811.photobucket.com/albums/zz35/MrMurphe/KSP/screenshot38.png)\n\n![screenshot31.png](http://i811.photobucket.com/albums/zz35/MrMurphe/KSP/screenshot31.png)\n\n![screenshot39.png](http://i811.photobucket.com/albums/zz35/MrMurphe/KSP/screenshot39.png)\n\nThis game is beautiful\n\n![screenshot30.png](http://i811.photobucket.com/albums/zz35/MrMurphe/KSP/screenshot30.png)\n\nSolar Eclipse\n\n![screenshot37.png](http://i811.photobucket.com/albums/zz35/MrMurphe/KSP/screenshot37.png)\n\nRe-entry to KSC\n\n![screenshot40.png](http://i811.photobucket.com/albums/zz35/MrMurphe/KSP/screenshot40.png)\n\nLanded\n\n![screenshot42.png](http://i811.photobucket.com/albums/zz35/MrMurphe/KSP/screenshot42.png)\n\nPublicity Shot\n\n![screenshot41.png](http://i811.photobucket.com/albums/zz35/MrMurphe/KSP/screenshot41.png)\n\nSorry not sure how to hide the images like others have done.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-03T12:46:19Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2012 12:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by RadiationKing**"},{"CreatedByName":"Moltove","CreatedById":33359,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T11:29:34Z","Content":"Are u allowed to rotate parts so the plane takes off vertically?"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T11:56:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are u allowed to rotate parts so the plane takes off vertically?\n\n[Yes you can](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=279234#post279234)"},{"CreatedByName":"Suzaku","CreatedById":40800,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T12:34:56Z","Content":"I tried to land my spaceplane on Jool, but failed miserably... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T12:57:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are u allowed to rotate parts so the plane takes off vertically?\n\nThe thrust can be vertical but the plane does need to show/be capable of some horizontal motion during takeoff. Something like a VTOL thrust vectoring aeroplane that could take off while rolling as well as stationary has been allowed and you can angle the landing gear to make your wings point upwards on the runway but I don\u0027t think a pure rocket-style launch that only works when stationary would be allowed."},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T18:51:20Z","Content":"The take off has to start with horizontal movement, any distance, after that you go where you want.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Rules\n\u003E 1.
