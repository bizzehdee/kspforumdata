I actually use two/three stages up before even attaining orbit. The first has aerospike, and the second uses normal liquid engines, and the orbiter uses aerospike again.\n\nBasically, that\\\u0027s just due to how I build my rockets; the aerospike won\\\u0027t allow anything attached below it.\n\nAh well. My adapted Mun lander can make it to Minmus as well ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Knyght","CreatedById":22035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T18:56:42Z","Content":"What annoys me about the aerospike is that you can\\\u0027t stack things under it (fair enough I suppose) but more annoyingly they sometimes refuse to connect to my tri-coupled fuel tanks fairly randomly."},{"CreatedByName":"Vampereon","CreatedById":6134,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T20:01:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Those other tanks must not be connected to the engines, use the fuel lines to connect them to the tanks or nacelles before the engine.\n\ntried that, it worked well thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T06:04:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What annoys me about the aerospike is that you can\\\u0027t stack things under it (fair enough I suppose) but more annoyingly they sometimes refuse to connect to my tri-coupled fuel tanks fairly randomly.\n\nThey sometimes refuse to connect to a single fuel tank. I think I remember seeing words on this getting looked at, so in the meantime I would recommend that if you are using multiple copies of jet-spiked engine stages, get the connection done then just copy that to the modules you are assembling. Alt-clicking a part or module creates a copy. It should help save you some frustration."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T18:57:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ... it stops working after burning one or two fuel tanks...\n\nJust yesterday, I had a similar issue with my new space plane. The engine ran out of fuel while there were still two full tanks. I think this is due to the way I had connected the tanks together. It is possible that, during editing, one of the connections was changed to sideways when I intended it to be end-to-end.\n\nIn other words, tanks can be welded together side-by-side, but fuel won\\\u0027t flow that way. If you then connect more side-by-side tanks below them, only one connection gets made and the others become useless cargo."}]}
