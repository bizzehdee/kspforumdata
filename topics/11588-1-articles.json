I think I remember seeing words on this getting looked at, so in the meantime I would recommend that if you are using multiple copies of jet-spiked engine stages, get the connection done then just copy that to the modules you are assembling.

The engine ran out of fuel while there were still two full tanks. I think this is due to the way I had connected the tanks together. It is possible that, during editing, one of the connections was changed to sideways when I intended it to be end-to-end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, tanks can be welded together side-by-side, but fuel won\\\u0027t flow that way.
