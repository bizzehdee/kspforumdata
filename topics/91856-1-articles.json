It is best to envision this with a structural panel on a fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is when a part is flipped, the editor un-clips it from the part being placed upon and (upon click) attaches it to the side. For example, pressing [W] twice with the square panel makes it so that it is (almost) 100% clipped inside the part you are placing it upon. This idea, if ever implemented, would \u0027move\u0027 the part so that it would not be clipping, and (in the case, because the panel is symmetrical) you would end up with the same thing that you would get it you just placed the panel on the part without flipping it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry If this makes no sense; it is kinda hard to explain with words.
