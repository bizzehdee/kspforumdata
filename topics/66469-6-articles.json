There will be one node available and you can attach it to the node for the LEM decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a small connect node in the middle of the Ascent Module that corresponds with the node on the SLA. I\u0027d seen a node placed right below the engine of the SM, but when the docking port was attached to that node...selecting it as a target is impossible when you go to dock with it. I suppose I could have a node to decouple the engine, but then that node gets really close to nodes used to attach the SLA/decoupler/Instrument Unit...Since all the parts of the LEM are hidden to FAR with the fairing, nodes can be placed darn near anywhere to connect items, I haven\u0027t had any stability issues either, visual or otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T18:45:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I think I got it this time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I had to use part clipping to get it to attach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oFIj7uj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oFIj7uj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the fuel tanks hold no fuel and I can\u0027t fuel them up either in the Action Groups (for the Saturn parts).
