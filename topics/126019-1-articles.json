All stationary objects I have landed anywhere did stay put in their places; the problem arises when I start moving. The chances of sinking through the ground also increase with surface velocity, if moving fast then not a long time goes by before I go through the ground.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is a major issue for my carreer space program, for which I had designed several Moon modules that would comprise my Lunar base and that were to be picked up by my Lunar Truck from their landing sites (2 to 10km apart) and brought back together to the intended base\u0026#39;s location in the Lunar seas :(\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-23T21:39:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2015 09:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pvnkb1tch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbonautInTraining","CreatedById":145373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T01:55:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing I can think of is to widen the wheel base, maybe have two wheels in front of each other at each corner.
