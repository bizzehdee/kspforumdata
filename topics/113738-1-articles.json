You can now download it from Steam, GOG and our website.\n\nThis update focuses on bug fixes and balance settings, including a few small tweaks that were made to the aerodynamic \u0026 heating simulation models. We took some time to evaluate these changes and we\u2019re very happy with the result, but they can mean that designs that worked previously need some changes to continue working correctly.\n\nIn addition to the tweaks and rebalancing, this update contains five new radiator parts to help cool your spacecraft.\n\nKerbal Space Program v1.0.3 is part of our commitment to keep developing KSP even after release. We also continue to work on KSP 1.1 which will feature an update to Unity 5 and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll share more on that as information becomes available in the future.\n\nYou can review the full list of changes **[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/346](\u003Ca%20href=)\u0022\u003Ehere**."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T20:26:25Z","Content":"WOW !

Or stock gamesaves?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E After a quick play, it seems like 1.03 gives us way less drag, but a much less forgiving reentry. I did a missile test with an early career mode design, and couldn\u0027t recover it. First try it reentered too steep and blew up. Second time I managed a shallower reentry and it survived, but it was going too fast when it reached the surface and the parachute was destroyed when I tried to deply it.\n\u003E I like those changes! Looks like we\u0027re going to take those heatshields more seriously now!\n\nI love hearing this ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T21:31:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 09:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OddFunction**"}]}
