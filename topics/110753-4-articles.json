A full two-meter engine pod would add some fun end-game toys for us space-plane builders.\n\nAlso, propellers would be a fantastic early to mid-game tool. It seems kind of weird to me that a plane built in early career games can easily break the sound barrier. With propellers being introduced before the basic jet, that wouldn\u0027t be so much of a problem. More realistic progression, more fun parts to play with. Also, imagine its applications on oxygen-less worlds. I remember wanting to build a mobile Eve science station, flying low and slow, milking all the science Eve has to offer.

The game feels a lot more complete between the new aero, the new parts, re-entry heat, etc. Granted, I am also in the club where I wouldn\u0027t mind if re-entry heat were turned up a little, so that on normal difficulty you had to actually worry about it a little (IE needing heat shields, at least for \u0022beyond Kerbal\u0022 re-entry type velocities). At higher difficulty settings you should need to worry about re-entry angle, not just if you have a heat shield or not.\n\nAll of that said, two things I am hoping for eventually are multiplayer.
