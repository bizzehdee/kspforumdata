So you can, for instance, mount an RTG and a high gain antenna on a probe core, stick it in a fairing and then in orbit, you can extend out the RTG and high gain away from the probe core. Or you can mount stuff in a plane/shuttle bay or equipment bay and then either use a grasper arm or accordian part to extend it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am VERY much looking forward to SQUAD doing the Unity 5 transition as well as the full audio pass. Maybe more than any other thing. So far I am LOVING 1.02. The game feels a lot more complete between the new aero, the new parts, re-entry heat, etc. Granted, I am also in the club where I wouldn\u0027t mind if re-entry heat were turned up a little, so that on normal difficulty you had to actually worry about it a little (IE needing heat shields, at least for \u0022beyond Kerbal\u0022 re-entry type velocities). At higher difficulty settings you should need to worry about re-entry angle, not just if you have a heat shield or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that said, two things I am hoping for eventually are multiplayer. That and hopefully either a release focused on \u0022moar parts\u0022 or continuing the awesome itterating of parts. Both low level, mid level and high level parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the other things I\u0027ve noticed is that there could be some more rover parts. Maybe a \u0022capsule\u0022 or two that are dedicated rover capsules (A la, \u0022Mars rover\u0022 type stuff). Maybe a scientific instrument so that probes can take soil samples as a very high level part.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T13:00:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 01:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lazarus1024\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T12:59:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, consider Pathea\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://planetexplorers.pathea.net/about/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPlanet Explorers\u003C/a\u003E.
