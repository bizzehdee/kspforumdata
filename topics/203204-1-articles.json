It has something in common with KSP: it doesn\u0027t dumb things down very much. Newbies can easily get stuck and it\u0027s easy to find very hard challenges. I remember one time, a guy who\u0027d played Railroad Tycoon avidly from version 1 to version\u00A0 10 (how many years is that?) came on TT-Forums looking for help because his train network wasn\u0027t working. He\u0027d got his trains into a mild form of deadlock - something natural to train networks. It was a thing every Transport Tycoon newbie quickly learned to deal with, but... well, Railroad Tycoon wasn\u0027t that real, Transport Tycoon was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn those days modding wasn\u0027t really accepted by game publishers, but nonetheless a \u003Cs\u003Emodding\u003C/s\u003E \u003Cem\u003Epatching\u003C/em\u003E community got going and \u0022TTDPatch\u0022 got a large number of improvements and extensions. TTDPatch was very much alive 10 years after the release of Transport Tycoon Deluxe or 12 years after the original Transport Tycoon - many years after the publishers had stopped selling the game. In those days, games didn\u0027t really get updated. They were released, maybe had a few variants, and if they did well, maybe sequels. Transport Tycoon had 3 or 4 versions which were more art changes than program updates. Deluxe has some extra train signals over the original and some different terrain generators; that\u0027s about it for code changes. So I guess its last release was probably about 1996, but TTDpatch was still going strong in 2004.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy 2004, another fan project was ready for prime time: OpenTTD. With all new code, OpenTTD is a clone of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, a faithful reproduction but not bound by the same licenses. Until about 2005 or so, you had to have the original graphics data to play it, but as the coders matured they got uncomfortable with that. They started a project to get open source graphics; compatible but looking a little different. Some of the many \u0022NewGRF\u0022 artists were willing to contribute, so OpenTTD was soon able to include a complete set of open-source graphics. It\u0027s still going strong; you can today play Transport Tycoon Deluxe much like it was originally (but with \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E better pathfinding), or with almost all the extensions from TTDPatch and many more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, fans of a complicated, technical game had the technical skill to make sure it survived and to make it better than the original. It\u0027s still going strong today. I\u0027m almost certain the same will happen to KSP 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor reference of the sort of activity level I mean by \u0022still going strong\u0022, here are links to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.openttd.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOpenTTD\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s news page and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.tt-forums.net/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETT-Forums\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-30T19:20:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2021 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by eekee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
