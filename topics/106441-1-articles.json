I had EVA\u0027d on this save earlier, but this was the first time i had done so while EVA\u0027ing by clicking on the pod and hitting EVA instead of from the lower right corner. I reverted the flight but Kerbin is completely gone, even from the main KSC screen as can be in the screenshot. I have linked a folder with the Save, KSP.log and screenshot of KSC showing just space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-cZkGvXdzz0YzdDemVFNVl3M2M\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-cZkGvXdzz0YzdDemVFNVl3M2M\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERestarting KSP has fixed the problem\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
