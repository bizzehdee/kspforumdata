I had EVA\u0027d on this save earlier, but this was the first time i had done so while EVA\u0027ing by clicking on the pod and hitting EVA instead of from the lower right corner. I reverted the flight but Kerbin is completely gone, even from the main KSC screen as can be in the screenshot. I have linked a folder with the Save, KSP.log and screenshot of KSC showing just space.\n\n[https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-cZkGvXdzz0YzdDemVFNVl3M2M\u0026usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-cZkGvXdzz0YzdDemVFNVl3M2M\u0026usp=sharing)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nRestarting KSP has fixed the problem"}]}
