Complete with huge motherships, landers, heroic docking and maybe rovers. However, misunderstandings, misprocurements and misdesigns quickly snowballed, and, as of this moment, astronauts are boarding a single stage monster which is... still supposed to complete the Jool-5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimulations (hyperedit) show it should be possible, but the safety margins are very narrow. So the engineering department decided to document the trip just to have evidence in future strategy meetings what happens when the interns are reviewing the designs, and nobody knows who made them in the first place. Bob is saying he saw the KSC cat spend way too much time at the location, but nothing could be conclusively proven.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The mission will probably be presented mainly as a series of accelerated videos, I\u0027m still trying to figure out how to present everything nicely.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an introduction, we are presenting our craft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EParental advisory:\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cem\u003Eminor clipping, engines firing from within a cargo bay, floating parts\u003C/em\u003E (I realize these might disqualify me from the formal challenge, but, eh, this is too much fun not to try it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E, the only clipping I\u0027m aware of, though, is the partially clipped in landing gear, and the slight clipping of the rapier engines. It \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E done for the purpose of nicely fitting into a cargo bay however.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe weighs 60 tonnes dry, 127 fully loaded. The launch weight is 111 tonnes, because getting through the Mach barrier has proven challenging with her fully laden. She has an integrated ISRU system, magnetically suspended nacelles which double as vertical landing gear, 6 rapiers, one nuke, a nose lift system and 8 big wings which make her look a bit like a centipede.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun fact - she is made from exactly 100 parts (because I forgot the probe core). 20 of these parts are the monoprop nose lift system, 19 are SAS units. 36% of her launch cost comes from the 4 RTGs which power her. Those RTGs are the only thing providing electricity, except for the nuke engine when it\u0027s firing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods: I use MechJeb heavily, however it should not affect the viability of the craft, just compensate a bit for my piloting. I also have Hyperedit installed, which was used for testing but not the actual mission, and Throttle Controlled Avionics, which I am not expecting to use, but, well, the option is there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of this posting, I have successfully reached Minmus, so no guarantees how it will turn out.
