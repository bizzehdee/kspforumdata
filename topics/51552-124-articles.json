A single relay will never have an unbroken line of sight to your target. As soon as you start putting up multiple relays, they need to be able to exchange information with each other. If they\u0027re too far apart for omni antennas, that leaves dishes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. (This one new players forget pretty often) Active vessel is only useful if you\u0027re trying to get a direct connection to the specific satellite you\u0027re controlling. If, say, you have a relay sat around the Mun, or a mothership that\u0027s supposed to act as a relay for a shorter-range ship, you need to have a dish pointed at the Mun if you want the relay connection to last while you\u0027re controlling something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the minimum, you\u0027re going to need a dish for every celestial body that has (or will have) its own comm network, or the two planets\u0027 networks won\u0027t link up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-11T22:25:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2014 10:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starstrider42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arrowmaster","CreatedById":57556,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T22:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BigD145\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BigD145\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, a calculator or pencil and paper.
