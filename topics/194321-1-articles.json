As far as the old tutorials - They may still be valid - I haven\u0027t heard of any changes to that system - not to say there haven\u0027t been any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cukkoo","CreatedById":204373,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-08T04:29:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to export the particle then\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-09T03:15:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve haven\u0027t played with this much (very little in fact) and didn\u0027t get anything I was happy with - so take with a large grain of salt. I made two empties in blender - a top level and an emitter point with the emitter empty as a child of the top level empty. I exported from Blender and into Unity where I added PartTools to the top level empty and a Particle System to the emitter empty. I then added a material to the particle system and used the partTools \u0022Write\u0022 button to make my .mu file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cukkoo","CreatedById":204373,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-17T07:10:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t export it due to part tool somehow doesn\u0027t create the texture file\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
