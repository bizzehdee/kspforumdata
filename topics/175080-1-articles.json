Could we have a more in-depth and by extension difficult\u00A0airship mod? Make it so in order to gain buoyancy you have to expend compressed hydrogen or safer-but-less-effective\u00A0helium or use E/C or fuel to heat up the gas (as well as dropping ballast). And to lose buoyancy you would have to re-compress (if that\u0027s even possible), vent, or allow the gases to cool. Make players budget their use of these resources. In addition, in oxygenated atmospheres give hydrogen a small chance to combust on vent, especially if headed or if the part if damaged. Before the death of airpark it was far too easy to set up mining bases in gas giant, and still is too easy to\u00A0have balloons ferry you around Kerbin and Eve for almost no cost (other than your own patience). I think adding engineering difficulty by resource balance is usually\u00A0a good thing, I don\u0027t think a mod like this would be difficult to understand but still stop players from getting free movement. It honestly just feels cheaty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of airpark, the current people (or is it person now?) working on airpark continued are rather busy with having lives and stuff and if somebody would be willing to lend a hand in bringing it closer to ready would make my Jool mining station (whom is now filled with dead kerbals) eternally grateful.
