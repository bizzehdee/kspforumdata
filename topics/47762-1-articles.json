I had an orbit oh 40 by 100 and should have come in contact whit the atmosphere and yet it just kept spinning around and around. This is more of a bug report but could also be useful for mod users such as the kethane mod. The kethane mod has a drill that drills for kethane however you have to stay on the mission and wait until it is finished if you were to leave the mission it wont drill while you are doing something else. radar mods don\u0027t work and it is quite a pain to do this hopefully someone agrees with me thanks for the read \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAquired","CreatedById":83672,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T21:40:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I am aware, the reason for this not being feasible is due to the way Squad has designed the game to keep it from lagging. When an object has your focus, then all the physics will be calculated on that object, however, all the other objects, far away and near, will be on what Squad calls \u0022Rails\u0022. This means the game jsut moves the object along, where it calculates it should be based on the last orbit trajectory it had. If every single object, near and far had to be having physics calculations being applied constantly to them, then things would turn ugly fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be so much lag no computer could hope to try run it. (Especially with Unity\u0027s current limitation of only using 1 core of the CPU).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously a perfectly simulated universe would be best, but Squad has done very well to make it as close as possible, while still keeping the game fun and playable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that makes sense, I\u0027m pretty tired right now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldfang35","CreatedById":81711,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T21:59:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI understand that there are a lot of lag reasons in KSP. but like they did with the terrain they had a turn on turn off option.
