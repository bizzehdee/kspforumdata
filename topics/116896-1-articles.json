This video has 2 version of a Viper Mk.2 replica from Battlestar Galactica, one of my favorite shows! ther\u0027es a simple version and a complex version (more accurate), both made with stock parts. They both also function as SSTO\u0027s, though they don\u0027t end up in oribit with very much deltaV left over. These probably couldn\u0027t make it to the Mun without refuel, but flying to a space station in LKO and back to the runway is possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you enjoy!:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/LHheEVTW_Qk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a thread earlier with \u0022shorts\u0022 where I build something, but this one isn\u0027t exactly short at 14 minutes. to be fair the actual flying ends at 9:00, and the vid ends around 12:00 after i explain how i used the advanced building tools. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you think and if you want to see me make anything else!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rufledt","CreatedById":115067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T05:23:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got votes for an X-wing and a Starfury from Babylon 5, anyone else have a suggestion for what i should try next? i\u0027m trying to make them functional in-game and not just models, preferably with stock parts only.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
