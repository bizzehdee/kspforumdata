You press a button to lock the throttle on the center main engine so you can adjust the four outer engines without effecting the main engine\u0027s output.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if someone suggested this earlier or not, but I figured I\u0027d post it anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, also this is my first post.

Or, say, your rocket has a mainsail and some lv-30 engines which are more efficient, and at takeoff you\u0027ll want every Nm you can get but approaching terminal velocity it would make sense to throttle back just the lower isp mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this gets implemented eventually, it should be a basic feature afterall.
