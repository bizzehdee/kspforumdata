something like 55 knots and cruises somewhere near 120, you want to design your low speed performance so that you have controllable, steady level flight down to about 120 knots.\u00A0 The C-130 clones I build for ferry missions can maintain control authority in the pitch moment (Jargon for: I can move the nose with aft stick input) down to about 115 knots.\u00A0 Below that, I end up pulling the stick all the way aft and the nose will keep dropping anyway.\u00A0 Mind you, the C-130 design scheme is one of the single most robust low speed performance designs in existence (The design is older than most of our parents).\u00A0 Copying the design might be a good place to start to get a feel for what GOOD low speed, short, rough field capability is

problem is with your vehicle\u00A0design.\u00A0 If you aren\u0027t on an ascent by 3/4 the length of the runway, you\u0027re overweight.\u00A0 If you can\u0027t get it in the air in that distance, you\u0027re going to fight just to climb, and you\u0027re going to fight to land.\u00A0 It\u0027s very important to remember that you don\u0027t design the universe to accommodate your

surface in the entire system.\u00A0 In real life, we build nice finished airports everywhere, but even then they have to reasonably submit to the realities of the location.\u00A0 St. Marten has a glide slop so shallow that beach goers on the end of the runway run the risk of surprise haircut by 747.\u00A0 Telluride is over 9000 feet above sea level on the side of a mountain.\u00A0 Try landing while going something like 25% faster than normal, being buffeted by mountain winds, and aware the whole time that on one side is rock, the other a sharp drop.\u00A0 An Aircraft carrier is both built specifically to assist launching and trapping planes, AND the planes are built specifically to land on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncidentally, the side-veering is a result of too much weight on your gear.\u00A0 When overloaded in KSP, landing gear tend to result in an unnoticed lean to one side (usually left) that causes slight bank and drag forces, pulling your nose off center.\u00A0\u00A0 One thing you may not notice is that if your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is too far forward, your attempt to rotate makes this problem WORSE.\u00A0 Instead of rotating like a see-saw on its pivot, the act of applying your pitch back on the stick pushes the tail down, compressing the landing gear further and making the overload affect worse.\u00A0 As a point to make about piloting technique itself, don\u0027t pull back on the stick until you reach takeoff speed.\u00A0 Doing so early deflects air and makes it harder for engines to speed you up, lengthening your takeoff roll even further.\u00A0 Depending on the design, this also results in a partial rotation before takeoff that raises your nose gear off the ground, leaving you to steer with only rudder authority that is not yet sufficient to control the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember, a properly designed airplane almost flies itself.\u00A0 If you have to WORK to maintain control of the aircraft at any point, the design has serious problems.\u00A0 Modern high performance aircraft being the exception thanks to advanced Fly-by-wire avionics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-24T22:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

However, if you need very high-speeds to take-off, something is off about the design, IMHO.

Unless you\u0027re doing something mildly exotic, most functional/practical designs should be able to take-off before reaching and flinging themselves off the end of the runway, thereby avoiding the lights. It\u0027s true enough in reality (for whatever good this reference is) as real runways can have far more elaborate lighting systems. (Especially at commercial airports that handle large airliners.) As an example, KerbinSide adds feature to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and makes the runway more like a commercial runway with landing lights on the west end of the runway (Runway 09). They were kind enough to not replicate it on the east end (Runway 27), or else some players would be VERY liquided \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the way I see it: If my design requires the ENTIRE runway to liftoff, risking a light strike,\u00A0it needs work. (I already know it would need work if it\u0027s swerving a bit on roll-out.)
