I have to switch back to the vehicle with the command chair, and click on the \u0027leave seat\u0027 button. Usually, the kerbal stands up alright, but sometimes he\u0027ll clip into something and fly into the air. On other occasions, usually when Haystack is used to switch, the kerbal I switch to will be unresponsive, and I have to go into the trackign station and back to regain control.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny fix for this?
