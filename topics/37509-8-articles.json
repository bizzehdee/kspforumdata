Equivalent airspeed is uncorrected for altitude and mach, and so it will always be lower than TAS. The EAS/TAS button toggles between the two modes.

You see, the problem with something like folder \u0022hints\u0022 is that it gets tricky to decide if the folder should be added once the toolbar loads up or not. Like, is this the first time the hinting plugin is run? Or is this a subsequent run, but the user has decided to keep the folder? What do we do if the user throws the folder away (moving all buttons into the main toolbar), then restarts KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way things are right now is rather simple: Plugins add their buttons, and they usually go into the main toolbar. Then, if the user decides to add folders and put buttons into them, that information is saved, and can be used for subsequent toolbar plugin runs. There just is nothing a third-party plugin can do to override which buttons go into which folders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Just a quick note here, I\u0027m not watching this thread on a regular basis, so I might be missing suggestions like this.

If you could, open up your KSP_Data/Output_log.txt. Preferably after you just start the game, enter the flight scene, and then exit (so the log is smaller). Then do a search for \u0022exc,\u0022 and see if there are any exceptions that mention SteamGauges.

To unlock the gauges themselves, click on the basic steamgauges icon (the furthest right one in the image above). This will open one of two windows, but towards the bottom both will have a selection called \u0022Lock Gauge Positions.\u0022 If the green light is off, you should be able to move the gauges around.
