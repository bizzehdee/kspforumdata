And I did those in in 0.90. This is my first plane landing in 1.0.0 without parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s start. We leave off in a space program in a science save with 0 science and 1 Jeb stranded on Minmus from a half-sucessful landing attempt. I am not good enough at the game to be able to construct a rocket capable of landing \u003Cem\u003Eand returning \u003C/em\u003Ewith my limited tech. So what do I do? I bring out my science plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy science plane is named Airplane 2 (which is not a nod to Airplane (the movie)) (and also because the first one I built had an outdated cockpit), and man is it awesome. It is meant to biome hop on Kerbin and... that\u0027s it. I had used it for one more mission before this (and tried another but it took too long), but it was headed for the mountains. Destroyed? I would have never flown the mission if the answer was not no. Parachuted down? Yes, unfortunately. But this... this mission was going to land normally. Kod help us all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pilot of the plane is Bill Kerman. It is sitting on the runway, barely moving. I know the space program depends on this mission, so I am tense. This same feeling gets me to activate the standard stock jet engine on the back of the plane. It hums, coming to life; andddddd WE\u0027RE OFF! The plane lifts itself up into the air as gracefully as a dove, and flips over 180 degrees slowly, again with grace. I am heading for the desert on the west cost of Kafria (the continent where the KSC is located) to hopefully get some untouched science. Now I am allowed to not tell the part in between the takeoff and encountering \u003Cem\u003Ethose\u003C/em\u003E mountains because nothing of interest happens in between, so yeah. Bill\u0027s plane comes across the mountains blocking his path; and instead of just going above everything, he was gonna fly through a low section of the mountain like a boss. Skip another boring part of the story. My heart is racing as I turn the plane, getting closer and closer to the sea. It makes it out ok and I am relived. However, the worst part is to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI enter physics warp x4. I am at about 4,000 meters in the sky. I point my plane down... and done with warp. Woah, I\u0027m really close to the ground! I pull up as hard as hard as I can. I DID IT! I landed a plane normally! WOO-HOO!!! So, I get all the science I can, and I recover Bill and the plane. 45 science! That was \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E enough to unlock the node I wanted! Yay! So, for saving the space program, Jeb, and himself, he gets a glamor shot next to the plane that did it all. (The chutes on the back were not used.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jBeJEPq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jBeJEPq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I have pleased you guys, and have a good day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T21:15:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RAINCRAFTER\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T21:18:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now I am doing my Minmus rescue mission thanks to this plane landing.
