Craft file attached, all stock parts. Look at the booster rocket on the \u0022near side\u0022, closest to the camera, it has flt 800 and 400 tanks above an lv-t30 engine, and on the solid booster next to it, there\u0027s one more flt 400 tank from which a fuel line comes to this stack. There are no other fuel lines coming to or from these tanks. In flight, the engine runs but fuel is not used from any of these three tanks - it seems that fuel is instead drawn from the center orange tank, which in turn does -not- give fuel to the center stack engines, they only get fuel from the thin tank directly above them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve spent the last 20 minutes trying to see what I\u0027ve done wrong...
