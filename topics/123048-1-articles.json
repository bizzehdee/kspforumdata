Usually it seems to take about 950 ish dV to get on a Kerbin escape trajectory, and another 950 dV for me to plot a kerbin return. I can\u0027t figure out a way to plot a return trajectory after escaping Kerbin\u0027s SOI that doesn\u0027t use a lot of dV, and I feel like it should be possible.

That makes sense! I was mostly messing around with ejecting prograde and retrograde, I never thought to try ejecting anti-radially. I had an ejection angle mostly anti-radial and a bit prograde relative to Kerbins orbit. This put Jeb on an orbit slightly larger than Kerbin\u0027s and a bit offset once he escaped Kerbin\u0027s SOI. To return, I only had to burn 80 m/s retrograde with a little bit radial burn and I got a Kerbin intercept with a 25km periapsis 9 hours after making the escape. This makes perfect sense to me now. By ejecting radially with a bit of prograde, I eject Jeb ahead of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, but I sent him into an orbit that is higher and thus slower than Kerbin\u0027s, so that allows Kerbin to catch up.
