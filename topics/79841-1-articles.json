This container would store the surface sample in order to return it to Kerbin ... a sample collected this way would either generate the full percentage of a surface sample that is brought back home by a Kerbonaut, or at least 50% of it (taking into account that maybe a Kerbonaut on the ground is better at selecting surface samples)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regards to Cameras there might even be several models (like ... B/W, Basic Color, Advanced Color) each getting different percentages (of Kerbonauts EVA report science points) out of the Biome and each located at a different node in the tch tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO these changes would integrate very well into the existing game (after all they only tap into science pools that are already there, i.e. the EVA and surface sample science pools) and the game play ... especially the play with inmanned probes, would win a lot by this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would increase the usefulness of probes and would also increase the similarity of KSP probe missions and RL probe missions\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T15:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u0027d like to see that coming, I fear this makes Kerbals even more useless than they are now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T15:11:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022M3tal_Warrior\u0022 data-cite=\u0022M3tal_Warrior\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlthough I\u0027d like to see that coming, I fear this makes Kerbals even more useless than they are now.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would still need 10 probe missions (if we assume that the instruments produce 10% of a Kerbals EVA report /surface sample science) to a Biome in order to produce the EVA/surface sample of a single Kerbonaut (or a single reusable probe \u002B an orbiting science lab \u002B refuel station)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(all under the assumption that it is implemented along the way I depicted in my OP, that is, that the scoop and cams could only be used once per Biome [and mounting multiple scoops/cams wouldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t allow you multiple EVA reports/surface samples per Biome])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo manned missions would still be more cost and time efficient than probe missions would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest difference IMHO would be Eve ... as you wouldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t a manned mission (either a one way with the sacrifice/marooning of Kerbals on Eve or a hyperdesigned return one) anymore in order to gain EVA and surface sample science from there\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-28T15:14:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2014 03:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Godot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T15:28:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure, but then: Does it actually make sense? Like you get about 20 science from a probe EVA report (that\u0027s somehow a contradiction, but anyways) on planet X, but the probe itself flies for 2 years to reach that planet - during that you can do so much other science on Mun and Minmus, you don\u0027t need the science any longer when that probe reaches its destination.
