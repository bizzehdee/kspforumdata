Yeah, the challenge lends well to crafts that are weighted a bit more toward the conventional aircraft end with VTOL capability, as opposed to being ideal for crafts that excel tremendously at easy vertical take offs and landings while sacrificing speed, range, and efficiency with respect to their operational radius. The VTOL spectrum is quite a broad one. I figured if it was simply a matter of just taking off and landing on a small spot, it would have been a little too easy. Although that is one aspect of VTOL piloting and design, having the craft be efficient at covering ground horizontally as well as being able to transition between modes was something that I wanted people to focus on, if not at least figure out how to work around, in this challenge. The flexibility required to perform the tasks, I had hoped, would also bring more sophisticated designs with a broader range of capabilities; think of it as an area 51 for VTOL prototypes. Maybe people, including myself, can get lots of ideas from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rudi1291\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rudi1291\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, here\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s my entry\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/ApUTj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/ApUTj\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll parts stock and stock physics, so a Division 1 entry.
