Most importantly, since the R\u0026amp;D buildings cost so much to upgrade, only parts up to tier 5 can be used. (the maximum allowed by a tier-1 R\u0026amp;D centre). In addition this plane should be able to take-off and land on the very rough tier one runway. (although as we know anybody sane uses the grass with a tier-1 runway...). Also, there are some interesting constraints imposed by the fact that at this tech level, manual fuel transfers don\u0027t work and there are no action groups. Ideally we\u0027d want at least 3-400ms of delta-v on-orbit to be able to do rescue missions with this plane, and make sure there\u0027s enough fuel left to run the jet on the way back to landing at the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most interesting issue is that with the tier 5 parts, there\u0027s no turbojet. This means a very different ascent profile than is normal with a spaceplane, and a lot more rocket fuel is needed than usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is, with lots of testing and some abuse of the alignment tool it is indeed possible...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0fwZjlb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220fwZjlb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull mission album:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/EPHiW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

RO-1 Torpedo is a fine looking and capable craft and I feel sure that once you iron out the teething difficulties she will be capable of completing the K-Prize successfully. Also FYI so you dont waste your efforts in the wrong direction you should know that what appears to be the \u0022payload\u0022 apparently cannot be detached so is part of the craft and doesnt qualify as payload as it stands. You also probably need to know that the utilitarial awards require the payload to be delivered ie dropped off and for the distinction the payload has to be delivered to a planet surface other than Kerbin to count. I have amended the rules to make this clearer. As for stabilising your cargo bay fuel tank I recommend struts, also the tank appears to be clipping a girder stack and this may have contributed to the instability and explosion as the game can react strangely to clipping especially when internal collisions are induced by a sudden G force. If you want to make it a payload then you will need to used docking components or decouplers and you can use struts with those until undocked, but for retrieval you may be interested to know you can use more than one docking port on the same craft simultaneously so you can stabilise a payload for retrieval with two docking ports for example (which is the most I have tried) providing they are precisely aligned with counterparts they will both dock at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-12T23:35:12Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2015 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Batz_10K","CreatedById":4992,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T18:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022boolybooly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022boolybooly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBatz_10K congratulations on acquiring the minimalist record holder title.

The probe is off to do it\u0027s work (complete contracts for me, or presumably provide satellite TV for the inhabitants of minmus which is, currently, Jeb). As you can see I have flight engineer so you can see how much Delta V the little satellite has. More than enough to get around anywhere it needs to go in the Kerbin area. The only two mods I\u0027ve ever used are Flight Engineer and Kerbal Alarm Clock. I don\u0027t think my computer could even run much more than that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/COIrThT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022COIrThT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent some time fussing with the satellites orbit and then had to wait a while for the KSC to come back into the light side of the planet. Here I\u0027m setting the de-orbit maneuver node. Honestly I\u0027m always off on this but this time around I got really lucky and she came down on a near perfect trajectory west of the mountains near the KSC. I barely had to touch it coming down aside from the last adjustments to short final. Normally I wouldn\u0027t care at all and just land it anywhere near the KSC but for this I wanted to put her on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I1vlNsF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022I1vlNsF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGliding it down. Pretty lucky. At this point I\u0027ve usually either overshot the KSC by a lot or am under power trying to maintain speed so I\u0027m not bored for ten minutes flying to the KSC since I came in too far before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zsw9HNN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Zsw9HNN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal approach and power is turned back on. If you let the speed drop below 100m/s its very easy to stall and break her up. It happens more often than I would care to admit. Also with my low powered computer the runway is all of 13 stair stepper pixels which is another reason I usually don\u0027t even bother with putting it down right on the runway!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p9nrrRd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022p9nrrRd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort final. Aim for the numbers. Light on the yoke. Full flaps. Hand on the throttle. Oh wait this isn\u0027t a cessna 172. More like wwqqeaaassssswwweeewqq. Take a screenshot. Damnit I hit *shift* again!
