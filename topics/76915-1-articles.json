It would almost be easier to always build the launcher from scratch, but I really don\u0027t want to do that. There has to be a better way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I understand why the staging is getting mixed up, as every stage has a number assigned to it and it probably just puts the staging elements into the stage numbers of the payload. But is there any way of preventing this from happening. I wish there was a way to make self contained groups of staging, that would stay intact and unaltered no matter where you moved them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone knows any solutions to this problem, your help would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T21:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe subassembly will place itself in the stages corresponding to the numbers it was assigned when you built it.
