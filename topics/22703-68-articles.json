They\u0027re good as they are in terms of the size of the pads and the pods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the main thing is just to get the bug fixed. Just so that a pilot doesn\u0027t have to \u0022cycle\u0022 the gear before landing. Or upon re-spawning from a save when it\u0027s landed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I only have two suggestions and they are very OPTIONAL: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne: The landing leg length could be adjusted to more accurately reflect the source material. Your Eagle sits low to the ground compared to the original. This sometimes is a problem when landing on slopes. I wouldn\u0027t suggest resizing the pod itself. Just making that one vertical bar of the landing leg itself just a bit longer (not wider!). Unless you HAVE to in order to make that bar fit inside! On the scale of a Kerbal, I\u0027d think not much more than a foot-height (a Kerbal foot) would need to be added. If the leg can fully collapse and fit flush with the pod as it does now, but come out with just a little more length so that the Eagle can clear the ground a bit more. That\u0027d be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo: Purely cosmetic - the pods don\u0027t have much in the way of actual physical detail. You\u0027ve got stuff printed on the skin. But no actual \u0022grimblies\u0022 as the old FX model makers would call them. Check out the source material or the old Redspar Eagle and I think you\u0027ll see what I mean. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain - If you can\u0027t do it, you can\u0027t do it. Priority is just the landing gear bug fix. But if you CAN or WANT to - great!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW - all of you - I\u0027ve got a thread over in the Mission Reports section called - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68066-A-Flight-of-Eagles-Mission-To-Eve?p=941783#post941783\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EA Flight of Eagles - Mission to Eve\u003C/a\u003E.

And glad things in life are working out well for you Devo! Could not agree with Logan more about the fixes. They all sound good. If I could add my one little suggestion, which is purely cosmetic. It goes along with Logan\u0027s about the \u0022grimblies\u0022 or details on the model. The one thing I really loved about Redspars\u0027 Eagle (besides the fact that it was an Eagle \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) was that it looked just like the one from the show, almost photo-realistic, and had tons of details all over it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I like the current \u0022Kerbal-ized\u0022 version we have, I thought the Eagle looked pretty Kerbal as it was. I know you (Devo) changed the looks a bit to differentiate your Eagle from Redspar\u0027s, but I think enough time has passed that no one could accuse you of copying or imitating him. I know that making these changes would mean you have to re do the textures, but if your going to re do them anyways for Logan to add details, you might as well go the whole nine yards eh? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Maybe you could even add some rust streaks or dirty spots to really give the Eagle that \u0022Good ole reliable Space Truck\u0022 feel... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, it\u0027s been far too long since I\u0027ve done THIS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mNNCALw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mNNCALw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-12T01:50:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2014 01:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by UltraVires\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Logan.Darklighter","CreatedById":7375,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T02:16:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile we\u0027re at it on minor cosmetic suggestions - I\u0027ve got another 2 - and I THINK they should be \u0022easy\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) A simple palette swap on the Command pod - make the upper windows orange instead of blue, and BLACK OUT the lower ones.

Well - on the fore and aft sections of the main body, you\u0027ve got some textures that I notice you\u0027ve re-used with other of your craft designs.
