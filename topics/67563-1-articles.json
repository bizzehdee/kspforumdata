Not as smart or efficient, but they work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally like to go for asteroids that will pass a fair distance from Kerbin, like out beyond Minmu\u0027s orbit. This means the roid will be moving pretty slowly so it\u0027ll be easier to match up with and you\u0027ve got days to make it happen if you screw it up the 1st time. It goes like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Select the roid you want based on where it will pass through Kerbin\u0027s SOI and its size. The bigger the roid, the more ship you need to capture it. You also want one that won\u0027t enter Kerbin\u0027s SOI for a couple months at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Determine whether the roid will go above or below Kerbin. Then launch into a polar orbit when KSC is more or less in line with the roid\u0027s path. Depending on whether the roid is going above or below Kerbin, and whether KSC is facing its approaching or departing path, you\u0027ll launch more or less north or more or less south. The essential thing is to make sure you\u0027re going around Kerbin in the same direction the roid will be when it gets there. You don\u0027t have to match inclination perfectly at this point, just get reasonably close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Get into a huge orbit straight from launch, like out as far as Minmus, and more or less circularize it. Once there, you can fine-tune your inclination to match the roid\u0027s. At that distance from Kerbin, this won\u0027t cost much. The thing is, though, you want to be a fair bit inside the roid\u0027s path so you complete an orbit faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Now you wait for the roid to enter Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Warp at high speed until it\u0027s close to entering, then slow down so it enter\u0027s Kerbin\u0027s SOI at no more than 10x warp. IOW, treat it just like it was one of your ships, because roids that cross SOI borders at high warp end up with altered orbits just like ships do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Now make a node to rendezvous with the roid as best you can. At this distance, the roid will be in Kerbin\u0027s SOI for a couple months usually so you\u0027ve got plenty of time. Just set up the burn so you\u0027ll come within about 500km of the roid. Closer is of course better, but anything less than 1000km will do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Coast out to your closest approach and burn to match velocities with the roid. Then burn towards the roid. It\u0027s exactly the same as rendezvousing with a space station except the distances are much greater so you burn to a much higher speed towards the target. Like the 1st time you move towards it, get up to 150m\u0027s or so towards it. Periodically kill your relative velocity then burn towards the roid again, same as a normal rendezvous, using warp as needed to pass the time. Eventually, you\u0027ll get within a couple hundred meters and can finish off with RCS. And because the roid is moving so slowly, this will usually happen at least a little before the roid reaches its Kerbin Pe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Arm the grabber, control from the grabber, target the roid\u0027s CoM, and ease up to it until the grabber sets. Because roid surfaces are highly irregular, you\u0027ll probably dock at an angle to the CoM. No worries, just release the grabber\u0027s pivot and pitch/yaw the ship as needed to line up with the CoM, then lock the pivot. The only real trick in this part is if you\u0027re going after a D- or E-size roid. With these, it\u0027s VERY difficult to reorient the ship/roid combo to line up for a burn; it\u0027s easier to move the ship to the other side of the roid. So when you 1st catch the roid and know you\u0027re going to burn retrograde to capture it around Kerbin, try to grab a big rock on its prograde side so you can at least do this capture burn without having to release and move the ship around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. You want to capture the roid into as big an orbit as possible, so the burn to change its plane down to Kerbin\u0027s equator is as small as possible. Once you\u0027ve got the plane change done, shrink the orbit as desired so you can either park the thing around Mun or crash it into KSC as preferred \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T04:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022purpletarget\u0022 data-cite=\u0022purpletarget\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes.... and solar RV is a whole \u0027nother conversation.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely.

Neither was exactly easier to grab than the other because each had its own set of problems, except that I had to launch a ship specifically for that asteroid when I grabbed it near Kerbin as opposed to just leaving one fully fueled on high orbital standby for whatever I feel like going after. The other one I basically trailed it as it escaped from Kerbin\u0027s soi and caught up. I say that to say this... Bringing one back with you is (in my opinion) easier with a solar rendezvous because you have greater control over your Kerbin approach, inclination, etc and there\u0027s really no big rush to grab it and furiously burn retrograde while hoping you lined everything up just right. If you\u0027re not comfortable with being outside of Kerbin\u0027s soi yet though, well that\u0027s a different story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the actual methods to do either, it seems pretty well explained by others and I don\u0027t have anything to add.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T16:04:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile we appreciate the advice you all are giving, this request for help is 2 months old.
