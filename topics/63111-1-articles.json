Rovie the Rover is for you. Rovie can be placed on top of any rocket without any other support vehicles, and can reach the surface of the Mun from Mun orbit by itself, with no supporting rockets of any kind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe secret to Rovie\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s success is the patented \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThrustBlam\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 landing system. All thrust required for landing on the moon is inside Rovie! In addition to the four 4-way thrusters, six more unidirectional thrusters are installed on the bottom to provide enough RCS thrust to land without difficulty. The 80 units of onboard RCS fuel are more than enough to land, and even take off again to survey a new place (although probably not enough to get back to orbit). The only thing you need to land on the moon is Rovie himself, and the rocket you use to get you there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TR-2C Stack Separator is used to detach Rovie from the launch vehicle. It makes Rovie more efficient because he lands with no extra weight to haul around on the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you land, the ample battery pack will provide enough power to keep you working through those cold Mun nights, and the deployable solar array allows you to recharge quickly and be on your way. When it comes time to phone home, the included Communotron 88-88 can send your science data to far away bases. Rovie can also hold any number of exciting experiments (sold separately).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PD9xcmt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PD9xcmt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TR-2C Separator\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7wlk53i.png\u0022 alt=\u00227wlk53i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore battery power than a bag full of Energizer bunnies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cXlLFN6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cXlLFN6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnviro-friendly solar array so you don\u0027t pollute the barren, atmosphere-less rock that is the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T20:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFunky little rover RocketBlam, and welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh by the way, I added the stock tag for you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T20:34:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I was wondering how to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T20:35:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a drop down box when creating a thread, or you can use the advanced editor \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
