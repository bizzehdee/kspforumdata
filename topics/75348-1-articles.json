What a mess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general it seems to be easy to get to an asteroid outside kerbins SOI if you burn properly. On a 70 day timer until it hits the soi you should be able to hit it at around 40 days left. Then you can putter around with your Kerbal poking at the rock with a stick for 40 days. By the time it enters the SOI of Kerbin your Kerbal will have made a scientific discovery. The asteroid is in fact not made of cheese after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso be sure to save often before starting a burn. If a 3500 ton E class starts to tumble you might as well untrack it and let it despawn.

It\u0027ll take you more delta-V to get there, but you can then make a small correction to set your periapsis for aerocapture. For bigger asteroids it\u0027s the way to go. Provided the asteroid is due to enter Kerbin\u0027s SOI, you can get to it simply enough by leaving in the direction it\u0027s predicted to enter.

I\u0027ve done a few intercepts now and on all of them, I\u0027ve managed to capture the roid at least 10-15 days before they enter Kerbin SOI. I then burn, so as to get the Kerbin SOI around 60KM, and fine tune it to about 36-40KM once in the SOI.
