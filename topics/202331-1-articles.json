After less than one month, I already cruised halfway around the mun with a small rover, despite it being a fairly crappy design. My first major achievement was a large manned rover to roam freely on any moon. Even if I don\u0027t use them, I feel better if I can put wheels on my landers, just so I could move around if I wanted. And while I generally dislike planes, I took an interest in propeller planes because they allow roaming freely - and expeditely - on the planets with air and oceans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI keep being surprised by how rare that attitude apparently is. I asked advice on improving the aerodinamics on my latest plane project, and I got a lot of answers that - while competent - clearly denoted that everyone who was answering had a single specific kind of plane in mind: something that starts on the runway, goes to orbit, flies back to the runway. Some even got to laythe, but without any intention of flying around the place, just land, plant a flag, and return.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022share your rovers\u0022 has been voted thread of the month, but few people posted on it. And except for my model, all of them were very small, clearly not intended for long distances. it seems nobody is interested in driving a rover on long distances. indeed, i got the record for most science on a jool 5 run because i did drive a rover on every single biome on tylo and vall, and nobody else did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\neven in the \u0022what did you do today\u0022 thread, rovers (or leisure, exploration planes) are virtually unseen. While the sharing of space stations and spaceplanes is very crowded - though each and every one of those space planes are only meant to be launched from the runway to orbit and back. i\u0027m also, apparently, the only one who cares about putting in a crew module with large windows, so I can drive in first person perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to discuss, is my passion for surface exploration really so rare? Or are there other people who like driving rovers for long distances, and they just never dared to make a coming-out? Why are there so few people who like exploring surfaces?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, exploring surfaces is a natural consequence of space exploration. sure, we got there and planted a flag on it. great acheivement, but it doesn\u0027t tell us all that much. going there and being able to move around, that a greater achievement. I feel that a lander that lands and moves around is inherently superior than a lander who lands and does nothing else. To the point that even when I don\u0027t want to explore, i still like it more if I have the chance. just because it makes my vehicle better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can also be very relaxing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can understand, though, that after a while the surface of any given body feels samey, and it can grow dull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, sometimes I also name places, especially when I like where I\u0027m driving. On Vall I have mount godzilla, batman pass, the mohawk mountains, the shadar logoth trail. Am I the only one to name places?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-11T14:10:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking as a player, and not a Squad employee... you are not alone!\u003Cbr\u003E\nI love driving and exploring in rovers, especially on the Mun.

Seriously, this must be stressed. leave your car out, see how long it takes before it stops working. i guarantee, it will last much less than the mars rovers. and yet, you can stretch the operational life of your car well above 15 years with regular maintenance. We lost many rovers because they got dust on their solar panels, this would have been easily fixed by a a crew member with a broom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) those rovers moved very slowly. their top speeds were on the order of 100 m/day. not because they could not go faster, but because they were piloted remotely. which means that mission control instructs the rover to move forward 10 meters, the data is sent through the deep space network, then the rover moves, snaps some pictures, send them back to mission control. mission control looks at the pictures, run a risk assessment, then plan a new trajectory for the next 10 meters, which is as far as they can accurately see obstacles based on the pictures. and the process is slow. a pilot there would be able to drive as long as there is battery. also, mission control is driving a rover costing billions of dollars, so they have to be more careful than we are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) those rovers are not supposed to run, but to perform science. and performing science takes time, and causes them to stop for months in the same location. in ksp we don\u0027t have those same requirements, as science is done istantaneously. kerbalism changes that, and you\u0027d need to stand still 90 days in the same biome to finish the measurements. i don\u0027t even try.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) because of factors 5 and 4, those rovers are not going to move around much. so they will take several years to run a few km. and then they will stop working for other reasons. so, there\u0027s no need for big, sturdy wheels, and we can make them lighter. see again 1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere is absolutely no reason a large rover with a pilot able to run maintenance and a decent power supply could not cover thousands of kilometers. indeed, it\u0027s exactly what happens in the martian, and i\u0027ve seen a lot of science reviews about that book, with detailed analysis of what can and cannot be done, nitpicking pretty much everything, and yet nobody among the many reviewers - all people with solid science credentials - ever raised any problem about the capacity of a rover to last that long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-12T13:08:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2021 01:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by king of nowhere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-12T13:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223970999\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202331\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221620824894\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 minutes ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni don\u0027t care how bad regolith is, we can move on rocky deserts on far greater distances\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Earth cliffs and deserts are even not close as bad as the nasty regolith.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Earth sand particles are round and nice, they are polished by wind and water.
