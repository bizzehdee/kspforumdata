My experiment looked like this:\n\nSince the efficiency of these engines is supposed to be greatest in vacuum that was my focus. I used mechjeb\u0027s delta V calculations. I would pick a number like 3,000 delta V and make a stage using cryo engines and lox/H combo fuel and another using stock vacuum engines and mixed fuel. At \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E greater than 2 it didnt make sense to use the cryo engines, not only because of the size of the stage, but because the mass of the stage that gave 3k \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E was greater than the mass of the stock stage that gave 3k \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E. Regardless of that stages engine \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E it would take more lower stage Delta V to get that 3k Delta V into orbit so its worthless. Lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E stages seem to get lighter than the stock stages i guess because the cryo engines are heavier. At a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1 the cryo stage had about 5% more delta V than the stock (stages were the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and same overall mass, meaning any lower stages would be the same for both to get to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. At .50 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E the cryo stage had close to 10% more delta V than the stock. At a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of .30 the cryo stage had about 12% more Delta V.

In any case, seems really strange that a planet mod would affect LH2 boiloff/power module detection like that...\n\nAfter removing Kopernicus, I\u0027ve run the test again with and without KSPIE, LH2 boiloff at 100000x time warp seems to be almost completely contained (there\u0027s still a tiny boiloff which only applies for a fraction of a second, but then it stabilizes at 0).\n\nI\u0027m gonna try with the old .dll (from Kerbal Atomics 0.4.9), now, see if something changes. \n\nEDIT: Tried with the old .dll (Kerbal Atomics 0.4.9) and didn\u0027t notice any difference. I forgot to mention that in order for the boiloff to be stopped, I\u0027ve had to run my two MX-0 \u0022KerboPower\u0022 fission generators at 80% (generating 46 electric charge each), any lower than that and the boiloff would return. Is it a coincidence that 46 electric charge is almost the exact amount consumed by each H1000-1152 Hydrogen tank?\n\nIt almost seems like the K90-ML Trio Solar Panels don\u0027t work properly at 100000x, although they\u0027re now correctly detected by BDS... \n\nAnyway, as long as those fission generators stop boiloff at 100000x, I\u0027ll be content. \n\nBtw, [this is the ship](https://mega.nz/#!IElU2LwQ!uRvjUjdOYmTR5t2gqIbETMctreHLZ00yaVFfntGgm3g) I used for the latest tests (no KSPIE parts on it).

I always use the custom angle snap this mod provides for all radial attachments. \n\nSo I\u0027ve removed the mod and reattached all radial components of my test ship (including the solar panels) using stock angle snap and... tadaaaa.\n\nThe electric discharge problems at high time warp seem to have almost disappeared (they are very sporadic now, electric charge remains full most of the time)...it\u0027s a bittersweet feeling, really, since I freaking love Editor Extensions and I freaking love your mods ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif \u0022;.;\u0022) \n\nIn any case, I\u0027m attaching the [modified test craft](https://mega.nz/#!0Et1hByQ!0WL4IFH_3VgmqDr6y8GspXD5zRvjfCMvGoZZulwaqOw) . Could you please confirm that the ship works as expected on your end too? \n\nIf this turns out to be the issue... is there any way to make NFT Solar and Editor Extensions fully compatible?
