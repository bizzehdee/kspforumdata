Your goal is to reach Jool using as little delta-V as possible. You know if you immediately make a burn, the transfer orbit won\u0027t hit Jool at the right time and place. So you have to wait for a better window. You want to make the manouver node NOW that is or a time way ahead in the future. The only way to do it now is to increment the time of the node forward by 1 orbit around Kerbin. 1 orbit in low kerbin orbit is maybe an hour, but your window might be 100 kerbin days away. That means you would need to click the increment button 600 times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea is that you can use the parent body\u0027s orbit to create a pseudo-manouver-node for the parent body. This pseudo-node can be handled as a regular manouver node that can be moved with anchors that can be pulled to create a hypothetical trajectory. Encounters with a target body will also be shown. Once you find a good trajectory, you can transfer the time of the pseudo-node to a newly created node on your current planetary orbit. The hypothetical burn does not transfer over. Then you can adjust the node on the planetary orbit to get a similar trajectory as the the hypothetical one. This would allow you to create nodes far off in the future and would also make it easier to find a good window for transfer burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrawbacks as far as I can tell:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIt simplifies finding good transfer windows and maybe ruins the game for players who want to figure things out more mathematically.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe pseudo nodes might create clutter and confusion for the player.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt might not be obvious for the player how the new manouver nodes were created and what they mean.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can\u0027t timewarp comfortably 100 days ahead in a low Kerbin orbit anyway. Maybe the player should just get used to timewarping from the tracking station first and worry about manouver nodes close to when the burn needs to happen.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf your current orbit gets you an encounter with a moon before the time of the manouver node, your orbit will be different. It is not obvious how this should be handled by the game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
