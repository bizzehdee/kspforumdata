My feeling is to keep it special it should be pretty sparse though. The Kraken is a classic bit of game lore and I think could be part of that near the end.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-08T16:30:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2022 04:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
