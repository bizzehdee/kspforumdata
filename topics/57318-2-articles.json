The problem is that the Munshine IV sits on the edge of diminishing returns for the Skipper/Jumbo booster configuration. Adding another booster only ups the payload capacity to 30 tons or so, not really enough of a difference to warrant an entire design. I\u0027ve played with a lot of variations trying to get one orange tank into orbit efficiently:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Adding a bit more fuel to the five-Skipper first stage design brings the first stage\u0027s TWR dangerously close to 1.0, causing severe control issues at liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Adding a bit more fuel to the second stage just gives the first stage an even harder time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Swapping out the central Skipper for a Mainsail fixes the TWR problem but it guzzles too much fuel, even when \u0022throttled\u0022 by using 0.23\u0027s thrust limit slider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Adding some of the much-maligned Mark 55 vernier thrusters to the core stack does the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Swapping the outboard Skippers for clusters of LVT-45s balloons the parts count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Building out the second stage (effectively turning it into a down-powered Munshine V rather than an up-powered Munshine VI) requires a more powerful first stage and again balloons the parts count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve so far not been able to produce a 35-40 ton lifter that is lighter on parts than the Munshine V. Your design would push about 30 tons to orbit - certainly not bad, but as I said I feel it\u0027s not enough advantage over the Munshine VI to warrant inclusion in the family.
