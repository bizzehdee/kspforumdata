Or Scientists and pilot, or all 3 things? What if when a kerbal reached level 5 you could chose an additional trait for him? This way the kerbal leveling system will have more depht and there will be a reason to reach level 5 (right now, afaik, after level 3 you dont get much additional perks.) To be honest, the problem i am having is i end up with way to many kerbals on mission, i know i can upgrade the astronaut complex, and get unlimited amount, but it still got me thinking what if kerbals werent limited to just 1 trait? It seems that gaining an additional trait at level 5, is a nice fit, although with a few challenges to implement. Perhaps mostly UI related. What do you guys think?"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T21:30:39Z","Content":"Nope, there is no way kerbals can have several traits, and IMO, it would be kind of OP.\n\nOn a mission, taking 2 kerbals instead of 1 (pilot\u002Banother) usually doesn\u0027t have huge consequences on the mission, due to the fact that a command pod weighs less than 1 ton.\n\nOn the other hand, you could replace a pilot with an advanced probe core that has several SAS settings, and just take an engineer/scientist.\n\nI personally like the trait system, it avoids having 1 kerbal managing a huge mission/station/mine/whatever on his own. And it makes sense that a scientist who does research cannot pilot a rocket on his own or repair a rocket with a single wrench. Specialisation of Kerbals makes you have a real crew for a mission, with many Kerbals having each their role.\n\nAnyway, you could probably find a mod for this, or even edit config files yourself, it you\u0027re not afraid of what\u0027s behind the curtain."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T21:53:49Z","Content":"There are a lot of caveats, but the short answer is \u0022kinda.\u0022\n\nThe longer answer can be found in my modulemanager config named [JOMT (Jack Of Many Trades)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117530-)."}]}
