It should start soon after launch, and go gradually so that you are at 45 degrees around 10 km and horizontal around 40 km, but it varies for every craft a little bit and you\u0027ll just have to experiment a bit, eventually you\u0027ll get it right almost every time! Still, you\u0027ll most likely need to read up/watch some videos on this if you don\u0027t really know how spaceship trajectories work.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDelta-V: This is how much your rocket can change it\u0027s velocity. In order to go places, you need to change your velocity. More fuel doesn\u0027t necessarily mean more delta-V! Often you can get even further with a rocket you could fit in the back of a truck than with one that barely fits in the whole \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. The key to maximizing delta-V is fuel mass fraction. Basically, you\u0027ll get less delta-V from a fuel tank and engine carrying a large payload (like a big station module or kerballed lander) than you would from the same tank and engine if you used it to carry a tiny satellite. That\u0027s because it takes more energy to move a bigger mass.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E: This is a number that says if your rocket can lift it\u0027s own weight. You need a bigger, more expensive engine to lift a bigger rocket because it needs more thrust to move.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Tyranny of the Rocket Equation: Fuel has mass too. If you have a rocket, and not enough fuel to get to where you\u0027re going, you need to add more fuel, which is heavier, so you need to add more rockets to lift the extra fuel, and you need more fuel to lift the rockets all the way, etc...When I designed my ship to do the first Jool-5 ISRU run (hide the quote in my sig to find a link), I had a lot of trouble with this. That\u0027s the reason it\u0027s called the \u0022Super \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EMk10\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022.

Higher Isp means your rocket will have a higher delta-V for the same payload and fuel mass than if you used an engine with a lower Isp. Note that rockets have lower Isp and thrust in the atmosphere. You will need to choose the right engine for each stage of the mission. For launch you will need one with high thrust (these usually don\u0027t have great Isp though!) and in space you should have a high Isp, but you can get by with lower thrust.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are fairly advanced concepts, though, and for now I suggest just running through the Tutorials in the main menu. With those, you will be able to build and fly your own rocket, and even get it into orbit! As stated above, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E is a good tool for easily knowing important statistics about your ship without a calculator.
