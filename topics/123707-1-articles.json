I would agree with 5thHorseman. Installing the game again will likely clear it up. Are you using any add-ons?

A simple reinstall fixed the issue. I think this may have happened because I had the demo installed prior to purchasing. I uninstalled the game, went into my steam folder and remove the folders for Kerbal Space Program and Kerbal Space Program Demo. I think reinstalled and everything is there!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
