This way you can move a station or upgrade a station to complete the contract which makes a lot more sense to me personally. I currently have 4 abandoned stations above kerbin 2 over the Mun 2 empty Mun bases. I have had a couple of those launch abandoned controlled by a probe core just because I know I will never use them.
