Now, there are situations in which KSP runs quite nicely and there are situations in which I really have to decrease the graphic settings in order to maintain a playable framerate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow as I am planning to purchase a PCIe graphics card anyways, I am wondering whether anybody here has measured some noteable increase of graphic performance when upgrading from integrated graphics to external stuff? Seriously 3.5GHz shouldn\u0027t be that bad - and decreasing the graphic setttings of a 5 year old game feels a bit weird - so I am seriously wondering whether the integrated graphics are the bottleneck, or if the bottleneck of the system is to be found elsewhere... Multithreading should at leas allow for a playable performance of the game on high settings (rendering and textures).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T23:02:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeasured?
