It looks to me that it has some solar arrays in the camera shot which either don\u0027t rotate and aren\u0027t fitted with panels on both sides or the rotator is broken as the panels (it looks like a static item), if there are any are not facing the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe camera changes every now and then so I took a screen shot of what I\u0027m talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/4meLjeA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4meLjeA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224meLjeA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/International_Space_Station/Where_is_the_International_Space_Station\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/International_Space_Station/Where_is_the_International_Space_Station\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pipcard","CreatedById":2541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T08:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s part of a Soyuz or Progress spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T08:29:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pipcard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pipcard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s part of a Soyuz or Progress spacecraft.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the ISS just flew over my house. It was so bright in the sky. It\u0027s just gone dark here (slightly past dusk), so I guess the sun was still hitting the ISS. It was like a huge spotlight in the sky going over. Very impressed.

That is the Russian Soyuz/Progress with its fixed solar panels docked to the ISS. As for seeing the ISS. It\u0027s actually more frequent then you imagine.
