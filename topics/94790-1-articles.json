Squad moved to XInput as KSP is now reading the left and right triggers as separate axes - ie you cannot it seems, by default, map yaw to left and right triggers, as it only binds to one axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI *think* this can possibly be fixed thru config editing by changing the yaw axis to the 3rd axis (2 if it starts from 0) instead of the one it detects (8 or 9?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother workaround is to use my app \u003Ca href=\u0022http://evilc.com/proj/ujr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUJR\u003C/a\u003E to perform a 1:1 straight through mapping of the xbox controller to a virtual stick, then unplugging the xbox controller, starting KSP and plugging the xbox controller in after you start the game. The game will then only detect the virtual stick (which is controlled by your xbox pad).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe also the AltInput mod could be used to fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, KSP now only seems to support 20 buttons on a stick.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T14:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how you were doing it before, but Unity\u0027s been like this with regards to all joystick input for... well, longer than my memory goes back.
