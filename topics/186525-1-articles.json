On my last launch the stack was engines, fuel, a three man capsule, a pair of linked Clampotron Jrs and a 4 man habitat, an inverted decoupler and a nose cone. The intent was to deliver fuel and the habitat module. Docking was routine. When it came time to leave, one of the ports was offering the undock option and I clicked it. The ships remained docked. The option to undock was no longer present on either port I brought up an engineer but he can\u0027t fix the parts or remove them. I suspect both ports think they are attached to the 3 man capsule. After the failed undocking I noticed certain kinds of spacecraft drift caused by Kerbal helmets clipping into parts\u00A0 were also causing this port linkage to rotate as if it were some kind of bearing. I had the entire crew on EVA simultaneously trying to grab the parts but alas I was one Kerbal short of the required six.\u00A0 I have verified that all the tanks engines and command capsules have autostrut disabled. Identical docking ports on the opposite end of the habitat module are working normally.\u00A0\u00A0 I\u0027m running version 1.7.3.2594 64 bit with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, no other mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting fact: when an engineer tries to grab either of the docked ports, the game reports the weight as over 5 tons.
