I do have a lot of mods installed, but this problem only started happening last night after having played all day. I\u0027ve had these same mods installed since I started my career save, so about a week or two ago. Really I cannot figure out a reason why it would start crashing constantly without changing or installing any additional mods. I am guessing that the problem is with one of the mods, since my memory does not go above 3Gb, but I might be wrong.\n\nSettings as follows:\n\n- Forcing d3d11, and have been for ages. Opengl crashes for me.\n- All mods through Ckan, and game executed thru it as well.\n- PPFX off\n\nI have deleted some mods, re installed KSP, and then re installed the mods that I would like to use.\n\nHopefully, I can find the mod at fault or some answers/guidance. I believe that this game running with the mods I have active has to be the best game I have ever played and cannot get enough of it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Mods Installed:**\n\n![n0H3Vmb6MbG5xwLAk-O-M2A-6B4g3YOIc074jgDCBC8?size=1600x1200\u0026size_mode=2](https://photos-3.dropbox.com/t/2/AAAL1GNTMiRrFOF912f-3-8mSevWa8UswN6yxO33Vwi7PA/12/14991502/jpeg/32x32/1/_/1/2/1.JPG/EMSDlAsYswcgASgB/n0H3Vmb6MbG5xwLAk-O-M2A-6B4g3YOIc074jgDCBC8?size=1600x1200\u0026size_mode=2)\n\n![XyeuujNADvONSgygYKbdNjlfAE2rhDM_aOcQwvcPQtg?size=1600x1200\u0026size_mode=2](https://photos-2.dropbox.com/t/2/AAAeYvp9JKxGKZ5nQQkMFDvwV0M0lCPAmbMM5gt9flqpIg/12/14991502/jpeg/32x32/1/_/1/2/2.JPG/EMSDlAsYswcgASgB/XyeuujNADvONSgygYKbdNjlfAE2rhDM_aOcQwvcPQtg?size=1600x1200\u0026size_mode=2)\n\n**Log:** \n\n **Output:** [**https://db.tt/tbWz54k5**](https://db.tt/tbWz54k5)\n\n **Error:** [**https://db.tt/iyXAoyd4**](https://db.tt/iyXAoyd4)\n\nThank you guys so much!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T00:06:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 12:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DScamp**\n  \nRemoved some mods and did a clean install"},{"CreatedByName":"DScamp","CreatedById":144316,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T03:13:18Z","Content":"I figured out that the problem was a vessel that I had in orbit.

I\u0027m dubious as to it\u0027s touted performance benefits as most modern hard drives are faster than a USB flash drive anyway. If you have an SSD I doubt it will do anything at all.\n\nAll of this is irrelevant for KSP, unless you have ~\u003C3GB System RAM, in which case you\u0027re barely meeting the minimum system requirements anyway - just get more RAM. Even the fastest USB stick is far, far slower than system RAM.\n\nKSPs memory issues are not generally due to running out of physical RAM, it\u0027s running out of 32bit addressable RAM. That limit is ~4GB in theory, and (on Windows) ~3.5GB in practice, regardless of how much physical memory you have installed or the size of the (virtual memory) pagefile.\n\nThe only way to circumvent that limit is to ditch 32bit addressing - i.e. a stable 64bit Unity.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T11:11:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 11:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve\\_v**"},{"CreatedByName":"remusromullus","CreatedById":147084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T11:49:44Z","Content":"I have 32bit Windows 7 and 4GB RAM...so...I am not sure if I understand well to your advice\n\n\u0022The only way to circumvent that limit is to ditch 32bit addressing - i.e. a stable 64bit Unity\u0022\n\nThank you"},{"CreatedByName":"Ignath","CreatedById":77210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T12:28:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have 32bit Windows 7 and 4GB RAM...so...I am not sure if I understand well to your advice\n\u003E \u0022The only way to circumvent that limit is to ditch 32bit addressing - i.e. a stable 64bit Unity\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E Thank you\n\nBasically steve\\_v is saying that until SQUAD comes out with a 64 bit version of KSP, these memory crashes will continue with a heavily modded install.
