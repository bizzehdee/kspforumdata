Have you tried this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter\u003C/a\u003E ? You can safely use it to convert the entire GameData/Squad folder to DDS, which should save you about half of the memory load from it, without deleting anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for actually deleting Squad assets - there is one mod that depends on them (SXT), and one that is configured by RO to take a minor advantage of them (FASA). The former will likely not work at all if you delete stock parts, the latter should work fine, except for centaur upper stages being broken. If you are OK with that, you can certainly delete the Aero and FuelTank folders. But again, I would not recommend that before pruning mod parts and trying to DDS-ify as much as possible. Applying these two (and opengl) lets me run the game with practically every supported mod (except for Laztek, which I simply find not worth its hefty memory load), 8k textures for Earth and Moon, plus EVE, Chatterer and some Texture Replacer stuff, and it pretty much never crashes. This is all on a decent, but not gaming-dedicated laptop, windows 32.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kitspace","CreatedById":109786,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T12:01:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy problem does not look like a memory crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had some of those things and so I have an impression of how do they look like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the game runs out of memory it usually crashes while something is loading or at least in the flight scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that it also leaves a message in the log saying it is out of memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of these things seem to happen in my case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crashes happen in the editor scene or when going to or from editor scene and they can happen when nothing is loading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example of such a crash I can quite easily load the game go to the assembly building leave the editor open as is for about twenty minutes and then click a mouse anywhere on the screen or even move the mouse.
