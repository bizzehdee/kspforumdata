Instead of having to put together 6 tanks and strutthem and perhaps work out fuel flow one extended tank would work. Perhaps a tweakscale style slider for length width and height.

Furthur more if you like the things the way they are now then nothing really changes of you. Even just procedural tanks would be nice. Look at the structural tubes and how those work.\u00A0This seems like a no brainer simple rockets 2 does it and the game runs very well in terms of speed.
