I\u0027ve tried sleeker rockets, payload fairings, fins, starting from 1km and slowly turning (instead of the 10km-45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 trick), etc. Even the most basic of rockets, I can barely get into an orbit.\n\n***2)*** Also, I\u0027ve looked around the forum a lot, and to me, it seems like a lot of you just want a real life simulator rather than the quirky, semi-unrealistic game that KSP is. In the area of realism, FAR mechanics sound cool, but I would rather it be in a mod than part of the core functionality of KSP.\n\nPart of what made KSP fun for me was that it was relatively easy to design a ship and get into orbit (hard in other scenarios, though; SSTOs), but you have to know what to do (or how to do it) from then on. In the small picture, making the process of getting into orbit harder means that, in this case, you have to completely relearn everything, and if you even manage to get into orbit, you have so little fuel left that you can\u0027t do anything such as a transfer to the Mun.\n\nAnother thing I heard/*somewhat* experienced is that engine thrust was messed around with, and that in space, it\u0027s less than compared to before. I completely disagree with this, no matter how realistic this new system is. The old one was good for everyone as I recall, no?\n\n**1)** Tips for the current aero?\n\n**2)** Opinions?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T03:28:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 03:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by joshtemplin3**\n  \nFixed title"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T02:46:46Z","Content":"Third thread in almost three years?!

I haven\u0027t tried to use the Rhino for liftoff yet, since I wanted to get a design that worked at all before I started going bigger.

If an absurd design would be able to fly as good as a logical design then where would be the fun in trying to build something better. Yes we were able to lunch whole space stations that had girders going all over the place and maybe as wide as 50 meters sitting on top of a rocket in that soup of an atmosphere but now its more of a challenge to build something like that and design it modular so that it can be launched."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T03:43:38Z","Content":"There\u0027s a lot of virtual ink already spilled on this subject, with many tips and advice.

There are people that don\u0027t like the current aero because it isn\u0027t realistic enough. It really is more forgiving than reality.\n\nOn the simulation-vs-game, I think it needs to be realistic enough that common sense applies, and the old aero was so far off of reality that things that there were things that would make a real rocket or aircraft perform better actually make the corresponding KSP craft worse. If it were subtle effects like ground effects, that would be one thing, but the old aero system didn\u0027t even factor the cross area of a part in determining its aerodynamic drag.\n\nOn the topic of tips to help you get to orbit, I\u0027d suggest starting off reading [this forum thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119185-A-Simple-Guide-to-Rocket-Aerodynamics%21). It\u0027s not comprehensive, but it at least touches on the reasons rockets flip during launches. The post mostly goes into rocket design, not the piloting.\n\nOn the piloting, my suggestions are:\n\n1) If you\u0027re having problems with flipping, go slow. If you\u0027re seeing mach effects, you\u0027re going fast enough to make it harder on yourself. The faster you go, the stronger the aerodynamic forces are, so if they want to flip them, going fast makes it that much harder not to flip. I tune my rockets so that they spend most of the time in the 1.3-1.7 TWR range. No, I\u0027m not saying 1.7 TWR on lift off, because your TWR will go up as you burn off fuel.\n\n2) Always keep your craft aimed within five degrees of your surface prograde marker if you\u0027re below 20-25km altitude. The farther off of prograde you point, the stronger the aerodynamic forces are. I\u0027ve got a few craft where even going that far off of prograde results in a flip.\n\nIf you\u0027ve done all this and still can\u0027t get to orbit consistently, then I\u0027d recommend posting a screenshot of your craft along with a description of your ascent profile (how fast you\u0027re going and how far you\u0027re tipping at various altitudes in the 1-20km range)."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T06:15:28Z","Content":"OK, in reverse order.\n\nOpinion - I like the new system. It didn\u0027t take long at all to get used to and my designs were pretty much all transferrable to the new aero. Maybe that\u0027s just because my previous designs were boring. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Neither am I noticing a lot of difference in how I use the engines. The Terrier still makes a decent upper stage booster for 1.25m diameter payloads and a serviceable on-orbit engine for getting larger craft (based on 2.5m parts) to the Mun and landing on it. When I start building heavier things like chunks of space stations, I expect the Poodle will be a useful replacement. Nuclear powered craft I haven\u0027t played with yet.\n\nTips: \n\n![GrCcUzm.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/GrCcUzm.png?1)\n\nNot really a tip but hopefully some encouragement. This will get to Munar orbit and back. Beyond that - what Eric S said. Watch out for Mach effects and throttle back a bit if necessary, 25km is a more reasonable height to be pointing at 45 degrees (rather than the the old 10-15km) and if you\u0027re using SRBs, it might be worth tweaking them for reduced thrust, since they can give you too much thrust to weight for light craft.\n\nGood luck!"}]}
