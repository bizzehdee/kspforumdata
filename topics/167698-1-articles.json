But you can\u0027t do that in KSP unfortunately, there is no spade or a ability to use your hands to interact with the ground or anything, but this is the idea behind it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhenever I forget a ladder or when my cockpit is to high due to long front gear then I temporarily set gravity to 0.33 in the debug menu and then use my jetpack to get back in the cockpit.

But realistically a sentient being would allow himself to build a temporary lump from dirt or even staircase/ladder from available twigs, plants etc. So with some logical reasoning it isn\u0027t a cheat, but simply a good help in the circumstance described in the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

Atleast Val should be able to get on Jeb\u0027s shoulders to reach for the cockpit hatch. Close contact behaviour is primitive in Kerbal kind. To facilitate this behaviour Kerbals require equipment, which is sad but accord.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, if your mission was already finished you can recover the Kerbal first and then the aircraft in the tracking station.
