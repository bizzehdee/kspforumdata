I have a part with 4 node connections that I would like to provide lift. \u00A0In the SPH the lift arrow icon only shows when the part is connected via the x axis. I would like it to show when connected with a different axis\u00A0( if possible)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpacetackle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-31T11:53:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2016 11:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by spacetackle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
