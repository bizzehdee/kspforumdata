Building them in situ was no problem at all, so deploying them on the final orbits with just a tiny ammount of xenon to correct courses was the most efficient way I could think of. To get to the next position of the 7, the apoapsis was changed to 3000 km for 2 orbits. Next maneuver is another circularisation, then the next sattelite is set free again.

The more parts already make up the station, the longer the docking takes, as loading times go down. While the first 6 missions were sent up with a variant of the original rocket that brought up the main factory, the last 3 use a different setup, replacing the argon engines for the transfer burn with liquid fuel ones and a cockpit that does not return to earth. On the other hand, the sideways docking on these missions forces searching for a good angle before engaging the docking pilot. Also: Always use only one type of RCS only - attempts with mixed setups of 5-way and extra strong 2-way RCS enforced aborting one missionduring docking - it ran out of RCS in an angle and I had to revert to construction. Stuck here for now, as the redesign of the ship always crashes my game during launch or I loose tanks in a collision - Getting up a payload of 3 pilots and 40 Kerbals together with 80k rocket parts and supplies for a year is hard, and splitting it down to even MORE missions makes the station FAR bigger...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I lack starting pics (I curse myself!, but HUGE ammounts of tanks tend to make the game crash... and I can\u0027t seem to press screenshot often enough) I have quite some of the docking, of the successes docking.

To faciliate easier resupplying, a general change in the transport design is planned - instead of transporting hundreds of small containers, all transportation should be done in 5m Kontainers, the same ones that make up the CargoTail that leaked. To keep the station small, any subequent parts should be docked to a structural array, branching out. To ease docking and allow to move shipments from the rear end to an other dock, a pair of robo-arms is added - and already a relief mission is on the weay with the crew that forgot to get their bus to the launch platform, some RCS fuel and an emervency generator as well as food, so the Kerbals don\u0027t freeze as they work on the project...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/JJOay/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-21T14:40:36Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2016 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Friethjoph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Friethjoph","CreatedById":153491,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-20T18:31:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPhase 2\u003C/strong\u003E - I did set up the KPS network by now (and forgot photos of how I did it - daaaam)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPhase 3\u003C/strong\u003E - ..but now I never loose connection anymore when delivering a cargo up to the station, if I don\u0027t forget to switch on the larger antenna on the transports.

A fuel rover Mk1 is sufficient for only 5000 Material kits, and up there I need 60k to build a 320k storeage to allow a break-free construction of the SH \u0022Dres\u0022. Comes time, comes efficiency, right? Why do I use a ground base at all? The larger containers are near impossible top get up into orbit, especially the 160k ones. But bringing them to the ground base on wheels with only a 100k load per container and shooting the stuff up with the USI Module (and loads of LF-O) is much easier. Still, it is a PITA to get enough LF-O to the station. So the obvious solution: Bigger fuel rover Mk2 (75x red Rokomax tanks!). Like REALLY big.

Then the supply station blew up - with our brave engineer luckily outside - so the new setup was smaller in parts count - who needs 12 solar panels per transport when a full side mounted battery is enough to bring the thing to the deployment place 2.3 km from the end of the runway? about 900000 Material kits and 160000 specialized parts were gathered to be brought to orbit, where storage for said 900000 Material kits already was present and those storeages for the other materials in construction... but even an extended, 90 red rokomax fuel transport only was able to shoot at best a third into orbit... well, rinse and repeat, isn\u0027t that the core of KSP? meanwhile the Technicans think about what other storeages will have to be brought up... the solution: actually none, because between finalizing the ship and releasing it, it can be filled up... But we will do so anyway - safer than storing 80k nuclear fuel on the ground, and we need to bring supplies to keep the Kerbals working. Still hauling materials to the re-setup ground base (yea, those things tend to blow up at times....) and then up... at least \u0027up\u0027 stores about most of the needed materials up to now...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/9g8dv/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Friethjoph","CreatedById":153491,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-24T00:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand, since I showed this as ReadPanda was streaming, a little sneakpeak to the actual SpaceHulk - you only see less than a half, maybe only a third of the ship!
