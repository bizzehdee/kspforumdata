Your concept violates the golden rule of game design: you do not take control away from the player. Whenever you have a dilemma of game design wherein players favor grind over variety, the answer is not to \u003Cem\u003Eforce\u003C/em\u003E variety, it is to \u003Cem\u003Eincentivize\u003C/em\u003E variety. Taking the option away by making the player suffer an inferior system is never a good idea, especially not if said system hinges upon a random number generator (which the contract system currently does).\u003Cp\u003E A better solution to this entire problem of contract spam is to give players more incentive to actually run missions that don\u0027t involve contract spam. Which forces us to ask the essential question: \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy\u003C/strong\u003E are players spamming those contracts? The answer is simple: they\u0027re easy, they pay well, and they\u0027re basically impossible to fail. The takeaway from this is that the alternatives are too difficult, don\u0027t pay nearly well enough, and/or are very easy to fail. My go-to example at this point of bad contracts are the aerial/visual surveys. Their payout is atrociously bad for what they ask you to do, their precision requirements are excessive, their engineering requirements are excessive, and ultimately they take far too long to complete. Adjustments are badly in need for this variety of contract, for as it stands, they just take up space on the mission control contract list to tempt players who haven\u0027t tried them yet and don\u0027t yet realize that they\u0027re horrible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, by its nature, career mode imposes constraints on what the player may do. They can\u0027t use whatever parts they want, they have to unlock them first. They can\u0027t build whatever spacecraft they want, they need to able to afford it. And even if they can afford it, they may need to upgrade buildings to be able to launch it. For that matter, even sandbox mode imposes constraints on the player, because they have to use the parts that are available, with the stats they are given. So, I don\u0027t see limiting the player\u0027s options as inherently a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I disagree that this limits player control. Under the time-based system, the player has an option to leave a science probe in orbit. They can choose to take and use all of the science contracts they get. But, there\u0027s a trade-off. There\u0027s up-keep to having that probe, it takes up a slot that could be used for another mission, and so on. You can choose to get some easy, more or less certain income, or forgo the probe and perform another, potentially more lucrative mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat the RNG is an issue is a fair point. So, I\u0027ll revise my proposal. Instead of having the number of contracts offered in a certain time period be limited in number, the number you can accept is limited by the level of your mission control center. I still think that that declining missions should have some cost, even if it\u0027s a small one, so that players have to make a choice about whether to try and get a better contract or go with a less-than-perfect one they have right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reduce the role that the whims of the RNG play, contracts are offered in categories, including type and location. So, if you decline a Kerbin part test contract, you get another Kerbin part test contract back. Likewise with Mun survey, Minmus satellite, and so on. This should keep a broad enough variety of contracts open that there\u0027s no need to keep hunting for the particular sort of contract you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me also put the problem with orbital science contracts into a single sentence: \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThey are pay-once missions with the potential for arbitrarily large payoffs.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\u0027s compare them to the aerial survey missions with increased payouts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. An aerial survey mission has to reach a particular location. If it\u0027s not in that location, it needs to be moved there. An orbital science mission just needs to be in orbit, and with the right parameters can be used to get high and low altitude orbital science. If it\u0027s not at the right altitude, a brief bit of time acceleration can get it into the right place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. An aerial survey mission has to expend fuel to reach its locations. If you want to keep using the same craft for surveys, you need to refuel it. This costs funds. An orbital science probe, on the other hand, costs exactly 0 funds to use over and over again. Assuming it doesn\u0027t intersect any atmospheres or SOI boundaries, it will remain in the exact same orbit indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Flying craft to new locations is interesting. Grinding for funds with the same orbital science mission is boring. Here the advantage is to the survey missions, since they have you do new things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you can offset the advantages the orbital science missions have by increasing the payouts aerial survey missions have. But...how much higher do they need to be? What is the appropriate increase over zero-effort, zero-cost missions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the payouts for survey missions should be increased, there also shouldn\u0027t be zero-effort, zero-cost contracts. The only way I can see to balance them is to make them too trivial to bother with, and that\u0027s not a good option, either (see Note 1). I\u0027d much rather that there be some costs involved, so that you can weigh the pros and cons of doing one over the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote 1: There are other zero-effort, zero-cost contracts already in the game. They\u0027re the \u0022Test parts while landed at Kerbin\u0022 contracts. You get a 100% refund for recovering vessels on the launchpad, so they cost nothing. Similarly, it takes no particular effort to run a part test. However, the payouts are so low that most people simply don\u0027t bother with them. They do have some use in a \u0022Drag yourself back from bankruptcy\u0022 role, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T21:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the \u0022spam advance\u0022 problem, a limited number of advance contracts could be set (or funds total, like a \u0022loan\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T22:03:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022armagheddonsgw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022armagheddonsgw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat thing can fly at mach 5 with FAR?
