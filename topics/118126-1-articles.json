Having only non-gimballing engines makes the controlling rockets harder and having only tiny fuel tanks makes them over-wobbly and potentially shows up lag. Those are both things that make the demo play worse than the full game which I can\u0027t see as being a good thing."},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T23:58:10Z","Content":"Yeah, I think all FL-T tanks shoukd be available, and basic docking."},{"CreatedByName":"Thantos","CreatedById":157176,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-17T23:30:08Z","Content":"Hey, um Pecan I tried to make the rocket you did but it kept on going up then destroy everything I know and love in Kerbal Space Program.
