I agree with what Slashy wrote, but I\u0027d like to add one thing - your experiment only goes to 1600 LFO (8 FL-T200 tanks). This is enough fuel mass for the smaller and lighter engines like Ant or Spark, but doesn\u0027t really give the bigger guys a chance to get anywhere (poor Mammoth doesn\u0027t even get to 2km/s dV). I see it has to be a lot of work putting everything together in-game and taking measurements one at a time, but you could, if you wanted to, repeat the process with bigger fuel tanks for the bigger engines. Or, you could calculate the values for all engines and all necessary fuel values in any increments using a suitable software (like Excel, which I\u0027m assuming you made the nice graph in). This would tell you when exactly do the bigger engines get the dV budget you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a bonus, you can then add a static mass for payload to the simulation, and even start easily calculating multi-staged designs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep up the good work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T02:24:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically you\u0027ve got two things to consider.
