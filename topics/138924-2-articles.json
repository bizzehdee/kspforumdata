I\u0027m glad to finally see a serious discussion about the problem. I freely admit that I know very little about the specifics of mono or .NET framework, but when I see and hear about how this miracle of code can run on multiple platforms from a variety of manufacturers, I become suspicious. Of course, we also have Java, which is much the same, but with Java, it falls to the user to install Java, along with its runtime environment, and ensure that it is up to date, a little bit different than with the \u0022forced\u0022 updates from Micro$oft. I haven\u0027t had any serious problems with Minecraft or it\u0027s many public releases over the last few years.

I also expect that in time, many of the issues that we currently face with the game will be ironed out. Fine, no problem. I can deal with that, and would be happy, privileged even, to take part and help with the ongoing development of the game. But, when I\u0027m fed a line of crap like I was with the recent exclusive Steam release, it is an insult to what little intelligence that I have. I have very little sympathy for the political maneuvering involved with the push to release on consoles or the new \u0022walmart\u0022 of the internet, Steam. Greed comes into play. Dollar signs begin floating in peoples head, and the noble intentions around the game, education and awareness about space flight in general, become clouded. My frustration with this process comes not from the problems with Unity and KSP and crashes, but rather the lack of open and honest dialogue, like we see here in this thread, from Squad on the issue. I also realize that I am wishing for what amounts to a developers utopia, where everything just falls into place and works like it should. I guess the point of my rambling is that there are more issues that need to be, or could be, addressed besides just mono and .NET that could help stabilize the overall product and keep people like me involved with the project, rather than sitting on the sidelines and feeling discarded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T09:52:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222562501\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138924\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462437755\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278020\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, AlamoVampire said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nkinda like, how one is allocated money in paycheck would be the between ksp/host os and what you BUY with said paycheck would be the with in mono?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess you could say that, Let\u0027s say the OS is giving mono the paycheck, and mono is spending it on running KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I say \u0022KSP\u0022 I mean squads code in KSP_Data, \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the KSP.exe / KSP.x86_64 executable - that\u0027s actually the Unity player in disguise.

Hence the popularity of Unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not particularly articulate explaining such things in layman\u0027s terms, and my own knowledge is somewhat limited, but here goes my \u003Cs\u003Etake\u003C/s\u003E lengthy ramble on this bug:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMono abstracts memory management for the code it runs, it asks the OS for a bunch of memory, then parcels it out to managed code.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf managed code running in the mono runtime, lets say KSP or a KSP mod, wants more memory than mono has already obtained from the OS then mono will ask for more.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the managed code stops using that memory, monos garbage collector comes along, notices it\u0027s not being used any more, and frees it so that mono can give it back.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSide note: The garbage collector \u0022stutter\u0022 that some people (me for one) are getting liquidy about is happening because the garbage collector temporarily pauses execution of managed code (KSP) while it does this scan for unused memory. Result: sudden lag spike every few seconds. The more unused memory there is to free the worse this gets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe error that accompanies the crashes I\u0027m seeing is: \u0022*** Error in \u0060./KSP.x86_64\u0027: double free or corruption\u0022 This is followed by a stack trace, and KSP dies with \u0022aborted\u0022 printed to the console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose errors are coming the from the OS memory management functions (Glibc), free() is the call that mono/Unity will be making to the OS to \u0022give back\u0022 memory it doesn\u0027t need any more.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoing this free() twice for the same bit of memory is a very, very bad idea as free()ing will wipe whatever that memory contained. If mono has already told the OS that it can have it back, then goes and nukes it again, strange and unpredictable things are bound to happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn normal operation mono will ask for memory, put something in it, free it, ask for more (probably getting the same memory location it just freed because that\u0027s convenient for the OS), put something in it, and so on in rapid-fire fashion to meet the needs of the code it\u0027s running.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf it frees some memory that has already been freed and reused elsewhere the contents of that bit of memory are now going to be either nothing or garbage, depending on the order of operations. There\u0027s no way to tell, and chaos (and random crashes) ensue.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGlibc has a \u0022memory police\u0022 function, and it will kill (\u0022abort\u0022) anything it catches doing this. This is a good plan as crashing immediately is generally better than letting it get away with corrupting it\u0027s own memory - otherwise it\u0027s going to crash sooner or later anyway, and in a way that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E hard to debug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFiguring out exactly where mono/Unity is doing this double free(), without source code and/or help from the unity devs is not going to be easy, if it\u0027s possible at all. Compounding this is the fact that Unity is multithreaded - multiple instances(threads) of mono will be running at the same time, and if they step on each others memory things \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E go boom sooner or later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ENote for any coders that read this and are horrified: I realise this is not entirely accurate, I\u0027m trying (and failing) to simplify. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-05T10:03:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2016 10:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by steve_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T10:06:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69272-steve_v/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002269272\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69272-steve_v/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@steve_v\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Kinda makes sense sorta.

I then started up KSP and went into the SPH. I started designing a simple plane with modded parts... about 20 minutes in....BAM.. \u0022KSP_x64.exe has stopped working\u0022 Back to looking at my wallpaper...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best explanation I can come up with is the same that others have theorized: there is something fundamentally wrong with Unity 5, in the way that it handles calls for memory. When I got to thinking about it, it makes sense, and reminds me of a personal experience. Back in 2009 I built a gaming PC, with an air cooled i7 965. I didn\u0027t know it at the time, but it had a cooling problem. You wouldn\u0027t know it to look at the case, or even to use it for everyday use/gaming. It idled at 30 degrees, and only got up to around 55 on intense games. However, if you stress tested it, with Prime95, or any similar program, it would heat up like a nuclear inferno, to 100C and then shut down... though it was basically stable, stressing it made it cry uncle and quit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApplying that story to KSP and Unity 5, Squad tested their build running stock.. Stock KSP is not that taxing on the Unity engine, and will run more or less without problems. Once mods are added in, it makes it become more stressful on the engine... the more mods added, the more the stress level.. mods are acting as Prime95 did on my old PC; making Unity cry uncle and quit. That is why when I have 5 small mods added, I won\u0027t notice much change, but when 20 mods are added, including big memory hog parts mods, the game may run 5 minutes before quitting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSO.. in summary, we basically have the same system as we did with Unity 4 and 32 bit KSP... mods have to be limited to avoid crashing.. how ironic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EI note that some folks are having crash problems with stock, and others are running 20\u002B mods without issue. I\u0027m willing to bet that the stability is based on PC performance, beefy top end gaming PCs can run a metric ton of mods with few issues, mid range PCs are crashing with mods, and potatoes are crashing with stock.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisproven: The crashes are not related to overall PC performance, and seem to be at near complete random.
