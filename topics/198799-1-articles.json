I noticed the delta v was incorrect when looking at a craft I built before the update.\u00A0 I did some testing, and now the mod will not let me see the delta v stats when putting a booster on. I would have to put the booster on, grab another random item from the item list, and then immediately drop the item for the delta v stats to show up. I also noticed that when I added more parts to my vessel, parts that did not have any fuel, my delta v would go up. I tested this by building a craft with 2,000 delta v, then stacked like 3 mobile processing labs on top of it, and the delta v changed from 2,000 to 7,000 with no added fuel and only added weight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was wondering if yall have experienced this or heard about issues with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E with update 11.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, I have never used this forum before and just started playing ksp about a month ago.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-18T12:02:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a change to the way KSP calculates delta-V values, maybe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E needs an update to match it?
