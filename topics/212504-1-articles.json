I promise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(today is not that day, though)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of you may know that prior to the EA release I posted a very long, but reasonable (in my view) post honestly and dispassionately assessing the EA footage of the game, and the fact that the game seemed to be releasing in a VERY, VERY early state, which is not advantageous unless they need cash, imminently. (now in the pre-release discussion archives: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/212173-reading-into-ksp-2-ea-featuresnon-features/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/212173-reading-into-ksp-2-ea-featuresnon-features/\u003C/a\u003E). However, I was cautiously optimistic, and very open to being proven wrong. I\u0027ve played just over 3 hours of the game, and I feel that the hysteria on this forum around the FPS is misplaced. In my view, EA games aren\u0027t optimized, ya just gotta deal with it. My post is not about poor performance. I suspect that both the people complaining about low FPS, and defending the game for having low FPS because it\u0027s EA haven\u0027t played much more than 2 or 3 hours yet, because, as the title of this thread states, FPS is not the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI planned on spending the whole day and night on the game, low FPS be damned. But after 3 hours, I turned the game off and I\u0027m doing other things (like posting on this forum I guess- I should really get more hobbies). The truth is this: the number of game-breaking bugs in this release is staggering. I haven\u0027t seen a livestreamer who didn\u0027t have a similar experience to mine: over the course of a 3-4 hour play session, I experienced multiple bugs that caused me to quickload, several bugs which appeared once I quickloaded, and finally a bug where the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E spawned in on my craft and irrevocably followed me around everywhere, even in the tracking center and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. This spawned version of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E even had collidable trees, which I found out when atmo drag slowed my spacecraft, causing it to crash into the tree at an altitude of 30km and explode. I tried saving and reloading the game, and I upon loading the save, I have a black screen. I had to force quit the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy issue is not poor performance. It\u0027s not even bugs, or game-breaking bugs. I\u0027m fine with bugs, truly. I was LOOKING FORWARD to finding and reporting bugs. My issue is this: the sheer number, frequency, and variety of game-breaking bugs present in this release make the game virtually unplayable. Youtubers Beardy Penguin and Carnasa have agreed with this publicly- more will soon probably follow. To be clear: THERE IS NO GAME-DEVELOPMENT REASON TO RELEASE A GAME INTO EARLY ACCESS WHEN IT IS IN A NEARLY UNPLAYABLE STATE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sheer volume of bugs had to have been present and known about before the release. They said they were releasing in order to gather player feedback, and me and a few other forum members had what I thought was a nice, civil, intelligent discussion about the validity of this game, pre-launch. We agreed to wait and see. After waiting and seeing I can say this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game was NOT released because they were at the step of development where they needed community feedback. There are clear, frequent game-breaking bugs that need solving. Any playtester (were there paid playtesters? I\u0027m given to wonder...) who spent 3\u002B hours with the game would tell them this. They say the\u0027ve had tons of fun playing and experimenting themselves with the game- I find that hard to believe. My only conclusion is this: they needed an influx of cash. What to do with? Who can say. Maybe T2 has lost faith in the developers, and this is them cutting their losses. See my now-archived post about reading into EA features/lack of features for a full, logical explanation of why this is a plausible state of reality. Maybe, the upside of all of this, is that with this new cash they can pursue development whole-heartedly and finish the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, judging based off of my personal experience, and the game\u0027s current Steam rating of 48% positive, which is heartbreaking to me, I wouldn\u0027t expect many players to have the game long enough to give good feedback. I suspect mass refunds are likely taking place, and I myself am holding out for a developer response to all this before I decide to do the same. The only reason why I haven\u0027t yet put in for a refund request is because I want to wait and see what the devs will say, and how soon the next patch rolls out, and because I\u0027m fortunate enough to be in a position where $50 isn\u0027t a big deal for me. If it was... I would\u0027ve refunded after my first hour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, as a community, what should we do? I\u0027m not trying to preach- I\u0027m posing an honest, good-faith question. I can think of two scenarios, which dictate two different actions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) T2 is looking for high EA sales to justify continue funding the project. In this case, we should NOT refund the game, and try to give the dev team the benefit of the doubt that they haven\u0027t lost faith in the project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) T2 is looking to cut KSP 2 loose after finding themselves many years, and millions of dollars deeper into KSP 2 than they ever thought they would have to be, and with a product that is still sub-par and far from finished, and high EA sales will allow them to justify doing this. In this case, we ought to REFUND the game in order to force T2 to fund the dev team and finish the game, or accept a massive loss, likely at least on the order of tens, to even a couple hundred million dollars (reasonable estimate for what the game has cost them so far, including marketing, etc.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to end this message by saying that I ADORE KSP, and it\u0027s not anger, but sadness that prompts me to write this post. I want to appeal to the KSP 2 development team: now is a critical time when you will likely either earn the faith of the broader KSP 2 community, or lose that faith entirely. It is imperative that you both 1) Communicate CLEARLY AND COMPLETELY how and why the game was released in this state, and why we, as a community, shouldn\u0027t back out of the $50 dollar promise we bought into: that the game would release in a state that, while unfinished, would remotely inspire the confidence eventually be finished, and 2) Begin solving these truly game-breaking issues as QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, releasing game updates on a DAILY-WEEKLY, NOT MONTHLY basis. Yes, it is true that game development is chaotic and timelines are unpredictable. But that ship has sailed (or lifted-off \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E) - you have released the game, and are charging $50. This community is pretty intelligent, and generally showed understanding when the game needed to be delayed. Comment sections across the internet were dominated by the sentiment: \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Take your time. Do it right.\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E They stuck with the project because they believed in earnest that the game was being delayed so that when it released, at whatever stage of development, they were getting at least a playable, fun, \u003Cstrong\u003Epromising\u003C/strong\u003E experience. We as a community have held up our end of the bargain- we have bought the EA, evidently in large numbers, despite the price, and despite the poor performance we knew we were getting. When you take a step back you realize that this is truly remarkable- not many other fanbases have done the same. You have NOT held up your end of the bargain thus far- delivering a largely unplayable project despite the many delays, with a level of broken-ness that CANNOT be described as \u0022understandable\u0022, or \u0022forgivable\u0022, let alone \u0022promising\u0022. Now it is time to make things right, by acknowledging the mistakes of the past, and beginning to deliver serious results. I suspect that if the next week or two go the right way, the KSP fanbase will probably be largely very forgiving. But changes will need to come fast. Again, totally susceptible to the \u0022game development is chaotic, timelines are unpredictable\u0022 argument BEFORE you charged $50 for the game that was released. Despite the near-unrelenting negativity of this post, there are still some great additions/changes and it\u0027s clear that the dev team has a deep passion- it shines through in places like sound design, and UI improvements. Here\u0027s a link to a thread where people are listing all the things they love about the game so far, which I think is a nice counterpoint to this post: (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/212492-praise-and-things-we-like/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/212492-praise-and-things-we-like/\u003C/a\u003E).\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EI wish nothing but the best for to the KSP 2 dev team, and sincerely hope the project is not in nearly as dire of a state as it appears to be; that this post has all been an emotional overreaction, hyperbole that will soon fade and be remembered as a brief moment, overshadowed and invalidated by an incredible, successful game.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTl;dr-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AN044_PRINT_edited.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002270.30\u0022 height=\u0022438\u0022 width=\u0022623\u0022 src=\u0022https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a7b3b3_da0dd6a744b2413789693b6eefcfa744~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_623,h_438,al_c,lg_1,q_80,enc_auto/AN044_PRINT_edited.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbugs, lots of bugs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T02:14:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 02:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by VlonaldKerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEdited for balance, emphasis, and clarity.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flipflops","CreatedById":194361,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T23:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you\u0027re missing a 3rd scenario.

It is inarguable that the current state of the game is not worth $50... it\u0027s probably worth like $10 max. Thus, $40 of what you are paying is speculative value, a \u0022bet on the future of [the] game.\u0022 While some amount of betting on a promise is acceptable to me, in my view, it shouldn\u0027t be 80% of the price of the release, which I think it is here. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis is why a lot of people have a sour taste in their mouths about the price.\u003C/strong\u003E I think the community outrage would be much less if the game cost $20-$25 in its current state, which seems reasonable to me- $10 for current value, so a ratio of ~50% speculative value seems appropriate for an EA title, if a little too large even still for a game in this early of a state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the exact Steam rules are less important than the general ethos of the rules, which speaks to what EA really ought to mean.

Just because it is EA, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s okay for many (most?) of what little game features we do have to be unusable/unplayable due to bugs. \u003Cstrong\u003EThat is not what EA is for\u003C/strong\u003E, from a moral/principle standpoint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNowhere is this more evident than in the comment sections of KSP 2 videos made by Youtubers who haven\u0027t really touched the KSP franchise before. The audience of those videos is mostly people who have never heard of KSP, and this release is their first impression of the franchise as a whole. These are unbiased, outside observers, and their opinion is \u003Cstrong\u003Enear-unanimous\u003C/strong\u003E: \u0022The game has potential, and it would be fair to charge $20 for it in its very, very young EA state. However, $50 feels like robbery\u0022 (that last sentence is actually a direct quote). Again, these are outside observers- they know what an EA is supposed to be and they know this isn\u0027t it- at least not at a price point of $50. Almost all the positive or cheery comments in their comment section are KSP fans who are excited that someone new seems to be trying the game, which speaks to the level of rose-colored glasses/the bubble which some of the KSP community seems to be living in. I would be surprised if these \u0022new KSP players\u0022 will be playing the game for long, at least if the state of the game doesn\u0027t improve quickly and dramatically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really, really hope we get some kind of statement from the devs about this.

I get a good vibe from the dev team; they seem to really care, and I want them to succeed. But the discrepancy between messaging like this and the product we received chips away at that image. In my mind, when it comes to a speculative project like this, the image of the devs (and the truth about them!) is paramount. I think at this juncture it\u0027s really important for the devs to take steps to restore trust in the eyes of the community.
