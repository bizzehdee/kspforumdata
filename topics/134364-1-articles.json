While ATM may have a few other features, its main thing was compressing and rsizing the KSP pre-v1.0 textures to DXT1 \u0026amp; DXT5 (.dds)... But Squad went and pretty much did this to the stock game in v1.0.0, making ATM mostly redundant... Here we are 5 releases into .dds format, and over a year, so the majority of mods have also converted...So unless you have a BUNCH of old, or non-dds mods, you wont gain much if anything from ATM anymore...Use DTL instead...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess there\u0027s some discussion/evidence that DirectX11 works better than DX9 AND OpenGL, and is less resource intensive...??\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo try forcing either DirectX11 or OpenGL...\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd FYI for others, Linux also natively uses OpenGL already... (Though I HAVE heard there are fixes to run DirectX9, (maybe even DX11?) on Linux...??)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOT: I usually can push 100~120 mods... But probably 60~80 are pure plugins/.cfg hacks/MM patches... Then maybe 20~30 small parts packs... Definately less than a dozen parts each, if that...Then I usually might be able to manage 2, maybe 3 large parts packs.. Like a few dozen parts or more each... No graphics/beautification mods for me... I run with very minimal graphics settings, and the BEST FPS I can get, with the first couple dozen plugin mods only, is around 30~33fps, and gets as bad as 12~15fps, or worse once EVERYTHING I can stuff is installed...I generally play my heavily modded games on Linux now, and mostly just do light to moderate mod testing on Windows... Tho I used to run heavily modded all on Windows before that...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-17T04:01:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2016 04:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"supraman","CreatedById":136660,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T18:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks for the tips guys, I switched to openGL and that seems to be helping a lot!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
