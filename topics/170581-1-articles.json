Now I get back to it only to find my mining ship is embedded into the asteroid so far that the drills won\u0027t work (I presume they are too far in to make contact with the \u0022surface\u0022), the first set of solar panels I have on the ship are also embedded in the asteroid! If I try and release the Klaw, I get a kaboom every time (however I try and disengage; stability ON/OFF,; autostrut ON/OFF).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresuming this is a known bug, anyone know of a way to get my ship away from the asteroid in one piece? I built a new ship, grabbed a new asteroid and tried again. I now have two asteroids in Duna orbit both with ships embedded in them!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-07T14:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a known bug -- the \u0022morphing asteroid\u0022 bug.

I fear I may have grabbed onto the asteroids at a \u0022low point\u0022 in their seeds as I\u0027ve changed focus a few times (re-started KSP, done other tasks etc) but they still stay embedded.
