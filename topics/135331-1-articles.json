In the end a messenger-style path was used as it was best. The real probe flew by Venus twice then Mercury twice and entered Mercury orbit on its third pass, Metaphor did 8 flybys of Moho to cut his arrival speed down incredibly low. If you look closely at the albums you can figure out at what times they launched and did their flybys. Note that back then there was only Earth time (24 hour days/365 day years). It took a lot more dV to get into Kerbin orbit back then too, so take that into account in your dV estimates for a modern mission. Some other people have done Messenger-style trips since then, but no one has ever beaten Metaphor\u0027s trip. That strategy of flying by Mercury and then doing a deep-space maneuver to correct for your next Mercury flyby is \u003Cem\u003Ehard\u003C/em\u003E. (For me anyway!) But it can cut the total dV required by 30% over a standard Hohmann trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
