If the half of the orbits behind the objects were partially washed out like in Space Engine, this would not be an issue.

The only time I can get confused is rendezvousing with polar orbits because those DO change direction (relative to the surface).

I\u0027m just so used to it now, I forget there\u0027s other kinds). At most, a couple of seconds, but yeah, I\u0027m not adverse to direction indication per se, just adverse to something that generates screen clutter unnecessarily like arrows - fading orbital lines is a great idea that fits my personal criteria and I would have no complaint if it got added.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T22:44:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow this is one of those ideas that I never even thought of as a problem, but would still make my life way easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI aprove\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wadusher0","CreatedById":105513,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T23:05:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow on earth can you even do that.. you were the one who put them there.\u003Cp\u003EWRT your question, I don\u0027t see the harm in fading the orbital line a bit to show direction, but I do object to arrows and stuff which generate screen clutter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes I forget which direction I transferred the ships in.
