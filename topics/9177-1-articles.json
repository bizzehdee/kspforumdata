But I\\\u0027m running into a navigating issue! I nearly nailed the transfer to the craft I set in a farther out planet-like orbit, but I found the closer to syncing orbits to get closer, the orbit lines would vanish, making any more corrections impossible! Zooming out is the only option, and that far out I can\\\u0027t get very accurate. Has anyone run into this issue? Or how to work around it? Pictures included.
