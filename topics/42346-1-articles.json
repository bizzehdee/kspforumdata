I want it to also act as a outpost, possibly a radio tower after landing, but still be able to re-attach and get back to orbit (i like to get the most out of everything, less rockets sent, more functionality per module).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econsider that i want it to have the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~ landing legs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~ 2 clamp-o-trons (one on top, one on bottom for attaching the rover.
