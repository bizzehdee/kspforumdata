Disabling MechJeb\u0027s autostaging allowed me to circumvent this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if it just a compatibility glitch or an omission from the start, but I feel the FLAT really should store some electric charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly was something that was partly my fault and partly something I don\u0027t yet understand. I had the FLAT configured with the landing gear and a small engine. Below the engine I placed a stack separator and a heat shield, so that it could be jettisoned after atmo entry. Naturally however, attaching a 2.5m stack separator to a 0.625m engine creates only a 0.625m interstage adapter and things get weird, especially if you use the offset tool to \u0022correct\u0022 it. Ultimately it sort of meant I tore the engine off when separating the heat shield, which I kind of achieved by a method called \u0022hitting the ground at 40 m/s\u0022. Amazingly all the essentials survived intact, including the FLAT, the command core and the solar panels on top (actually attached to the core). It rolled along the surface for a while before coming to a rest on its side. Now I don\u0027t know if it was just a matter of the core (RC-001S RGU) not having enough torque to move the thing, but it read the torque as idle regardless of whether I moved it manually or tried to orient it with MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, can you add the option to toggle off the rotation on the Centrifugium? Kinda weird that it can start spinning but then only reverse rotation and not just stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should add a disclaimer that I manually updated the Firespitter and LayeredAnimations plugins to override those bundled with this pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t think of any compatibility issues that I experience with the FLAT in 1.0.4 ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s certainly nothing in the pack that would cause the staging issues you described and in your own words it stopped happening when MechJeb\u0027s autostaging was disabled. It would help to know more about the craft, some pictures or a craft file. But something about that craft makes MJ think that it needed to keep staging, either its design or a decoupler from another mod that MJ doesn\u0027t recognize as a decoupler. Those are the only two reasons I know of behind unwanted staging in MJ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to lack of electric charge, an omission at worst; a choice by Porkjet at best. You\u0027re certainly entitled to the opinion that it should have electric charge but I point out to you that there are quite a few crewed modules do not have resources at all. (keep in mind that unless it\u0027s a command pod and/or has reaction wheels that most crewed parts don\u0027t have ElectricCharge resource)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobe","CreatedById":95803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T17:05:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere\u0027s certainly nothing in the pack that would cause the staging issues you described and in your own words it stopped happening when MechJeb\u0027s autostaging was disabled.
