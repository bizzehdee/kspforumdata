As the title says, I am running into an odd issue where there is some type of artifact all the way around my screen in KSP2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KSP2SCREENISSUE.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022677\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://u.cubeupload.com/Boat_Rower/KSP2SCREENISSUE.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis only occurs when actually flying a rocket (from takeoff to anything in orbit, basically the launch pad loads in like shown above), it doesn\u0027t happen on the home screen, any of the load screens, or in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is happening regardless of graphics settings in the game (it does the same thing on max or min settings). My base PC specs are: RTX2070 Super, i5-9600k, 32 GB ram.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game runs with CPU at ~50%, memory at ~50% and GPU at 100% (for all in game graphics settings), and my frame rate is pretty decent at all times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI searched around the web and couldn\u0027t see anyone else having this same issue. Has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone know a fix?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T10:13:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/226239-boat-rower/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022226239\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/226239-boat-rower/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Boat Rower\u003C/a\u003E, your problem has been moved from KSP 2 Discussion to KSP 2 Tech support for better visibility.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Baleine","CreatedById":131757,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T10:45:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose artifacts have been added because you are in the simulator \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush2:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/blush2.png\u0022 title=\u0022:blush2:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T10:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a really cool feature and it\u0027s on purpose - to remind you that you\u0027re in the simulator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
