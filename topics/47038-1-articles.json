The Cassini mission utilized not one, but \u003Cem\u003Etwo\u003C/em\u003E gravity assists from Venus, followed by a gravity assist from Earth, and finally one more from Jupiter before continuing on to Saturn. I don\u0027t know how I\u0027d even begin to start planning something like that. I\u0027m curious if anyone here has managed anything that roundabout for their missions to the outer planets, and if so, if it was just for the challenge, or because their computer couldn\u0027t handle high part numbers for more delta-v, or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just_Testing","CreatedById":54382,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T23:54:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I unfortunately cannot help you with your quest, I am also extremely interested in how one would go about something like this, and I also very much approve of your username.

First get an intercept, any intercept. Then you have a very narrow range of intercept angles and velocities, but by changing the displacement (using a small adjustment far in advance) you end up with a wide variety (two degrees of freedom) of possible output angles and velocities. Some of these lead to subsequent intercepts, some do not. Right now I search for these by trial and error by tugging on the maneuver nodes for a while, but it would be possible to find all reachable intercepts within a given time horizon. Each of these subsequent intercepts will have an associated intercept angle and velocity and again displacement would be adjustable with small corrections (adjusting even before the first intercept if precision is high enough).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would ultimately produce a tree of potential intercepts that are reachable with only tiny course corrections, exploiting the chaotic nature of orbits. If your initial intercept has enough velocity, and the body has enough mass, the choices multiply to the point you can get pretty much anywhere for free. What\u0027s missing is the program to compute the transport network, but it definitely has me interested.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
