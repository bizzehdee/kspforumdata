I am using MKS and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support, with the lowest levels of Interstellar Extended\u0027s power and propulsion tech unlocked. In short, no transit times to Jool that would be less than two years or so, at least while carrying a reasonable (30\u002B) number of passengers per trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI plan to use the Cycler to only carry colonists, building more as time goes on to eventually have a voyage every year\u00A0or so. Cargo deliveries can be done with traditional Hohmann Transfers. Unfortunately my math and coding skills are not up to the task of determining masses and orbital parameters for this vehicle. I am hoping you nice folks can help me figure these parts out. My questions are as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. How many ships would be needed for one to arrive at Jool every year?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. What would be the parameters of the Cycler\u0027s initial orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. How much Delta-V would I need for course changes, ideally or worst case, per trip? Could I use the Joolian moons to reduce this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Is there a more resource-efficient way of doing this cost-wise? I figure that the Cyclers will pay themselves off within two or three voyages because the fuel and construction costs\u00A0to carry the supplies and crew would be far greater for a similar ship that had to decelerate at either end of the voyage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I unlock the more powerful fusion drives this design will be obsolete, but in the interim I have contracts to do things near Jool, and I want to simulate the rotation of specialist personnel that such a facility would experience. As for off-world infrastructure, I currently have a mining and science base on both the Mun and Minmus, a big orbital fuel processor\u00A0around Minmus, Science/tourism station orbiting\u00A0the Mun, a science base on Duna with a fuel plant on Ike, and a fuel depot in Geosynchronous orbit over Kerbin, with smaller tugs to carry fuel to crafts in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"oAsAo","CreatedById":178832,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-06T16:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is really hard i gonna say. You probably will be bored by placing them into orbits already and maintaining them not gonna be easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell. If i got it right (which might be not) there is cycle with 34 of them, or you can go with 11 and more fuel for every trip/on corrections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(And i just failed test in sandbox.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-06T18:32:13Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2018 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by oAsAo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kmMango","CreatedById":109375,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-06T20:06:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you post screenshots?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
