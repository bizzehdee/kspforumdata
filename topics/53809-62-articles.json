I had a similar problem last week, where I updated several things at the same time, and it broke ATM. I never figured out exactly what it was though, no matter what I removed or reverted I couldn\u0027t fix it.

I feel this is a KSP problem in general with the 0.23.5 version. Had the same version of 0.23 for months, modded the hell out of it and it still works perfectly, upgrade to 0.23.5 and it really started messing up after a couple of weeks. What I did was copy the entire Game Data folder to desktop, put KSP folder in bin, re-install from my mirror, remove old squad / nasa parts from copied game data, merged both Game Data folders and still works perfectly now...
