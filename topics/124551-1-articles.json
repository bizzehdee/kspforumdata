That didn\u0027t help anything. If I leave the probe after leaving it\u0027s initial launch into orbit it will not save the data. And every time I go to another ship the data is gone. That window doesn\u0027t do anything. Every time I leave the probe with the scanner It deactivates the interface and I have to go back and click toggle overlay. and when I leave the probe for another ship or the KSC to use that data live it disapears now. It does not show electrical use after it\u0027s initial scan. So why does it not stay active where I can use it. The moment I leave the probe with the Survey scanner it stops showing the data and I have to go back to the probe and toggle the overlay... This makes the scanner useless. What is with this thing?! And if it needs more electricity why does it not show this in the data for the item?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow is this thing supposed to work.

I see nothing besides the initial scan that takes electricity. The probe seems to be electrical independent and not lacking anything.
