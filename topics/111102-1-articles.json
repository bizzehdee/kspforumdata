I\u0027m about fed up with the whole space plane thing. I love KSP, but I can\u0027t seem to fly even the most basic plane to save my life. The planes don\u0027t use anything close to real aerodynamic physics, it seems. I can fly a real flight simulator without any difficulty, but with this the plane gets a little bit up to speed and then goes completely out of control, pitching straight up or straight down and crashing.\n\nA lot of the missions in KSP require the use of space planes to get to a specific part of the planet and perform some test. So, I concede that I need to figure this out, but I\u0027m having no luck with it at all. Any videos posted online seem to be for old versions of the game, so I really need some up to date advice."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T04:05:22Z","Content":"I will point you [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information/page8#304).

Make sure that the CoL is behind the CoM. Or try flying some of the stock planes before you do your own. Start with small, simple planes: a cockpit, single Mk1 fuel tank, basic jet engine, air intake, landing gear, wings, and a horizontal and vertical stabilizer. Make sure to use control surfaces for the stabilizers. Once it\u0027s built, move the wings backward until the CoL is a bit behind the CoM.\n\nOnce you get the hang of building and flying basic planes you can get more elaborate. Larger planes with more engines can be interesting and eventually RAPIER-equipped spaceplanes are a fun challenge. Just remember that your CoM moves as fuel is spent and if it gets behind the CoL your plane can become very unstable."},{"CreatedByName":"Recon777","CreatedById":144849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T04:18:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Usually when planes go out of control it is a lack of directional authority caused by either Center of Mass too close or after Center of Lift, drag at the front exceeding drag at the back (this is usually the speed flip) or making to large a maneuver at speed.\n\nThis is the plane I\u0027m trying to fly.

Even a very very gentle landing on the bumpy grasslands west of KSC blows something up. The whole flight model is so unlike real planes, maybe I\u0027m just not knowing the rules. For some reason cutting the throttle to 0% still allows the plane to fly for ages and doesn\u0027t slow down enough to stall and stay on the ground for a landing. \n\nRegarding the construction, well I had the T400 tanks on so that there would be room for all the parts.

Though, I have to say that even with the stock planes it still doesn\u0027t feel like real flight. Hop in FSX and fly around in an F-18 Hornet or P-51 Mustang, and the flight dynamic feels entirely different. KSP planes feel like a ball that just flies around the sky with the model of a plane that pivots around the ball acting on the air in various ways depending on what you do with the control surfaces. Not the best description I know, but it really doesn\u0027t feel like an actual plane. Maybe that\u0027s partially because these are planes made of rocket parts and they wouldn\u0027t fly like normal planes? I\u0027m not sure, but it could be.

Maybe most of the parts which can make a nice spaceplane are unlocked much, much later. For me just starting out, I have the basic science node unlocked but that only gives you the parts to make essentially one plane - the plane I made. There really isn\u0027t much room for flexibility as far as I can tell. It\u0027d take me 500 more science to unlock all the parts to get the Aeris 3A. I\u0027d like to, but wow 500 science is a lot.

Yes, KSP aerodynamics are a crude approximation of the real thing, but they get the gist (and the aerodynamics now are waaaaay better than they were in beta). As it turns out, making \u0027flyable\u0027 planes in a flight simulator is a lot easier because they can have all their parameters input directly whereas KSP has to mash something together from a bunch of blocks stapled together and then try to figure out the aerodynamic implications.\n\nHowever, there is a mod called FAR (check the modding section) that dramatically improves the aerodynamics model in the game. At the moment I believe it\u0027s still ironing out a few minor bugs, but it will make aircraft behave much more realistically. But FAR usually makes design and flight considerably more complicated so you may want to get the hang of stock aircraft first.\n\nBy the way, aircraft stall above 30deg AoA or so.
