If a Triple A studio with unlimited funds when compared to a TINY INDIE dev house like Squad cannot support a quality Single Player Campaign AND a \u0022quality\u0022 multiplayer regime, you cannot logically expect a TINY INDIE dev house with extremely limited staff and even more extremely limited funds to be able to. It just is NOT possible. I hate to say it, but, given the consistent DOWNTURN in quality this game has seen because of factors we the end users are frankly only able to speculate on \u0026lt;such as out side companies pushing squad to release versions faster, thus causing major bugs. OR my favorite: going from YEARS of ALPHA stage work to a SINGLE BETA to a \u0022FULL\u0022 release that again, is buggy\u0026gt;, you honestly think that they can handle giving us content on the single player side of things that is worth something? Right now, with them working ONLY on a single player platform, career mode, the supposed CAMPAIGN \u0026lt;if we are looking to draw parallels here\u0026gt; is worse off than even CoDs forgettable single player campaigns or even Battlefield 3 and 4\u0027s unremarkable campaigns, and do not forget, that those titles are by TRIPLE A studios that are TITANS in this industry, with multi MILLION dollar, bordering on feature length MOVIE type budgets, you think Squad can even come close to pulling this off? No, they cant. Sorry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ONLY way they can even CONSIDER multiplayer is to completely SHELVE and FORGET single player and redirect all efforts there. The person power and financial power just isnt there to do both. Then on top of that, if you want multiplayer to be a truly viable thing, some things will NEED to be cut away. Time Warp, Mods, Quick Saves and Quick Loads will ALL have to go. Add in the fact that they are giving you, me and everyone who has been here and paid our way in, or been here long enough to have gotten this when it was free, updates at NO COST, its going to turn into a house of cards. Also, given our player base, how many servers will it take to even TRY to cover bases in terms of \u0026lt;IF YOU WANT MODS\u0026gt; having servers that are configured to accept every single possible combination and reject every single combination of mods out there? Where is the money going to come from? Not me, not you, not anyone as I said who has been here long enough or already paid. Will they suddenly require a subscription fee? Or micro transactions to allow you to use your mods? Now, factor in this: how much power does a server use? How much does it cost to maintain the hardware alone for the servers? The software?

Back before we had the internet as we know it TODAY, widely and easy to access with petabytes of info going hither and yawn across the planet each and every day, back when AOL was the titan, we had the early Call of Duty games with stellar and I mean STELLAR single player campaigns that made you fall in LOVE with that franchise. I was a CoD fan back the day, when it was taking place in WW2, but, the moment the fans started clamoring for multiplayer and it became easier to do that multiplayer things began to slip on the single player side, then one day, it was all: Screw it, this is multiplayer with single player as the after thought. The same I am told was the story of the Battlefield franchise. I am exceedingly fearful of a game such as KSP with the raw potential it has locked in its DNA taking that route. I am thus afraid of it because if a Triple A design house that had a stellar game allowed it to sink into the meme bog that it is now, what chance does KSP have? While, yes, SOME indie dev studios or that one guy got lucky and pulled it off, that does not mean Squad will be able to. I say this because, lets be frank and honest here. They spent how many years in Alpha/Early Access? Then how long was Beta? A. Single. VERSION, lasting a few MONTHS. Then we got a poorly done, bug ridden mess called 1.0. While, I freely admit that version was far more polished than 1.1.0 and its absurdly fast .1, .2 and .3 \u0022fixes\u0022, things have gone down hill. Look, please understand me on this, when massive bugs slip through because they are not going slow enough because out side forces are \u0026lt;if rumors are true, so, heres a pinch of salt to go with what I am about to say\u0026gt; rushing them, do you honestly, and I mean this sincerely do you HONESTLY think that multiplayer is a good idea? Let alone the additional costs in electricity, hardware, software, dev \u00A0time, dev team members that will need to be hired, and so on and so forth. I honestly see this turning into a move that destroys something that has soo much potential. I would LOVE to be wrong, heck, I will make a THREAD with a mile long soliloquy on how wrong I was if I am wrong if it doesnt collapse in on itself. BUT, this is something that should not be considered until Unity and KSP are working as flawlessly as can be. That means all bugs that CAN be fixed are fixed. All things \u0026lt;single player content mind you\u0026gt; that have been promised, are delivered and working. IF lucky, this is 10 years from now. IF lucky. Time will see. But, I am done.

I doubt it would take 10 years though. MP code is more simple than it used to be. An Indie Jam pushes out dozens of such. I am sure that Squad has the means and the methods, but it\u0027s is not the time yet.
