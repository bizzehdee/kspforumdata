As in, it literally felt and looked\u00A0like when awake, with amazing realism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I recall (it was about 7 hours ago), I noticed something weird going on, and did a nasal reality check. I could breathe normally beyond a shadow of a doubt, so I knew I was dreaming. I was actually surprised by this, due to the incredible vividness. Felt like I was normally awake, but in another place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t remember the exact details, but I started off walking on the street, and went to a corner store to buy something. Bought it for about 5 currency units which I spawned inside my pocket by thinking, got the change, and started walking towards the exit. Just as I was leaving, someone I didn\u0027t exactly want to be there showed up, and I attempted to de-spawn them at least twice, with no success (I\u0027ve been refraining from speaking out loud, which is WAY more effective, due to being afraid of saying it out loud in real life. Not sure if that\u0027s a real risk, though.). So I just went and left, knowing there would be no consequence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I was leaving, I thought to myself, it would be nice if I could have a faster mean\u00A0of transportation. Just as I thought that, my car was waiting for me, properly parked on the street and all. I just reached in my back pocket and got the keys, went inside it (everything looked correct), got ready and went for a drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was driving well, traffic seemed really realistic. The city looked nice. However, I started going up a hill some time after, and a thought struck me: I had no idea what was going on in the REAL world. Literally none of it. I could\u0027ve been doing something completely inappropriate by now and I wouldn\u0027t be able to know it. Just like how a pilot needs his instruments to know where he\u0027s at, what\u0027s happening around him and what to do during a storm or IFR, except my instruments were gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then attempted to suppress this thought, which I knew could destabilize my dream, by dismissing the real world. Then, suddenly this pain struck me, it felt like my kidneys were ten times their size inside me, or that there was some kind of rope getting tighter and tighter over my waist. I took my seatbelt off, but it didn\u0027t help at all. It was really getting uncomfortable, so I gave up and, unfortunately, woke up. I woke up\u00A0lying sideways, but I have no idea if it\u00A0was the reason for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s really unfortunate I woke up, though.
