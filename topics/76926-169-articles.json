The targeting pod would be used for A2G. That being said, the real use for IRSTs is for long range detection of enemy aircraft while staying EM silent. That\u0027s because turning on your radar instantly tells anyone near by that your in the area, as almost all military aircraft from fighters to cargo planes these days have RWRs of some fashion. This is especially true for ELINT aircraft like the RC-135W/V Rivet Joint, which is designed for this exact purpose. Now the issue here is KSP\u0027s physics range, since you have to start all the aircraft on the ground, and, at the moment, can\u0027t create flight plans for the AI (that plus Kerbin side would be really handy). Because of that, most combat will be within ~10km of KSC, rendering IRSTs useless, as at that point you aren\u0027t being stealthy, because your in visual range, so you may as well go full blast with radar power and kill your enemy ASAP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, once longer range combat becomes viable, IRSTs would be great. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, an IRST pod ala the Lockheed Legion Pod would be cool, as well as a simple ball to tack on to the nose of jets\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T21:10:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, nice, now we need a functioning ball camera instead of that RCS tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m now working on welded-parts destroyer.

The DJM (deceptive jammer) should kill a lock on forcing the craft to go back to search mode to reacquire and get a lock-on all over again. Obviously within a certain range the radar burns through the deceptive signals making it useless close in. The side benefit is that it helps with the limited ranges the aircraft have to operate in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe boresight FOV is configurable in the radar part module, so ACM could be added to certain radars by just increasing the FOV.
