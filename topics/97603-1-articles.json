VOID\u0027s there cos I like green numbers and HUDs. For reference, I\u0027m using a DRE shockwave multiplier of 1.8 for now due to DRE nerfing itself in the presence of RSS. If this is a problem, I\u0027ll deal with it. I\u0027m expecting to add to this thread progressively; it\u0027s not really a mission report yet, but it will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince my first post, I have discovered three things: FAR makes things turn.
