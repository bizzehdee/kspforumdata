As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one\u0027s own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known, and might not exist outside the mind. As a metaphysical position, solipsism goes further to the conclusion that the world and other minds do not exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdealism: idealism is the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically, idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACespecially beliefs and values\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACshape society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit.[2] Idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDualism: dualism is the position that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical,[1] or that the mind and body are not identical. Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, and is contrasted with other positions, such as physicalism, in the mind\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153body problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysicalism: physicalism is the ontological thesis that \u0022everything is physical\u0022, that there is \u0022nothing over and above\u0022 the physical,[1] or that everything supervenes on the physical.
