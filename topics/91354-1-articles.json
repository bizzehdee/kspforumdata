Unfortunately, it might be an irrecoverable error that would require manually editing your savefile, or possibly restarting your save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue comes from how the savefile treats docked vessels and VAB-assembled vessels differently. Docking ports all have a UID (universal identifier) that points to the UID of the other port that it\u0027s attached to. If one of the ports points properly to the second port, but the second port\u0027s pointer gets corrupted so some number that the game cannot interpret, you have to go digging through the savefile to manually fix it. This is not impossible, but it can be very tedious, and if you mess it up the entire save will become permanently unplayable. (So make a backup before attempting.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat always frustrated me is that no one seems to know what causes it. I seem to recall discussion that Squad was aware of the bug but had no idea what caused it.
