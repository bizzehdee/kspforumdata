This has the interesting side effect that the equator moves a lot faster than on stock Kerbin, and you get a lot more boost for launching eastward. The main result of this that it becomes a lot harder to launch in other directions, especially westwards into a retrograde orbit. You need a huge amount of extra dV for that. Somewhere between 800 and 1000 m/s more, beause equatorial speed is somewhere over 400 m/s.
