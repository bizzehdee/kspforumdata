Maybe a system of parts that work with and attach to Mk2 fuselage parts to create wheel attachment points/surfaces, and generally to expand the Mk2 system so it can be more readily used to build medium-sized pressurized rovers. By this I mean things like a rover cockpit, maybe a flatbed, or a rear ramp. Cool stuff, right? Many of the existing Mk2 parts would work great as ground vehicle fuselage segments, I think, but the extreme awkwardness of attaching wheels and the lack of an Mk2 control pod with good ground visibility holds the rover potential of the Mk2 system back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, jet fighters and junk are flashy and all, but where\u0027s the love for the ground crawlers?

Even though it\u0027s a mod it will do for now. You can, however, use some structural parts to make a cabin.

Building a rover cockpit from scratch runs you into part count issues, however. Not a big deal if it\u0027s an autonomous rover, but it begins to be one when it\u0027s meant to operate together with some kind of ground base. Plus it doesn\u0027t help that anything built out of structural parts tends to look janky as heck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T12:53:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERover cockpit, EC fuselage thing, tructural element to make the bottom of MK2 fuselages square.
