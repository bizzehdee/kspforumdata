Obviously I want to know where the Mun is gonna be after a specific length of time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T13:49:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 01:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clythoris**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T11:08:59Z","Content":"Angular velocity and trigonometry would get you the linear distance.

If you describe your time period as a fraction of the orbital period (e.g. 1 hours = 0.05 orbits) then just multiply the circumference by 0.02 (number made up, do not use!)."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T11:21:07Z","Content":"Well, you can save yourself some trouble and [use the wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page) which will tell you the apoapsis, periapsis, and a whole lot of other information. Now, the great thing about Kerbins Moon Mun is that it is a perfectly circular, perfectly flat, orbit. This means if you get into an orbit around Kerbin that is reasonible close (you can be of by as much as 5 degrees) you can plop a maneuver node on your orbit, pull prograde, and get captured by it (If your node is in the right spot. If it\u0027s not, move it around) You can set the Mun as your target and it will give you close approach nodes to help with this.\n\nI\u0027m curious why you want to calculate distance and what you are wanting to calculate at all. if you are trying to ind the dV to get from one place to another there are [several](http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png) [handy](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png/600px-KerbinDeltaVMap.png)[charts](http://www.skyrender.net/lp/ksp/system_map.png) floating around.

That\u0027s not going to be that accurate either since closest approach isn\u0027t likely to be at the Ap for close encounters and rapidly moving moons.\n\nI\u0027m guessing you\u0027re trying direct injection to moon from launch skipping the orbit Kerbin step?"},{"CreatedByName":"Clythoris","CreatedById":116254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T11:52:41Z","Content":"Oh!
