It was made as a graphic that would be used for less formal occasions, and is based on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NASA_seal.svg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENASA seal\u003C/a\u003E, which was made first before the meatball and worm logos at the very start of NASA. The official seal would\u0027ve been used for more formal occasions and nowadays is only used by the Administrator for awards and other such things. The \u0022Worm\u0022 logo was actually made in 1974 when the government launched a \u0022Graphics Improvement Program\u0022 and NASA got some National Endowment for the Arts funding to give to an artist to design a more modern NASA logo.
