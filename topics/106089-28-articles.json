I\u0027m not thaaat good with such things, so... that\u0027s why I ask XD\n\nComparing them side-by-side is a bit difficult.\n\nCryogenic Engines compared to stock engines seem to cost something like 60-70% more and take up about 50% more in tankspace, but also get a bit better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E in that case.  \n\nBut I wonder the application of that... It\u0027s larger, more expensive (even excluding energy-generation for the tanks), a bit lighter and stronger... But the same result (acceleration and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E) can be achieved with stock chemical engines for less cost and size.\n\nKerbal Atomic engines compared to an unmodded NERVA are 6 times larger in tankspace, cost double as much as the same stock-solution and weight about the same.  \n\nAgain, I\u0027m a bit lost for the application when the KA-engines need that much more volume (which you could ignore in space, although x6 is still ludicrous) and cost double as much as the same stock-solution.\n\nTo get those \u0022numbers\u0022, I built a small benchmark-ship (2.5m pod \u002B Jumbo as payload) and aimed for a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 0.4 to 0.5 with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1900-2000 m/s).

Cryo Engines / Atomic Motors have a better performance? But on the other hand, so do some stock engines... I\u0027m really confused. I like the look of Nertea\u0027s engines, but at the moment (well, see above), I don\u0027t see a way of profiting from them..."}]}
