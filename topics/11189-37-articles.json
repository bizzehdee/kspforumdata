View full album](//imgur.com/a/62vwC)\n\nThanks to Cupcake for the initial inspiration - his Scythe Mk2 is superb, but I\u0027m a sucker for wings, and can\u0027t resist a challenge. VTOL is definitely one such challenge, and despite stealing a few, choice ideas, there was still plenty of issues to tackle. For Dragonshy, perhaps the biggest problem was having to balance thrust on both the horizontal and vertical axis. I owe a huge thanks to m4v for creating RCS Build Aid - the task would probably have been hopeless without it.\n\nSo, in addition to being an all-stock VTOL-capable SSTO with a LVN that can take it to minimus, Dragonshy has a dead center COG that doesn\u0027t budge as fuel burns, leading to stable and consistent flight characteristics throughout the flight regime. Also, in order to shift weight to the front, it sports three reaction wheels, and is quite nimble and fun to fly as a result. \n\nAs a relatively new builder, I had to get creative to get it all to work; in particular, getting the fuel logic to behave while using a ton of decorative intakes gave me fits. Still, I\u0027m very happy with the end result, and I hope you all enjoy it as well.\n\n[Download Link](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3333645/Dragonshy%20mk8.craft) (dropbox, right click to save)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-27T13:39:35Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2013 01:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by drewscriver**"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T13:46:33Z","Content":"Get ready for my new cargo hauler...\n\n![RhkfMcp.png](http://i.imgur.com/RhkfMcp.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cupcake...","CreatedById":62843,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T10:59:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Cupcake, amazing result for a VTOL.\n\u003E \n\u003E Congratulations.\n\nWait, I think I can go one better. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nCupcake...\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/TzotToepRKw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T08:52:46Z","Content":"Cupcake, thanks once again for two excellent videos demonstrating the adept piloting of your unique designs.

[The OP sets out the rules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=167440\u0026viewfull=1#post167440), for addition to the roll of honour the minimum evidence is that you report in the thread that you successfully completed the challenge within the rules with any detail you might like to provide. The main purpose is to encourage people to do the challenge for themselves and enjoy the accomplishment of achieving the goals and enable demonstrating the method used to those interested.\n\nTo show proof positive to the K-Prize readership you can show a map screenshot of the orbit PE \u003E 70km or a flight screenshot with sufficient altitude and velocity on the instruments to establish that the craft reached orbit successfully and another of an intact landed ship showing resources and MET, also demonstrating safe landing and landing location and structure of the craft. If there is any doubt about the lift off then a screeny to show a horizontal initial vector will put the matter beyond doubt. \n\nSome use imgur to provide a sequence of screenshots documenting the mission and others use video capture, occasionally set to music! The choice is yours, but the rules are specific and we are on the honour system to abide by them (below) if any are confessedly broken the mission is linked to the gatecrashers list instead of the roll of honour, since if people go to the trouble of making a report I feel its only right that it is listed so that others can view it. It is sometimes necessary to make a lighthearted quip though! It is a challenge after all... ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Rules\n\u003E 1. The craft may not lose any parts in flight, no decoupling allowed. \n\u003E \n\u003E 2. The craft must lift off horizontally, reach orbit (PE \u003E 70,000m) and land intact ready for \u0027refuelling\u0027.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. All fuel tanks, wings (lift generators) and engine parts must be stock, for fairness. \n\u003E \n\u003E Provisos to rule 1.\n\u003E \n\u003E **A.** Payloads may decouple from the craft providing all payload tanks are full on decoupling and any thrust generators on the payload were not used prior to decoupling. \n\u003E \n\u003E **B.** Docking is permitted providing no fuel is transferred (net per fuel type) into the K-Prize craft (it can be transferred out).
