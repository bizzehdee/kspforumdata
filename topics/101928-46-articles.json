I fixed this in the next update, but I not tested contracts yet.\n\nCan you try to edit your save and set the launchid of your antenna to the launchid of your vessel (the one that brought antenna) ?

A \u0022ModuleKISItemResupply\u0022?\n\nAs the title says, ModuleKISItemEvaPropellant is only for EVA propellant.\n\nHowever, I can change this if needed.
