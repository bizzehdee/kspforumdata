Well, I\u0027d love to see them. I\u0027ve got a fleet of starships that are designed to go from the Kerbol system to others and a sub-fleet that goes to the planets. With the KSS mod. This particular spacecraft is the jewel of the fleet of transfer vehicles, Starship Alpha. The lead ship: Starship Alpha. The other ships: Starship Beta, Starship Omega, Starship Prima, Starship Sagatarius, Starship Pheonix, Starship Andromeda, Starship Laniakea, Starship Orion, Starship Revolution, Starship Ruby, Starship Francium (Nuclear powered starship), Starship Nirvana, Starship Colossus, Starship Star Stuff, Starship Conduit, Starship SpaceTime, Starship Autumn, Starship Universal, Starship Horizon, Starship Twilight, Starship Millennium, and the central comms starship (used as a hub for all communications between the star systems); Starship Gene. I will include a photo of Starship Alpha once I get access to my PC. Starship Alpha is the largest starship in the fleet, with a weight of over 600,000 tons, and over 2000 parts. I\u0027d love to see your guy\u0027s ideas for stuff like this.
