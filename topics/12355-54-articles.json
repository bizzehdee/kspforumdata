I can think of a few things that you could stick in here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Smart RCS rotation. Similar to the smart translation, this one works sort of like a KillRot module that simply doesn\u0027t KillRot in the planes of rotation that you tell it to. If I have a poorly-balanced RCS system and I tell it to pitch up, often times it\u0027ll induce some sort of uncommanded roll. With a KillRot that ignores my pitch command, it would compensate for the roll (perhaps in conjunction with an \u0027overdrive\u0027 system ala Smart Translation) and thus pitch properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- RCS limiter. An overall master limit of RCS thrust. Simply serves as a percentage of RCS output (overdriven RCS nozzles would still overgenerate thrust, just based on the lower master RCS values). This way I could command RCS to always be using very delicate bursts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Similar to above, but an RCS limit in mono-propellant burned per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rotation limits. If the craft is rotating above a specified number of radians per minute, it stops applying input (specifically, spending RCS fuel) and allows the craft to drift into position. It seems fairly wasteful to have a lightweight probe spewing out gallons of monopropellant to turn around as fast as it can, when just a quick burst and a drift would accomplish the goal just fine while conserving RCS fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EManeuver Node Planner Improvements\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Allow maneuver nodes to be saved.
