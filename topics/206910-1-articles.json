I see a lot of people struggling with Eve return missions and I noticed that I have a few tips that would be helpful for many of those people, so I decided to write a guide about it.

You should begin by designing a vehicle that can get away from Eve\u0027s surface. Don\u0027t worry about landing on Eve yet. (We\u0027ll place parachutes, landing legs and heat shields on decouplers and eject it all after landing on Eve.) For now, just pretend the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is located on Eve and you want to design a rocket for a one-way trip to Kerbin (or just to Eve\u0027s orbit if you want to do an Apollo style mission).

I decided to use the Vector engine because my vehicle quickly became quite big and therefore needed a lot of trust and the Vectors are more compact than the Mammoth. Just pick the one that suits your design the most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor more efficiency you should use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Asparagus_staging\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Easparagus staging\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to put the capsule under a fairing.

This may be helpful. Since your design is probably quite big, you\u0027ll want to use 10 meter heat shields. You can also clip multiple of them into each other if one isn\u0027t big enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLarge heart shields at the bottom will probably cause your lander to flip around during reentry because they act like a very big parachute and force your ship to face prograde. This will lead to your ship being destroyed by reentry heating. You can compensate this by adding even more heat shields at the top of your vessel. These won\u0027t serve as heat shields but they\u0027ll stabilize the vessel during reentry. If you still have problems, you can try if a prograde reentry works better since you have heatshields on both prograde and retrograde side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll have to drop the heat shields before touchdown. You may have to experiment a bit until you find a way to safely separate them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget to attach the landing legs on decouplers too. Eject them at the moment you ignite the engines for takeoff and you should be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camacju","CreatedById":207172,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-01T21:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224091999\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206910\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221644911523\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205435\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022s_gamer101\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/14/2022 at 11:52 PM, s_gamer101 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I remember that this was already written on the wiki before the Making History DLC was released, so it could be possible that some engines from this DLC are also well-suited, but I haven\u0027t done further research in this direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere aren\u0027t really any high-pressure engines from the DLC (I believe Vector beats the Mastodon anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, Breaking Ground is super useful for Eve ascent vehicles because you can use props.
