It\u0027s great, it\u0027s challenging, it makes everything I know about real world rocket science even more useful for playing KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, what I have noticed is that there is a tendency to equate realism to real life. If you\u0027re not sure what I mean by that, allow me to explain by example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced Jet Engines is a mod that changes the physics of in-game jet engines to be more in-line with real physics. This is great, I love that kind of thing. What I don\u0027t love is the fact that it replaces all of the stock engines with real world engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I love playing with real physics, I don\u0027t want to play with real planets, parts, or people. This is my primary issue with Realism Overhaul. Sure, it makes the physics more realistic, but it also does its best to erase everything kerbal and replace it with real world equivalents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow while some people may enjoy this, I don\u0027t. I want to be able to play with real physics, while still having the same kerbal planets, the same kerbal engines, and the same kerbal astronauts. This is why I love mods like FAR, which overhaul the physics without changing a single part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there mods that do what I\u0027ve described? Sure, but they are nowhere near as common or well developed as their counterparts in the \u0022realism = real world\u0022 category. I could play with the 10x Kerbol System mod instead of RSS, but it\u0027s buggy, less feature complete, and nowhere near as well supported as RSS is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I am almost sure that my view is a minority one, there\u0027s no rule that says that we can\u0027t have niche mods for those minority views.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T15:54:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently is in progress a kerbalized version of RSS, so with real planets kerbal sized.

Ideally, it\u0027d be kerbal planets scaled to real size. However, as mentioned, the only mod that does scale the kerbin system to 10x is feature incomplete and buggy.
