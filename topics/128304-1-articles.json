So, since there were no animal life forms programmed into Genesis, if it were launched into a heavily populated world, such intelligent (or any other animal and plant life) would be totally wiped out, broken down into its primary elements, and reconstituted into the plant life/new biosphere that had been programmed within Genesis.

That doesn\u0027t work. Your travel to the past can work in one of two ways:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. You create or travel to a parallel universe in which the Borg don\u0027t exist - an \u0022alternate timeline\u0022 if you like. Thus you have left our universe and gone gallivanting off into your own. I\u0027m sure that universe is great, but all of us back here still have our Borg to deal with. Unless of course you \u0022erased the old timeline,\u0022 i.e. destroyed the universe... in which case you suck and are the biggest jerk ever ;P\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. You travel on a closed timelike curve into your own universe\u0027s past. But since the past, by its definition, happens \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E the present and future, whatever you\u0027re \u0022going to do\u0022 in the past \u003Cem\u003Ealready happened\u003C/em\u003E, even before you set out. If the Borg exist now, no amount of traveling to the past will change the fact that they already do exist now. You can go ahead and try to kill your grandfather while you\u0027re at it, but nothing you do \u0022will\u0022 result in anything changing the facts we\u0027ve already established - that you and the Borg both exist. Yes, that does bode ill for your free will, but that\u0027s the price of time travel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnless of course you\u0027re trying to make the point that Starkiller base is impossible, in which case... nah. Just very impractical. Building it exactly as depicted in the film would be ridiculously hard due to several intervening laws of physics, but you could build the basic concept - a planet-sized cannon - easily enough with the necessary resources.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI do concur with your doubts as to \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E one would build it in that format though. \u003Cem\u003EStar Wars\u003C/em\u003E seems to have a predilection with giant balls with doomsday lasers on them, while, as mentioned by many others here, there are much more practical and equally scary ways to destroy your enemies (and their planets, if you simply must).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAL 9000","CreatedById":140704,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T02:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, if you MUST destroy a planetary system (and you have 400 quintillion dollars to spare),\u00A0here\u0027s how to do it: Turn an entire planet into a particle accelerator, make a bunch of antimatter, and when it\u0027s ready, fire the antimatter in a particle beam towards the system of choice.

The gases of the star are pulled apart and compresses within the planet, following that the plasma is injected into space at its target.

Clearly what Starkiller Base was doing in TFA was taking in all the hydrogen and helium from that star, fusing it into iron all at once, and using the vast amount of energy to accelerate the resulting iron to high speed (exactly how high should be easy enough to calculate if you\u0027re familiar with all the stages of fusion between hydrogen and iron, but I\u0027m too sleepy to bother now).\u00A0That would certainly be powerful enough to destroy planets, considering the amount of mass involved.
