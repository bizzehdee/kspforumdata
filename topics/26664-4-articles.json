Fast forward at a slower pace until it\u0027s sunset. Set up a maneuver node about 10 minutes ahead of that sunset point, and give it enough prograde to get you out a little past Duna\u0027s orbit. Then make that burn - depending on your craft you may have to start it at different times; if it\u0027s a 10 minute burn you can start it a couple minutes before you get to the node, if it\u0027s a 1 minute burn just start it 30 seconds before you reach the node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point, you should be roughly on your way to Duna.

You\u0027ll be at Duna when you get there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- if your orbit isn\u0027t showing a closest approach indicator already, you probably either didn\u0027t go out far enough, or are angled from Duna\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - check the green indicators. If they\u0027re more than 0.2 degrees off or so, you\u0027ll need to correct that. You should already be relatively close to either the ascending or descending node on your orbit. If you\u0027re at the ascending, you\u0027ll need to burn \u0022south\u0022/\u0022down/normal-\u0022 (three different ways to say -normal), if you\u0027re near the other you\u0027ll need to burn \u0022north/up/normal\u0022. Set up a node a few minutes or even hours ahead on your orbit and put in those adjustments until the post-burn orbit shows 0-ish inclination on the green indicators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you\u0027re already at a 0 on the green indicators and have no greyish closest approach indicator, try setting up a prograde burn node. The map view can be tricky, and what looks like a far enough out orbit may not be actually crossing Duna\u0027s orbit; angle the map view to see duna\u0027s orbit from the side of the orbit where you\u0027ll be crossing it and see if it\u0027s really crossing. set up your prograde burn to take you a bit further out than Duna\u0027s orbit, or to get a closest approach indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have that indicator, you\u0027re mostly done with prograde burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If the \u0022target position at closest approach\u0022 indicator is AHEAD of your \u0022closest approach point\u0022 - set up a -Radius (towards the sun) maneuver node. play with adding prograde and -Radius components to the burn; you should be able to use -radius burns to move your encounter point closer to Duna, but it will also be removing distance from your outwards travels so some prograde might need to be added too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- do the opposite if your closest approach is ahead of Duna on its orbit. mostly \u002Bradius burn away from the sun, adding retrograde a bit as needed to keep from heading for Jool instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing that adjustment plus possibly some tweaks to north/south, you should be able to get to a point where you have an SoI change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you fast forward time to within a few weeks of Duna, you can try using the same tricks to lower your closest approach - or you can just brute force a braking burn for a re-entry once you\u0027re in Duna\u0027s SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-14T13:55:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2013 01:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by khyron42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T14:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I like the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lazor-docking-cam/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELazor Docking Cam Mod\u003C/a\u003E - it makes docking a bit easier, but not by cheating, it just gives you valuable infos and a good camera view.

I could get within range to use RCS (1 or 2 Km), but I couldn\u0027t seem to control my ship using RCS thrusters to make it go the direction I wanted. It would invariably start rotating whenever I tried to translate laterally or vertically. The solution was both simple and AMAZINGLY difficult to implement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The MOST important thing is balance. Make sure your RCS is at your ship\u0027s center of mass (CoM). And by ship I am talking about JUST the part you are docking without any of the sections that will be used to get it into orbit. When I design a ship, I fully design the docking module and check its balance before I add other stages. Make sure you have RCS pointing in all directions and they are ALL in line with your CoM indicator. (You can turn that on and off in the lower left of the design window of the VAB.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Understand that if you are dealing with fuel tanks on your docking craft, what is in balance in the VAB may not be when you are trying to dock because the tanks are full when you are designing the craft and they are likely to be empty (or partially depleted) by the time you make rendezvous for docking. This moves your CoM. the farther the CoM is from the center of thrust of your RCS thrusters, the more the ship will try to spin as you perform translation maneuvers. You can either transfer fuel from other parts of the ship to try to re-balance everything or you can attempt to counteract spin by applying pitch and/or yaw as you fire RCS. I go for balance whenever possible. It\u0027s easier ... for me. As mentioned elsewhere, ASAS and SAS will also help with control issues to some degree, but they can only do so much. Balance is critical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Once you get within RCS range of the target, before you do anything else, reduce your relative velocity to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

And by \u0022slow\u0022 I\u0027m talking about \u0022nudging\u0022 your craft in any one direction at a speed that will seem only slightly faster than continental drift. Then you wait FOR-FREAKING-EVER (patience grasshopper) until you\u0027ve drifted as far as you need to in that direction and cancel your relative momentum to the target by firing RCS is the opposite direction. Then you get to repeat the process a LOT until you dock. Keep in mind, your RCS thrusters are not used like rocket engines. You will be firing them in single short bursts. You are not setting a course so much as correcting your trajectory over and over and over and over until you are close enough to target the individual docking port you are aiming for. As you get closer still, your corrections get smaller and smaller until you finally dock. The smaller your course corrections are the easier they are cancel and re-correct. If you are doing it right, you will feel like you are moving somewhat slower than glaciers or software updates.

If your ships are oriented north-south, with the ports pointing at each other, then yes, go glacial. Any other time, and your orbits (and bearing!) are are not quite in sync, and when closing 100 m at 0.2 m/s, that\u0027s 500 seconds to close--about half an orbit. In that time, while you started off pointed at (and moving towards) your target, all that **** has moved 180 degrees relative to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important thing I ever read on a forum or video guide was the 1/100 rule: for every 100 m apart you are, close the gap at 1 m/s. 1000 m apart? Close at 10 m/s. 500 meters? close at 5 m/s. This gives you 100 seconds to turn around and stop all motion, and it\u0027s not a lot of dv either. importantly, orientation won\u0027t change in those 2 minutes. Much, at least. Ever wonder why when you\u0027re 2000 m apart and you point at the purple prograde and hit the gas, and 2 or 5 or 10 minutes later you\u0027re at your closest approach but instead of kissing you\u0027re 300 freaking meters away? Yeah. You orbited out of synch. You\u0027d need to lead the target, and bully to the pilot that can do that.

When you zoom out and look at Kerbin the ship, assuming the port is on the nose, should look like it\u0027s pointing straight up and down but flying sideways. Point your docking craft in the opposite direction. Once the docking ports are close to lined up, even if separated by dozens of meters, they will not wobble. Much. I promise. At this point, when you don\u0027t have wobble, and ONLY THEN can you move at a glacial pace. I honestly don\u0027t know how people do it slowly in any other way, you end up chasing a moving target and never closing the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut your point about ship balancing and RCS port placement is really good--docking really does begin in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T17:33:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry to say OP but you need practice.

It looks like you could place a node at one of the two points where the circles cross nearest each other, and drag the blue arrows until your projected orbits get close. Start there, and post a picture of the result. If you\u0027re confident, try to perform the burn that the node calculates for you: it will put a blue cross on the navball and a gauge to the right of the navball that has ### m/s, and below that will be a time--when the timer is finished, you need to be aiming at the blue cross (the direction you need to aim), and burn engines till the gauge reads almost zero (the gauge is the amount of thrust you need to add in that direction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI strongly recommend uploading your craft file too, so we can see how your RCS ports are placed and how they behave.
