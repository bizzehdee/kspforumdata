What the name means, I have no idea. I wasn\u0027t the EXACT one who made it, my friends did, but they left it behind and gave me the \u0022rights\u0022 per say of the card game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of the game is like most, you battle with the cards you have, and use items that you have in your hand.... it\u0027s not hard. The gameplay is simple, on the card is the name of the character (for this circumstance I\u0027ll use my card, \u0022Solider\u0022). Then a crappy hand drawn image of the character, then a line with \u0022Att\u0022 (or Attack\u0022). Att is the card\u0027s health and attack damage. Let\u0027s say the Solider has Att: 40. Then he can deal 40 damage per attack, unless an ability does something about it....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf he is hit, say for 20 damage, then his health drops to 20, \u003Cstrong\u003Ebut NOT\u003C/strong\u003E his damage. He still deals 40 damage, he just has 20 hits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow his Att, is his listed abilities... some have many, some have few... but none are pointless. In this case, let\u0027s say the Solider has the Ability \u0022Frag Grenade\u0022, and it says \u0022deals 40 damage, splashed\u0022. That means it deals 40 damage, and has a splashing effect on all other cards on the battlefield. I have the \u0022splash\u0022 set up so that when the main card is hit for the main damage, then you half that damage and deal it to two cards, then half it again, and to another two, and repeat until you get a decimal. For example, 100 attack would splash to 50, then 50 would splash to 25, but 25 cannot splash into 12.5, because that is a decimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made (in my middle school career), nearly 1,000 cards... sometimes during class, sometimes not. But that is a large number... and most are nothing more than normal lined paper. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make them, their pretty easy, hence why I remember how to make them. What you do is, have a normal sized piece of paper, then have it the long ways (vertical). Then fold it to make it like a book, or in the middle going long ways. School teachers would say \u0022hamburger\u0022 style. Then, fold the same way again, and repeat a third time, until you have a little card sized piece of paper, ready to be used. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, you scribble a Z on the front, and put decks below it. Flip it over, and add some none-sense on it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I have, as said, nearly 1,000 cards, and in that number, is Star Trek stuff, Doctor Who, Kerbal, Star Wars, Real Stuff, Robo Stuff, Random Stuff, Warrior stuff, Ninja Stuff, scientists, cops, army men, clones, droids.... just about anything... My \u0022slogan\u0022 for it, is basically \u0022Anything that can fight, battle here\u0022.
