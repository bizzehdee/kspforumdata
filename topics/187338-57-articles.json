And budget for it was probably set a long time ago. Spreading it over 2 years would cause a financial disaster for the publisher - especially since KSP is not exactly the most known or anticipated game of T2. Also, look around. If you keep posting about one thing all the time, people get bored and move on. Same would happen on overextended campaign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuality over quantity. You don\u0027t need a looong campaign to be successful, you need a good one.

Here and in other games, people are interested in seeing games and also become negative if it isn\u2019t promoted \u201Ccorrectly\u201D. Anyone who complains that starship isn\u2019t getting enough coverage and Elon musk should spend more money to have more promotion and more coverage isn\u2019t seen as promoting starship\u2019s success - because the PR has basically nothing to do with how good of a rocket it is.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting closer to KSP, you might be interested in a news organization. Like a video game, the success of this news organization depends on publicity. But, it doesn\u2019t impact the quality of the organization. If you care about the news, then you don\u2019t necessarily care about how many other people are watching it. You don\u2019t demand that the news organization advertise itself to others better. Giving you the benefit of the doubt, let\u2019s say your reason for wanting more promotion is less selfish: you want lots of people watching the news so that you can watch the news with them and talk about the news together. That still doesn\u2019t mean that you should complain about the lack of advertisements the company is buying; if they want to stay a small, local news channel, that is on them, and they will broaden their reach when they feel like it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, these two examples are false comparisons, and I hope you recognize the difference between being excited for a game and hoping it will be a good game, and wanting the game to advertise itself more so that it will have more players. The developers are putting in the same work whether they announce it or not, and we will be getting the same game at release no matter the marketing strategy, and the developers have the final say on when they start their real marketing campaign again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-03T12:24:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I the only one that missed this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2869691624\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/208441-nate-simpson-mini-interview-hidden-in-matt-lowne-episode/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:194px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo Nate started he doesn\u0027t need to promote KSP 2.

But I can\u0027t help others if I can\u0027t help myself first.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor me to help others, I have to be of sound mind and body first, and if I\u0027m a nervous wreck because I\u0027m worrying about stuff I cant\u0027 change then I\u0027m of no use to anyone.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBesides, 99% of the stuff on the news (and even this KSP 2 discussion sub-forum) these days falls in one of two categories:\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst there\u0027s \u0022Stuff that affects you but you can\u0027t change\u0022,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand secondly there\u0027s \u0022Stuff that doesn\u0027t affect you in the first place\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow if you think of yourself as an activist, or there\u0027s someone other than yourself that you\u0027re taking care of, I guess sometimes you would need to worry about some of the things that fall in that 2nd category, if they affect people you care about.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut that first category? You can just delete that whole category from your brain and be a lot happier for it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeck most of politics can be lumped into that first category too, because what ACTUAL difference is a single vote gonna make 99% of the time?

Well, it\u0027s like I said, the work\u0027s done already at least conceptually (might have to re-code the implementation to handle how KSP 2\u0027s code works differently to (and hopefully better than) KSP 1\u0027s code)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means the solution is easy. Hire the devs of both of the 2 KSP 1 multiplayer mods, and if possible pick the best non-conflicting ideas from each to use for the multiplayer code of KSP 2.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat provides an excellent starting point. If things need to get more complex than that, at least you have something that worked that you can start from, which is a far sight better than starting from a blank sheet scratching your head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sincerely believe that the users commenting on the \u0022KSP 2 discussion\u0022 subforum have blown this whole \u0022issue\u0022 with multiplayer entirely out of proportion to the actual difficulty of solving the problem, because let\u0027s face it the majority of us on the forums are not in fact people with a history of creating mods, and so we as a group have no real understanding of how hard or easy any particular coding task in the confines of KSP is in reality.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCase in point: Sometimes simple things like \u0022 I want to have more than one docking port connect my ship together at a certain point to make it stronger\u0022 are next-to-impossible, sometimes extremely complex things (just take a look at KSP Interstellar Extended, or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-1 suite of mods) can be implemented as a series of rather simple changes (lots of different changes sure, but each one conceptually and code-wise simple).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for that reason I believe that the problem of how to implement KSP 2 multiplayer is firmly in the \u0022this can be solved within a reasonable time frame\u0022 category, and absolutely nowhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-13T21:08:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor some reason I thought you were talking about the FTL kind of warp and then realized you meant time warp.
