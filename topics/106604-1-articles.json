Is it a past faliure which weighs heavily on your mind, or something which you can never quite achieve.\n\u003E For me, it\u0027s that despite owning the game for years, I have not managed a successful docking so far. I\u0027ve attempted it a few times, but found it hard to get the launch time right when it\u0027s passing overhead, or can\u0027t get near enough to the other craft without zooming past it.\n\nFirstly, here\u0027s the easy way to dock (assuming you have already rendezvous):\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Take two crafts into a 90 degree orbit.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Align craft A so that the docking port faces North (red line on the nav ball).\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Align craft B so that it\u0027s docking port faces South (180 degrees on navball).\n\n**VERY important that you do this. Having the ports face these direction means that as you orbit the planet, the ports don\u0027t \u0022drift.\u0022 I am willing to bet you cant dock because you ports keep drifting causing you to not only kill relative velocities, but also chase the port at the same time.**\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Change camera mode to \u0022Locked\u0022 (V key)\n\n**Optional. I find docking 100% easier with this viewpoint, but it\u0027s not critical to the process.**\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Moving SLOWLY and in ONE direction at a time (don\u0027t try diagonals) inch your way closer to the docking port on all axis (top/bottom and left/right if you look at your craft from the engine in locked camera mode)\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Once aligned, press H to close the gap\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 ???\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Profit!\n\nSecondly, my biggest regret is despite having all these planets to explore, I\u0027ve only ever been as far as Duna (did it in a recent stream, you can see it if you want by clicking the link in my sig)\n\n\\*shameless self plug"},{"CreatedByName":"Mohole","CreatedById":110358,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T21:54:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E wow, by this point they\u0027ve probably formed an new civilization and culture!\n\nBut, at that time, Female Kerbals didn\u0027t exist! ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"quietsamurai98","CreatedById":69270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:59:41Z","Content":"My biggest regret is launching the game executable directly, instead of via Steam. \n\nI really want to know how many hours I have wasted **not** playing the game since I bought it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T00:28:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 12:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by quietsamurai98**"},{"CreatedByName":"bobcook","CreatedById":73597,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:07:09Z","Content":"I can\u0027t make an Eve lander capable of a return mission, and I gave up trying after a few hours of attempts.
