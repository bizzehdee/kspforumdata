I feel it is one of the main things the previous game lacked.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know the devs have ideas and probably a few things already in the works in regards to story with a few of those being already hinted at in videos and models found in the files.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, It\u2019s important for the story to not simply be just Easter eggs, but actually be something interesting that ties the world together and drives the player to explore other planets and star systems.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe closest thing that comes to mind is The Outer Wilds which is a masterpiece with this concept. (If you haven\u2019t played it, play it now) I will not spoil it here.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf the devs could capture at least 10% of what The Outer Wilds does with its way of story telling and driving the player to explore planets for the sake of exploration and uncovering a mystery, it would make this game much more engaging and may also entice a wider audience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would help planets not feel like barren lifeless spheres but like they have some mystery to them, something to uncover and some reason to be there.

I think the game would be much easier to get into if there was a story to hook you in and Outer Wilds style environmental storytelling would be the way to go. Once you\u2019ve finished the story you would still keep playing as usual and if you started a new game you should be able to ignore the story.

To me this game is about my successes, failures, and achievements, not following some sort of pre-defined plot (and if it\u0027s procedurally generated all the worse). At its core this is a physics sim sandbox with the ability to build individual craft, allowing you to surmount certain challenges of (space)flight (or driving too, I guess). Adding in these sorts of story elements would also greatly reduce replayability in my mind since all the wonder of engaging with those elements will be gone on any future playthrough. For that matter, what happens when the plot is over? What does the player do when all that\u0027s left is the sandbox? You\u0027re back to square one, a sandbox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not at all opposed to story and enjoy many games that spin awesome narratives (Elden Ring, for one), but KSP isn\u0027t really suited for that IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-03T19:30:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u2019t think there should be a plot.

I won\u2019t spoil anything, but how it works is that you can go anywhere you like from the very beginning, you visit places, find secrets hidden around the little solar system you\u2019re in, figure out clues, and eventually understand what the big mystery of the world you\u2019re in is. There\u2019s no predefined order in which you have to do things, you can just sightsee if you want to, and the reward is unraveling that mystery you find yourself in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a game like KSP that could be a lot lighter because it\u2019s not the main gameplay focus, and it should be possible to just ignore it, but it could totally work and I\u2019m sure it would help keep new players engaged as they figure out how to do things.

Clues point to each other and if you want to follow them you can if you don\u0027t, then don\u0027t.
