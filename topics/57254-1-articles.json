Adding the near/far space environments drops the number to only 261.9, and by the time you add all the other bodies with near/far space environments (15 other bodies with 2 environments each equals 30 additional environments), the per biome number to unlock the entire tech tree is only 151.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat 151.2 science per biome is less than every experiments\u0027 \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ebase\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E value combined (which is 158).*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, I would like to discuss whether or not the tech tree needs to be made more difficult to fill out when biome maps are added for more and more of the systems\u0027 bodies, and if so, how should it be made more difficult and how much more difficult it should be made?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Doesn\u0027t take into account recovering a craft, as that is entirely dependent on how far the craft flew.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-22T02:38:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2013 02:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Themohawkninja\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T02:39:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering the same thing since after 3 Mun flights and 2 Minmus flights I\u0027m fairly far through the tech-tree.

Limit yourself to using only 1.25m parts, no more than 1 experiment per craft, only 2 stage rockets, whatever takes your fancy.

There\u0027s a lot of changes will happen between 0.23 and 1.0, so it\u0027s probably not worth worrying too much about perfect balance of the tree at this stage. Additional biomes and additional parts are going to throw any balancing off, plus things like the economy, missions, contracts, etc will likely change the picture in ways that throw the balance off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeeping it easy-ish during the development phase makes a lot of sense, in terms of keeping it accessible to all.

That\u0027s why I think the concept of science points should be dropped completely and parts should be rewarded for sets of particular predetermined measurements. There\u0027s enough measurements and enough parts to keep you busy for quite a while and many insubstantial parts can be rewarded for measurements at the most distant targets in the system such as Eeloo or Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T19:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Murph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Murph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah, we\u0027ve (hopefully) only just scratched the surface of career mode and science right now.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.
