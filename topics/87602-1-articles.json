Not only is this a really cool looking vessel, it\u0027s a fully functional battleship, which it will be brought into battle in the next video.\u003Cbr\u003EExcuse my ranting of Homeworld. I love that game. The Tiiadan Assault Frigate in Homeworld is what this star ship was modeled after.\u003Cbr\u003EIf you really like this ship, please share the video or subscribe to my channel. This took a lot of time to make, I hope it gets some good feedback.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHere\u0027s what Homeworld actually looks like, or at least the original game:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00001LDCK.01.LZZZZZZZ.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022B00001LDCK.01.LZZZZZZZ.gif\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThere\u0027s also Homeworld 2, but those are some complex designs. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be making ships in KSP from that game.\u003Cbr\u003EBut I will probably make more Homeworld ships if this gets enough attention.\u003Cbr\u003EPlease don\u0027t ruin the Homeworld series GearBox. Don\u0027t turn the game into fighting and effects. I would seriously play a Homeworld that has the same graphics as the original if it has a new storyline/different take and new maps/missions/blah blah blah.\u003Cbr\u003EHope you guys like it! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen I first saw the new explosions, I was doubtful because they didn\u0027t have that rocket fuel explosion look to them, it looked more like burning gasoline.\u003Cbr\u003EIn testing my new battleship - an Assault Frigate, designed from an old game called \u0022Homeworld\u0022 - I was proven wrong, the new explosions are amazing.\u003Cbr\u003ESo is smashing into the VAB.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UUkDlX5Tv47INdUMsw6aYhmA\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI was originally going to add in music much more of an epic hardcore sound, but the quirkiness and eventual epicness of the patriotic American song \u0022Stars and Stripes forever\u0022 fit it way more. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYes I know the gravity is off.

Since mine was so massive, had a fair amount of armor, and had a lot of shots, I thought I could take this thing out. The Assualt Frigate would have to be quick and accurate with it\u0027s first shots to disable the Cruiser in someway that would eventually lead to the cruiser\u0027s destruction from not being able to fight back with it\u0027s primary weapon.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBut things did not go to plan.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UUkDlX5Tv47INdUMsw6aYhmA\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI\u0027ll attempt to create a better battle in the future.
