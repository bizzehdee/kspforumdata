I installed the proprietary graphics drivers and bumblebee. KSP (x64, x86 doesn\u0027t even start) is started using this command:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html\u0022\u003E\nLD_PRELOAD=\u0022libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1\u0022 __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 LC_ALL=C primusrun ./KSP.x86_64 --force-opengl\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game itself works without major problems, sometimes though, it just randomly freezes. When that happens not only KSP crashes but my entire PC, to the point where I have to hard-reset it. The freezes either happen on the initial loading screen, when switching scenes or sometimes just mid-game. I can\u0027t get the game to run for longer then, say, 5 minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe logs don\u0027t show anything, although the Player.log has some weird (binary?) gibberish appended to it; all other entries are just normal messages like \u0022EVA from craft X\u0022 or whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried using optirun (also with -b primus), switching around the command line arguments, lanching through steam, applying the segfault fix (from the Linux Support Thread), I tried using noveau but that... really didn\u0027t work, plus I actually want to use the proprietary driver...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is a very difficult problem to ask in a forum but I\u0027m getting to the point where it\u0027s just so frustrating... Does anyone have an idea what\u0027s going on? Or even better, how to fix?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you need any more information just ask, I\u0027ll provide it ASAP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, Pi\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-27T16:59:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi P-Maker, can you put the Player.log on pastebin for us, even if it looks useless it may still tell us something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, please tty KSP without \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E arguments, they simply are not required and are optional, though LC_ALL=C should no longer be required at all as KSP 1.0\u002B ignores the system locale on both x86 and x86_64\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--force-opengl is also completely redundant and useless on Linux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as KSP is causing the whole PC to freeze I\u0027d be testing my RAM (memtest via a live cd) and checking my distro\u0027s own logs to find out what was going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile KSP might crash or freeze itself, for your system to freeze suggests a deeper issue than anything KSP can cause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"P-Maker","CreatedById":61272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T19:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayer.log:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/1AJD8wKU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/1AJD8wKU\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time the crash happened when loading a vessel, KSP.x86_64 was run without arguments (but with primusrun, as I want to use my nvidia card of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe distro\u0027s logs don\u0027t show anything, I think the system crashes before any log entries can be made...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRunning a memtest right now\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T21:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah nothing in the logs just as you say, I\u0027m not sure what else to suggest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP does just crash sometimes, but next time your PC freezes you could try control\u002Balt\u002BF1 to switch to tty1, and log in to the text terminal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could see if it\u0027s only KSP that\u0027s not responding in htop, or use startx to get a desktop so you can use your regular task manager.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nControl\u002Balt\u002BF7 gets you back to your normal desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"P-Maker","CreatedById":61272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T20:02:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried Control-Alt-1/2/n already, nothing happening, that\u0027s what got me thinking it\u0027s something serious...
