At the top, using a mk1 pod with a mk16 parachute (same low drag even if deployed) is an excellent combination of low drag and high temperature tolerance. The wider the tanks and the more stages you use the draggier it will be. Low drag can be even more important than saving a few kg.\u00A0A few thin\u00A0stages is best. Mk1 size engines are your friend because of this. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse Circular Intakes as nosecones on the top (\u003Cstrong\u003Eand \u003C/strong\u003Ebottom if no engine there) of all tanks.

was during v0.90.\u00A0 I had accepted contracts for something like \u0022Eve base on wheels\u0022 and \u0022plant a flag on Eve\u0022.\u00A0 I went ahead and constructed a mission that landed three Kerbals in a large mobile base to fulfill the contracts.\u00A0 However, it was basically a one way mission with no immediate plan to bring them back.\u00A0 After a couple decades stranded on that purple rock, I decided\u00A0it was finally time to figure out a way\u00A0to bring them back home.\u00A0 I had never launched from Eve before so this would be my first attempt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot wanting to build some huge monstrosity of a spacecraft to bring them to orbit all at once, I brought them up one at a time using a small lifter with a command seat.\u00A0 Unfortunately I\u0027ve lost all my screenshots from those missions, but I still have a save of the vehicle (remember this was pre-1.0, so I didn\u0027t have to make everything aerodynamic or have heat shields):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EveLifter.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

ship.\u00A0 I saw no reason to dock them together into one huge vessel, so they all flew to Eve independently.\u00A0 The plan was to\u00A0make three separate landings, drive the mobile base to each landing site,\u00A0have one Kerbal board each of the three\u00A0lifters and launch,\u00A0have the return ship rendezvous with each Kerbal in orbit, and have each Kerbal board the return ship via EVA.\u00A0 After all three Kerbals were aboard the return ship, they would have to\u00A0wait in orbit for the next available launch window, and then they could finally all come home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo validate that the\u00A0lander/lifter worked before sending all three of them, I first sent one along with the return ship.\u00A0 The plan was to bring one Kerbal up to the return ship and, if that worked, I\u0027d send two more landers/lifters at the next launch window to bring up the other two.\u00A0 Good thing that was the plan because what I didn\u0027t realize when I designed and tested my\u00A0lifter, a Kerbal adds 94 kg to the mass of the vehicle when he\u0027s placed in a command seat (he doesn\u0027t add anything when\u00A0he\u0027s in a pod).\u00A0 Everything seemed to be going exactly according to plan, but I ran out of propellant before\u00A0attaining orbit.\u00A0 Fortunately I did a quicksave before launching.\u00A0 I tried again, same result.\u00A0 I couldn\u0027t figure out why the results weren\u0027t matching my simulations until I discovered I was 94 kg overweight.\u00A0 I then launched unmanned and I achieved orbit exactly as I had planned it (my first ever successful launch from Eve).\u00A0 That told me that my design method was correct, I just needed to upsize to account for the extra 94 kg.\u00A0 (In retrospect, I probably could have left the command seat and used the EVA pack to gain the last bit of velocity needed to\u00A0attain orbit, but I didn\u0027t think of that at the time.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the next launch window I sent one redesigned lander/lifter (pictured above) to fetch one Kerbal.\u00A0 The mission went off without a hitch and I had one Kerbal aboard the return ship.\u00A0 By now I was getting pretty good at landing close to my target.\u00A0 Once entry started I had no control over where I was going to land.\u00A0 My only control was in selecting the altitude and location of periapsis when performing the deorbit burn.\u00A0 I don\u0027t remember exactly, but I think all of my landings were inside of 10 km from the mobile base (I think the closest was about 3 km).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConfident now in my design and procedures, I sent the last two landers/lifters at the next launch window and rescued the last two Kerbals.\u00A0 At the first opportunity, they rocketed out of\u00A0Eve orbit, traveled back to Kerbin, and safely splashed down.\u00A0 With all the\u00A0time spent waiting for launch windows, and the time spent in transit, it took about 5 years to complete all the flights needed to bring\u00A0those little green guys\u00A0back home.\u00A0 I\u0027d like to think there was a nice tickertape parade for them after their long awaited return.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit:\u00A0 I forgot to mention that I was lifting off from an elevation of about 900 m.\u00A0 I therefore
