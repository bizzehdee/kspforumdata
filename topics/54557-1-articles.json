Or he\u0027s some hobo we found on a bench employed by the Kerbal Space Center; I don\u0027t really care enough to find out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently, Jomer got into a bit of a scrape. I had recently installed Procedural Fairings and wanted to build a small orbiter to test how it looked. So a night launch of the prototype rocket \u003Cem\u003EErbiter [PF]\u003C/em\u003E was in order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s28.postimg.org/xe8e8bodp/screenshot25916.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot25916.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJomer was the lucky Kerbal who got to test the design. The mods I use are Chatterer, KerbPaint, and now Procedural Fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have an annoying habit of overfueling my designs, and the \u003Cem\u003EErbiter\u003C/em\u003E is no exception. It got into orbit with plenty of fuel left in its second stage. So I decided to put Jomer into a higher orbit because, you know, reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s27.postimg.org/x0pfroxsz/screenshot25929.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot25929.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter an orbit, I decided I\u0027d had enough of Jomer staring at me like a sociopath and FIAHED THE POODLE to deorbit. I didn\u0027t have enough fuel in that stage. Okay, no problem. Just fire up the deorbit stage and...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[FLUFFYBUNNIES].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, I didn\u0027t have enough fuel. I tried F9ing time and again, but the best I got was 68500 meters. Welp. Although I didn\u0027t really care about Jomer, I knew the Kerbal public would get miffed if I left a Kerb in orbit to reenter in only a few short centuries. Fortunately, I had a backup plan. I \u003Cem\u003Eknew\u003C/em\u003E there was a reason I left that prototype nuclear vessel in orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003EDevonian\u003C/em\u003E was my first attempt at a nuclear ship built to carry Kerbals to the Mun and farther. It didn\u0027t have enough Delta-v for an interplanetary return mission because it had four nukes, but it was good for a single Munar return run. Onboard? Jeb, Bill, and Bob Kerman. It had \u0027chutes on the capsule, but I didn\u0027t want to deorbit it for some reason. I just felt like it could be refueled and become a permanent craft for future Munar operations. So I left the Big Three in orbit because I was too lazy to get up off my Kerbehind and go get them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could have just had Jomer get out and push his capsule, but that would take too long and was boring. I wanted to pull a huge publicity stunt that proved the Kerbal Space Program never leaves a Kerbal behind! \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EExcept the ones we haul onto bases.

The only trouble was that once I matched velocities, I too had a periapsis inside the atmosphere. Just. Fortunately, the closest approach came after the \u003Cem\u003EErbiter\u003C/em\u003E had passed its graze with Kerbin\u0027s embrace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s23.postimg.org/wbw2bsl3f/screenshot25936.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot25936.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I had previously decoupled the deorbit stage in an attempt to lower my periapsis more via decoupler force.

As for the capsule... well, the capsule can go shove off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJomer got settled in after being stuck inside a cold powerless capsule for almost an hour, and Jeb celebrated the rescue by giving the \u003Cem\u003EDevonian\u003C/em\u003E a paint job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/5sei6eaev/screenshot25941.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot25941.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow he did it will forever remain a mystery, as paint doesn\u0027t work in space.
