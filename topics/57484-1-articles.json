When I try to boot it loads up a update bar thingy at the bottom of the screen then the bar fills a tiny bit then crashes.

Just making sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming not (or you have a much too old TM backup), you should get an external backup drive (like the Seagate ones that fit in a shirt pocket; 1 TB). It will set you back about $100 or so.
