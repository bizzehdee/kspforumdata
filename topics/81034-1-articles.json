I have been trying to build most components of the main lifters retrievable, in addition to using SSTO space planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy latest mission involved sending up ~100 tonnes of cargo including replacement parts and emergency supplies to the station, all the cargo containers would not be going with the space station so this mission presented a unique problem to me. I had a craft that at the launch pad cost about a million credits, but nearly all components could be retrieved if I could figure out a way of doing it. I decided the shape of the payload was too long and tall to survive a landing without toppling over and crashing into the surface, so the best way to retrieve the payload was to split it up in sections while it fell towards Kerbin and have parachutes on each module. The main lifter stage would be put on a suborbital trajectory so it could parachute down safely wherever it could, another stage would circularise the payload, help it dock with the station and then be used to de-orbit the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/nmHSo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the main stage, I used an inline chute containing a drogue and a main chute, covered with fairings to protect the chutes if the main stage started tumbling during re-entry, before the main drogue was able to kick in. When I actually did this, the main stage actually tumbled quite a lot because it was aerodynamically unstable in a retrograde trajectory, luckily my fairings managed to shield most of the heat until the drogue kicked in so overall the chute design here was a success. When the main stage landed (on a small slope) it fell over and unfortunately damaged one of the four engines, but the rest were okay so I accepted that as a reasonable result given the size of the main stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the payload I attached chutes radially on each module and covered with an ablative shield to protect the chute during re-entry, the engine would allow me to maneuver close to the space centre for this which increased my cost retrieval. The main docking port is attached to a decoupler to reveal the drogue chutes (2 off). I had a complex action group arrangement to decouple the modules, ablative shield, deploy landing gears and parachutes module by module. This didn\u0027t work on my first run through (thank god for quick load). I changed my deployment so that the top module decoupled first, then the lower ones one by one. This reduced the chance of the lower stages colliding with the upper stages during decoupling. I stuffed up my chutes however, I somehow made them uneven so the modules didn\u0027t glide down in a balanced way. Luckily the touchdown speed was low enough that I retrieved 3/4 modules (the fourth one disappeared ~300m from the ground just as I was trying to centre my focus on it to make sure it landed okay but oh well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall the mission went OK. I retrieved roughly 70% of my cost. I am still learning how to set up real chutes correctly so hopefully I wont make that mistake again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Immashift","CreatedById":57223,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T16:37:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice idea for a thread. I\u0027d also like to save on cost with a pile of mods installed. Getting lower stages to successfully land without either disappearing or exploding seems to be a challenge for me. Orange tanks and mainsails really dig into my funds right now, especially when I drop them 2300m up and they go poof.. I\u0027ve been resorting to spaceplanes and SSTO\u0027s for smaller lifts due to costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley put up a good video on cost savings, in case you haven\u0027t seen it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3DyY3Y5G9E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong ago in modland there was the Lazor system, capable of extending craft despawn range with voodoo magic.

That orange fuel tank is actually a scaled up version of the ordinary one, note the KR-2L engine attached... I found the best way to get the launcher stage to be retrievable (with DRE) is to have enough fuel to get it into a reasonable suborbital trajectory (using far) with a periapsis of between -50,000m-\u0026gt;35,000m and have enough batteries (make sure they are turned off until you need to use them) to turn the stage and perform any burns\\parachute deployment that may be necissary.
