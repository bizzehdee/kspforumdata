This happens while looking at the planet from a certain distance and even if i zoom in with just 1 small turn of the wheel texture quality goes bad immensely as if it is no longer using the 8K textures. I don\u0027t remember it being like this in 1.0 version. Is this normal or a bug caused by Unity 5? Zoom in on the pictures and compare them and you can clearly see the difference between two.
