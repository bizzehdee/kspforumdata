It can be firespiter, SXT or any mod that has a propeller for some reason they seam to stop the game loading. Currently I am only interested in fixing SXT the first engine that hangs is Sxttinyprop but deleting it only means the next propeller hangs. Does anyone have a fix that works?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is where you come in\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cup a joe","CreatedById":145990,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T14:56:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen loading your ship or the game as a whole?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jamieT6","CreatedById":103826,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T19:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame.
