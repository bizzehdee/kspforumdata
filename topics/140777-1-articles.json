Now I skycrane everything on Mun/Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a couple Skycrane designs. My heaviest skycrane is a 2.5m 1600 fuel body, with twin 1.25 400 fuel side mounts. Those side mounts carry thuds. It has a large reaction wheel, and lots of RCS. 400 side tanks have 4 place anywhere RCS underneath them. This craft has LOTS of RCS. This makes the skycrane very wide so that I don\u0027t scorch the payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first step is to just land somewhere pretty close with the piece and save my game. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that I take a moment to orient myself with the piece the rotation and the RCS, so that I\u0027m comfortable with the controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI start bumping up my thrust until I\u0027ve just about overcome Mun gravity. I\u0027m trying to make the craft near-weightless with the Thuds. Then I use RCS to hop off the ground and dock with the base. I occasionally tap vertical RCS since the Thud thrust will never be perfect. Once I dock, I fully refuel the skycrane, and send it up to the station for the next piece, leaving excess fuel at the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSideways planetside docking is pretty laborious, which is why I gave it up and built the vertical landing for the ore hauler.
