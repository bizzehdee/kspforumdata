Whilst i\u0027m waiting for my favourite mods to be updated, perhaps you kind folks of the ksp forums can answer me the question in the title, i used to use kerbalstuff to keep me posted as to when mods were updated, but alas that seems to have dissapeared :(. Does everyone use ckan now? is there anything else that has replaced kerbalstuff? My favourite mods , spaceY, Near Future, Mk IV spaceplane, Dmagics science, scansat, the list goes on. Oh yeah!

CKAN. No CKAN. Steam. No Steam. I know we don\u0027t talk about religion directly around here (I believe there\u0027s a forum rule about it), but I find it amusing how people get religious about KSP.

The biggest advantage to CKAN is the compatibility checks, which makes mods like Real Solar System and Realism Overhaul, with wide lists of dependencies and recommendations, much easier to manage. On the other hand, CKAN doesn\u0027t cast its net as far, and it\u0027s polarizing: mod authors who aren\u0027t actively pushing CKAN often end up frustrated with CKAN indexing and installs. You\u0027ll find many authors\u00A0who automatically refer users to CKAN help pages and won\u0027t provide support if their mod is installed via CKAN. It makes sense, but it can be difficult as a user to navigate. In the end, my Kopernicus installs (RSS, New Horizons) depend on CKAN, while my primary install is handled manually.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also spend as much time managing my mods\u00A0as I do actually playing the game. At least I\u0027m not a mod author. How many authors get to actually play anymore instead of fixing bugs and answering forum questions about why something is broken? There\u0027s satisfaction in problem solving, for sure, and most authors rightly are in it for selfish reasons, i.e. they make mods they want to use. But we users sometimes forget that the mods (as well as the core game and tools like CKAN) represent the work and ingenuity of the people behind them.
