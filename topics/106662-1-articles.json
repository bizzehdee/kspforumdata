I feel frustrated as an airplane/spaceplane building enthusiast as I cannot produce craft that perform acceptably without plucking away all the feathers of my birds. I could manage in the previous patch, but now it has gone to riddiculous levels.\n\nMany of us build wings in the \u0027lego\u0027 style: adding strakes, delta and structural wings together to shape into being something that looks realistic and aerodynamic. I personally like to build \u0022shells\u0022 over engine and fuel tank components to \u0027protect\u0027 them from the airflow - but now I can\u0027t. Building wings in this way is being severely, harshly and bluntly punished by the drag changes and I feel like something must be done to fix this. In a game about creating spacecraft, there should be some creative crafting space. Currently however, the only functional configuration is a big tube using the brand new \u0022one size fits all\u0022 wing parts glued to the sides.\n\nEither add some sort of airflow protection for stacked wing parts (but limit lift) or revert the drag changes for wings altogether. Wing parts are some of the best creative parts in KSP as they are pretty much perfect \u0027building blocks\u0027 that can be rotated, offset and placed in such ways that their use extends way beyond just being practical. In previous versions I would build SSTOs and cargo aircraft with custom cargo bays made out of wing parts, but that kind of range of creativity just doesn\u0027t exist anymore.\n\nAnd \u0027in before\u0027 the inevitable accusations that I am just lamenting the loss of some exploit, infinite wing placement has never been an advantage, even considering the lift gains. I just want to be able to create realistic looking planes.\n\nPlease fix."},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:27:24Z","Content":"For shape-based lift and drag modeling, keep an eye on what ferram4 is doing with FAR."},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:29:23Z","Content":"I\u0027d much prefer that the vanilla game has a more lenient drag model for wings than having to use mods.

I have only glanced at the aerodynamics panel (I\u0027ve mainly been interested in thermal) but I know there are some sliders in there.

I did some back and forth testing between 1.0.1, 0.9 with stock aerodynamics and with the latest 0.9-compatible version of NEAR, and the worst performance was with 1.0.1.\n\nOf course, I played nearly exclusively with NEAR so the decreased drag of stock 1.0 compared to previous versions suited me just fine, but with 1.0.1 the drag feels heavier than in even 0.9 stock!
