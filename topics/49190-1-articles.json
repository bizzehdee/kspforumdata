Either Spootyman or Dafud Left-handed on KSP-TV and their own Twitch channels(If you aren\u0027t watching it, then go press the button up top, there) had their craft snap apart during reentry, and the science modules survived the crash-landing.

If your craft breaks up during reentry and you don\u0027t see what debris lands, recover it anyway. One of those bits could be a goo container bearing the biggest part of your mission that just managed to soft-land. If none of it turns out to be a science module, you still did a good thing picking up lag-producing litter.

During returns from beyond LKO, I turn off my time warp at around 120k, as from that point on, it isn\u0027t going to be a long trip unless I scuffed the reentry trajectory and end up back out into space. If you are going to jettison the science modules separately, then doing it from a point where they will land within the 2k limit is best(depending on your angle of descent, probably 1-1.5k from ground seems the point of detachment). It may seem like crazy thinking, but that is the Jeb philosophy after all. I often make it a habit to deploy my chutes last minute which helps keep my focus going and adds that last little bit of excitement to the mission. Unless of course I am hotdogging the re-entry, which won\u0027t be something to do when heat comes into play.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-18T23:43:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2013 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by samstarman5\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T22:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUhm - can I land with five pods, take five surface samples, store them each in a different pod, return to Kerbin and ... what then?
