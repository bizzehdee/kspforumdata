It is kind of vague you might agree or disagree and no one might be interested at all. However if you\u0027re trying to introduce friends to KSP but they\u0027re a bit reticent, or are a KSP 2 developer who\u0027s wondering how to reach a wider audience, this could be food for thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s about KSP being widely regarded as a difficult game. When I talk to people about KSP I often hear things such as \u0022Oh KSP looks fun but I don\u0027t have a big enough brain to play that game / it\u0027s too complicated for me / wow you play that game you\u0027re a living god you must be so intelligent\u0022.\u00A0 And while it is true that my quasi-divine intelligence is definitely something to gawk at, I think that everyone who\u0027s ever told me something like that could actually become \u0022good\u0022 at KSP with not too much effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause most of these people erroneously think that playing KSP with any kind of success is like getting a degree in engineering, you need to be good at maths, understand everything about fluid dynamics,\u00A0 you need to have a very \u0022scientific\u0022 mind whatever that means and be good at STEM in general. And well I think everyone lurking on this forum knows this isn\u0027t true. You don\u0027t have to do any maths when playing KSP.\u00A0 Most of the complicated stuff like your trajectory, your center of mass, center of drag, are already calculated for you. You can use some kind of spreadsheet to very precisely budget your Delta-V if you really want to but in 99% of cases that\u0027s pretty much all the maths you\u0027ll ever be doing in KSP, and if you\u0027d rather not do this you can always over-engineer everything and have some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo why is KSP hard then? Is it really hard?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you could argue that it is both really easy and kind of hard at the same time, in the exact same way and for the exact same reason why you could argue that riding a bicycle is easy or hard. And the reason is that both bicycle physics and orbital physics are outside of our regular experience, but the human brain is also very good at adapting and learning how to do new things instinctively. If you went somewhere on Earth where bikes don\u0027t exist and tried to teach someone verbally how to ride, or even to show them, that someone likely wouldn\u0027t succeed at first. They\u0027d have to try slowly, have someone to hold them on their first rides so they don\u0027t fall, and get a feel for how things work when you\u0027re on a bike. But in the end they\u0027d very likely succeed and find it super easy and never loose that skill for the rest of their life. \u003Cem\u003EThis\u003C/em\u003E is called cerebral plasticity, and \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E is what makes us awesome. And just like riding a bike is outside of our normal experience of physics when we first learn to ride, orbital mechanics are also very much outside of our regular day to day experience of physics, and as for aerodynamics,\u00A0 the only thing we commonly experience is that pointy things go faster.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I\u0027ll admit, maybe, that KSP is perhaps a little bit more scientific than just riding a bicycle. But just a little. When you go to the University to have someone teach you Physics, your professor will teach you about scientific rigor, precision, a bunch of facts that you\u0027ll have to memorize, and a bunch of equations that you\u0027ll have to know how to solve. All very rigorous, not much seat of your pants feeling about how things are going to behave. (Of course if you later do actual engineering in your life you\u0027ll use a lot of that seat of the pants feeling because you\u0027ll know what you\u0027re doing by then, you\u0027ll have graduated.) KSP is all about getting that instinctive feeling for how things are going to behave, it\u0027s about instinctively raising the nose of your ship once you\u0027ve passed Apoapsis and failed to circularize by that point, you just know that you\u0027re going to dip back into the atmosphere if you don\u0027t burn a bit upwards, but that you\u0027ll waste fuel if you do it too much. So how do you get someone from a state where their brain can\u0027t compute anything about orbital mechanics to that stage where they instinctively know what to do without having to formulate the thought?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite obviously, the main hurdle is frustration. I think most if not all KSP players are very patient, and if you read through all this you definitely are, thank you, we\u0027re nearly there I promise. I think KSP 1 is quite bad at helping players overcome their frustration, on various different levels. The UI is not simple enough for new players and doesn\u0027t have enough information for psychos\u00A0like me who want to get their geostationary orbit precise to a hundredth of a second. The in game tutorials have pages of text that you must read while the game is paused (or sometimes when your rocket is flying, good luck with those), and this is where KSP 2 comes in. Honestly from what little I saw of the animations they may or may not be better. They\u0027re (slightly) trying to be funny which is good, because keeping people entertained is a good way to make them learn. But it does not help that much which the average impatient gamer who\u0027s just bought a brand new game and wants to try it. No one wants to read pages of texts or watch lengthy videos explanations about how the game works (and if they do they can just go on YouTube like people did with KSP 1), most gamers just want to game. I think the in game tutorials should be in-game at least 99.99% of the time. They need to be that friendly person that holds your back and keep you from falling while you take your feet of the grounds to put them on the bike\u0027s pedals. It\u0027s about getting that first experience, about showing your brain how things work without getting hurt. I never recommend MechJeb to new players because by only using the autopilot some players end up never learning how to fly the rocket and how orbital mechanics work, because MechJeb can literally do anything for you except design the rocket. But I must also acknowledge that for a lot of people MechJeb has been the thing that allowed them to play the game at all, because just trying something over and over without any guidance on what to do or how to do it is very frustrating, and if you don\u0027t have the patience to sit through lengthy in game tutorials or go watch Scott Manley\u0027s tutorials you\u0027ll likely just give up. Mechjeb offers that guidance, that helping hand, but without explaining what it does or teaching you, which is kind of a shame. I think KSP 2 tutorials should be in game, and they should be helping, forgiving, and encouraging. They need to tell the player he\u0027s doing great, that it\u0027s not that hard, it\u0027s just like driving a car, anyone can do it. It\u0027s all about getting players past these first moments when their brain doesn\u0027t understand the first thing about orbital mechanics, and letting the experience teach them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if others are more convinced than I am by what we saw of KSP 2\u0027s planned tutorials, and if you\u0027d agree that (not to brag, honestly) KSP is objectively not that hard as long as you\u0027re patient and ready to make a lot of very frustrating mistakes. And honestly I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s even possible for KSP 2 to reach a much wider audience if I\u0027m\u00A0 right and the main quality required to succeed at KSP really is patience. But given my mitigated results when it comes to introducing some of my friends to KSP, I might be wrong about everything I just said...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-15T00:20:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2022 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by lBoBl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-17T12:43:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP \u003Ci\u003Eis\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0hard- it\u2019s literally rocket science! With no prior background in physics or anything particularly space-y, trying to fly a rocket into space is a daunting challenge: getting the right combination of thrust, fuel, aerodynamics, flight profile etc. to make it to space (rather than a smoking crater where the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E used to be) isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll get right on the first attempt, or even a few after that. The rocket equation isn\u2019t immediately intuitive, has some strange units in it and requires some information that you won\u2019t find easily in stock KSP, while the concept of velocity as a measure of range is totally unlike any other activity, such as driving, that people might be familiar with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHistory is full of situations where space didn\u2019t work they way people thought: a real-life Gemini mission that attempted an orbital rendezvous eventually gave up and went home because they kept trying to fly towards the target but ended up further away instead; it took a great deal of work by some very clever people to figure out why, so it\u2019s hardly surprising that people (including me!) had similar problems in KSP even with the tutorials doing their best to explain how to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP itself can make some problems worse: the tutorials are old and sometimes broken; information can be both overwhelming and inadequate at the same time; and the tools for more advanced flight planning are either limited or non-existent. Mods can fix these problems, but bring their own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 aims to flatten the learning\u00A0\u003Cs\u003Ecliff\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0curve with a greatly improved tutorial system, explaining all the concepts you need to know in a more understandable way so that new players have a fighting chance of making it to orbit before quitting in frustration, and from there to more interesting destinations- just getting to the Mun is a challenge too far for many new players, let alone going interplanetary and forget all that interstellar stuff. However, there\u2019s only so much that can be done to make the game more accessible to new players as at the end of the day it\u2019s still a realistic physics simulation and has to be treated as such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
