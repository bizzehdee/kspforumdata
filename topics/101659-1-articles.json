The last time it happened I had Task Manager open and on top of KSP and it said KSP was using 2.8GB (my system has 8GB so I more available). I have mods installed but I delete most parts, including models and textures, I\u0027ve even delete basically all Squad parts. I\u0027m almost certain that the problem isn\u0027t me hitting the 3.6GB limit, or at least if it is it is some type of memory leak.\n\nThis is an exception that I got right before it crashed last time, I saw it in the debug window but the game kept going for a few more seconds but it most be related. The crash log is below that.\n\nWhen it crashed I was trying to add a fairly small (30ish part) subassembly to my craft (also 30ish parts).\n\nAny Idea what is going on? Is it a FAR problem? Thanks for any help.\n\nEDIT: Well now I\u0027m not sure I can trust task manager, I just reloaded KSP built the exact same craft, in the VAB it claimed KSP was using 3GB, but once I launched it Task Manager only 700-900 MB was being used! Definitely something fishy going on with memory. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E OutOfMemoryException: Out of memory\n\u003E \n\u003E  at (wrapper managed-to-native) UnityEngine.Mesh:get\\_vertices ()\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ferram4.PartExtensions.FARPartExtensions.GetPartMeshBoundsInPartSpace (.Part part) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ferram4.FARPartModule.TriggerPartBoundsUpdate () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ferram4.FARPartModule.get\\_PartBounds () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ferram4.FARBasicDragModel.AttachNodeCdAdjust () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ferram4.FARBasicDragModel.UpdatePropertiesWithShapeChange () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ferram4.FARGlobalControlEditorObject.FindPartsWithoutFARModel (System.Collections.Generic.List\u00601 editorShip) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ferram4.FARGlobalControlEditorObject.UpdateEditorShipModules () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ferram4.FARGlobalControlEditorObject.UpdateWingInteractionsEvent (ConstructionEventType type, .Part pEvent) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at EventData\u00602[ConstructionEventType,Part].Fire (ConstructionEventType data0, .Part data1) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at EditorLogic.\u003Csetupfsm\u003Em__B4 () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\u003C/setupfsm\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at KerbalFSM.RunEvent (.KFSMEvent evt) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at KerbalFSM.updateFSM (KFSMUpdateMode mode) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at KerbalFSM.UpdateFSM () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at EditorLogic.Update () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\n\u003E \n\u003E DynamicHeapAllocator out of memory - Could not get memory for large allocationCould not allocate memory: System out of memory!\n\u003E \n\u003E Trying to allocate: 4194304B with 4 alignment.
