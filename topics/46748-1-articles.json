I know this is used on locomotives a lot, or, at least the CSX ones that pass by my house. How is it more efficient to burn diesel fuel to power a generator to power electric motors than it is to have the diesel engine directly providing torque. It seems to me you would lose energy through heat as a byproduct of combustion. You would then only continue to lose power due to electrical resistance as you sent the electricity through the wires from the generator to the motor. Never mind having to carry around the extra weight too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T06:15:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is quite a nuisance to build a mechanical gearbox for something as big and heavy as a train. Cars have at most 6 speeds, trucks already have a lot more (9 to 16 with often high and low gearing, making the total 18 to 32), so you can only imagine what it takes to drive a fully loaded train. It just makes more sense to not bother with the whole gear thing and just do it electrically, where it is relatively easy to vary the torque and power applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will lose some energy in the conversion, but remember that the diesel motor is quite inefficient anyway.

It is rather difficult to transfer torque to wheels on a moving platform. Electric motors are small enough to just mount them on the moving platform. It also allows you to power much more wheels without too much additional effort which reduces slipping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T06:51:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you describe is called a hybrid engine.

The only reason those cars use gasoline/petrol instead of diesel, is because they were originally aimed at the US market, where diesel isn\u0027t widespread enough for consumer use. The problem with those hybrids is that they are basically on par with conventional turbo-diesel engines in terms of mileage, performance, and emissions, for a much higher price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Europe, where people have been running diesel cars for decades, we are starting to see diesel hybrid cars, which make much more sense. I think the best concept is something like the Chevrolet Volt/Opel Ampera, which is basically a plug-in electric vehicle with a 60km range for daily commutes, but with a conventional generator engine to charge the batteries for longer trips. To me, replace it with a diesel generator instead of gas, and you really have the best of both worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T07:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know diesel is as widespread in the us as here in Canada.

The hybrid concept in cars is quite different than that of diesel-electric trains, since cars use batteries as a main mode of power with a fuel driven engine as backup. Trains are just powered by diesel and not intended to be hybrid in the sense cars are - partly because of the lack of batteries, but mostly because energy conservation is not the goal.

Diesels are most fuel efficient at a few discrete sets of rpm, which doesn\u0027t lend itself well to direct linkage as vehicles don\u0027t travel at discrete speeds. (Can\u0027t get from 0-60 without going through 1-59, but the diesel works best at either 0 or 60 for example.) This is why gasoline fuelled cars typically have from 3 to 5 gear settings in their transmissions but diesel trucks start at 10 and go up from there; you need more gear ratios to make a diesel as flexible as a gas motor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt ends up more efficient to have a diesel motor run at a fairly steady speed, tuned for optimum fuel consumption, to drive a generator and let the far more flexible electric motors handle the train-to-track bits.

You need a very chunky gearbox, driveshafts, final drives, etc. All that machinery is usually heavier than the main generator, motors and traction control system you\u0027d get on a diesel-electric. Electric motors are compact and powerful, you can pack a pair into a bogie very nicely and drive both wheelsets. This means the big hulking diesel can be mounted upstairs inside the vehicle where it can be properly cooled. I have worked on diesels that have had their engines slung underneath, but this generally means mounting it on it\u0027s side so is a bit of a bodge. Cooling isn\u0027t optimal, and ride comfort for passengers with a massive lump of vibrating German machinery under their seats isn\u0027t tip top either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the days of yore the type of diesel engines that could produce the power output a train requires were hulking beasts, I get the impression they simply didn\u0027t have the technology (particularly in the gearboxes) to squeeze it all under the train, so converting to electricity and send it down to the bogies by cable was a very practical solution. Gearboxes these days are better, some of the modern fully fluid boxes are amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother advantage of diesel-electric is that like hybrid cars the revs of the engine can be decoupled somewhat from the traction demand. So the diesel can operate at it\u0027s optimum speeds, while the actual traction motors are controlled by the traction control system. The result is that the diesel isn\u0027t made to run in an inefficient way simply because of the traction demand at that instant. Having electric motors also gives you the option of using rheostatic braking, which saves wear on the brake pads, or even regenerative braking (not usually seen on diesel trains, but ubiquitous in cars). Regen has the possibility of huge efficiency savings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-28T15:19:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2013 03:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Seret\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
