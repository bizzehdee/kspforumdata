Though in my opinion, the Moon and NEOs should be our main concentration to set feet on, explore, and settle, we should eventually colonize Mars. \u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s like the New World in the early days of European exploration. Yes, Mars is a lot less inhabitable than the New World then, but it\u0027s the same in its core. People went exploring the world on ships, knowing they had a far greater chance of dying than of space exploration today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to keep in mind is, exploration and colonisation are 2 completely different games with different set of drives. Exploration, curiosity, search for resources. Colonisation, mainly necessity. I\u0027d think we\u0027d settle on Antartica and the North Pole ice cap before Mars and there is little enthusiasm for that so far as far as I\u0027m aware. So, exploration of Mars, we\u0027re underway there. Colonisation, perhaps. Perhaps not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-18T04:55:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2015 04:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LN400\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
