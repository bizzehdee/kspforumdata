Market prices for the various sorts of rocket propellants are easily found through Google, and the capacities for said consumables are public information. Multiply the market price per unit volume (or unit mass, as appropriate) by the booster\u0027s capacity, and you have the price for any given consumable for each launch. Add those up, and you have the consumables cost of the launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if one was to launch a Saturn V today:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe S-IC first stage carried 810,700 liters of RP-1 fuel and 1,311,100 liters of liquid oxygen oxidizer. (All capacities per NASA\u0027s official technical history of the Saturn boosters, \u0022Stages to Saturn.\u0022) Other than the eight solid-fuel separation motors (which I cannot find cost data for), it used no other consumables, as it steered entirely via engine gimbals, and the hydraulic system for gimballing the engines used RP-1 as its actuating fluid. This works out to 214,164.28 gallons of RP-1 kerosene and 1647.57 short tons of LOX. (Conversions courtesy of aqua-calc.com, and you\u0027ll see the reason for the odd selection of units momentarily.
