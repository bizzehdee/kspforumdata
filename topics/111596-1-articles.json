To my surprise the planet was not there upon exiting the map view. Only when I zoomed out I saw the planet which was an equivalent of about 30,000 meters. Although the planet still has gravity and surface since I managed to land a lander on its invisible surface, it is literally pitch black or colour of the space around. Does anyone have any idea what has happened. Restart of the game does not help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIT\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
