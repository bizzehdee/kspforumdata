I have absolutely no audio at all. Checked settings, nothing\u0027s been changed. Iv\u0027e closed and restarted the game three times now to no avail. Closed windows (restarted) and open KSP once again, still no sound. Iv\u0027e got sound in all other games and programs but not KSP. Anyone got any ideas as to how I can fix this? Thanks for any response and or help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T00:40:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 12:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedCowboy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T23:03:56Z","Content":"Have you installed any mods lately?
