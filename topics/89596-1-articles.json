Sandbox has none activated, Science has only science activated, and Career has all three activated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there\u0027s one problem with this: there\u0027s no point on them being different modes. The same thing could be achieved a lot better if when creating a new game, there were three checkboxes to toggle the three currencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also opens up new gamemodes. Want a budget, but no research or reputation (like most career-oid rule systems on the forums)? You can! Want reputation, but no other currency? Of course! Hate capitalism, but still want to have reputation and research? You can do that! And, what\u0027s more, Squad wouldn\u0027t have to add an infinite* number of gamemodes to achieve this - just three checkboxes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*actually 8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESummary\u003C/strong\u003E: Remove the gamemodes, add toggling of currencies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-06T22:03:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2014 10:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Holo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T18:22:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
