Unless there is written evidence that they supported piracy ( ie internal email - of which law enforcement has gotten legitimate access - where they expressly support piracy and take measures to support it for money ) there is _nothing_ illegal about hosting a file sharing website. I can\\\u0027t stress this enough - there is _nothing_ illegal about it. They even support take downs of non-judiary requests from various companies that SAY that they have found something that they would like to take down, without the possibility of the uploader to revert the decision without spending a lot of money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven the Pirate Bay - which I assume you think actively supports piracy - does _nothing_ illegal. Various media companies and lobbyists would want you to think otherwise, but it\\\u0027s just not the case.
