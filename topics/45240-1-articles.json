I suspect your flipping over issue is because of a high Center of Mass. If you don\u0027t want the hassle of having to fly two different designs, add a decoupler at the top and then a parachute, that way you can dump the parachute beforehand so you don\u0027t have the extra mass during landing on non-atmospheric locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for atmosphere landings parachutes are invaluable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T13:19:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EwbDYIm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EwbDYIm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust make this lower, and the atmosphere descent will turn to the lower site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
