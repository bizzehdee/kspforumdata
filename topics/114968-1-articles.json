I know...it has been some time. But maybe some of you still remember the [BSC-Challenges](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71015-BSC-Aeris-4a-AND-THE-WINNER-IS?p=994346#post994346). They were all the rage in this forum....like one and a half years ago. With the new aerodynamics I think the time has come for a Better Strock Craft Challenge Redux. \n\nLike last time you guys will have one week to build and one week to vote. I will probably split the voting-procedure in a 4-days primary vote, using a condorcet vote, followed by a 3 days final vote here in the forums. Other people will be able to see what you have voted for in the final vote. \n\n**If you want to vote in the primaries - you have to pm me your email-adress.**\n\n**I repeat: I need a pm with you email-adress if you want to vote in the primaries**\n\n**The Challenge**\n\nSo, what is the challenge? Well the veterans might remember: Since the quality of the stock craft that get delivered with KSP is often questionable, I challenge you to come up with something similar but better. Your craft is supposed to be a good craft for noobs that just bought KSP. \n\n**Please check the BSC:** [**Challenge Guidelines Mk.II**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/1086-BSC-Challenge-Guidelines-Mk-II)**- even if you just want to vote!** This is where I\u0027ve outsourced all the rules, legal stuff and design-goals.\n\n**How is this going to work?**\n\nYou will have 168 hours (7 days) to build you craft and post your entry here with at least one screenshot and its .craft file (only one .craft file is allowed). Also be so kind to drop us a few lines about your craft. What are your thoughts on the design? Why is it a good stock craft? Remember: A good sales pitch will often get you more votes. \n\nOnce submissions are closed, everyone who sent me their mail adresses via pm will receive a email with a personal link to the vote. Yes, it\u0027s annoying but this method has proved itself. Depending on the number of entries, we will probably first hold primary election, followed a final one. I would like to encourage you to write a few lines why you voted you that craft, as it keeps the thread fresh and we all have something to read while we wait for the votes.\n\n**What are we doing this time?**\n\nAs you allready know, we are doing the Stearwing D45 - the other spaceplane.\n\n![zyIv70N.png](http://i.imgur.com/zyIv70N.png)\n\nThe Stearwing D45 is a rather stange plane. While beeing a fun concept, it is rather hard to get it into space - you will need every drop of fuel. However, it carries several passengers and has a formidable set of science equipment. So basically I am looking for a spaceplane with a twist, that can show a noob was stange vehicles are possible in KSP: \n\n**Inspiration**\n\nWell, there are obviously no real life counterparts to the Stearwing. But there are \u0022one-and-a-half stage to orbit\u0022 spaceplanes like [SpaceShipOne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne) and [Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo). Well, they are only suborbital, we want a real space plane. Once again the Kerbals are ahead of us. The [Pegasus rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_%28rocket%29) on the other hand is unmanned but is airlaunched and can get a small payload into LEO.\n\n![il6Fud8.png](http://i.imgur.com/il6Fud8.png)![XmhLYx1.png](http://i.imgur.com/XmhLYx1.png)![81vyPcx.png](http://i.imgur.com/81vyPcx.png)\n\n**Contenders**\n\n[Batz_10K - Stearwing D50](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127657-BSC-Redux-Stearwing-D45-Building-Phase?p=2070040\u0026viewfull=1#post2070040)\n\n[Jodo42 - Stearwing D45 v2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127657-BSC-Redux-Stearwing-D45-Building-Phase?p=2064078\u0026viewfull=1#post2064078)\n\n[Kweller - GniwRaets](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127657-BSC-Redux-Stearwing-D45-Building-Phase?p=2069006\u0026viewfull=1#post2069006)\n\n[mrmcp1 - Stearwig D48](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127657-BSC-Redux-Stearwing-D45-Building-Phase?p=2069292\u0026viewfull=1#post2069292)\n\n[Rhomphaia - Stearwing D47b](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127657-BSC-Redux-Stearwing-D45-Building-Phase?p=2064474\u0026viewfull=1#post2064474)\n\n[t3hJimmer - Stearwing XL](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127657-BSC-Redux-Stearwing-D45-Building-Phase?p=2066256\u0026viewfull=1#post2066256)\n\n[Xeldrak - CRoBAR](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127657-BSC-Redux-Stearwing-D45-Building-Phase?p=2067400\u0026viewfull=1#post2067400)\n\nRegistered voters:\n\nRhomphaia, Jodo42, Xeldrak, Batz\\_10K, mrmcp1, vosechu\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T19:37:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T17:46:05Z","Content":"Good to see BSC back on."},{"CreatedByName":"JPmAn","CreatedById":121564,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T23:04:51Z","Content":"I like that this is coming back"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T23:35:50Z","Content":"Well, up till now the response is....reluctant ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nWe\u0027ll see if there will be a Vote.

View full album](//imgur.com/a/7li6W)\n\nCheck out the album in a new tab on imgur for full descriptions and full HD 1920\\*1080 screenshots!\n\nNote that the inclusion of KER data is purely to inform the reader more accurately of the ship\u0027s capabilities. The ship does not have a KER module on it, and is completely stock. The information provided by KER is in no way necessary to pilot the V2 to the fullest extent of its capabilities.\n\nI wanted to create a ship with the same basic appearance and function as the stock craft but with improved performance. To do this, I removed some frivolous bits from the original ship (ie RCS and the cargo bay\u0027s passenger seats) and stretched the fuselage. The wings were also reworked and canards were added to improve pitch authority in the stretched design. A vertical rudder was added, along with a materials lab and an atmospheric fluid experiment in the cargo bay.\n\nAdvantages over the stock ship include a simpler, less stressful ascent path, better in-orbit capabilities, more scientific equipment, constant power generation, and better control authority in atmospheric flight.\n\nDisadvantages are small: the ship lost its RCS system, docking port, and extra crew storage. Power output is slightly less than when the solar panels of the D45 are functioning as well. The V2 is not as compact as the original. \n\nThe craft is available for download [here](http://kerbalx.com/Jodo42/Stearwing-D45-v2).

It is powered by RAPIER engines that can operate as both jets and rockets. Getting to orbit is as easy as pointing the nose 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 above the horizon (pull back until the orange marker on the navball is lined up with the 25 line) and firing the engines at 100% thrust. Once you achieve an apoapsis of 75km (The AP on the map view), power down and wait until you reach apoapsis. Burn prograde at apoapsis until your orbit is circularized.\n\nThe cargo bay can be operated using a right click or taping the 1-key.\n\nThe RAPIER engines will toggle to rocket mode automatically, and can be manually toggled between rocket and air mode using the 2-key.\n\n\\*\\*note\\*\\* the fuel on the satellite is locked, in order to fly the satellite, you have to right click on it\u0027s fuel tank and enable fuel and oxidizer use.

Pitch up to 25 degrees. \n\n**Climb**\n\n- You can pretty much fly hands-off once you\u0027re at 25 degrees pitch. the ship will pitch up to 30 degrees or so as it climbs all the way to space. \n\n- At 15km, enable RCS\n\n- Once the speed starts to drop as the jets lose thrust, stage to activate the rhino. Then press 2 to shut down the jets, and 1 to close intakes (don\u0027t try to fly too long on jets at high altitude, that\u0027s asking for a spin...)\n\n- Note that you don\u0027t need to pitch up further\n\n- Once the Apoapsis reaches 75km, throttle down the Rhino. Set the SAS mode to \u0027Prograde\u0027 to reduce drag, and coast to the edge of the atmosphere.\n\n- About 10s from Apoapsis, throttle up the Rhino until you get to 2100m/sec\n\n**Separation**\n\n- At 2100ms, stage to separate the orbiter. \n\n- Unlock the fuel tank on the orbiter, and stage to eject the engine fairings (note: ensure that you have cleared the transport before ejecting the fairings, unless you want fireworks. well, they \\_usually\\_ don\u0027t do any damage to the transport....)\n\n- Throttle up and circularize the orbit.\n\n- Press \u0022[\u0022 or \u0022]\u0022 to switch back to the transport, and get ready for re-entry\n\n**Transport re-entry**\n\n- Transfer all remaining fuel from the rear-most tank (the one attached to the Rhino) to the front tank (the one attached to the shuttle cockpit)\n\n- Press 3 to deactivate the Rhino\n\n- Press 9 to activate 2 Jet engines for landing\n\n- Keep the nose between 10-20 degrees above prograde (ideally about 15) - note you\u0027ll glide for quite some time at about 30km. (it\u0027s actually possible to climb a bit too)\n\n- Deactivate RCS around 10km. \n\n- You should be somewhere over the large continent to the east of the KSC. Pick a reasonably smooth place for landing. Minimum flying speed is about 60-70ms. Careful on the manoeuvres, it\u0027s quite easy to spin when the fuel gets low. Flaps are on action group 5.\n\n**Stearwing re-entry**\n\n- This is a pretty normal spaceplane re-entry. Make sure it\u0027s not too steep, as there\u0027s lots of melty-explodey stuff on the Stearwing.\n\n- Use up the rest of that RCS fuel to maintain attitude during re-entry. 15 degrees seemed to work reasonably well.\n\n- This version has heavy-duty landing gear fitted, so it can tolerate some reasonably hard landings.\n\n**Action Groups**\n\n1 - Toggle intakes\n\n2 - Toggle jet engines\n\n3 - Toggle rhino\n\n5 - Toggle flaps\n\n9 - Toggle two jets only (enough to fly after re-entry, saves fuel)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T10:47:15Z","Content":"Only ~6h left.
