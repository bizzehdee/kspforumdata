If you got to my profile i have pics of a ship that can act as a remote command and carries 8 micro-satelites and probes. Its an instant planetary comms network in one launch then all you do is send a second ship. I am going to follow my probe command ship with a single launch long-range comms sat, ground based comms package and maybe more micro-sats. All in one go hopefully, they take a fair bit of fiddling to get to a managable size capable of launch but i got the 1000\u002B tons of the probe ship off the ground eventually.
