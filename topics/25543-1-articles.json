Days later a rescue mission was attemted and in no time at all Jeb found himself sat comfortably in the command pod on his return home, then the terable realisation that the amount of fuel wasn\u0027t going to do the job and Jeb once again called on mission control to inform them of his need of a rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo back on Kerbin a plan was hatched to basically strap a bin to the front of a rocket and force the trajectory of the command pod to bring Jeb back home in one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission was a great success, the bin worked perfect(sort of). Jeb landed on land far away from the space center and now a plan to go and bring him back is in the works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow a question regarding my bin rocket, when the command pod was inside the holding and I sped up time the command pod just moved through the walls as if they were not there, but I slowed it down again and the command pod would get stuck inside the wall it happened to be passing through at the time. Any one else had this problem? I had to make some quick changes on the fly to make this mission work otherwise I was gonna have to rescue the rescue, thus the thread title.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EG.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-05T10:31:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2013 10:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gniuz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T10:46:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo idea about the passing through walls issue, but well done on your successful rescue!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI too once had a rescue rocket that needed a rescue.

I\u0027ve not tested this but I\u0027m like 90% sure it will work. The new version of the KAS has a docked mode, if your bin craft has a KAS winch then you could go EVA, attach the little attachment node thing and then clip on the KAS line and set it to be a docked connection. If your bin also has Quantum struts inside it, then they can be switched on and will link with the craft connected via the KAS line and hold it securely. Then you should be able to timewarp just fine, it will basically be just like they are docked, but without needing to have docking ports already on the target craft before you sent the rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edit - btw, I really liked the title of this post, just sums up Kerbal so well!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-05T16:36:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2013 04:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"duncan1297","CreatedById":57230,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T16:31:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis video shows what he means\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/QWosyn17e4U?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gniuz","CreatedById":57846,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T16:44:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replys folks, if its a known problem then i wont file a bug report.
