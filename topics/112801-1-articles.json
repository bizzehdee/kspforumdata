The science goes in but the Kerbal does not. LMB click on Lander Can hatch shows both Kerbals inside even though there is obviously one outside on the ladder. Note: this only occurs with surface eva\u0027d Kerbals, low/high orbit is fine.\n\nThe fix/workaround is to eva the other Kerbal (LMB on Lander Can hatch shows ship is empty) and then they can both board normally.\n\nWhile this doesn\u0027t threaten the very fabric of spacetime itself, it is a little freaky / annoying, at least the first time it happened.\n\nAnybody else come across this?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T23:56:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 11:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zablonski**"},{"CreatedByName":"xrayfishx","CreatedById":76147,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T22:43:37Z","Content":"I have encountered this same bug in LKO so the location is probably irrelevant. I\u0027m not sure my ship had a lander can. It had the size2 capsule and besides that either the lander can, the hitchhiker or nothing at all. I don\u0027t remember. What I do know is that all EVAs happened through the capsule.
