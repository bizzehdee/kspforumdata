In celebration, since I\u0027m a sucker for normal maps, I feel the need to educate some folks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for those of you who don\u0027t know, normal maps are used as a pretty much a technique to fake lighting on models. in geometry a normal is pretty much described the surface of a face or the front of a polygon. Normal maps bake fake normals onto the faces of a model. This brings out an illusion of depth, like the mountains shown in the news weekly photo! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get into more detail, normal maps are calculated by taking the vector of the shaded point and the vector of the light source and dotting the surface with the unit vector normal. The result is a map that labels the intensity of light on the surface, a normal map!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a visual just to add interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Normal_map_example.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Normal_map_example.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mesh on the left is a high detail model consisting of 4 million faces or triangles. The middle is a wire visual of the model when it\u0027s simplified to 500 faces and the right is the same model with normal maps. That\u0027s a model with roughly the same detail while being 800,000% more efficient! So, instead of loading high poly models, you\u0027ll be loading a more optimal low poly model with a normal map on it. This means there\u0027s more detail without the performance dip, and we all love some optimal enhancements for quality results.... right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo who\u0027s all excited to see a graphical enhancement teased into the v.2 release?

How else do games like Call of Duty and Battlefield 3 get away with such levels of detail without destroying your computer? Fun fact, most game models in high budget titles started off as high poly models, before undergoing a process call retopolgizing. This is a poly-by-poly remodeling process where you pretty much remodel the high poly character or asset in order to make a simplified clone of the original. From there, the normals are baked from the original to the retopologized model, making the game asset that doesn\u0027t make your console/PC kill itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T08:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what exactly happens when you land on a feature you thought was quite detailed in topography, but in fact, \u0022simplified\u0022 by normal mapping.
