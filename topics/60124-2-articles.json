I hope they\u0027re semi-randomly generated based on what you\u0027re doing currently. So if you\u0027ve got ships on their way to Jool to set up a base, you get a contract to do something on Jool, not Moho.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to see biomes everywhere, but just expanding the selections is fine. Like, say, adding biomes to Duna, Ike, Eve, and Gilly. Then next update the 5 Joolian moons, and finally the three odd-men out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs they add biomes (and therefore potential to get SCIENCE) I hope they increase the costs of items in the tree. Maybe not all nodes, but make the higher ones cost exponentially more. That way, you can\u0027t max out the tree before you\u0027ve left Kerbin\u0027s SOI, but you can still unlock early nodes with the science you can find around KSC. I\u0027m thinking like the first node still costs 5, the 2nd tier nodes cost around 25 instead of 20, but the last nodes cost like 2000 each. With double, triple, even quadruple the available science, that shouldn\u0027t be totally unreasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like some of the more (and less!) overpowered things tweaked.

Making the tree broader (not deeper) another step where it currently stops getting broader can provide this without having to adjust the science cost of each tier. The little bit extra this will cost to complete the tree is easily offset by further fleshing out the Kerbol system. It was possible to complete the tree in 0.22 without even leaving the Kerbin SoI, and then Minmus got biomes and now grants even more science.

For example, why do we have two final tier tech nodes (costing 1100 science) that do nothing but unlock largely redundant probe cores, side by side? You can scrap/repurpose one of them, move the QBE somewhere else, and combine the two \u0022larger\u0022 parts (the 1.25m and the 2.5m cores) into one node which can stay highest tier. Then that one node at least has a credible reason for being there. Similarly, 0.625m engines and fuel tanks need to come much earlier in the tree so you can actually build a nice and small unmanned probe before finishing the tree. There\u0027s more of these cases scattered around the tree, so a little restructuring will help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Progression parts.\u003C/strong\u003E One thing that I found kind of a shame is the low amount of true progression in the tech tree. It\u0027s perfectly logical to understand why that is - KSP started with sandbox mode, and in a sandbox, every part fills a nice and a purpose. But in career mode, you end up with a tech tree that mostly unlocks sidegrades, not upgrades. A few low-performance early-tech items thrown in just so they can be replaced by better ones later-on will give the player a better sense of constant advancement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-16T16:43:36Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2014 04:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T14:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny of the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EA full tutorial system\u003C/strong\u003E: Controls, construction, flight, transfers, docking, landing, science system, design choices etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E More sound effects for everything.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Some GUI indication that a craft is out of power: Greyed out navball, low power symbol, sound effect.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The navball enhancements that were discussed a few versions back (radial and normal markers).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E A \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54303-0-23-Navball-docking-alignment-indicator-v2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edocking alignment indicator\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E An enclosed manned rover body (the lander cans don\u0027t really suit the aesthetic).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Extra graphical effects and shaders, (the GPU doesn\u0027t have much to do at the moment).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Nerfed 48-7S, redone model with room for the turbopumps.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61632-0-23-Better-Than-Starting-Manned-Career-mode-redefined-%28v1-21-Jan-11th%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERebalance of the science system and tech tree\u003C/a\u003E: Less emphasis on electric charge being the bottleneck at the sub-orbital and orbital tech levels.

If you turn off the music in KSP, it\u0027s just a really quiet game. Go on, give it a try! You might think your volume is muted until you place a second part in the VAB. Barely any of the interface makes noise, and most of the parts are silent. As far as bug fixes go, the map screen is chock full of sorting issues.

I agree that doing it well takes time, but I\u0027m surprised that they added all the other planets in a single update but we got a single biome for the last one.
