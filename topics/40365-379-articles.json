In my opinion, it\u0027s critical to maintain a distinction between the raw form of energy that is being generated by the reactor and the electrical power that comes out. There is a world of difference between a spacecraft designed to use a nuclear reactor as a heat source for a thermal rocket and a bimodal rocket that can generate electrical power from that reactor as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I started work on Interstellar, I did it with modularity in mind. Most people will use reactors and generators as a pair and generally just think of them as one combined unit that does something useful, I do most of the time too, but the point is that you don\u0027t have to and that you can save mass by doing something different if you can live with the more constrained design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think it\u0027s valuable to take a more realistic approach with the techologies that are closer to real time than the more advanced technologies, generally it\u0027s tough to get the physics spot on for technology that hasn\u0027t been invented but I also want to bear in mind that people play in Interstellar for different things. The people who really focus on the very near future possibilities in space exploration are probably also more interested in having a moderately believable potrayal of that technolgy. As the tech scale advances, an increasingly rough portrayal is perfectly adequate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been working on writing a new set of back-end code for the reactors but this is all about increased reliability and providing more information, rather than fundamentally changing the way they work. In fact, functionally, you shouln\u0027t really see a difference aside from the increased reliability of more well designed code.

Treeloader will automatically change the placement of parts on the techtree according to the settings in the tree config file, this generally takes place after MM finishes patching all that it is set up to patch. As a result, modifying the part configs, or creating an MM patch will not work. There\u0027s the main tree config file found in the /gamedata/warpplugin/ folder, and it also gets copied to the/savs/(insert your savegame name here)/ folder.

In my opinion, it\u0027s critical to maintain a distinction between the raw form of energy that is being generated by the reactor and the electrical power that comes out. There is a world of difference between a spacecraft designed to use a nuclear reactor as a heat source for a thermal rocket and a bimodal rocket that can generate electrical power from that reactor as well.\u003Cp\u003EWhen I started work on Interstellar, I did it with modularity in mind. Most people will use reactors and generators as a pair and generally just think of them as one combined unit that does something useful, I do most of the time too, but the point is that you don\u0027t have to and that you can save mass by doing something different if you can live with the more constrained design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think it\u0027s valuable to take a more realistic approach with the techologies that are closer to real time than the more advanced technologies, generally it\u0027s tough to get the physics spot on for technology that hasn\u0027t been invented but I also want to bear in mind that people play in Interstellar for different things. The people who really focus on the very near future possibilities in space exploration are probably also more interested in having a moderately believable potrayal of that technolgy. As the tech scale advances, an increasingly rough portrayal is perfectly adequate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been working on writing a new set of back-end code for the reactors but this is all about increased reliability and providing more information, rather than fundamentally changing the way they work. In fact, functionally, you shouln\u0027t really see a difference aside from the increased reliability of more well designed code. I am, however, away on work business at present so expect any news of future development to be slow for at least the next week or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all your efforts creating this mod, Fractal! Regarding modularity, I love having to add some extra components to the vessels, if only to simulate realism requiring all that extra hardware to work. Hell, some life support modules (I don\u0027t use TAC balancer, not at the point yet where I feel I want to deal with potentially killing kerbals due to advancing time too fast), or a cryo module, or a better hab module would be neat flavor stuff. Even thermal panels and heat management, which is fairly easy (sans the cost mechanic - I may eat those words someday), adds a welcome bit of realism. The only thing I would personally appreciate would be folding generators and engines into smaller packages once you hit the (near) very-end of the tech tree, so you can do some wicked sci-fi stuff on spacecraft without needing all the size and weight of extra parts (perhaps being able to research some dedicated reactor/engine hybrids optimized exclusively for flight as opposed to thermal and electrical power? Worse ISO, better output?) Either way, curious to see what new parts, if any, are coming down the pipeline! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Side note: still haven\u0027t found a niche use for the particle fission reactors though...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you do make something of the ambient radiation mechanic, I\u0027d hope to see various forms of current, plausible near-future, and hypothetically plausible-far-future means to stave off kerbal BBQ until they can crash into a suitable planet. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaveStrider","CreatedById":78109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T19:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Threadsinger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Threadsinger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Side note: still haven\u0027t found a niche use for the particle fission reactors though...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe they are pretty useful for low-tech interplanetary tugs due to their (optionally) high core temperatures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, i have a little problem with the gravity lensing mission, in that i\u0027m not sure what place it has in the mod.
