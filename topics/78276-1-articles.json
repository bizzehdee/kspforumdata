Unless the ready button is select the space bar does nothing. After the count down the player hits the space bar when ready to launch like normal, or hits it prematurely which cuts off the count down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could see the launch button have a pre-flight check list down down meun, Check staging, check struts. or maybe even display notes you can make for the ship in the SHB. I can\u0027t count how many times I\u0027ve stops mid launch because I forgot something I could have made notes to check. or a launch procedure I forgot about on a rocket I built last month.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis feature would have no effect on game play whats so ever, but i could see it being a great immerse mod or addition to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
