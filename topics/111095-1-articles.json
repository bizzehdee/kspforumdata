Not only are there inline fairings, but they separate in however many segments you want and they are persistent debris.

I think fairing segments are treated in a similar manner as broken solar panels are; have no mass, and only serve as graphical effect. You\u0027d have to get into really advanced modding for that.\n\nEDIT: Oh, well never mind then."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T03:58:02Z","Content":"I wouldn\u0027t worry about it.
