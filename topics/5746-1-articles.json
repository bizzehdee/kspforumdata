John Clark testified about illegal pirating in the monline medical feild, in which I respect the feild very highly for. IF this bill is passed then it should only be avaliable to the high-ranking government officals. Rep. Lamar Smith proposed this outrageous bill and had people like John Smith backing him up on this. And, this to me is very dissappointing to me, and my fellow Americans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This bill is a horrific monster, in my opinion. Not because it will, say, take down Youtube\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, or Facebook\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, Wikipedia\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, etc..., but because that in doing so, you are destroying people\\\u0027s ability to learn, as well as other\\\u0027s hard work and effort. Imagine this: You made a Youtube\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 video, and it went viral. Lets say, something like 1,265,965 views in an hour since posting. Then, sombody you don\\\u0027t know, completely out of the blue just comes up to you, says\u0027This video infringes on my rights, cuz I have had that music on mah laptop for teh longest tiemz. INFRINGEMENT! \u0027 and removes your video. Wouldn\\\u0027t that make you mad, like you wanted to kill that person? That\\\u0027s SOPA on a very, very small scale. This bill will let the government take down any site they want and abuse their powers. Its just like communism, if the government runs this way today it is run that way the next day, and the day after. The police everywhere, looking for people who don\\\u0027t agree with the government\\\u0027s ideas and being around up in the middle of the night just for speaking their mind. Unforntantly, this happened before. Once a government is corrupt, then the whole country goes down the tubes, with no one to turn it back to normal because of the new laws they impliment to keep the people just so they can do it a while longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I won\\\u0027t see the internet, possibly the greatest invention of our time yet, go to waste. I, just like everybody else, use everyday to find out information. And so do the schools, I mean, if SOPA was passed then what if Wikipedia\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 was shut down, what else the schools use if Google\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 was shut down as well? And, what if Amazon\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 got shut down, they are an online-only store, and will be run out of business because of this act, with the same story for eBay\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. If you have a Facebook\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, Twitter\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, Myspace\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, or a Gmail\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 then it will be greatly affected, you can more than certainly count on it. I am not trying to start a riot, or a fight, or a \u0027My dad can beat your dad\u0027 situation, but just a peaceful protest. I would prefer that the sites themselves have to monitor everything posted on them rather than the government. It may be more work for the sites, but in the long run, it would be better for everybody. I will not stand for this and, therefore am completely against this act against freedom. I may have my back against the wall here, but I can and I will stand against this bill for all that its worth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E These are my words, and I speak them boldy and proudly, as a true American should.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
