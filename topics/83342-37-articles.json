Later on when you have longer missions you\u0027ll find that it\u0027s not as much of an issue. If you know your Minmus mission will be taking 10 days, you make sure you\u0027ve got something building during that time. Chances are it\u0027ll be complete by the time you finish your mission and you won\u0027t have spent any more time on it than you would have without KCT. You\u0027ll find yourself planning multiple missions, and often running multiple missions, at once rather than one after the other, to try to use time as efficiently as possible. Some people still run one mission at a time and just warp everything, but like the time limitation for things like rescue operations or advancing the universe a bit between launches.

At first load I sit around 2.0 GB, but with the terrible memory leaks in KSP I still get crashes after a few hours after going above 3.5. Without it I can only play for a very short amount of time before going from 2.8 at load to above 3.5. I do see performance issues though, and they\u0027re pretty noticeable. DirectX11 gives me really bad graphical glitches. Looking forward to 1.0 since I hopefully will be able to use DirectX9 again without randomly crashing.

I know it doesn\u0027t translate 1:1, but my GameData folder is 3.82 GB all by itself. Hopefully with the DDS transition in the stock game with 1.0, more modders will use DDS, which will help a lot. I know it is almost silly to have so many mods, but they are so much fun! Outer Planet Mod does have all its textures using DDS already, so I\u0027m not sure how or what got broken. I may tinker with it some more sometime. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, Magico, I do love this mod, KCT. I\u0027ve just started tinkering with it, and found it to be a massive headache early on, not understanding it at all. Scott Manley\u0027s video convinced me to take another look at it, although I wasn\u0027t sold on it at all. However, the PDF instructions manual really did help a lot. I don\u0027t use the \u0022simulate\u0022 function at all, or at least haven\u0027t yet. I did set it to \u0022free\u0022 though. I am using everything else at defaults, except for the rollout time I put at 10%. I thought that was going to make a big difference, but it really doesn\u0027t matter at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, KSP is one big game of \u0022Let\u0027s pretend\u0022 mixed in with Legos, Tinker Toys, Construx, etc. KCT isn\u0027t doing anything that I wasn\u0027t already trying to do on my own, but it is a simple framework that helps remind you and keep you focused on what you\u0027re \u0022pretending\u0022 about. There is a lot of warping forward instead of constant launces, and it really doesn\u0027t change much in the way I play. I was manually doing a 21 Kerbin-day hiatus between launches manually before KCT, and I think KCT may actually let me do more than that. However, the KSC upgrades take a long time, and really slow things down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, all of this is at first. I\u0027m sure the gameplay does change a bit later.
