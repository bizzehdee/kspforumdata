The majority of the shielding would actually be actually for radiation (from cosmic rays and radiation caused by stray atoms hitting the frontal shield and deionizing\u00A0) , a mechanic that could work well with the existing radiation shielding mechanics postulated to exist in ksp2. It may likely be a difficulty setting like re-entry heating amount in ksp1.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe video notes however that the solar system irl is in an unusually sparse region (aka the local bubble)

The devs know that they cant do infinite work, and thus they want everything they do to be valuable and distinct, having more stars for the sake of more stars and not have unique settings would not only be a lot of work, it would lead to a lot of the solar systems feeling the same. Currently its pretty safe to say there are at least 3 solar systems, we know of kerbol and gurdama, and many of the planets we\u0027ve seen dont fit the theming of gurdama (which is a young kerbol esc system). Also I forget which video but a red star is seen in the background of one of them. With the previous assumption Im going to do the bold task and try and guess what stars have a decent chance of being in game. Gurdama is obviously intended to be the star system most players will first enter, with the star likely being similar to kerbol thus not having too many new mechanics, the main gameplay purpose of this system would be to just introduce players to interstellar travel while not shoving too much on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stars I think have the highest chance of being in game would probably be one or two sorts of dwarf (Im guessing a closer red dwarf and a farther white dwarf) and a giant star (guessing red giant). The gameplay niches these systems will fill is having dealing with greater precision for interstellar travel, large amounts of radiation and dealing with greatly increased distances between planets respectively. Some more star systems that I think would fit ksp2 and be unique but be less likely would be a binary/trinary star system (main challenge here would be dealing with the unique gravity), a brown dwarf/rogue planet that serves as a hidden system that\u0027s only revealed to exist later on when you get better telescopes (and probably in a logistically useful position), and a blue hyper/supergiant for late game that has greater radiation and scale then the white dwarf and red giant respectively. If the devs have decided to implement stellar wind (previously they said it was outside of scope), I can also see a planetary nebula with a red giant in the middle to serve as a place of extreme stellar wind. Overall Id be surprised if the amount of systems in ksp2 isnt in between 4-7 star systems.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor some more theoretical exotic stuff that probably wont be in ksp2 but are cool , plank stars are stars that exist within black holes, with the significant energy density of these stars causing significant repulsive pressure due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle. This repulsive pressure eventually causes them to break out of the black hole, however due to the relativistic effects of this extreme gravity, this process would take billions of years. Electroweak stars are another form of highly compact stars that instead of having there repulsion come from fusion, it comes from the conversion of quarks to leptons. This means the repulsion is far less then a normal star and thus they\u0027re far denser. Boson stars are stars formed out of bosons (type of particle, one possible boson that could compose these stars is dark matter), these stars are both transparent and invisible, yet the gravity is significant enough to where you still get significant warping of light (it would probably look similar to a black hole except there wouldnt be any black and you could just see right through it).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-21T03:26:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2022 03:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Strawberry\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ahres","CreatedById":180308,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-21T13:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224166037\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207634\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221661040447\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s well established that everything will be handcrafted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have a source for this?
