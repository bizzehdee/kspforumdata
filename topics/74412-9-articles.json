As it appears in the VAB/SPH, while I\u0027m \u0027holding\u0027 it with the mouse pointer before attaching it to another part, it\u0027s oriented \u0027backwards\u0027, so to speak, and the light is ON. Upon attachment, the light axis is oriented \u0027down\u0027, through the surface to which the light is attached, and it\u0027s still on, showing a VERY bright spot on whatever wall or floor it\u0027s aimed at. Right clicking the part allows no \u0027tweaking\u0027, but then again most of your stuff, BahamutoD, doesn\u0027t in the editors, so that doesn\u0027t concern me. The real problem comes when I launch. After assigning my functions, all two of them (\u0027activate light\u0027 and \u0027toggle mouse aim\u0027, or to that effect), to my desired keys, and then launching to the runway, in my case, I got nothin\u0027. The action group keys I\u0027ve assigned don\u0027t do what they\u0027re supposed to do, and right clicking the light itself only offers a \u0027toggle light\u0027 (I think) button, but that doesn\u0027t do anything either, the light stays off. Oh yeah, now the light is OFF in flight mode. So, no functionality whatsoever from the spotlight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked at the output logs, both during the game and after quitting, and there\u0027s nothing I can find having anything to do with this part or any related plugin malfunctioning or throwing NRE\u0027s or anything, it\u0027s like the game is completely ignoring that the part exists. Other than the fact that I can right-click the part to bring up a nonfunctional context window, that is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis behavior indicates to me that there\u0027s a plugin missing, or not working, or something missing from the config file, but I\u0027ve checked several times, the file in my GameData\u0026gt;BahaSP\u0026gt;Parts\u0026gt;spotlightTurret folder is identical to the one in my original .zip archive. Well, aside from the fact that I changed maxPitch to 90 and rotationSpeed to 9, but I can\u0027t imagine that such minor changes to a config file would totally break the function of a part in-game. The new plugin is in its own Plugins folder in the same BahaSP folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try to remove the entire BahaSP folder in GameData and start from scratch, but I\u0027m not optimistic. Btw, I\u0027m not blaming anything to do with THIS mod for not working, I think... well, I\u0027m pretty sure, one of my MANY other mods is somehow interfering with this one. Do we know of any definite conflicts with BDAnimationModules.dll and some other mod? Several people have been talking about having problems with engine animations, maybe this is related. I do have quite a few MM files that do a number of things with most parts in the game, but it\u0027s mostly stuff like increasing breakingForce and breakingTorque values, which doesn\u0027t seem to have caused much of a problem before. Tweakscale, Tweakable Everything, ATM, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, anyway, I\u0027m running 32 bit KSP, I only have 4 gigs of RAM in my PC, so running this game in 64 bit wouldn\u0027t really get me much improvement to what I already have. That, and whenever I try running 64 bit it crashes with depressing frequency. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I\u0027m off to experiment with some fixes, I\u0027ll check back in a few hours from when I post this to see if anyone has any quick thoughts.
