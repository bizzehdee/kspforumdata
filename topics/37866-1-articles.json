Yes, I figured since it takes so little dV to get to the Mun and back, I\u0027d have the lander make the trip all on its own this time instead of the traditional CSM \u002B lander approach. I probably have to thank the non-stock engines, though, with stock parts it would probably be a bit more difficult to design the lander to do everything (and less historically accurate).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T03:58:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMan, that was a very good Munar mission!
