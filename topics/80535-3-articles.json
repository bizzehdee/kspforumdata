Lots of new kerbals around now that they\u0027d settled here in the League of Eight. A dull rumble rang through the cabin when the voice reached five. Neilny wasn\u0027t sure they should trust any of them. The rumble grew to a roar and a familiar shudder when the voice reached zero. The clamps released, the ship lurched upwards, and Neilny was pulled violently backwards into the seat cushions.

Riding the Luzhins was always a thrill, and one likely to be short-lived with the new Tantares launchers nearing completion. A new, different shudder ran through the ship as the three first-stage boosters were jettisoned. No explosions, all good. Shortly afterwards the fairings kicked off, exposing the small cabin window to the empty darkness. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141014_ksp0163_luzhin6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141014_ksp0163_luzhin6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t you boys have launched me when there was something outside to look at?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNegative, Luzhin, the station sets the clock.

An extra 2000m/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv if done cleanly - not the easiest thing to ask for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first burn of the \u0022Block B\u0022 second stage ended abruptly, pushing Neilny forward into his straps. He checked the flight profile again, pointed the ship southwards, and set up for his first burn. The plan was to expend as much fuel as possible from the Block B to rendezvous with the Anomaly, then complete the rendezvous with Bernoulli using the Luzhin 6\u0027s thrusters. It would leave the craft nearly dry, but the hope was they could refuel while at Bernoulli station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lake, Luzhin.

Static again. \u0022Guess we\u0027re doing this alone then.\u0022 Not surprising, as so far they\u0027d only managed to get one of their new relay satellites into orbit, and it was on the other side of the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane-change maneuver placed the Luzhin 6 on an intercept trajectory with the Anomaly, on the daylight side and barely 10 minutes out.

The ship twisted around to give Neilny his first look at Bernoulli in more than a year. He grimaced when he saw the damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141015_ksp0178_bernoulli.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141015_ksp0178_bernoulli.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lake, Luzhin 6. Think I know why the station has been unresponsive. There appears to have been a seal failure between the lab and the central docking node. I can see a bit of daylight through the gap.\u0022 He used RCS to maneuver around the station, looking for other holes. \u0022Good bet that whatever happened also ripped the power system apart.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We copy Luzhin, proceed with caution. Make sure both you and your passenger are suited up before attempting to enter the station.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, really? He almost responded as such, but decided against it. Enough useless chatter on the line already. The station might be salvageable if they could seal off the habitation module and fix the bits that were torn to shreds. Neilny would\u0027ve preferred to have a mechanic with him instead of, well, whatever Lem was, but any extra set of hands should suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst order of business was to move the docking adapter form the lower, now vacuum-exposed port, to the one on the hab itself. Lem woke up as soon as the Luzhin and the station clanged together. He glanced around, looked at that station, looked to Neilny, and was about to start into another tirade when Neilny stopped him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Look, I get it. Your world is all kinds of messed up right now. Can we just cut the psycho nonsense and concentrate on fixing this station?\u0022 Lem stared at him blankly for a moment then started off into his spiel anyway. Neilny shrugged, ignored him, and moved up into the orbital module so he could unhook the docking adapter. He closed the hatch behind him so he could suit up - and get some peace and quiet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking adapter itself was in good shape, but a quick check of the pressure beyond showed what Neilny had feared - the station internals were exposed to the vacuum. So he unlatched and undocked, moved the ship around to the port on the hab module, and docked back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141015_ksp0182_bernoulli.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141015_ksp0182_bernoulli.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe keyed the cabin microphone. \u0022Lem.\u0022 Silence. \u0022You\u0027ve got to hit the big blue button next to the speaker.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ok. What now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Get suited up. I\u0027m going to head into the station and try to stop any leaks. To do that I need to equalize the pressure between the orbital module and the station, which probably means venting the cabin into space.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ok.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe damage wasn\u0027t as bad as Neilny first thought, aside from the lack of an atmosphere. There was no way they\u0027d ever be using the lab module again, at least not without serious repairs. He radioed the damage reports to mission control, sealed the habitat module off from the rest of the station, and headed back into the Luzhin. If he was right, they had just enough supplies onboard to repressurize the station and keep them breathing good air for a few days. Maybe a full munth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least they\u0027d have more room to spread out.

Hmm.\u0022 Shepgee pointed at a particular diagram in one of the Bernoulli reports. \u0022Is Neilny sure about this?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah. Blew a hole big enough to squeeze your hand through. We were planing to replace the station anyway, but not this soon.

We\u0027ve been there, done that. I want Duna.\u0022 Shepgee motioned towards Haloly, who had all bit ignored him so far. \u0022Any update on this idea of yours? \u0027It\u0027s for Kerbals\u0027 and whatnot? Is it possible to get it built in the time we have?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaloly shook his head. \u0022No. Not without larger parts and a station in orbit to build from. I\u0027ve worked out a smaller version that should suit our needs in the interim. Only big enough for a crew of eight though.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Eight? Hmm.\u0022 Shepgee leaned back in the chair, almost to the point of tipping over. \u0022Ok. So let\u0027s do this.

A small Tantares-built hab. Plan was for Neilny to salvage as much from Bernoulli as he could and move it into the new hab.

Begin the count.\u0022 One of the newer kerbals hit a button and the large clock in mission control started counting down from 5 minutes. Uncrewed flights had a shorter terminal count for some reason having to do with impatience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why do we always launch at night these days anyway?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMilzer just shook his head and half ignored Meldo as he punched in a few settings on his panel. \u0022Station sets the schedule...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, yeah. Station sets the schedule, not us.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe five minutes were gone quickly and the Aspdin 1 was away. Aspdin was the planned expansion program for the Bernoulli Station, meant as a stepping stone back into space. Pressure from the worsening political situation and the damage suffered by Bernoulli [by shrinking 0.25 parts] had turned it into more of a planned mothballing operation.

I finally grew too weary of KSP on my OS-X machine needing 2.7GBs of memory _just to run without mods_. And there are other games I want to play that I\u0027ve not been able to, and with this being the shopping season there were some good deals on off-the-shelf systems. So I picked up a sweet little thing that has a rather nice GPU (Nvidia GTX-770) and an i7 that should be enough for several years to come (i7-4790). So... KSP runs really well on this setup! My Mac will always be my main PC, but it can now return to the video rendering, virtual machine running, code compiling, photo editing, trying to take over the world-ing, and all the other things I bought it for in the first place instead of being abused by games that weren\u0027t meant to run on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, the save file I was using for the alternate space program, the \u002219th\u0022 KSA as run by Gene from Cape Kerbin?

Instead copying over the R\u0026amp;D node from the old persistence file, I just granted myself a bunch of science when I started the new save and unlocked most of what I already had unlocked. And then I unlocked some more, as a form of reparations taken from KSP for glitching my save. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E The other save file, with all the Ad Lunam / 18th KSA stuff is still in good shape, and I have plenty of backups of it should something happen.

Crew assignments.\u0022 That got everyone\u0027s attention. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The good news first. Every one of you in this room will be on either the Jool or the Duna mission. All of you. The bad news is obvious. These two missions will be our last for some time. Those of us going to Jool won\u0027t be back six years. Those of you going to Duna won\u0027t leave until late next year. And with the current unpleasantness on Kerbin, it\u0027s hard to say what the political landscape will be when we return.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the \u0027political landscape\u0027 was rapidly deteriorating. The League of Eight, which had split from the Unified Government of Kerbin for a myriad of reasons, was increasingly nervous about Unionist forces attempting to retake their lands by force. And the Westlanders seemed more than eager to restart the war they\u0027d lost seven decades before, even if under the banner of the Unified Government. And with what Lem had told him, Shepgee was pretty sure it would come to open warfare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Now, the details. I\u0027m leading the Jool mission aboard the Munlit Silence. Haloly will be joining me as navigator. Laning was as giddy as a mortician when he realized he could study first-hand the effects of radiation exposure on living kerbals, so he\u0027ll be joining us as chief medical officer. Meanwhile, Milzer and Meldo will be leading the Duna Expedition. It\u0027s up to the rest of you to sort out who goes where. We need three Engineers on each ship, at least four pilots for the Duna landings, and the science teams to perform the required analysis work on each mission. So, argue it out amongst yourselves and let us know within two days. Any questions?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah!

And at the time I was avoiding Home-Grown Rockets for reasons of RAM and TGA files (both issues have resolved themselves).

Clicking on anything failed. The logs were unhelpful, blaming plugins such as Kerbal Alarm Clock (which I removed), then the Docking Port Alignment plugin (which is nonsense), and then everything at random.

For Kerbal Construction Time I upgraded the high bays of the VAB so bay 1 and 2 were equivalent, and rather fast. (I\u0027ve ignored the SPH.) Building the core stage of the Munlit Silence took quite some time, but not near as long as the armature stage (which we\u0027ll get to later). That allowed the drive stage to catch up to the other two. Only 11 days build for the relatively simple core, with 27 days for the arms and 18 days (29 total after waiting for 11 days) for the drive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/adlunam/20141128_ksp0073_munlit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220141128_ksp0073_munlit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, the core stage went up first.

The core of the Munlit Silence is small enough that the first stage made it to altitude before cutting out, mercifully leaving quite a bit of excess fuel in the second stage.

Because the upper stage of the Core Section\u0027s launcher was still attached, and because I needed to drain it of fuel before it could deorbit, I had to dock the Drive Section on the forward docking port.
