Each engine has a specific thrust and ISP (Specific Impulse, or amount of fuel used per unit of velocity gained). Some engines work better in atmosphere and some in a vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs your rocket burns fuel, it gets lighter, and therefore easier to push. This leads to Asparagus staging being the most efficient method of rocket construction in KSP (not in real life, because fuel can\u0027t be pumped that fast between tanks) because you drop excess empty tanks to shed weight. Total \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv is advanced calculations based on how much fuel you have and how much thrust you can generate with that fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, without mods, it\u0027s not easy to calculate total \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv in KSP, and knowing how much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv you have left mid-mission is even harder. Adding maneuver nodes helpfully tells you the amount of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv needed to accomplish the burn, but nothing tells you how much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv you CAN use.

You could have 7,000m/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv but if your TWR is less than 1, you won\u0027t move. When building a rocket, be sure that each stage has a TWR greater than 1.

I used Scott Manley\u0027s tutorials to get the basic flight path of an SSTO down, then made my own model SSTO using some of the other basics in his other tutorials. After I did, it couldn\u0027t get enough Delta-V to get orbit. I actually had to make a small adjustment to his tutorial to get orbit, and managed to save even more fuel in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for the love of all that\u0027s holy, do \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E try to roll a vehicle with two or more ASAS modules not directly centered on the main vehicle\u0027s ASAS module.

As lajoswinkler showed with his math, the heavier you are, the harder it is to accelerate. If you have better engines with higher thrust, you can accelerate faster because you increase your TWR. As you burn off weight your TWR increases. KSP can actually calculate how long a burn will take depending on current thrust, as you increase throttle the time for a burn decreases.
