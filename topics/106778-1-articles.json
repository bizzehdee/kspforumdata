If so how do you do it? Alternately, are there mods out there that change the default satellite contracts? Or else add alternate satellite contracts? \n\nThe I find it mildly annoying that satellites are almost all in graveyard orbits. I just launched the thing. Use it for something! The vast majority of usable earth satellites are no higher than geostationary (with the exception of Molniya orbits). We only send satellites that high to die. For Kerbin that suggests that almost all contracts should max out at 3,000 km. Its rare when I see ones that low. It also makes it hard/annoying with mods like remote tech."},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T03:35:09Z","Content":"There are some mods ([Mission Controller 2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645) is the one I know of) which allow you to specify your own contracts. There are also contract pack mods which may cover this, though I do not believe that any have been updated to 1.0.\\* yet."}]}
