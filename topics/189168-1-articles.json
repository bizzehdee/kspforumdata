In compact and especially multistar systems, it doesn\u0027t hold up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is because our eyes are very good at adapting to differing brightness. Even at Pluto aphelion, where sunlight is 2400x dimmer, it\u0027s still as well lit as an average living room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, lets say you have a second star with its own planets orbiting at a distance where the first\u0027s light is, say, 1000x dimmer. When orbiting at the secondary\u0027s distance but in a different direction, the light would still appear fairly bright. However, if you orbit near that secondary so you receive an earthlike amount of light from it, then the primary\u0027s light would appear very dim due to your eyes being adjusted to light 1000x brighter. The issue is a little more nuanced, but that\u0027s the gist of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a compact system, the issue arises because you can see the planets from other planets. Lets take the example of TRAPPIST-1. Standing on h, the terrain would look about as well lit as d would from its surface due to only receiving a few times less light. However, if you looked at h from d, it would look dimmer due to your eyes being adjusted to d\u0027s brighter light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is, the stock light system doesn\u0027t account for any of these. The rendered brightness of sunlight is dependent solely on the distance from the star emitting said sunlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m fairly confident such a mod could exist, since the things it would need to access I\u0027ve seen access in other mods. Planetshine modifies lighting outside of the stock intensity curve system, and I\u0027ve seen Distant Object Enhancement react to how bright a scene is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
