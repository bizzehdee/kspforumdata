The craft was well lit from all sides. And the huge doors of the building were also open and it was possible to see the street, the grass in the distance. It looked more comfortable. Now the building is closed and dark. Sometimes bright sunlight penetrates through the windows, but this is a matter of chance. In my opinion, there are not enough artificial light sources of a cold or white hue. I know it\u0027s more of a matter of taste. \u003Cspan lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poppa Wheelie","CreatedById":218525,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-24T19:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt appears that In Game Time passes while in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E in KSP2.\u00A0 So the lighting inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E varies as Kerbol passes from East to West, including strong lighting with high-contrast shadows as Kerbol passes over the roof.\u00A0 And then during game night it\u0027s dark with poor artificial lighting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI vote for one, consistent, well-lit space, please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-25T04:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMe teo\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
