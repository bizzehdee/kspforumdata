I have managed to get into the game just now, but only once out of the five or six times I\u0027ve tried doesn\u0027t really seem acceptable. It\u0027s not my mods, either, as I have tested them all. It could well be the fact that it\u0027s the x64 version of the game, but I\u0027m not sure, so I\u0027ve included a couple of the output logs that have been produced by these crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need more info, let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutput logs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ug6ntag51fpor15/AAC27yIbhf5kgBeaWm6LlyURa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/ug6ntag51fpor15/AAC27yIbhf5kgBeaWm6LlyURa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x3v8v8bb3yol52k/AACnfj5LYgJwzKYnSwudbFHSa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/x3v8v8bb3yol52k/AACnfj5LYgJwzKYnSwudbFHSa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T22:34:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm, it could be write permissions, you\u0027re playing KSP from the desktop and Windows will often prevent programs from writing files in certain locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost Windows folders are protected by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Execution_Prevention\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EData Execution Prevention\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, you can avoid this by running KSP from C:\\Games (you make this folder)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe aware though, that because you ran your copy of KSP from a protected area, Windows now assumes those files to be unsafe, so copy KSP to the new folder and run the copy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows will think the copy is a whole new program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RogueMason","CreatedById":45069,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T16:57:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlas, that doesn\u0027t appear to have worked.
