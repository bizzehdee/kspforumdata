Winged spacecraft would have increased the landing envelope, but traditional fuselage-wing designs were only optimized for subsonic speeds. Consequently, NASA undertook significant research in lifting bodies, which shaped the fuselage itself to generate sufficient lift without the need for actual wings, while being efficient at subsonic, supersonic, hypersonic and atmospheric re-entry regimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA\u0027s original intention for the shuttle was to provide cheap, reusable and frequent access to space, and early shuttle concepts were based around lifting bodies supported by a booster, with a small crew and/or moderate payload capacity. However, the DoD, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the USAF saw the shuttle solely as a means to deploy and maintain reconnaissance and other national security payloads - in return for providing additional funding to cover the increasing development costs of the shuttle, the DoD and NRO now had the final say on many of the shuttle\u0027s specifications:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The DoD and NRO envisioned successive generations of spy satellites becoming bigger and bigger, so insisted on a much bigger (60 x 15 feet) payload bay than NASA originally planned (40 x 12 feet). NASA considered the new requirements excessive for civilian space access, but was forced to concede.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The DoD also wanted increased cross-range capabilities - the shuttle not only was required to reach highly-inclined orbits in order to capture Soviet spy satellites, but also needed the capability to loiter long enough to find and land at an friendly airstrip (in case their original retro-burn put them near bad weather / Soviet airspace).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth these complications meant that the original lifting body concept was no longer viable, and was thus replaced with the eventual delta-wing design. This increased the wing area of (and the corresponding atmospheric/thermal stresses experienced by) the orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad NASA been solely responsible for shuttle development, they would have proceeded with reusable liquid-fuel boosters, which had superior performance, lower per-flight cost, lower environmental and developmental risk. However, the Department of the Treasury\u0027s Office of Management and Budget insisted that NASA pursue the higher-risk solid-fuel boosters instead, due to the perceived lower development \u003Cem\u003Ecost\u003C/em\u003E at a time when the various components of the shuttle system were competing for limited funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, the shuttle was envisioned to have a turnaround time between launches and landings as short as two weeks, being serviced quickly and efficiently like commercial airliners. Instead, the DoD\u0027s new design requirements meant that the resulting orbiter had turnaround times in the order of several months, during which the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) had to be completely disassembled, cleaned, inspected, reassembled and re-certified after each mission, along with the inspection and maintenance of the numerous thermal protection tiles on the underside of its fuselage. A \u0022reusable\u0022 spaceplane is not worth very much if it flies very infrequently and requires what effectively amounts to dismantling and rebuilding the shuttle after every mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the shuttle\u0027s piggybacked booster configuration was an inherently unsafe design, as many KSPers would have discovered to their dismay w.r.t. off-centered thrust. Whereas the Mercury, Apollo and Orion crew capsules have a Launch Escape System (LES) to pull the pod out of the way in an emergency, the shuttle didn\u0027t have that luxury (its ejector seats were removed after early flights). Indeed, the shuttle had much fewer and limited escape options compared to other spacecraft, and even if crew bailout was possible, they were more than likely to be unsurvivable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the \u003Cem\u003EChallenger\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EColumbia\u003C/em\u003E disasters, there were proposals to either reinstall ejector seats for all crew, or to make the entire cockpit ejectable as an escape pod. However, this would have required extensive modification to what was now an considerably antiquated hardware, and once again the DoD would have protested against *any* reduction of payload capability (despite the Cold War having already thawed by that time). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong - I agree that Shuttle was an engineering marvel, given the circumstances of its conception. But the myriad of compromises, cost-cutting measures and questionable design decisions has dampened my enthusiasm for any shuttle revivals for the forseeable future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-28T00:32:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2015 12:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed typos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T23:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESucks for the people on the right side of the plane.\u003Cp\u003EPS: YouTube comments should be banned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan we get a petition going for that...the lowest of the low those commenters are!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd glad to hear all the kind words about the shuttle, such a great time.
