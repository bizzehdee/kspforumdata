The gear were indeed the issue. I moved them to the sides of the solids and now all is well. I\u0027ll need to keep this in mind when I build more SSTO rockets in the future. In the past I\u0027ve concentrated on designs using the T30 and the aerospike, with the odd LV-N, T45 or mainsail tossed in when higher isp, control, or thrust was needed.

An electrical system would also be a good idea for 0.21 use, and bits like ladders for EVA. I totally forgot what ascent settings I had used for this before, but found a new set that worked, it still flies and has over 2800 m/s delta-V remaining once in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solids are nice for an initial TWR boost, and they don\u0027t weigh much empty so it\u0027s not that bad to carry them around the rest of the trip. You can\u0027t refuel them, but ah well. I wonder if using a seat and maybe the new small inline engine could help bring the size of this design down...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T01:50:07Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 01:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
