Haven\u0027t been able to play it recently and I am wondering if the new aero and heating feel too much different from the old version with FAR and DRE. I can adapt, but is there anything I should look out for during transition?"},{"CreatedByName":"Wiseman","CreatedById":116239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T18:07:31Z","Content":"I can\u0027t speak to planes, but launching rockets feels very, very similar to .90 FAR \u002B DRE. I\u0027m sure more talented players will be along shortly to tell me what I\u0027m missing, but at a basic level my play style is exactly the same - I use the same tools, same ascent profiles, the same sort of designs get into orbit, etc. The big difference is the current state of re-entry heating - it\u0027s very low and not terribly dangerous if you put even a little thought into your re-entry profiles. (I expect this to be fixed soon, but that wasn\u0027t your question.) G-forces and heat do destroy parachutes as of 1.0.2, but you can crush your kerbals in a 50-G maneuver and they\u0027ll be fine (as far as I know) so long as you don\u0027t flip your craft out and burn up / smash into something."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T06:26:32Z","Content":"Soo...a bit easier, but otherwise not so different?"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T07:16:29Z","Content":"I agree with Wiseman on the rockets. They feel pretty much like in FAR (you need only a few more 100 delta-v to orbit). However, reentry is way too easy to the point where heat shields are useless."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T07:23:21Z","Content":"Mixed bag, imho.\n\nI would say nuStock is vastly easier to FAR in these respects:\n\n- Spaceplane instability is minimal; you\u0027re far less lightly to have yaw or roll wobbles (basically point where you want to go and eventually you go there).\n\n- There is no such thing as stall; keep a plane pointing level and it\u0027ll fall about 15m/s. Nose down, then flare, and you can land anywhere (that\u0027s got a flat bit).\n\n- Takeoffs are absurdly short; it\u0027s easy to get a plane with limited wing off the ground in 1/3 of the runway, sometimes less.\n\n- Re-entry without airbrakes is easy; just point 15-20 degrees above the horizon from 40km downwards.\n\nOn the other hand...\n\n- You can\u0027t fly as high or fast with air breathing engines. Nothing in the world will get you good power beyond 20km on air, and you have to deal with it. Basically you have to bias planes for a short and brutal atmospheric ascent, followed by a long rocket burn at about 1000m/s and 25km.\n\n- You can\u0027t stack intakes (it doesn\u0027t help because the jets are hard coded to die at altitude).\n\n- Landing *on the runway* is actually harder because you don\u0027t glide as well in the thick lower atmosphere.\n\n- Rapier thrust before mach 1.5 is pitiful. You end up packing more engines than you wanted to carry, just to get you trans-sonic.\n\n(I\u0027m kind of assuming you\u0027re a spaceplane person since you used to use FAR.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T07:45:16Z","Content":"It\u0027s still pretty soupy for aircraft.
