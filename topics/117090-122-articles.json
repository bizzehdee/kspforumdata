I believe that you can mark a floatCurve as persistent.\n\nI\u0027m not sure I see the use case for detailed modification of SRB thrust curves though.  Even knowing what I know about rocketry, the only things I ever seem to find a use case for are constant and decreasing thrust (and usually decreasing - constant is only if the burn time is small enough for burnout thrust to not matter).  Being able to edit float curves through the UI is messy (and people have tried), but if you just provided a few presets I think that would cover 99% of use cases.\n\n[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) in case you missed the edit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-03T19:46:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2016 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by blowfish**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T19:41:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 minutes ago, blowfish said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) Amazing work as always.

I\u0027ve only recently (last 1 1/2 years) picked up modeling and texturing. \n\nPrior to this I spent \u003E3 years doing Minecraft modding, so I am very familiar with the game-update-breakage cycle; nothing new there -- APIs change, and anything depending on them needs updates.  Same way in the rest of the software world (though backwards compatibility is often more prominent).  After many years of \u0027updates break mods\u0027 you get used to, fix things up, and just carry on.\n\nI would love to use the plugin less; but there is so much stuff the stock modules merely cannot handle.  Even simple things like multiple solar panels with a single module, or basic texture switching is unsupported in stock.  That\u0027s not even getting into the modular parts and how impossible they would be to do with stock modules, or the really cool stuff like the engine clusters, dynamic engine fairings, and various decouplers.  With that said I can and do use the stock modules whenever possible, no reason to re-invent the wheel all the time; however their functionality only goes so far.\n\nIf you do happen to run into anything plugin related that is not working properly, please let me know;  I take bug fixing pretty seriously and generally have fixes available for major issues within a few days (minor/cosmetic stuff generally waits for the weekly weekend releases)."},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T15:18:15Z","Content":"![D996IKM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/D996IKM.jpg)\n\n[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) No truer words hath been spoketh. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-04T15:21:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2016 03:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ComatoseJedi**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T18:05:50Z","Content":"Re: Merlin Engines -- have decided to not make a 1A-Vac variant, as there is no need for it that early in the tech tree; instead will be making 1B and 1B-Vac variants.\n\nAs the 1B was never realized I\u0027m a bit torn on which way to go with the geometry.

Also more actual than the A/B variants\n\u003E \n\nAye, I\u0027m kind of leaning the same way.\n\nWill also help me differentiate them stat wise so as to not completely obsolete the Merlin-1A.  I plan on the 1A having a higher TWR but lower ISP than the 1B.  The main differences that will exist between the 1B/V and the 1C/V will be that the 1B/V (and 1A) will have vectored exhaust for roll-control; by the time you unlock the C \u0026 D engines you should have better attitude control available through dedicated thrusters (or the MUS parts...), and the C \u0026 D variants are more geared towards clustering anyway (where you do not need external roll control).  Comparing the B \u0026 C models, the C models will be slightly higher performance (both TWR and ISP), but will lack the vectored exhaust control.\n\nIt won\u0027t be very true to what the plans were for the -1B... but... meh... the thing never existed anyway... so I\u0027m usurping its model # for something custom that fits my needs in KSP ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nSo:  \n\nA = super simple, fairly high TWR, not the best ISP; vectored exhaust; available same time as the LV-T45  \n\nB = \u0027first regenerative cooled engine\u0027, not the best from a TWR perspective, but has slightly higher ISP than the A series; vectored exhaust; available the same time as the LV-T30  \n\nBV = first dedicated low (medium?) thrust vacuum engine; vectored exhaust; early-mid tech placement (90 science node I think)  \n\nC = minor/incremental upgrade from the B in every way except no vectored exhaust; mid-game tech-placement  \n\nCV = minor/incremental upgrade from the BV in every way except no vectored exhaust; mid-late game tech-placement, one level higher than the C  \n\nD = fairly substantial increase in thrust compared to 1C, small bump in ISP, insanely high TWR; no vectored exhaust; not available in career until late/end-game (veryHeavyRocketry)  \n\nDV = same trend as comparing the C and D -- more thrust and ISP than the CV, no vectored exhaust, sits at the very end of the tech-tree (veryHeavyRocketry / experimentalRocketry)\n\nWill know more once I get them all in game and play around with them a bit / think on it a bit more."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceEnthusiast","CreatedById":162961,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T21:29:05Z","Content":"I love your mod, thanks very much for making it!\n\nOne question: I just started a new career and noticed the huge potential of the SRB\u0027s of your mod in terms of thrust.
