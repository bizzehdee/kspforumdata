I\u0027m used to trying to do something with minimum mass, it turns out that is not always similar to trying to do it with minimum dV expended. As someone pointed out earlier, the key to this challenge is getting out of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere with as little dV as possible. Using tricks like flying by Mun multiple times to set up the best Hohmann from there to Minmus, making low burns to maximize Oberth, etc. can save maybe 100m/s. But optimizing the ascent can save hundreds. At first I experimented with flat ascent trajectories and high acceleration to reduce gravity losses, but I kept hitting a wall at a bit under 3050m/s to LKO where the decreasing gravity losses where overwhelmed by the increasing drag losses (Mechjeb has a great option for tracking these, see my pictures). Then I discovered that a straight-up ascent solved both problems if your TWR is high enough! Normally straight up is a bad idea for several reasons-under a TWR of about 5 the gravity losses overwhelm any other advantage, and if you are going to land on Mun or intercept anything in orbit your lack of tangential velocity means the encounter will be at very high speed, also eliminating any dV advantage. It is also VERY hard to aim accurately, and especially to cut off the engine at a precise speed. At a TWR of 12 a 1-second delay in cutoff makes for a 120m/s error! But because I was aiming for a Mun flyby the lack of tangential velocity actually increased its effect, and the aim didn\u0027t have to be so precise as long as you do a correction shortly after cutoff. It all worked out. Normally getting to LKO would be at least 3010m/s, and the burn from there to a Mun flyby would have to be at least 845m/s, for a total of 3855m/s. But in this entry I got from LKO to the Mun flyby for only 3780m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal dV from Kerbin launch to Minmus landing: 4079m/s.

Here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s how I see the physics: Clearly the biggest source of deltaV loss in this exercise is getting off of Kerbin. Getting off of Kerbin entails possible losses from two sources: atmospheric drag and fighting gravity. The ideal solution to the first issue is to launch the most streamlined stack you possibly can as straight up as you can, minimizing the total amount of air you have to go through and how much energy you transfer to it. The solution to the second would be to instantaneously deliver the entire impulse required to get you where you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going on the ground so that you can coast all the way to your destination. You could escape an airless Kerbin that way for around 3.4 km/sec, and whatever fraction of that it takes to reach the Mun SOI plus the drag losses is the absolute floor of how much dV you need to expend to get to Minmus. So what you need to do is accelerate as quickly as possible from the moment you take off, on a near-vertical trajectory that tops out just at the right spot on the inner edge of the Mun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI. Your acceleration will depend on the TWR of the whole stack on the pad and on how much drag it has. The intrinsic TWR of the engine is one critical component of the first parameter, but its ISP is also critically important because it dictates how heavy the whole stack will be. The less fuel you have to boost, the faster you will accelerate. Less fuel also means less total drag, so ISP affects that as well. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know what the correct formula to optimize this relationship is, but I Imagine it works out to something along the lines of maximizing TWR*LN(ISP)/drag coefficient. I think I might try applying that formula to all the available engines and seeing if any of them beat out the Mammoth. I also note the PLAD had an actual capsule on the ship, and you didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t specify that there had to be a Kerbal aboard, so there could be some dV shaved off there by using a probe core.

Having everything based on vacuum dV kind skews the calculation. I was thinking that aerospikes might stand a chance of edging out the Mammoth, but their higher vacuum ISP will penalize them. One thing that might offset this is the fact that values close to vacuum ISP are reached pretty quickly. I monitored the ISP of the Mammoth on a stack very similar to PLAD\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s, and found that it reached 310 at about 22 sec in, and engine cutoff was at 57 sec, so most of the burn actually happens at very close to vacuum ISP. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to spend a little time investigating this. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Calibri;\u0022\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also going to investigate the optimal atmospheric ascent speed a bit more.
