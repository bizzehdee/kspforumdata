Higher friction can help keep a vehicle in place when braked on an incline. It can also help keep wheels from spinning out in low gravity environments (lower gravity = less downward pressure on the wheel, for which higher FC can help compensate).\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ELower Friction Control\u003C/em\u003E: The wheel is more likely to slide, both front to back and side to side, and\u00A0hence a craft with low FC may be more likely to spin out than to flip over. It can also make your steering-enabled wheels less responsive (they slide a little in addition to turning), which helps keep a rover stable at high speeds by preventing overly tight turns. Wheels with lower FC are less responsive to acceleration and braking as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETips\u003C/em\u003E:\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHaving a higher friction control on the back wheels (with steering disabled) \u00A0can prevent you from spinning out\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHaving a lower friction control on the front wheels (with steering enabled on the front and not the back) can prevent you from flipping over while trying to steer at high speed (effectively makes your\u00A0wheels less responsive to steering without enabling advanced tweakables)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou may need higher friction control when driving up and down steep inclines \u003Cs\u003Eor on low gravity surfaces\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#8e44ad\u0022\u003EUPDATE June 2023: Per the third link below (and my testing), while counterintuitive, you actually want\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003Eto\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Elower\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0the friction control when driving on\u00A0low-gravity bodies.

First priority in a low gravity environment is generally keeping your wheels on the ground in the first place when driving, and low friction control helps you do that at the cost of lower responsiveness.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nConsider combining tweaks to brake percentage with tweaks to friction control when trying to keep your planes from spinning as you land/brake\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMore of a brakes thing, but remember that KSP doesn\u0027t have anti-lock brakes, so if you\u0027re spinning out while breaking try pumping the breaks rather than holding them down\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETraction Control\u003C/strong\u003E: Lowers the motor output to a wheel if it is spinning faster than the vehicle is moving.

This can prevent a wheel from spinning out (no torque for you until you match the rest of the vehicle!), but tends to lower motor output for the wheel overall.
