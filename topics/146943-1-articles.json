So:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Make weather(yeah yeah don\u0027t yell at me its on that list)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Wheels: first of all, wheels need to have their tires in proportion to weight. Secondly, the player needs to determine what \u0022coasting throttle\u0022 is for the wheels. Because a 40 ton bus will coast at a whopping 10 m/s with the medium gray wheels(forgot the name). But during this the throttle was only at 20% so it could have gone 50 m/s if the wheels stuck at 100%. And finally, wheels need to stop bouncing off parts and doing other magic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Feature at least\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Econsole\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Egrade graphics. Seriously, with a good CPU I don\u0027t doubt this game could run on 100 CUDA cores or equivalent. And even\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Econsoles\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0have that power. (Even my previous gpu, GT 730). At least add some basic effects plz?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Try to focus less on what mods can do. Pretty much, mods can add parts and mechanics faster than devs can (usually). Consoles can\u0027t have mods, but squad is smart so they\u0027ll figure out a way to get mods in game from stuff like space dock or curse. But some things are better reserved for the base game, like completely new mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. I would love actual river flow and, another thing is the water strip next to cape Canaveral, is something that would be doable and nice so I or anyone else could steer a bit left and go into water, for boats and seaplanes and ditchings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncheers(insert joke here)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-01T20:29:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2016 08:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by 322997am\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
