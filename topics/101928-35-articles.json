Both are things that act differently from KAS. So I don\u0027t know if they are a bug, future feature or a deal with it type of thing.\n\nAlso this has been things I have specifically been testing with inflatable modules from Roverdude\u0027s MKS mod, namely the MKS inflatable habitat.\n\nFirst, I liked the idea of having the part carried on the kerbals back, much like in KAS. It is too large to fit in the Kerbal\u0027s inventory, which was adressed with the carriable = true in the config. That worked fine. But when I set the variable to Physic it tries to put the item on the kerbal\u0027s back, but due to collisions hilarity ensues. Namely the kerbal and the part go flying. But afterwards the part is lying on the ground, while the kerbal\u0027s inventory still shows it is being carried. So this option doesn\u0027t work too well. I gave up for now and set the part back to \u0022part\u0022 for Equipmode and the part can be \u0022carried\u0022 and just doesn\u0027t show.\n\nSecond, when these parts are attached, they show up during the process in their inflated form, rather than deflated form. Additionally it seems to take into account the inflated form when figuring out collisions. To explain, when I attach the part it attaches deflated. But if the Kerbal was standing right in front of the part where they would be colliding with the part in its inflated form, it treats it like there was a collisions, causing the craft to go flying. This can be averted by making sure the kerbal is off to the side so he is not colliding with the ghosted model during attachment, but it is easy to forget and cause issues.\n\nLike I said, I don\u0027t know if these are fixable or even available to be addressed. Either way it isn\u0027t the end of the world but I figured I would ask."},{"CreatedByName":"prog","CreatedById":139695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T17:14:38Z","Content":"**HotSandwich**, checked in latest KIS and it looks like I have the same issue.
