There\u0027s this camera called EZdok where you can \u0022play back\u0022 your launch videos but can switch your views from any angle you wish. You can see the launch from the VAB, or as far away as you wish. You can see the launch from the pilots viewpoint. Do you think someone will be able to incorporate this to KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T17:43:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAT a guess, this is a system where it records the flight path of objects, so that they can be replayed, like the replay function in TF2.
