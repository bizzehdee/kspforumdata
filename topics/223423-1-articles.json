However, I do still feel that currency was a key part of my motivation to play KSP1 and is something I will miss. Let me explain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil For Science was released I had zero motivation to play KSP2. I do not do well in a sandbox. My particular flavor of ADHD derives motivation and joy from tiered unlocks and restrictions, and terrible melancholy and boredom when allowed a totally blank slate with free everything. So like the rest of you, I was thrilled when 0.1.0 gave us an actual gameplay loop. This is how Early Access should have been released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(As an aside; Take-Two made an enormous PR goof pushing the developers to release a mostly broken sandbox. They undermined their developers terribly and presumably broke a lot of trust. I hope someone in management realizes that their decision had a massively negative impact. Take-Two chose to make this investment in KSP2 knowing that it was going to be complex and bumpy road to full release: they should have either trusted their development leads to know when the game was ready, or not made that investment at all. Anyway.)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m about 100 hours into KSP2, about 70 of those after 0.1.0, and it\u0027s very enjoyable! I have not played KSP1 (which is still more stable and features many mods I loved) since For Science. This is 1/3 because I want to support KSP2, 1/3 because KSP2 is genuinely beautiful and fun and contains baseline improvements, and 1/3 because I\u0027m motivated by the new challenges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBut I\u0027m still missing currency! \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have \u003Cu\u003Eno motivation to \u003Cstrong\u003Eoptimize\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cu\u003E my spacecraft\u003C/u\u003E beyond what is needed to achieve mission goals.

Here\u0027s my alternative: I think it would be more interesting if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E produced resources at a finite rate with a finite (but large) stockpile. In this plan, the variety of resources available, the speed of production (ie: deliveries from manufacturers, as opposed to player-built factories), and the size of the stockpile could all increase as more technology is unlocked to scale with player ambition. This would add a subtle incentive to be efficient with resources without being too punishing or grindy since this is the early game (run out of rocket parts? Just timewarp until the next delivery from Rockomax-and hope you don\u0027t miss that transfer window!) Very large-scale missions could consume months\u0027 worth of stockpiled resources, rewarding those who get a head start on assembling the next mothership or thought ahead and built a reusable mothership already. Recovery of stages on Kerbin would make sense as the rocket parts would return to inventory (I\u0027m assuming this is how colonies will operate too) allowing for more frequent launches. Differing delivery rates of different resources would create differing perceived costs for said resources (SRBs would actually be useful as solid fuel comes in bulk and takes the load off the methalox supplier, while uranium and plutonium come in at a trickle, so you have to choose wisely to send up that SWERV, reactor, or big \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E as you won\u0027t have enough to build a second one for a whole year.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, colonies should offer this exact sort of emergent gameplay and problem solving, so how does adding it to Kerbin do better than a money system? Well...It trains us players on how resources work (which parts require which resources? are there resources I use more than others? if I don\u0027t have what I need, how do I redesign to fit my current limitations?) in a simplified manner (won\u0027t need to scan for resources, build mines and factories, nor set up delivery routes) thus offering a gradual introduction to colony resource management and giving an incentive to make those colonies in the first place (I like using the SWERV, but uranium comes in so slowly-let\u0027s find uranium somewhere else!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompare this to funds. Funds wouldn\u0027t teach you anything about colony resource management because there\u0027s nobody on the Mun to take your funds and give you rocket parts. This also increases the perceived jump in difficulty when going to colonies as you suddenly need to un-learn about funds and learn about whatever a uranium is and how to find it (hey why does the SWERV suddenly say it needs rocket parts and uranium? I thought it just needed 300,000,000 kerbucks!) And that\u0027s just the player perspective; imagine being the developer who has to design, build, test, and bugfix and entire game mechanic which exists entirely to become obsolete after 20 hours of gameplay into a 200 hour campaign. (The devs have expressed multiple times that they don\u0027t want parts of KSP2 to simply become obsolete because you unlocked something better. Now, how the Terrier will be useful on Ovin is anyone\u0027s guess, but they aren\u0027t going to waste time making content that is destined to become obsolete.) It just makes more development sense to have one resource system used throughout the entire game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeq","CreatedById":172375,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-02T17:29:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really hope that Kerbin launches will have limited resources at start and you need to build bases to different parts of kerbin to get access to more resources before going to orbit or even escape atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steveman0","CreatedById":64580,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-02T18:10:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could envision a design where production rates on Kerbin are very limited early on but can be upgraded, maybe very much like any other colony, using resources only obtainable from other planets/moons.
