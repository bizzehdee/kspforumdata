Greece declared war on me and I captured Athens, which eventually had enough production to finish late-game units in five turns. They declared war on me again, and I conquered them. I conquered the Scythians and the Spanish after they declared war on me. By that point my empire took up roughly half of my continent. I declared a holy war on Norway and launched a nuclear strike on Nidaros. I won a culture victory because I had 97 tourists coming to see my nation\u0027s great works and thirty others seeing the wonders, which was one more tourist than I needed to win, although the row of seven Seaside Resorts on my coast probably helped a bit as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-31T20:27:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2016 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by astrokerb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-31T17:34:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started a game as Gilgamesh.
