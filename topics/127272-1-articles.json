Now, I know that\u00A0circular orbits tend to do this, but the orbit isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0circular;\u00A0eccentricity should be about 0.143, and I \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E achieved that before this behaviour started. G-force and inclination are also inexplicably\u00A0going fairly crazy. All these values fluctuate rapidly around their initial, proper values, but far too much for me to make any additional fine adjustments imperative to the goal of the\u00A0mission (3 equatorial satellites around Minmus for SCANSat).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I started uninstalling mods to see if I could narrow down the issue. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/470/ToadicusTools\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EToadicus Tools\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/58773-105-tweakableeverything-114-for-all-your-part-tweaking-needs/\u0022\u003ETweakable Everything\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(which is dependent\u00A0on TT, to my understanding), seems to be the culprit. If both are\u00A0installed, I get the described behaviour. If I uninstall either TT or TE (but not both), the behaviour stops when I load the game again, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/mAbvfVd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebut a bunch of my stages go blank, I can\u0027t use SAS, the ship wobbles a bunch, and my cargo (the satellites, attached via clamp-o-tron jr. ports in the cargo bay) clip through the bay doors and fly off\u003C/a\u003E. If I switch to the nearest satellite (dropped previously), It spins out of control and has no SAS any longer. If I remove both TT and TE, my stages and SAS capability come back and nothing flies\u00A0away, but the crazy\u00A0stats behaviour returns.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running\u00A0KSP\u00A01.0.5 (Win32) - Unity: 4.6.4f1 - OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (6.1.7601) 64bit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy list of mods/addons at this point (all updated, and\u00A0pared down to a minimum to reproduce this issue while still being able to load the save) is as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemoteTech - 1.6.9\u003Cbr\u003E\nSCANsat - 1.1.4.4\u003Cbr\u003E\nModule Manager - 2.6.13\u003Cbr\u003E\nTweakableEverything - 1.14\u003Cbr\u003E\nMechJeb2 -\u00A02.5.5\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117662-105-custom-clusters-more-freedom-in-engine-design-0531/\u0022\u003ECustom Clusters\u003C/a\u003E -\u00A00.53.1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/75295-0235-mechjeb-and-engineer-for-all/\u0022\u003EMechJeb and Engineer for All\u003C/a\u003E - 1.2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutput log file is here (both TT and TE installed)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any assistance you can provide! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
