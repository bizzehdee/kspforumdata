Usually you need these to be \\\u0027rotationally mirrored\u0027 which means if you spin them around and attach them upside down on the other side of a cylinder, they would look the same; You do this so you can attach them in 2x symmetry (allowing you to attach controlsurfaces to them in 2x as well.. more on that in a minute)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl Surfaces: These are the controllable winglets, like rudders, ailerons, elevators, and so on. If you attach elevator-type winglets in 2x symmetry, they work as a unit to give you roll control (one goes up, one goes down, you roll over) if you don\\\u0027t attach them in 2x, they work alone and only provide pitch control\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can either make your main wings \u0027winglets\u0027 and attach the control surfaces to their trailing edges (as the C7 wings work) or you can build the elevators/ailerons/flaps into the main wing as a single unit, making the whole wing one big controlsurface (the config lets you set what percentage of the overall surfacearea is counted as \u0027moving\u0027 as far as figuring turning power)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Controlsurfaces, there are three objects required:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enode_collider - a normal collider defining the physical constraints of the wing as a whole, including the moving part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eobj_base - the non-moving portion of the wing, typically what attaches to the shuttle or whatever its connecting to.
