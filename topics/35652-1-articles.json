The Fuel Management system currently in place needs improvement. Here are some things that can be done that I believe would make it much easier to manage fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Make it possible to open and close fuel tanks through Action Groups.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving this option would be a major time-saver for us. There are times where we don\u0027t want certain fuel tanks being used at certain times. Currently, if you want to open or close a tank, you have to manually select it and hit the icon to do so. This is nice and all, but that becomes a hassle when you have a large number of tanks that you need to close off, or if the tank is obscured from view. So, having the ability to put them in Action groups would greatly improve the Fuel Management System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Change how Fuel Transfer works.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one needs a bit of explaining. Currently, when you want to transfer fuel between tanks, you have to select both tanks and then select which tank you want to send fuel to/from upon which the fuel immediately begins being transferred. Again, this would be fine, except when you want to transfer fuel from one tank to six tanks, or six tanks into one, or five tanks into four. There are also those occasions where you want to transfer one tank into eight, but there isn\u0027t enough fuel to go around. So, how can it be improved? First, instead of the current system, you would select all the tanks you want involved in the transfer, then you would designate which tanks are going to be sending/receiving through the UI (if it is not designated as one, it will automatically set itself to the other), then, to begin the transfer, you would select a Begin Transfer icon on the UI, whereupon the fuel will transfer into each of the receiving tanks equally. There would also be an Equalize icon on the UI that would equalize the fuel levels in all the tanks to the same level proportionate to their capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kilmeister","CreatedById":65062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T20:06:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are mods that do this now, (I Use TAC fuel balancer), but I agree that the current stock fuel transfer system could use some improvements.
