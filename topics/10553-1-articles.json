Its handling is difficult, but with some skill it can be used almost as effectively as a far smaller craft. The helicopter is fitted with pontoon landing gear for water landings.\n\n\u003E ![YbkKm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YbkKm.jpg)\n\u003E ![Pfcbc.png](http://i.imgur.com/Pfcbc.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![5B7Lv.png](http://i.imgur.com/5B7Lv.png)\n\nRequires\n\n=C7\n\n=C7 Experimental [including White Owl tail]\n\n=Damned Aerospace props plugin\n\n=HSTW Pontoons"},{"CreatedByName":"mincespy","CreatedById":9003,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T18:08:28Z","Content":"[bragging]\n\n\u003E ![6921119092_2ddd53001e_b.jpg](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5459/6921119092_2ddd53001e_b.jpg)\n\nI have a bigger one ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n[/bragging]"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T18:29:07Z","Content":"*Cougar* vs yours [if both given guns]. *Cougar* would win."},{"CreatedByName":"mincespy","CreatedById":9003,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T18:38:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E *Cougar* vs yours [if both given guns]. *Cougar* would win.\n\nYeah, but the *Asteria II* wins in transport capability.\n\nBut not handling.\n\nOr speed.\n\nOr general controllability."},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T19:21:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, but the *Asteria II* wins in transport capability.\n\u003E \n\u003E But not handling.\n\u003E \n\u003E Or speed.\n\u003E \n\u003E Or general controllability.\n\nWhat would its effective drop range be?\n\nBecause one of VA\\\u0027s passenger aircraft could go further, faster, and most efficiently."},{"CreatedByName":"madmat","CreatedById":16054,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T20:30:56Z","Content":"The cougar\\\u0027s a great looking chopper,The pontoons are a good addition.
