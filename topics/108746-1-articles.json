But from the part descriptions in the tech tree it is not clear to me, how and where to use these parts. Which do you need to put into an orbit? Which do you need to put on a lander (besides the drill)?\n\nHow will the data these new instruments gather be presented? As an overlay like some mods did?\n\nWill these new instruments generate sience points?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T16:09:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 04:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by egoego**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T11:51:29Z","Content":"The basic gist is this:\n\n- Get the large clamshell scanner (I forget what it\u0027s called)\n\n- Launch it into a polar orbit (inclination \u003E80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) on a vessel that also has an antenna and a power source\n\n- Unfold the scanner and start the scan. It will transmit data via the antenna, which costs power\n\n- Once that is done, you can now access the resource overlay for Kerbin (or any other body you just scanned). This can be done in map view or the tracking station when selecting that body and using the third little button on the rightside border of the screen; or directly from the vessel that performed the scan, but that\u0027s usually not as useful because your camera view is constrained.\n\n- Adjust the resource overlay to find a \u0022hotspot\u0022, which is a point where resources still show up even with a high cutoff setting\n\n- Land a vessel with a drill and an ore tank at that location \n\n--- optional: a refinery, though you could also have the refinery elsewhere and transport the ore there\n\n--- optional: a well trained Engineer Kerbal will massively improve your drill\u0027s performance\n\nAnd that\u0027s it! The other two scanners are optional and just help you get more precise abundance readings in specific locations on the surface if you need/want it.\n\nEDIT: I don\u0027t think you get science for this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T11:59:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 11:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sonny_Jim","CreatedById":103060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T11:53:33Z","Content":"There\u0027s a mega-thread somewhere that I can\u0027t for the life of me find, that explains it all. For now, here\u0027s a link tot he Wiki page:\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Ore#Mining](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Ore#Mining)\n\nIn essence, to mine ore and convert it into the different types of fuel you\u0027ll need:\n\nA drill and an ore tank to mine the ore.\n\nAn ISRU converter (possibly on a separate craft) to convert the fuel.\n\nIt\u0027s not possible to convert the ore straight into fuel without having an ore tank, so a craft with a drill and an ISRU wouldn\u0027t work, you\u0027d need to add an ore tank.\n\nEDIT: You don\u0027t necessarily need a trained engineer, but it will increase the mining efficiency.
