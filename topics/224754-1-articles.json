Yes the long wait between updates was not the best, recent news made it worse, but I still like the game and want it to succeed. Less faith but not all is lost. Worst case scenario: KSP2 gets abandoned after proposed IG clousure in July and never recieves any more major milestone updates, same as KSP1 after 1.12. The game would still have more than a month to live at worst and the modding community will continue to support it just like what they did a few years ago to KSP1. If so then it\u0027s just another repeat of the first game. This is unlikely for me since T2 would be losing potential money, as many people would buy KSP2 after some more updates (eg. Colonies, Interstellar, Multiplayer).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nStill can\u0027t understand those people hating KSP2.
