I was flying a jet aircraft with two kerbals in it, Valentina and Jeb. I was flying over water and I accidentally clicked the EVA button instead of IVA. Valentina jumped out of the pod, flew away and kept falling past the water. I switched to her and she disappeared and my view was of space with no planets or anything. I tried to switch back to my aircraft but it was already too far away, I clicked M to see where i was and that was also bugged out. Then i tried to revert the flight, that was also bugged and everything had the same space backdrop. After that I tried to reload the save and it was still bugged out at the space center view with the space backdrop. \n\n**Mods / Add-On:** Hyperedit\n\n**Steps to Replicate:** I did not try to replicate.\n\n**Fixes/Workarounds:** Restart Game.\n\n**Other Notes/Pictures/Log Files:** \n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434193229](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434193229)\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434193185](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434193185)\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434193142](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434193142)\n\nThis image was taken after reloading the game:\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434193076](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=434193076)\n\nSave file:\n\n[http://www./download/6y0u279cyh8gry6/Sandbox1.zip](http://www./download/6y0u279cyh8gry6/Sandbox1.zip)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T15:29:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 03:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SLAYERSOD**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:29:52Z","Content":"Make sure hyperedit is up to date, but it\u0027s known to cause issues even then ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SLAYERSOD","CreatedById":142228,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:34:16Z","Content":"Its a fresh install from this morning. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
