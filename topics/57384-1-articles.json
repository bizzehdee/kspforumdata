Quite proud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully I quicksaved 20 minutes or so earlier, but what happened is I opened my 3 parachutes at 4000 meters or so when I was going at about 100 m/s and my rocket (everything except for the command pod) blew up. I had two side-parachute thingies and one on the top (excuse my amazing KSP vocabulary) on the lander. I obviously cannot redesign my rocket in-flight, but why does this occur and is there any way to get my lander safely down to Kerbin? I have roughly 8 fuel and 9 oxidizer for a lander. I don\u0027t know exactly how much it weighs, but based on some other landers I have seen I would call it medium/small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery small bit of help is appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T03:20:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard to say without pictures, but there are two suggestions I can give you. 1) Open the chutes sooner so that braking is more prolonged and gentle. 2) If you\u0027ve got fuel left (which I think is what you\u0027re saying), burn the engines as the chutes are opening to take some of the deceleration load off of the chutes.

You can also use tweakables to vary their opening properties.
