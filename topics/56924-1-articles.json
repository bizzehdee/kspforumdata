There are many threads about impacts, and most are about how can we destroy the asteroids before they hit us. This is another one of them, but I won\u0027t make you find a way to blow up a 10 km rock. We\u0027ll start simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst Scenario: The Kerbal space station, or KSS. This is double the ISS, which is 450,000 kg, 72 meters in length, 108 meters in width and 20 meters in height. Just double that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSS got hit by a piece of debris which caused it to depressurize. It destroyed multiple docking ports, and it cannot be de-orbited easily. There is a few docking ports left. It cannot be saved, but there is bigger risks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a lot of debris where the KSS orbits(An equatorial orbit at 200 km). Some of it is big, some is small, but if it is hit with something big, a huge amount of debris will be formed. This will greatly increase the population of large and small debris in LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIssue two is if it de-orbits itself. Its orbit will decay in 10 years. It will break up, and debris may land in populated areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to remove the threat.

Kessler Syndrome isn\u0027t that much of a problem in a LEO orbit since it\u0027ll decay in a few months. Few years at most before everything is clear again. As for the falling space station, much cheaper to just see where it goes 10 years down the line and evacuate if it looks bad. If you still have control over the solar panel orientation you could use that to control your descent so you hit the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also, might want to up the orbit a bit. 200km is REALLY low, the ISS is twice as high and it would still decay within a year.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil1993","CreatedById":92469,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T20:51:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you were absolutely certain that the debris would be landing on a large population center (the massive KSP super computer says so) then you could use lasers or some other tool to break up some of the floating pieces so they\u0027re small enough to burn up completely. Then you could try to attach a rocket to a docking port and deorbit the whole station manually so that it lands in the ocean.
