I haven\u0027t been able to implement everything I would want to have, and certainly not everything that has been brought up in this thread, but I think SCANsat is in an overall useable state now where small feature requests also shouldn\u0027t necessitate, say, save file structure changes anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, this build does change the save format, so maybe it\u0027s a good idea to make a backup of your save game before switching. In theory it should be fine, but you know. Note that some changes will only become effective once you switch to your existing vessels for the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main changes in this build are related to sensor efficiency at different altitudes (making that configurable in the part file is what necessitated the save format change), as well as slightly better integration with career mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most visible change to efficiency is that the high resolution altimetry sensor now only produces poor results at altitudes where the low resolution sensor still works. This slightly increases difficulty, but that\u0027s at least partially balanced by more accurate recording during time warp. I\u0027m hoping that the configurable parameters are useful for people making their own parts; on that note, there\u0027s also an animationName property now that you can set to make the plugin try to play an extend/retract style animation when a sensor activates or deactivates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as career mode goes, I have to say that the R\u0026amp;D system is a \u003Cem\u003Enightmare\u003C/em\u003E to work with if you want to do something other than just \u0022push button, get science\u0022. I\u0027ve tried to integrate it as much as possible, so that gathering science works in a similar way as doing experiments. However, all of the math is guesswork and it seems that implementing the right interface for a science container isn\u0027t enough to make recovery work either. So don\u0027t forget to put an antenna on your satellite so you can transmit results back. Since science is awarded based on completion, you don\u0027t need to report from the satellite that actually did the mapping; it just has to be something with the right parts in the right system. I\u0027d be interested in bug reports about getting the wrong amount of size credited after transmission (before transmission is a different story, even certain stock experiments show the wrong numbers there...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull changelog:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBuild 4 - 2013-11-10\u003Cbr\u003E--------------------\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Ground track should not fail anymore on certain escape trajectories.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The SAR sensor has been replaced with a multispectral sensor, and the\u003Cbr\u003E  high resolution altimetry sensor has been replaced with a SAR sensor.\u003Cbr\u003E  (Naming change that doesn\u0027t affect gameplay.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- All sensors had their minimum, maximum, and optimal altitudes as well\u003Cbr\u003E  as their fields of view adjusted slightly. These parameters are now\u003Cbr\u003E  configurable in the part.cfg files.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- A sensor\u0027s field of view degrades linearly below the optimal altitude, \u003Cbr\u003E  and remains constant between optimal and maximum altitude. Parameters\u003Cbr\u003E  are scaled based on planet radius and SoI size, so you can still map\u003Cbr\u003E  Gilly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The sensor changes affect the save format. Existing saves should still\u003Cbr\u003E  work, but sensors will use a default set of parameters until the vessels\u003Cbr\u003E  they\u0027re on become active for the first time after the update.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- To balance the now greater need to set up a reasonable orbit for mapping,\u003Cbr\u003E  the temporal resolution of the scanning process is now adaptive and \u003Cbr\u003E  will increase during time warp to reduce spottiness of the resulting\u003Cbr\u003E  tracks.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Turning off sensors no longer closes the SCANsat UI, but the small map\u003Cbr\u003E  and vessel list as well as map overlays are only displayed when some \u003Cbr\u003E  device on board can provide that information.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- If you run out of power, the minimap shows static and a lot less\u003Cbr\u003E  information is displayed in most windows. (OrtwinS)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Flags on the big map have their own toggle button now. (Thourion)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The minimap shows the area covered by the active sensors on your current\u003Cbr\u003E  vessel as a percentage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The \u0022Forget Map\u0022 button has been relocated to a new settings window.\u003Cbr\u003E  A new button \u0022Reset all data\u0022 is also available that resets all data\u003Cbr\u003E  for all celestials.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The anomaly marker and the close widget character are now configurable\u003Cbr\u003E  in the new settings window. (drtedastro)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Scanning can be restricted to the SoI your current vessel is in with the\u003Cbr\u003E  \u0022Scan all active celestials\u0022 option in the new settings window. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Scanning can also be disabled for individual celestials. For your\u003Cbr\u003E  convenience, completion is shown as a percentage for each celestial.\u003Cbr\u003E  (Includes Altimetry, Biome, and Anomaly scans.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- The temporal resolution of scanning while time warp is active can be\u003Cbr\u003E  configured in the new settings window. Higher resolution means more\u003Cbr\u003E  locations along a satellite\u0027s orbit are sampled. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Some sensors had experimental instrument readouts added that can be\u003Cbr\u003E  enabled via a button. Vessels equipped with a MapTraq device can also\u003Cbr\u003E  access some of this information if it has previously been recorded.\u003Cbr\u003E  The BTDT\u0027s instrument display reacts to the scroll wheel, although \u003Cbr\u003E  that\u0027s only really relevant at the KSC...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- If a part has an animation set via the animationName property, the\u003Cbr\u003E  plugin will attempt to play it for activation and deactivation of the\u003Cbr\u003E  part. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Dragging the minimized main window doesn\u0027t maximize it anymore. (Thourion)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- If the main window is minimized or maximized close to the edge of the \u003Cbr\u003E  screen, it will try to stay at that edge. (Thourion)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- A colour legend is available for height maps. (OrtwinS)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Parts have been moved around in the tech tree a bit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E- Science data can now be collected from parts for applicable fields, based\u003Cbr\u003E  on how much terrain of the planet the vessel is currently in orbit around \u003Cbr\u003E  has been covered. This science data must be transmitted using a suitable\u003Cbr\u003E  communications device like other science experiments; however, recovery is\u003Cbr\u003E  not possible at this time.

SAR is one example, differences in RADAR reflectivity make different terrain have different intensity on SAR images, but at the same time, buildings or vehicles have very obvious and telling RADAR shadows. SAR can also be used to image things that would be hidden to optical sensors, for example, lower frequency SAR can penetrate foliage or even the soil to some extent, so it could detect buildings that are partially hidden. That\u0027s why the biome/anomaly sensor was based on SAR in the first few builds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve changed it to a multispectral one now, an example of that would be Landsat. Obviously, manmade structures are visible on multiple levels here, but data from the infrared bands also correlates to things such as soil moisture or vegetation age more closely than visible band data. I think one of the more famous color schemes for Landsat images is the one where vegetation is red, and cities are blue. Those are shifted so that red maps to near infrared intensity, green maps to visible red, and blue maps to visible green. In these images, old vegetation appears dark red and young vegetation (e.g. crops) appears bright red. Real-life Landsat wouldn\u0027t be useful to find monoliths, but that\u0027s purely a resolution issue. And if we pretend that these anomalies emit some particular radiation unique to them, then it would be easy to have a multispectral sensor that also detects that separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the software side of the biome-anomaly detection still separate?
