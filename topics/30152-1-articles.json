Once your within a few kilometers you want to cut your relative velocity to the target. Once your target velocity is close to zero, find the target marker. If you have ports in wierd places you should do control from here on the port. So point torwards the pink target marker and use RCS with translation controls. H/N is forward/backwards, IKJL is up/down/left/right. So use H to move closer. When close enough set your target docking port as the target and get closer. Once within a few meters try to align yourself (it actually won\u0027t matter that much, so don\u0027t sweat if you don\u0027t get it perfect) then use IKJL to make sure your prograde marker is over your target marker. Use IKLJ to keep the prograde centered while you move forward with H and slow down with N. Once your sure you will hit the docking port at 0.2 or 0.3 meters/sec turn of SAS so the magnetism can pull the ports together. I learned how to dock from a tutorial video once that was not by a pro like Scott. Yes he is great but sometimes you need someone who has recently learned how to dock so you can learn it more easily. Sadly the video was lost in the forum crash.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OUScooby","CreatedById":66208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T03:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been having a lot of trouble with docking as well and MechJeb seems to get it wrong if I have multiple docking ports on my ship, it always tries to point it in the wrong direction. When I try and do it my self I end up with a craft spinning widely out of control. I\u0027m beginning to wonder if the placement of my RCS thruster blocks is the reason I can\u0027t keep my ships under control.
