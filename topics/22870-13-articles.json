This is a widespread problem across all sets - we\u0027ve managed to standardize around certain diameters, but we\u0027re a bit all over the place on lengths. I think this set actually does a pretty good job of it, it\u0027s around the edges where this gets hard. If you want to construct a large modular station, using docking connectors as part of that effort throws off your spacing just enough. It requires having either zero height connectors to keep your size standardization, or connectors that have corresponding non-connector parts which can pad them out to a standardize length - and some sets do these kinds of clever tricks, but its neither obvious nor easy to do.
