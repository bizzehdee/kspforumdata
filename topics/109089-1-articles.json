Will try to recreate it as soon as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:05:50Z","Content":"There are several ways to break career requirements like this. I agree they should probably be fixed eventually.\n\nAnother one is you can save action groups in a sandbox game and then copy the craft to a career game without a tier 3 VAB/SPH and still use those action groups.\n\nIn the end, it is up to you to not cheat. In the meantime, don\u0027t use that craft if it has parts you don\u0027t rightfully own."},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:13:45Z","Content":"My favorite accident was to use a strategy to lower vessel part cost, but then recover it at the launchpad for full value. At high commitment levels and expensive vessels, it was quite a cheat. At least, it worked in 0.90, not sure if you still can do it."},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T22:42:13Z","Content":"Why is this in suggestions?"}]}
