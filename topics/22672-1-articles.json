The massive fuel reserves on board need to be replenished, and you\u0027ve been contracted to do it. (This will be an extra-tricky assignment since the only docking port on the Fahrvergnugen is the one that its heavy lander is hooked up to, and both craft are completely out of RCS!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/kchallenge2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kchallenge2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Since sending up the fuel straight from Kerbin would be prohibitively expensive (though you\u0027re certainly welcome to drop off any excess fuel you bring up with you), your contract is to mine the Mun for Kethane and convert it into fuel for the Fahrvergnugen.* KSP Command has given you one month (that\u0027s game time, not real-time; also, remember that a Kerbin month is 1/4th of an Earth month, so that\u0027s 7 days!) to complete this task; don\u0027t let them down!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * - KSP Command would like to remind you that use of the example mining ship is neither required nor recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You need to refuel the Fahrvergnugen, which is in a stable 50KM orbit around the Mun. This means filling all 7 orange fuel tanks and large RCS tanks (20,160 liquid fuel, 24,640 oxidizer, and 5,250 monopropellant), as well as the attached heavy lander (7,200 liquid fuel, 8,800 oxidizer, and 750 monopropellant).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You need to refill it using Kethane converted into fuel. How you go about this is at your discretion. The Mun\u0027s Kethane deposits have not been mapped for you (though due to how the Kethane Pack works, any scans of the Mun you\u0027ve done prior to this will still be valid), so you do need to consider that as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You need to provide some screenshots: the Kethane map showing the size of your target Kethane deposit(s) before you first start drilling, a shot of the Fahrvergnugen\u0027s resources fully refilled, and a shot of the map showing the size of the Kethane deposit(s) you used after you\u0027re done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The usual disclaimer rules: no cheat parts, mods are fine as long as they\u0027re balanced compared to stock, don\u0027t just hack the save file, etc. MechJeb is not cheating, but use of it will be noted on your leaderboard ranks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScoring\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Your final score is a combination of the initial fuel capacity of the ship(s) you used (the lower, the better), the amount of Kethane you extracted to refuel the Fahrvergnugen (the lower, the better) and the time it took you (the less, the better). Anything taking longer than 7 days since the current time on the save file (ie. longer than 7:08:21:00 since Fahrvergnugen launched) will be disqualified!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELeaderboards\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELightweights\u003C/em\u003E (Least initial fuel investment)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELogisticians\u003C/em\u003E (Least Kethane extracted)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELagbeaters\u003C/em\u003E (Least time taken)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zanis","CreatedById":57177,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T02:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a cool challenge their aren\u0027t allot of kethane challenges and the time limit gives it another layer of depth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules are pretty simple so i might have to try this when I have the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s good to see the challenges like this after the forum died.
