When under the treshold, it acts as an antigravity anchor, only going at 5m/s max, while over this treshold it acts as a propellantless thruster. If you are at high speeds but below the treshold, the drive will try to instantly slow back down to 5m/s - while the rest of your craft still has it\u0027s mass wanting to go forward - generaly resulting in the kraken immediate retaliation ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n(The same can happen when you\u0027re going to a body with low orbital speeds, like the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn - if you engage a krakendrive with orbital speed below the treshold)"},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T17:57:48Z","Content":"Ok i have got the most amazing news guys! i have a new drive design and it\u0027s using the Klaw! yes you heard it right **the Klaaaaaaaw!!!** and it manages to pulsate at about 0.8 Gs. it\u0027s no perfect and i havnt been able to test a one legged drive yet(was so eager to show you and let you experiment) and it\u0027s not the smallest or even the most reliable but i have faith in you and i\u0027m sure we together could do great things with it-and now without further ado i am proud to represent the new Claw Drive \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
