What I\u0027m more concerned with is parachute landing. At the moment it\u0027s the easy way to land on planets like Duna. But what if you want to land at your base and you see a storm brew up and would push you away if you pop the chute... Then you have the fun of trying to anticipate the weather to move upwind of the station before you pop chute... or do you come in low and pop chute later than normal... or do you abandon the landing altogether... Then there is the final two outcomes... crash and live or crash and die. If you live then you have to make it back to your base OR you wait for them to send out a rover or a lander in hop mode.

The appearance would have been nearly the same regardless. Unless you are talking about some rather strong wind (hurricane forces), a returning command pod going straight down with a parachute is not going to be affected much by a cross wind. Where it will really mess things up is trying to land a plane, because planes have significantly more lifting surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, this is not the same, but kin to random failures which Squad is vehemently against.
