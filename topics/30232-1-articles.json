So right after you don\u0027t see the flames of re-entry anymore on your craft, immediately set SAS, then proceed to transfer remaining fuel from central fuel tank to the jet fuel tanks--caution: manual balancing required.

And yes, there\u0027s an extra cockpit seat (rear) for another Kerbal, but this can drastically change your flight performance--you need to experiment on this (haven\u0027t tried it yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) Final note--I haven\u0027t tried flying this using the WASD keys--I fly KSP aircraft/spaceplanes using a joystick, so if you have one, then you might be able to handle it well, but for keyboard users, sorry, I don\u0027t know what kind of behavior to expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake note I don\u0027t have mediafire, only YouSendIt, and thus this link will be dead in seven days:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.yousendit.com/download/WFJYS3dpZ2c1bmdsYzhUQw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.yousendit.com/download/WFJYS3dpZ2c1bmdsYzhUQw\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I just found out that user \u003Cstrong\u003ECupcake\u003C/strong\u003E already has a ship named \u0022Black Mamba\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E So I will rename my ship the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Sigbin\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E...I won\u0027t explain what that word means though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E You can go try and find out yourself. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-02T15:15:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2013 03:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by rodion_herrera\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T18:38:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elooks cool.

On runway, press 4 (close 6 intakes) then press 1, then increase throttle to max. Your V1 should be around 110 kts just before rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Take off (pitch up, very slowly and gently!) at VERY END of runway, being careful not to pitch too high or you\u0027ll damage the Aerospikes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Maintain heading of 90 degrees (Eastwards) then slowly pitch up to about 45 degrees. Try engaging SAS. You will notice that even with SAS on, the craft tends to drift left or right...this is normal...just manually correct it...alternate between pressing SAS then adjusting to keep headed 90 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Due to slow velocity (around 70-120 m/s), it\u0027s a long wait til you reach 10,000 meters, just be patient. Once you reach 10k, make sure your speed is over 350 m/s, otherwise, pitch down a little so that the speed will increase. Once it\u0027s over 500 m/s, you can resume a shallow climb of 10-15 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Now watch your intake value (resources tab). At around 17-19k, you should be seeing the value dropping down fast from 0.25 to 0.16, this is the time to be careful....so when your speed is above 700 m/s and intake value is 0.16, press 4 to open the remaining intakes, and watch the intake value rise again to more than 1.00...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Now watch the speed rise dramatically, passing 1,000 m/s...watch the intake value closely, esp. when you start passing 24k...once you see your v at around 1,250 m/s and intake val of 0.15, then time to engage the AEROSPIKE ROCKETS! Press 2, then Press 1 (to shut down the jet engines), and finally Press 3 and then Press 4. ROCKETMAN...You\u0027re now set for orbital insert!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Slowly climb and build speed (don\u0027t pitch up too much yet), until you reach around 1,450 and altitude of 34,000 m. Once you reach this altitude, pitch up to around 70-80 degrees up. Now go to map mode and monitor your apoapsis...you can go for 90 km or 120 km depending on your remaining fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Once your orbital path tangents with the target altitude (apoapsis), do a MECO...then coast to the apoapsis. Start a maneuver node at the apoapsis to circularize your orbit...do THE BURN...and...voila!!! Congrats!

Plan has been to do an SSTO Spaceplane, but it hasn\u0027t worked as well as I had hoped. Though I do feel pretty accomplished since I\u0027ve gotten a pretty good design (IMHO) and I\u0027ve never really messed with planes before now. Problem I\u0027m having currently is just getting it into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing is my two central turbojets seem to run out of fuel before the outer two. If I put fuel lines from the outer jets to the inner ones then the outer ones run out first. I suspect it has something to do with having the inner jets connected to the tanks for the aerospike. Which brings us to the 2nd problem, the single aero spike isn\u0027t enough to keep the whole thing going once the jets are shutdown. Also even if I make it to orbit I\u0027m not sure I have enough fuel to get anywhere, though I was planning on a few ion engines w/ solar/RTG\u0027s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I run into partlag (less than 200parts) though it\u0027s not a major problem, unless I want to run my turbojets above ~25k. I have been trying throttling down when the intake air is getting low which helps a little but with the partlag the throttle is a little jumpy. Also a little annoying, I\u0027m using the avionics package (seems to work better for my than asas since it keeps me going in the intended direction without turning it off/on, and when I try to keep it from accending/decending too fast it just goes back and forth between 100ms \u002B/-, but maybe that\u0027s just how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, I\u0027m glad to see that I should be able to get to orbit with 8 intakes, I\u0027ve been trying to cram more than that on there which obviously adds to the lag. I\u0027ll just have to keep at it I guess. I do have some large struts and rover wheels on the bottom (for the challenge) so I guess that could be part of it, with the added weight/drag. Could also be down to timing too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any other screenshots from different angles of Sigbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs annoying as this has been...it\u0027s still fun and will be rewarding, if I can ever get it to work. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
