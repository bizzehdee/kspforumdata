I restarted my computer and then the game. I loaded the game I had been playing, and the space center loaded and everything looked fine but when I went to the tracking stating and switch out to a probe headed for Jool the game went blank as it loaded the probe. I could switch back to the space center but everything is ow blank. I can see the boarders on the screen and go back to the main and intro menus but the loaded game will not do anything. I have a crash log if that would help.

Often when you get the Nullspace glitch (as it is sometimes called), restarting the game will solve it temporarily.

After a couple attempt to get it to load last night I went to bed. Figured I would try one more time to load it this morning before I figured out how to upload that large output_log.txt file. The game loaded fine this morning. The probe to Jool, that when I switched to last night, caused everything to go black after the initial game crash appears functional. One of the last things I did last was attempt to reload the last quick save. That seemed to work but not until this morning. When I loaded that game this morning it loaded at the point of that quick save. My Ike probe that I had landed just after that quick save and just before the initial crash was in Ike orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you still want the crash log I would be happy to upload it give. Please give me some instructions on how. It\u0027s too larger to simply copy and paste behind a spoiler tag or similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally is there someway I can backup a game?
