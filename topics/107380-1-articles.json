The only time I can think of when this would happen in real life is going downhill and **not** braking and using the rotational energy to power a generator. If anything braking should consume Electricty.\n\nIt\u0027s mature and common technology for electric trains, battery-electric road vehicles, and some hybrid vehicles. Trains have actually had the first part of it, using the traction motors to brake, for a very long time, including on diesel-electrics, to reduce wear on the friction brakes, but originally just dumped the generated electricity into a resistor grid and then out into the environment as heat (known as rheostatic braking or dynamic braking). It\u0027s also needed on traditional locomotives to help deal with certain limitations of the traditional Westinghouse automatic air brake, which can\u0027t be quickly and constantly varied, so instead the locomotive dynamic brake is used to fine-tune the brake force while maintaining a constant base line force via the air brake.\n\nIf you didn\u0027t have a resistive load or battery to dump the generated electricity into, it would require consuming electricity to brake via the motors. Motors and generators are basically exactly the same thing, it just depends on the way they are setup, and electrical braking just reconfigures them on the fly. It does consume some electricity, to excite the field coils of the motors, but that is a fraction of the energy generated by the motors."},{"CreatedByName":"TothAval","CreatedById":142030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T13:02:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I could see it for Rover wheels after all it should save weight, parts and charge to use regenerative braking using the motors that need to be there anyway.
