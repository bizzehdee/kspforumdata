Then, open the .zip file and extract the content in your KSP game directory. Make sure you **merge** folders.\n\nCreate your picture\n\nUsing a picture editing software like *Photoshop* or, create your cursor image or download a cursor. Save it where you want in the KSP directory, but ONLY in the KSP directory, not out of it. This is important. **It is recommended that your cursor image is not larger than 40 pixels width and height.** \n\nSet it as a cursor\n\nThen go back in the KSP Directory, go in this folder : GameData/MouseCursorChanger, and open the *configuration.cfg* file. Here you\u0027ll see code stuff. That\u0027s easy to understand, don\u0027t worry. So, choose the number you want your new cursor to have, and go to the corresponding **CursorX** section. In this example, I want to set the second cursor up, so I go to the Cursor2 section.\n\n    MOUSECURSORCHANGER{    Cursor1    {        name =        path =        hotspot        {            x = 0            y = 0        }    }    [SIZE=3][B]Cursor2[/B][/SIZE]    {        name =        path =        hotspot        {            x = 0            y = 0        }    }   MORE STUFF .....}\n\nThen fill this section. The **name** value is basically...the name of your cursor. The **path** value is where your cursor image file is in the KSP directory. The **hotspot** section contains data about where the real clicking point of your mouse of your cursor is in your file. The most of editing softwares have a coordinates system, that means you can get the position of a pixel in a file. With that, fill **x** and **y** coordinates. If your editing software hasn\u0027t coordinates system or if you don\u0027t understand it, count the amount of pixel from the left edge of the image to the hotspot point : that is the **x** value, and the **y** value is the amount of pixels from the top edge of the image to the hotspot point. **If you didn\u0027t understand anything, set x and y to 0**.\n\n    [SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=3]   Cursor2[/SIZE]    {        name = example        path = GameData/example.png        hotspot        {            x = 6            y = 1        }    }[/SIZE][/SIZE]\n\nThen, you can also add a different cursor on right and left click. To do that, include a new section named \u0027customOnClick\u0027 like this :\n\n    [SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=3][SIZE=2][/SIZE]Cursor2[/SIZE]    {        name = example        path = GameData/example.png        hotspot        {            x = 6            y = 1        }[SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2]        customOnClick        {            pathLMB = GameData/exampleLeftClick.png[SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2]            pathRMB = GameData/exampleRightClick.png[/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2]        }[/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE]    }[/SIZE][/SIZE]\n\n**pathLMB** is for left click, **pathRMB** is for right click.\n\nYou can also add specific hotspot for left and right click like this:\n\n    [SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=3]Cursor2[/SIZE]    {        name = example        path = GameData/example.png        hotspot        {            x = 6            y = 1        }[SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2]        customOnClick        {            pathLMB = GameData/exampleLeftClick.png            hotspotLMB            {                x = 14                y = 14            }[SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2]            pathRMB = GameData/exampleRightClick.png            [SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2]hotspotRMB[/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2]            {                x = 10                y = 27            }[/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2][SIZE=4][SIZE=2]        }[/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE]    }[/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE][/SIZE]\n\nYou can add only one of these hotspotLMB/hotspotRMB sections if needed.\n\nLaunch the game and choose the right cursor\n\nThe last step is to use this cursor.
