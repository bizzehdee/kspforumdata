Very slow to respond to controls. Press \u00224\u0022 to toggle flaps (although they\u0027re not really needed) and press \u0022U\u0022 to toggle passenger lights, \u0022G\u0022 for gear.\n\nMax Speed is 300 m/s, **Max Altitude 15000m. If it explodes on launch, revert flight - no idea why it does this. Do not physical time warp while in flight EVER.**\n\n***Download:*** [https://www./?zr05c6y93iexra1](https://www./?zr05c6y93iexra1)"},{"CreatedByName":"Zucal","CreatedById":139764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T04:55:11Z","Content":"Nice!
