I was playing 40\u002B hours of ksp in the summer of last year and came to rely on kerbal engineer for all the sweet numbers!! Recently started getting back into ksp and love the kmp mod. obviously I can\u0027t use k3rbal engineer with the mod so my question is, is there any other mods that do the same type of thing that are compatible with kmp? thanks in advance for any replies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
