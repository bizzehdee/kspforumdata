Long version follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrewCapacity is tracked in each partPrefab (the set of \u0022master\u0022 information read in from the GameData folder when the game is loaded used to create each Part instance during play), in each Part (the combination of prototype and prefab information that makes up a unique instance of a part as represented during play), and in the Internal model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn flight, the latter two are used. If the part reports a small crew capacity, Kerbals will be refused admittance even if the internal model is filled. On the other hand, if the part reports a larger capacity, the internal\u0027s seat count will dictate the refusal. This is straightforward to deal with, if it\u0027s what I cared about. I can tweak the part\u0027s field directly, and can remove and add seats from the internal model\u0027s data structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, in the editor, automatic crew filling is governed by the prefab data. This means that in order to change the way the crew filler behaves, I have to change the prefab. This is undesirable: because the prefab is the \u0022master\u0022 data for all future instances of the part, and because the editor does not entirely start parts up the way flight does, changing the prefab has very extensive interactions with future instances of parts. I\u0027ve found suitable places to reset the prefab value, but it still produces behavior that IMO users will find confusing or unacceptable. Just because I can do something doesn\u0027t mean I should. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more I think about it, the more I think that the right way to do this is to use a partless plugin that just gives a \u0022Disable automatic crew assignment\u0022 toggle in the editor; on the Toolbar or near the crew assignment button, perhaps. From there the process should be simpler; if I don\u0027t care about assigning specific values, I ought to be able to deal with the problem from a different perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T19:53:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis will probably fall outside the \u0022tweakable\u0022 purview, but how about changing the behaviour of the \u0022Launch\u0022 button so that it invokes the same function as pressing the launch pad?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toadicus","CreatedById":67745,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T18:12:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tallinu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tallinu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks Toadicus, that would be really awesome. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive this a try: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://toad.homelinux.net/KSP/TweakableEverything/TweakableCrossFeed.dll\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://toad.homelinux.net/KSP/TweakableEverything/TweakableCrossFeed.dll\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tested it at all, but it\u0027s literally just the crossfeed code stripped out of TweakableDockingNode, so it should work as well as that does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, I\u0027m not adding this to any parts myself, but if you want to use it you can write ModuleManager patches like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E// Change \u0026lt;myPartName\u0026gt; to the \u0022name\u0022 field of the part to which you\u0027re adding the module, e.g. for the Modular Girder Segment, \u0026lt;myPartName\u0026gt; should be replaced by trussPiece1x.\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[\u0026lt;myPartName\u0026gt;]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tname = ModuleTweakableCrossFeed\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t// If you want crossfeed to default to off, uncomment the line below.\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t// fuelCrossFeed = False\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: One bit of cautionary advice: fuel crossfeed in KSP is some dark arcanery.

One thing I had to do was set the staging up reasonably, as the re-enabled decoupler was put in a weird spot in the sequence.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the basic issue here is that both of those tools search for decouplers to determine if parts are shed at a particular stage. When I disable staging on a decoupler, I can only take it out of the list; I can\u0027t make those tools believe it not to be a decoupler, and they couldn\u0027t accomodate the tweak themselves without reflection or some dependence on my code. It\u0027s possible that I can work around the issue by \u0022poisoning\u0022 the decoupler\u0027s stage (invaliding their checks later in the logic), but this may come with the side effect that it will always come back at one end of the staging list rather than trying to remember where it was.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-18T03:03:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2014 03:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by toadicus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
