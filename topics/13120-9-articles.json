Wow, how? French? Really? I don\u0027t even know French.\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s not an installer. It\u0027s the actual program. Download, and place it in the KSP folder. Eventough it should work if placed anywhere. It just won\u0027t start KSP or install the mods in the right location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea what that Error code says... Since it\u0027s in French. But I noticed the location was in a temp folder. I\u0027m not 100% sure, but that could be it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry moving it in the KSP folder, and try again. You could also try to run it as administrator, if KSP is located in Programfiles folder. Since KSPMM is moving around files, mod files. But it has caused some problems in the past, with being in the Programfiles folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the French bits. As I said, most of the error is in English and the French parts are either what I translated in the link (\u0022impossible to find part of the path\u0022), or Windows logorrhea. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe folder C:\\users\\me\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\GameData that is referred to is actually missing, but I don\u0027t even understand why this folder is required. The fact is that I just get this message when trying to open directly the .exe file when I download it with my web browser, not after having saved it in a regular folder. When I do that and save the file in my KSP folder, which I guess is the normal procedure, then I just get this Windows 8 message stating that \u0022this application cannot be executed on my PC\u0022. Even when trying to execute as administrator (forgot to say that I tried it in my previous message, sorry). :/ The message is displayed not in a regular window, but in a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jjQ59Al.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efullscreen Windows 8 charm\u003C/a\u003E.
