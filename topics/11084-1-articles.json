I\\\u0027ve decided to try my hand at modeling a good sized parts pack, and for that I\\\u0027ve decided to try and do something not yet done in large quantity. \\\u0027Yep, I\\\u0027ve decided to go ahead and model some boat parts for water-borne craft, be it hulls, ATC towers, engines, etc. This may take a while as I tweak a few things, but I have in mind to do the following - \n\n**Hulls**\n\n-Front Hull\n\n-Mid Hull\n\n-Back Hull\n\n**Engines**\n\n-Underwater Turbine (perhaps animated, uncertain right now)\n\n-Overwater engine\n\n-Maneuvering Engines\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n-New Command Module as ATC tower\n\n-Runway Parts, for aircraft carriers\n\n-Gun Mounting stations (sized to fit JellyCube\\\u0027s Railgun, not included)\n\n**Status Colors**\n\n-Being Modeled\n\n-Being Textured\n\n-Being CFG\\\u0027d\n\n-Not currently worked on\n\n-Done. Yay!\n\nThis is going to be an ambitious project, and I welcome any assistance, although I plan to work on this alone, for the most part. Thank you.\n\n(If this is the wrong thread to post this, please tell me, and I\\\u0027ll be sure to move it to the correct location.

I want to get a workable boat done first, then get into specifics. Speaking of which, the Midhull is prepped for viewing. The box-like extrusion is where the command tower will go after its modeled.\n\n\u003E ![b7nj1d.png](http://i48.tinypic.com/b7nj1d.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T12:21:29Z","Content":"That looks nice, Radion ;D.
