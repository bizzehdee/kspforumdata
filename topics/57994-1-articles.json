Kerbals could die (or be impaired but that might be to complicated) if they spent enough time within these radii. There could also be stock, radially attaching radiation shielding parts that would mitigate or cancel the effect of radiation on manned capsules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, Jool (and maybe other planets as well) could have defined radiation belts, that produced similar effects when a spacecraft passed into them. These belts could be visible in map view (maybe after proper research has been done in career mode, or the proper part is attached to the spacecraft). I think that random solar flares and the like would be another great way to add some suspense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to get a little more complicated, radiation could effect probe cores and scientific instruments but that might be getting more complicated.
