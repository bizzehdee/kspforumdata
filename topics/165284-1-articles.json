Then when you use the move tool to offset their location, or the rotate tool to rotate the part, they would all rotate at the same time. If parts would be \u0027down the same branch\u0027, so you could also for instance instantly make a curve or circle by ctrl-selecting and slightly rotating a row of multiple girders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust something I though all players could agree on.
