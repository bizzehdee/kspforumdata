The hidden properties would only come out during testing - some being positive (like more efficiency from a particular nozzle), with some being catastrophic (instant destruct at a particular low temperature). If a bad property is found, it can be rectified by expending some science points - and the positive characteristic can be taken advantage of the same way. Once the components are assembled into a final rocket part, it too will get assigned some random issue and positive trait that should be explored before actual use.\n\nOf course, such things could often be comical - like science goo occasionally escaping and making the rocket glow green.

[bac9 makes the point much better than I can:](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/747-The-Making-Of-New-KSC)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E For some reason some people like to think Kerbals are sloppy engineers only capable of producing inherently broken designs held together by duct tape. To them, proposing something prim and proper like a NASA VAB could be built by Kerbals is ridiculous. Well, I disagree. Take a good look at the parts: at the LV-N engine, at 3-man pod, at the landing legs, at ion engine. Those are cleanly executed pieces of impressive technology. Kerbals are indifferent to safety precautions and are very excited about explosions, yes, but they make an impression of extremely capable and very competent engineers. Sure, we know they probably turned a construction crane into a vomit carousel or raced on bulldozers in the process, but I don\u0027t doubt for one second they can build buildings similar to real ones, and I don\u0027t think it would be out of character for them. Plenty of other stuff like engines is fairly close to how our human rockets look. It\u0027s unfair to mistake Kerbals for Orks from a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCertain Universe With 40k In The Name,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 or to expect them to build sloppy duct-taped huts.\n\u003E Overall, I\u0027m convinced the obsession with disasters and perception of Kerbals as worthless engineers only caring about explosions is destructive for the game. KSP deserves much more than being a glorified disaster simulator where rockets falling apart and crews being killed is the prime entertainment and the only expected result. The achievements of players who strive to be successful, who create beautiful, well-engineered, reliable designs, should never be devalued, and the opinion that going to space is impossibly hard deserves to be crushed and disproved over and over again. Kerbals are capable engineers and it\u0027s up to the player to utilize their technology well.\n\u003E \n\u003E This same mindset is harming the game in many other areas as well. The bugs of the physics system aren\u0027t there because we thought they would be fun and don\u0027t deserve to be defended as some players surprisingly do. The achievements of reaching orbit, landing on another body or even establishing a permanent base somewhere should not be perceived as something impossibly hard and unreachable for anyone but hardcore players. Everything is possible if you are willing to learn and there is no reason to restrict yourself to playing a disaster simulator with rocket cars or insta-exploding space planes. Justifying that to yourself by creating a certain mental image of Kerbal engineers competency might make the game better for you but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m striving for a greater Kerbal good.\n\nBasically these bugs are crap and should be stomped, if possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Alberto De Beni","CreatedById":98636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T16:50:16Z","Content":"As someone who lost months of work in a matter of seconds because of a corrupted craft file, no, they are not funny."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T16:52:43Z","Content":"Quirks, yes.
