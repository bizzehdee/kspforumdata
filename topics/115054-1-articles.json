It\u0027s very lightweight, doesn\u0027t do a ton, but it doesn\u0027t need much configuring either.\n\nSupports changing atmospheric properties of bodies, and the body radius.\n\nSupports global rescaling of radii, orbital altitude, rotation period, and atmosphere height.\n\nPlease adopt this and release it as your own!\n\nIt\u0027s all on the repo, you can grab it as a zip to play with it.\n\nTwo examples are included, one that modifies Jool\u0027s atmosphere, and another that rescales planets by 10x. If all you want is a changed atmosphere for Jool, delete the second example.\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/NathanKell/BodyLoader)\n\nLicense: MIT\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T22:30:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 10:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NathanKell**"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T23:14:35Z","Content":"Good to have some nice bodymodding options around here.

Tbh C# is quite close to Java, so you shouldn\u0027t need that much conversion. I\u0027d suggest googling for C# for Java Programmers or something, that might help. For KSP\u0027s flavor, check the KSP wiki and the tutorials in the stickies?
