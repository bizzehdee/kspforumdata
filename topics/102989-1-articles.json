Now, i understand the lab counts towards the 9 Kerbal count. But do i have to put the station up in one piece? Or can i assemble it piece by piece and still get the contract done? i plan to put a command capsule and science lab first and then add the Habitation modules in the second launch. Is it possible? Also if i have a station with say 3 Kerbals prior to the contract, can i just add 6 more Kerbal spaces and get the contract done?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethx in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T20:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you can put it up in modules, so long as it meets all of the contract requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T20:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, you will need to launch a new craft to complete a contract.
