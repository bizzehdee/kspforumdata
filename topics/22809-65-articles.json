I have a small probe that\u0027s diving down toward the sun because I have a contract that requires me to test a part at a very narrow altitude range of the sun, closer than Moho\u0027s orbit. It\u0027s periapsis is below this point, and I don\u0027t want to miss the time it happens. So I wanted to set an alarm based on distance. But, the distance box won\u0027t let me enter an altitude in meters larger than about 2.1 billion (I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s limited to a 32-bit integer), so it defaults to the periapsis altitude which is not helpful for me. This is kind of a dumb limitation to have in a game dealing with spaceflight and astronomical distances, don\u0027t you think? I mean, 2.1 billion meters is well inside Moho\u0027s orbit. At the very least I should be able to enter a distance in kilometers.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe limitation is simply because the request for that feature asked for altitude above planet and the orbits \u0022altitude\u0022 attribute is a double.

The alarms look ahead on the existing flight path for when the vessel will be closest to the target distance, and then creates an alarm at that point in time, for the expected arrival. As your vessels current flight path only has it going up for the next 4 secs (cuase its just launched and building speed) thats when the alarm will fire. Of course as you are still burning and the flight path is adjusting as you gain velocity thats not gonna be your ultimate spot, but the Clock doesnt go back and constantly recheck flight parameters and update the distance alarms. it might be possible to add another alarm type to handle your scenario, as long as there\u0027s no warping involved (as slowing things down gracefully if the flight path is changing hasnt been successful in most tests). Hope that explains it and its not too much babble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor extra credit in 1.0 and later the aero model changes mean that its actually better to start your gravity turn quite early - around about 100m/s velocity and then to let the vessel \u0022fall\u0022 over and follow the prograde marker up into orbit. Some good references on gravity turns in 1.0 are :\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_q_8TO4Ag0E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E and\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnAPDnv5kf8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"barfing_skull","CreatedById":126825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T05:06:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TriggerAu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TriggerAu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHavent seen that one myself, one thing that has caused issue like that in the past is Control Locks - in the KAC settings you you turn off the locks that it does to see if that fixes it.

Jumping from one vessel to another, or going between a vessel and the Space Center. It seems somewhat random, maybe 1 context switch out of 10? Enough that it\u0027s a nuisance. Certainly could be cross-mod interaction, though I did clean out my GameData folder recently to try and diagnose a problem with another mod.
