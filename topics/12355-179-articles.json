I have had no problems using MechJeb on MacOS X 10.8 and 10.9 other than ones that have been posted to this forum. MacOS X 10.9 has issues with KSP that are independent of MechJeb. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(the independent issues are 1.) KSP writes to directories in its directory. Since this activity is expressly forbidden for the /Applications directory, it is wisest to have KSP installed in your home directory or a subfolder of your home directory. 2.) MacOS X has issues with the manner in which the SM3 Terrain Shader handles memory management - or at least that is how I read the sampling - and so hangs when the shader is being used. The SM3 Terrain Shader in settings:Graphics should be disabled in MacOS X 10.9)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eskips\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T14:33:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENoik : no, jet engine (and rapier in jet mode) have a large reaction time and that confuse MJ in the final steps of the landing.
