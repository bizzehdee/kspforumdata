Bob had gotten off the craft and as he started to sink a little he was killed (appeared to crash into ocean floor quickly) and the screen went to outer space with a Surface speed of 55528.6 m/s. So it seams the new buoyancy fix has an issue with kerbals in EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T05:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich mods are you using?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"oab2","CreatedById":151584,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T06:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMJ, KER, Alarm clock, docking port indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qapla","CreatedById":153367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T18:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can confirm that a similar issue occurs on a mac with no mods installed. Without time-warp, a kerbal on EVA hit the water at roughly 20 m/s straight down, and rebounded at roughly 40m/s straight up. The process continued up to around 150 m/s, at which point the kerbal died.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
