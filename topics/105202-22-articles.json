As far as mass, the small kontainers are 0.4 tons Vs 1.5 tons for the wee greenhouses.\n\u003E My assumption is that the Pioneer module is pretty much obsolete on vessels that have a Kerbitat and Aeroponics, since adding a dedicated lab is much lighter.\n\u003E \n\u003E My thought was that since the Aeroponics inflatables have storage for water substrate and Organics now, it would make sense for somewhere in the chain to hold mulch (Kerb\u002B Inflateables and Habi\u002B inflatables) without having to build any additional storage. I mean I am able remember now, but I had to launch 2 rescue missions over it and it is a bit of a pain. \n\u003E \n\u003E For surface bases the landing sections have it. I suppose on massive stations you\u0027d just be using the LS inflatable storage, but for the sake of not wrecking missions, I think having a tiny amount(50-1000) of mulch storage in the inflatable habs would be a positive change.\n\nSimilar to someone else on here, I tweaked the small supply container to also have space for 100 mulch, and I strap an empty pair on to the aero module or wherever needs mulch storage. Works a treat, and the specs (weight, 100 days mulch storage for 1 kerbal, etc) are about right. You can bolt on one of the other storage containers, but they are all either very big or very heavy, and this looks much prettier. Technically, you could cheat a little and put both supplies and mulch in there I guess, but we\u0027re only talking about 100 units after all, and I\u0027m sure no-one wants to store their supplies in the garbage can."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T23:29:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there a way to disable the kicking supplies out the airlock feature? I just lost all my supplies on a Jool mission even though I had full power and that giant USI generator providing more power than they\u0027d ever need. It happened immediately upon jumping to the ship via Kerbal Alarm Clock, so I suppose there could be a compatibility issue, but I\u0027d prefer to just remove that mechanic entirely.\n\u003E My solar-powered ships consistently lose all power at maximum warp due to something funky going on with how solar input is calculated. I generally have to warp at the 2nd-fastest speed in those situations, which is annoying.\n\nNot sure why it\u0027s causing you an issue - I\u0027ve had no such problems in multiple saves - and there\u0027s no option for disabling that feature as it\u0027s built into the code."},{"CreatedByName":"Tahib","CreatedById":111243,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T19:22:25Z","Content":"great lifesupp addon. i do not see why this is called alpha.\n\nplease convert textures to \\*.DDS for faster loading times. you may use this: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter) i didnt checked your other addons but may help you\n\ni\u0027m not sure i understand how NomOMatic5000 works.

It does fit the Kerbal \u0022theme\u0022 and doesn\u0027t require micro managing a lot of different resources, and I\u0027m also using MKS/OKS. I\u0027ve been playing with this on my career on a custom hard mode and I\u0027ve finally unlocked the tech I need and raised enough money to finally set off and start exploring the Mun. I don\u0027t want to have to bring extra parts just to store a few supplies for quick missions to the Mun and Minmus, plus I can\u0027t afford to upgrade the VAB right now and that 30 part limit is making it hard. I realize Kerbals go without supplies for 15 days, but that feels cruel to send them off for several days without snacks. I also seems a bit odd that they can\u0027t stuff a few days of supplies in the command pods and passenger modules, so I decided to make a module manager config that adds supplies to any part capable of holding crew:\n\n    Supplies_Settings{\tAdd_SPC = 5 // Number of Supplies to add per crew}@PART[*]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleLifeSupport],#CrewCapacity[*],~CrewCapacity[0]]:FOR[LifeSupport]{\tSPC = #$@Supplies_Settings/Add_SPC$\t@SPC *= #$CrewCapacity$\tRESOURCE\t{\t\t%name = Supplies\t\t%amount = #$/SPC$\t\t%maxAmount = #$/SPC$\t}}\n\nIt will add 5 supplies per crew to any crewable part. Of course you can edit the \u0022Add\\_SPC = 5\u0022 to add whatever you find is reasonable. Five supplies gives about 4.5 days worth of life support and seems reasonable for me."},{"CreatedByName":"MarcAFK","CreatedById":142340,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T01:12:44Z","Content":"If you use KIS you can cram snack sized supply containers into a kerbals pockets, actually it\u0027s kind if a cheaty way of getting around the 30 part limit, but docking multiple ships together gets around that anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T04:58:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not sure why it\u0027s causing you an issue - I\u0027ve had no such problems in multiple saves - and there\u0027s no option for disabling that feature as it\u0027s built into the code.\n\nThis is a problem, this keeps happening to me no matter how much I save scum.

May want to edit that a bit. \n\nBut I believe what you are experiencing is more of a KSP issue with how it handles power production when at high warp and stuff. Usually batteries help this.

But it\u0027s sort of like TAC was I\u0027m guessing, you\u0027d have to refocus on ships before things ran out or kerbals would die.
