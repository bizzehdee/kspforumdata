As far as mass, the small kontainers are 0.4 tons Vs 1.5 tons for the wee greenhouses.\u003Cp\u003EMy assumption is that the Pioneer module is pretty much obsolete on vessels that have a Kerbitat and Aeroponics, since adding a dedicated lab is much lighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thought was that since the Aeroponics inflatables have storage for water substrate and Organics now, it would make sense for somewhere in the chain to hold mulch (Kerb\u002B Inflateables and Habi\u002B inflatables) without having to build any additional storage. I mean I am able remember now, but I had to launch 2 rescue missions over it and it is a bit of a pain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor surface bases the landing sections have it. I suppose on massive stations you\u0027d just be using the LS inflatable storage, but for the sake of not wrecking missions, I think having a tiny amount(50-1000) of mulch storage in the inflatable habs would be a positive change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar to someone else on here, I tweaked the small supply container to also have space for 100 mulch, and I strap an empty pair on to the aero module or wherever needs mulch storage. Works a treat, and the specs (weight, 100 days mulch storage for 1 kerbal, etc) are about right. You can bolt on one of the other storage containers, but they are all either very big or very heavy, and this looks much prettier. Technically, you could cheat a little and put both supplies and mulch in there I guess, but we\u0027re only talking about 100 units after all, and I\u0027m sure no-one wants to store their supplies in the garbage can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T23:29:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022woot\u0022 data-cite=\u0022woot\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a way to disable the kicking supplies out the airlock feature?
