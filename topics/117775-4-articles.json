After all, it has, what, 12 passenger seats? Plus the small cargo bay.\n\nOn that subject, for balancing the XR2... I\u0027d advocate enough fuel on board to make it to orbit, have some left over for on-orbit operations (600m/s dV tops), and enough fuel for ONE missed approach. Adding the cargo bay tanks would allow you to reach Minmus with enough to return home again, or Duna with enough to land.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Any kind of cargo shuttle will want to be dealing with cylinders.

They just need a cargo bay to go in. I dont think I have to do anything to the bay to make it compatible with KAS and KIS just as long as the modules will fit inside correct? Thats my understanding of it anyways. One of them have a big cylindrical storage and the other has the smaller square ones if I aint mistaken"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T17:53:12Z","Content":"KAS no longer has any storage units: they\u0027re all KIS now. And the cylindrical containers are inline stack parts and are not moveable by Kerbals. The small boxes are portable, though, and can be mounted and dismounted with ease."},{"CreatedByName":"Redneck","CreatedById":2030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T19:33:30Z","Content":"Ok so we want the ability to use both types of containers correct?
