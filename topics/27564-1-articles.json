I was able to come up with a fairly sound design, but then I decided to see how low I could push the mass of the thing. Now it was no longer an SSTO, because it drops half its mass halfway up, but here it is stripped of such things as a docking port, RCS thrusters, RCS fuel, a second decoupler, and a parachute: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/91jkar.png\u0022 alt=\u002291jkar.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - 8.08 tonnes it is. Now I am rather proud of this myself, but I am certain there\u0027s someone out there who can beat me. For my plane I used only one non-stock part, even if this part was pretty crucial to the design. This part was a large roundified liquid fuel tank from the KSPX Parts Expansion mod - it ran out of fuel just as my plane reached an altitude where the jet was hardly useful anymore, so this was pretty convenient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth space planes and rockets are allowed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBalanced parts mods (judge for yourself) are allowed! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo aerodynamics mods!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to send a kerbal up there - no tiny probey things!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost a screenshot showing the rocket/plane in question and the mass of it as I have done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to seeing your submissions. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T17:46:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.64 tons, with return capability: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Y4y2m#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/Y4y2m#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Anders","CreatedById":66786,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T18:12:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tavert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tavert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1.64 tons, with return capability: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Y4y2m#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/Y4y2m#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that\u0027s definitely impressive. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Seems I could\u0027ve been a lot more minimalistic after all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
