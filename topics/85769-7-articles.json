Anyway, if all those revertless return missions only count for .25 points collectively, I got 110 total, for a score of 6.5, if each revertless return counts for .25, it would be 115. Pretty paltry considering the 1300-odd hours I\u0027ve spent playing. Given that, it\u0027s pretty hard to believe so many people scored 8-10, which essentially implies all of the above.

I most often spend my time testing new designs, exploring Kerbin and all that, and building stations too. To me, it\u0027s a very big aspect in the game, and defines every other flight goal. I create launchers all the time for my payload and often goof around, trying new things. The quiz might be applicable to KSP if you didn\u0027t design your own ship, but it\u0027s a bit unfair for excelling builders with so much talent, yet never got to the Mun. Maybe if things like \u0022Have you ever built an SSTO or built a station in orbit?\u0022 were asked, maybe the quiz will be fair. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
