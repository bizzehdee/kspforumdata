However x4 max phys time warp barely feels like it\u0027s doing anything to me. Especially when I\u0027m just parachuting down to Kerbin after a mission or waiting for my craft to make it out of atmosphere after finishing my sub orbital burn.\u00A0 At times like that I\u0027d really like to see x10 phys time warp.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the Better Time Warp mod already showed how this could be solved? Basically set a target time warp, but only warp up to what is possible without reducing physics accuracy below X amount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
