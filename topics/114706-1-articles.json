If instead of dV-optimal Hochmann transfer where your transfer orbit is tangent to the target orbit, you exceed it, the travel time drops drastically - with strongly elongated orbits the speed around the apoapsis drops to a crawl, and it takes long days for your target body to catch up. By moving the periapsis away, you proceed to the rendezvous point still at a brisk pace, but then you both need to get the extra speed initially and lose it during the meet-up. (but seriously, measly 100m/s can make a difference of a week in case of Minmus.)

At that point, getting the periapsis above 70km (when you ARE at near the periapsis) without doing weird things to the apoapsis is difficult to say the least.\n\nWhy \u0022at that point\u0022? Obviously waiting until apoapsis and circularizing would be preferable. Except my launch stage is \\*just\\* falling into the atmosphere and I need to switch to it quickly to save it from vanishing and guide it to a gentle recoverable landing, and to be able to switch to it, I need to be above 70km - right now!\n\nAfterwards, my orbit is all kinds of wonky with periapsis just above 70km and apoapsis... somewhere out there, where it happened as I struggled to get above the 70km limit. Probably some 130, maybe 300km.\n\n And at that point circularizing is a pure waste. Whatever transfer I\u0027m planning, its dV will vary a lot with what orbital altitude I start it at, but it will be always lower than if I were first to circularize and then perform the transfer burn from a proper circular orbit. Yes, circularizing at that point is trivial - and entirely useless! Burning fuel just to make adjusting the node easier? Yeah, there\u0027s a lot of sliding prograde/retrograde markers as I move the node, because the same dV at apoapsis won\u0027t let me reach the Mun, while at periapsis it sends me into escape trajectory. Plus I wasted some of the transfer stage fuel getting the apoapsis so high while raising the periapsis.\n\nBut that\u0027s an acceptable price for: 1) not burning extra fuel to circularize, 2) having a lighter launch stage that doesn\u0027t need to reach orbital speeds on the wasteful atmospheric engines, 3) saving said launch stage."}]}
