Something I\u0027ve long wanted is an in-game way to filter parts within the VAB user interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven something as simple as a \u0022favorites\u0022 flag would really help. Right now the game displays all unlocked parts (or all parts if in sandbox), which leads to many pages on some of the tabs. Having to click to page 2 or 3 to get to the fuel line every time is super irritating. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m suggesting is that the game have an additional filter (in addition to \u0022is unlocked\u0022). Something like \u0022is favorite\u0022 or \u0022is in MyMenu N\u0022, which would allow the user to select which parts show up in the VAB interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you let me build multiple menus, I can have one with the parts I use all the time, one specialized for probes, one for heavy lifters, one for landers, etc. This obviously presupposes a convenient way to flip between filters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe number of parts I actually use in most of my craft designs is small enough to fit on a single page per tab. In order to improve access to those parts, I find myself deleting my less-frequently-used parts from the game folder entirely. Which certainly isn\u0027t an optimal solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T23:40:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Envm, I misunderstood.
