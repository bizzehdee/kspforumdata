Now, duct tape is probably one of the best adhesives around, but when it comes to heavy-duty landing gear on giant planes, I\u0027d appreciate something a bit sturdier. Like, you know, welding. Any suggestions on how to avoid my jumbo jet crumbling to pieces when I gently touch the ground?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENINJA EDIT: I kid you not, I turned on Unbreakable Joints.
