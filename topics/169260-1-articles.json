You can write your own autopilot, or use it to perform any action like collecting science on your scientific probes. The vessel needs to be physically loaded for programs to run on it, but anyway you can automatize the way you gather your science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-10T08:46:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI prefer kRPC to KOS:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8174648384\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130742-131-krpc-control-the-game-using-c-c-java-lua-python-ruby-haskell-c-arduino-v043-12th-december-2017/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:207px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-10T08:49:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like to manage my probes, but a little bit of coding to educate us all is not a bad idea.
