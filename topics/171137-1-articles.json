I\u0027ve got four main stages- liftoff, orbit, interplanetary, and lander. Liftoff is just a huge mass of SRBs. Orbit is a Mainsail with some fuel (hidden by all the SRBs). After that, the interplanetary stage is an atomic engine (the top fuel tank above the orange one also contains oxidiser for refueling the lander stage). Then underneath the fairing I have a 3-man lander powered by LV909 with a lot of parachutes, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t really played KSP much since about 1.1 or so, and it seems like some of the aerodynamics have changed and my rockets are no longer stable. I tried asking MechJeb to fly them instead but even Mr. Jeb can\u0027t fly my rockets stably. I\u0027ve tried a few variants on this like adding a bunch more wings in various places, but it doesn\u0027t seem to have made much difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions on how I can improve the aerodynamics of this rocket?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-20T15:54:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first rule of rocketry is: \u0022heavy stuff at the front, draggy stuff at the back\u0022.
