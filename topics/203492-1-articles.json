While this means you\u2019ll squeeze every last drop of range from your craft, it might also mean waiting for what seems like an excessively long time when it isn\u2019t really necessary to do so; if you\u2019re relying on that \u0026lt;5m/s by doing the perfect transfer vs just going ASAP, then you\u2019re better off packing a bit more fuel somewhere or shedding some excess weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
