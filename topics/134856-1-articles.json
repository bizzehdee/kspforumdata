Going to Duna with just regular chutes is dangerous. Use drogue chutes and/or fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example : don\u0027t enter Duna atmosphere on a retrograde attitude, don\u0027t hesitate to face radial or normal to increase drag as much as possible. Favour flat landers...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example : I tested landing with Kerbal-X. I used the engines to slow down so chutes could open safely. They were successfully partially open but even though, I was still increasing speed and chutes were destroy after.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new part which will be introduced in 1.1 (10m inflatable shield) will be a big bonus for Duna landings (even not reusable)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T14:31:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverheating on Duna is not a problem.\u00A0 I\u0027d recommend a heat shield to play it safe but, for a typical aerocapture, you won\u0027t\u00A0burn off much ablator.\u00A0 Entry from orbit doesn\u0027t need a heat shield at all.\u00A0 I have found that the aerocapture periapsis is pretty sensitive your entry velocity and the ballistic coefficient of your vehicle.\u00A0 If you have a\u00A0relatively slow intercept with a low ballistic coefficient, you\u0027ll probably need a periapsis of about 20 km.\u00A0 If you have a\u00A0fast intercept with a high ballistic coefficient, you\u0027ll probably need a periapsis of about 10 km.\u00A0 If you miss on the periapsis, you may not aerocapture at all or you may not pull out of the atmosphere.\u00A0 I\u0027d recommend at practice run and be prepared to revert/reload if you get it wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-24T14:39:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2016 02:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T14:32:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve found that speeds exceeding 3700m/s either result in explosions or not enough braking to capture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever the atmosphere is so thin that you can do a powered aerobrake (using rockets and burning retrograde while in the atmosphere).
