Generally speaking, there\u0027s no forum rules against sharing other people\u0027s add-on content (mods). However, we do require that users follow the add-on\u0027s license(s), and they sometimes carry restrictions about who can share it and under what circumstances. Please be sure to check the license that was included with the files, and follow the rules it sets out.
