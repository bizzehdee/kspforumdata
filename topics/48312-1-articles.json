Actually I did get it into orbit once, but the problem is that I can just barely reach a maybe 75x75 orbit. I want to be able to reach a higher orbit so I can dock at some of my stations. I have a lower one at 100x100, but I have some that are as high as 300ish orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is the design has four intakes (a couple are clipped over eachother).

You may not be firing the rocket low enough that the aerospike would be of any benefit, and the LV-N is so massive that you\u0027ll expend about as much fuel lifting it as it will save you on efficiency.

Seriously - each landing gear weighs 0.5 tons, for a total weight (assuming 3 wheels) of 1.5 tons, while the parachutes you\u0027d need to float the plane to the ground (and the decouplers required to drop the wheels) weigh much less. I have a personal distaste for doing this (I like to do proper landings) but on my early spaceplanes I couldn\u0027t argue with the weight savings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for rockets, I like the Rockomax radials. They\u0027re very light, and their low thrust values are compensated for by no drag, so the thrust adds up over time (and once you\u0027re in space, you have time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically, one mk1 fuselage tank is sufficient for each jet engine, but for multiple engines, you may wish to look at the mk2 and mk3 fuselages, which pack more fuel for their mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, RCS thruster blocks and RCS fuel really do add up. Your design is obviously meant for docking, so I can\u0027t argue with their inclusion, but you should minimize the RCS fuel, and optimize your thruster block placement. Each thruster block adds weight, and you don\u0027t need many given the low net weight you\u0027re going for. If you can, put them straight on the center of mass (well, where you expect the center of mass to be, once you reach orbit); you lose some rotational ability this way but you have SAS for that and you retain translational ability while cutting down weight. Remember you\u0027re having to lift all that stuff into orbit; it doesn\u0027t contribute anything at all to getting you out of atmo. Take a close look at the weight of each of these parts, and ask \u0022how much do I really need?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe constant consideration here, can be summed up as \u0022weight is not your friend\u0022. More weight means you need more lift. More lift means more wings, but that also means more drag (lift being created from drag). There is a balance between too much wing (which impacts your top speed) and too little wing (which impacts your top altitude). Too much weight disrupts that balance. Adding engines often just makes the problem worse (another engine needs another tank and set of intakes; the heavier craft needs more wings; more wings means it flies slower); the only gains are when the mission your spaceplane is designed for requires it (I\u0027ve seen a spaceplane deploy full orange tanks to orbit; it had lots of jet engines, and deserved every one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother consideration is jet engine flameout. Even numbers of jet engines can be problematic because when an engine flames out, all of the sudden you have unbalanced thrust. This can be a problem too with odd numbers of jet engines, although if you add the center engine last it seems to flameout first, which gives you warning. Single jet engine spaceplanes seem to be the easiest to start out with, as you avoid this issue entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T21:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile it seems like it in the VAB, landing gear does not have weight or drag.
