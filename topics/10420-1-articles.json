I wrote \\\u0027SPAAAAAACE CAAAAATS\\\u0027 next to it. I showed it to the people behind me. Then Emma Huskey shouted \u0027Space cats!\u0027 at the top of her voice. Ms Swinney glared at her, and for the rest of the lesson everyone just couldn\\\u0027t stop saying \\\u0027space cats\\\u0027 to embarrass Emma.\n\nToday, in English, I drew an idea for a cool-looking private jet in my planner. This was because Samantha Calvey said that when she has a successful corporation, she will let me design her private jet. Which is nice of her. Anyway, so then I drew a cat in a spacesuit on the page before it. I showed it to Toby, who sits next to me. He thought it was amusing. Then I started adding details to the spacesuit, and wrote \\\u0027SPACE CATS\\\u0027 on it.\n\nI held my planner up and I showed it to Emma. She thought it looked cool. Mary-Anne and Nick Brooks saw it too. I tore the picture out of my planner and gave it to Emma to keep.\n\nBackstory point: This was my second-last day at St.Bede\\\u0027s School. A lot of people are getting other people to sign their yearbooks.\n\nFor the rest of the lesson, I drew no less than six more Space Cats, each in a different person\\\u0027s yearbook.\n\nHere\\\u0027s one I made just now.\n\n![t7LdN.png](http://i.imgur.com/t7LdN.png)\n\nThey have varying levels of background art. One of them has the Space Cat sitting on a gantry with an entire launchpad in the background, including spacecraft. Another has a ball of string floating around. Most of them don\\\u0027t have a background.\n\nMary-Anne wanted one that was dead to match her Drop Dead Clothing bag which has a dead cat as a logo on it. So I drew it wiith a smashed helmet, and an ariel with \\\u0027SOS\\\u0027 repeated next to it.\n\nEach of the spacesuits were slightly different."},{"CreatedByName":"flying_chair","CreatedById":10362,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T18:06:22Z","Content":"Sir, I demand more Spess Cat pictures."},{"CreatedByName":"mincespy","CreatedById":9003,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T18:15:00Z","Content":"Can I have a space cat picture?\n\nAlso, Y U BE BETTER AT DRAWING.\n\nAnd Y CAN I NO DRAW ANY LIVING THINGS"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T18:33:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can I have a space cat picture?\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, Y U BE BETTER AT DRAWING.\n\u003E \n\u003E And Y CAN I NO DRAW ANY LIVING THINGS\n\nUntil recently, I couldn\\\u0027t draw living things.\n\nI taught myself everything I know about art.

Keep practising. Work on keeping images in your imagination. Work on improvisation. Also work on hybridisation of the two. I just drew a fanart of Kat from TwoKinds, in which she is doing a Victory sign gesture, and is standing in front of a blue background with stars popping and a rainbow going across it. As you may have guessed by now, it\\\u0027s called \\\u0027Nya Kat\\\u0027.\n\nTo draw it, I drew her hand first. I looked at my hand whilst doing a V-sign, and drew it from that. Then I added a paw pad and Keidran nails to the ends of the fingers. Then I added the arm. This part came from my imagination, as I wasn\\\u0027t looking at any images of Kat that looked like that. Then I drew her torso, then neck, then head. Most of the head was drawn whilst looking at images of her - but her head is facing the other direction to where it is facing in the images, so I drew the hair and such accordingly - using my imagination to work out where they would go. The mouth I imagined and drew. I removed the protruding teeth when I saw Kat has no protruding teeth. I added the openings to her ears, which either wasn\\\u0027t shown in the images or shown further up. Then I looked at my hands doing the V-sign again and realised I had drawn the hand the wrong way round. I redrew it. Then I drew the background, which was pretty much from memory of the Nyan Cat background, and then drawing a 7-colour rainbow.\n\nAnd then I scanned it in. It\\\u0027ll be up soon."},{"CreatedByName":"iamwearingpants","CreatedById":27,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T20:23:39Z","Content":"Bipedal cats are best cats!\n\nToo bad I suck at drawing :b\n\n![cOo7Q.png](http://i.imgur.com/cOo7Q.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T20:58:30Z","Content":"You want bipedal cats?
