I wrote \\\u0027SPAAAAAACE CAAAAATS\\\u0027 next to it. I showed it to the people behind me. Then Emma Huskey shouted \u0027Space cats!\u0027 at the top of her voice. Ms Swinney glared at her, and for the rest of the lesson everyone just couldn\\\u0027t stop saying \\\u0027space cats\\\u0027 to embarrass Emma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, in English, I drew an idea for a cool-looking private jet in my planner. This was because Samantha Calvey said that when she has a successful corporation, she will let me design her private jet. Which is nice of her. Anyway, so then I drew a cat in a spacesuit on the page before it. I showed it to Toby, who sits next to me. He thought it was amusing. Then I started adding details to the spacesuit, and wrote \\\u0027SPACE CATS\\\u0027 on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI held my planner up and I showed it to Emma. She thought it looked cool. Mary-Anne and Nick Brooks saw it too.

Keep practising. Work on keeping images in your imagination. Work on improvisation. Also work on hybridisation of the two. I just drew a fanart of Kat from TwoKinds, in which she is doing a Victory sign gesture, and is standing in front of a blue background with stars popping and a rainbow going across it. As you may have guessed by now, it\\\u0027s called \\\u0027Nya Kat\\\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo draw it, I drew her hand first. I looked at my hand whilst doing a V-sign, and drew it from that. Then I added a paw pad and Keidran nails to the ends of the fingers. Then I added the arm. This part came from my imagination, as I wasn\\\u0027t looking at any images of Kat that looked like that. Then I drew her torso, then neck, then head. Most of the head was drawn whilst looking at images of her - but her head is facing the other direction to where it is facing in the images, so I drew the hair and such accordingly - using my imagination to work out where they would go. The mouth I imagined and drew. I removed the protruding teeth when I saw Kat has no protruding teeth. I added the openings to her ears, which either wasn\\\u0027t shown in the images or shown further up. Then I looked at my hands doing the V-sign again and realised I had drawn the hand the wrong way round. I redrew it. Then I drew the background, which was pretty much from memory of the Nyan Cat background, and then drawing a 7-colour rainbow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I scanned it in. It\\\u0027ll be up soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iamwearingpants","CreatedById":27,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T20:23:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBipedal cats are best cats!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo bad I suck at drawing :b\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cOo7Q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cOo7Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T20:58:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want bipedal cats?
