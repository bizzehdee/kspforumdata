Remember, you\u0027re limited to 10x10x10 cm and typically 1kg in mass... An ion thruster of this class would exceed both of these measurements from just the thruster alone, nevermind propellant or the rest of the satellite. Or the power generation equipment required to drive even the smallest models. You might be able to fit a really small variant into a 3U cubesat and have enough space left for electronics and a bit of krypton, but that\u0027ll be it then. It will just be a flying thruster.

The team is crowdsourced, with any help being welcome, and with members of the \u0022official\u0022 team being determined only by their continued contribution. There\u0027s no application form, no waiting list, no resume requirements, no interview, no nothing. The only requirement is enthusiasm and proactiveness. We are based on the Kerbal Space Program community for its space-savvy and space exploration loving members, but are in no way associated with SQUAD. For this reason, feel free to hop in if you\u0027re an Orbiter, Flight Simulator, Celestia, Space Engine, or just-passing-by kind of person! All are welcome!\u003Cp\u003EOf course, space is hard. And sending anything up there takes more than basic orbital mechanics knowledge. For this very reason we are starting small and working our way up. There\u0027s no degree like experience! Our first mission will be a 1U cubesat, the smallest of its kind, to low Earth orbit. There will be few and simple components and no propulsion at all. To avert failure, we\u0027re setting the bar low for this one: if it gets to orbit that is confirmed with telemetry, we celebrate! If it manages to survive for multiple orbits and take pictures, we celebrate more! If it manages to conduct an experiment and yield useful data, than we will have broken some records!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what is this mission, exactly? Well, launching something to orbit is really expensive, and so we need to make it worth it. We had to come up with an experiment that would give new data to the scientific community; useful data, that is; data that wouldn\u0027t be able to be collected on Earth; and data that the public will recognize as cool/useful. All of these requirements would give our project scientific legitimacy, public support, and maybe, just maybe, a free ride from NASA\u0027s cubesat initiative support program, cutting back the cost on a hundred thousand dollars or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe experiment is [...]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cubesat will be like [...]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe funding will be done through Kickstarter, or some other crowdfunding service.
