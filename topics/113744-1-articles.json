The intake system in that engine was controlled by an analog computer rather than pilot control, not sure if there has been a real life example that is done manually."},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T03:58:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Would you please enlighten us as to how a turbo-ramjet works?
