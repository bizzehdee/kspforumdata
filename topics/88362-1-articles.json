It should be allowed to be taken from a probe or capsule (unless specified in the contract), that is in an orbit and position of the specified trajectory. The more specific the harder the contract, and various specifications, including altitude range of the report, if on a downward or upward trajectory, apoapsis, periapsis, elongation, orbital period (if not hyperbolic or sub-orbital). Obviously there should be a lookup table for the valid ranges to prevent impossible contracts (like an orbit of the Mun with a period of one Kerbin month or longer), without having to actually do major number crunching when generating contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface sample contracts: A company wants a physical sample from a specified planet, and possibly specified biome for experiments and/or display. For experiment ones they will give you the rights to use their research, so you get science points as well as reputation and funds. Considering Kerbals seem to have a lot of cash to throw around to settle debates, these can still be profitable. Many of the experiments will be to once-again disprove some preposterous theory, like Minmus actually being edible, or the idea that eve\u0027s lakes might be usable as rocket fuel and/or fruit flavored beverage. Also, distinguishing the difference between water and drinkable water on Laythe might be fun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s for display, then they will usually offer a lot of money and reputation depending on how difficult the sample is to retrieve. However, sadly, display missions will get you no more science than you get from your lab analysis. This is usually companies that would want to impress visitors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmosphere and particle samples: Also, much like surface samples, you should be able to take atmosphere samples. This of course can be done early on in EVA, or later on with a device. Since the vacuum of space technically has non-physically significant gases and dust particles, you should be able to collect \u0022particle samples\u0022 from space, but it should require a special device that must be mounted to the ship, and unfortunately requires a science lab to clean before it can be used again. Obviously, in addition to general science, there could be contracts for this, both science and vanity. As much as the dust floating near the surface of Minmus is useful for science experiments, the clear glass vial with a few deliciously blue-green specks in it from Minmus can be quite the trophy once put in an appropriately prestigious case along with a certificate of authenticity signed by none other than Jeb Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother contract on trophies is of course recovering a craft (or part of a craft) that did something in particular. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, stranded Kerbals should be found places other than low Kerbin orbit. While their orbits should be in a place that you can easily get to them in the time-frame of the contract, which could be a long time because the only safety technology Kerbals have developed is very efficient life support, but I think that Kerbal will be pretty sick of liquid nutrition concentrate emergency rations diluted in reprocessed sweat and . . . well, you know, from his space suit by the time you pick him up, and will be more than happy for some nice space snacks from Sean\u0027s Cannery.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
