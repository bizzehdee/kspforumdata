If somebody wants to play a much more limited game on a much more limited computer, it\u0027s their problem.\n\nI do agree that some people are over-reacting to this, but...Squad does seem to have some trouble communicating effectively. Like others, I wasn\u0027t particularly happy with this lackluster Devnote, especially given that it lacks a lot of information (like, *any*) that would have helped people understand exactly what this meant for the game. HarvesteR\u0027s article (which I consider to be the real Devnote) helped a lot, but all of that information, along with the information his reply to regex about the UI, really should have been in the first post of this thread.\n\nIt\u0027s true that you can\u0027t please everybody all of the time, and that you\u0027re always going to have haters, but -- perhaps from inexperience, or perhaps their own enthusiasm prevented them from thinking about how others would react to the announcement -- Squad is feeding that negative reaction with their communication style.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Curious Minds would like to know how is multi-player going and will it work across platforms?\n\nIf it\u0027s like most (all?) cross-platform games, multi-player will be segregated by platform.

Now I understand that creating a good port is possible, if the team working on it is talented. And that\u0027s the part that worries me and I\u0027m sure a bunch of others.\n\nI read several places that the DEVS are really happy so far with FTE and what they\u0027ve done. But when you look over what they\u0027ve made, you can tell that they either A) Don\u0027t really care about quality or B)Aren\u0027t capable of making anything better. I mean those games not only looked pretty bad but they were very basic. Nothing really innovative or requiring much ability to create. \n\nSo it\u0027s surprising to say the least that SQUAD chose them to port the game. It\u0027s just weird that the DEVS are hyping them so much. I understand it\u0027s basic PR 101 to do it but I have yet to see anything from FTE that makes me confident in their ability. The only thing I have to go off of is what the DEVS here say about them.\n\nLogic tells me that a game developer with that much talent would be creating games that are pretty good and quite well known. This company doesn\u0027t have much of a reputation for creating anything good. Zero experience on a system outside of making 1 PS2 game. Screenshots of their games show that they are an extremely low budget developer.\n\nWith such a big announcement and so much money on the line, choosing FTE was a pretty huge gamble. While I hope it pays off, their showcase makes one wonder if they\u0027re all that capable. It seems pretty obvious that they were the cheapest company willing to do the work, I hope they put a lot of effort into this port.

The console versions are functionally identical to the PC version except for the crafting interface, the size of the maps, and a few other minor changes.

As a hypothetical exercise, add those numbers together, and figure the ratio of forum members to actual players is probably 5to1: You get a potential sales figure of 1,294,675. That is probably a high estimate, given the fact there have been no sales figures released, and selling a million copies of a game is usually a milestone worth reporting.\n\nA game like KSP coming out on consoles where the average age of game players is about 12, is a risky move for a game that takes knowledge of math and science to play well. Not to mention, how many 12-year-olds are going to sit through yet another rocket launch, or have the patience to actually learn something about rocket design? My 12 year old brother loves playing KSP, but if it doesn\u0027t explode in a giant fireball, he\u0027s just not interested in it. Personally I thought the development of an EDU version of KSP, so kids taking physics class in school can learn a bit about rockets, was a great idea.

I think businesses should make money in order to stay businesses (shocking!). We\u0027ll get to see where this leads when we get there. At the end of the day, it IS Squad\u0027s product and they can do whatever they please with it. Some of us may not like it, but there\u0027s no pleasing everyone.\n\nI vote for patience and not panicking at the drop of a hat.\n\nIt\u0027s not like they announced they would stop development and subsequently suggested everyone wshould fry their hard drive in order to erase every trace of KSP.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAnd another thing:\n\nSquad used to be a marketing company. \n\nDave Grohl used to be the drummer for Nirvana. \n\nAlbert Einstein used to be a patent clerk.\n\nCatholics used to burn people at the stake. \n\nHumanity used to eat its\u0027 dinner raw and sleep in trees. \n\nLizards used to be bigger. \n\nRocks used to drop from the sky more often. \n\nOxygen used to be absent from the Earths\u0027 atmosphere. \n\nThe sun used to be a ginormous dust cloud. \n\nThings change. Be glad they do."},{"CreatedByName":"mikeb30165","CreatedById":60789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T23:22:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I read the Original Post, I grunted to myself and said \u0022Huh.\u0022 Then I said \u0022Wow.\u0022 Then I thought to myself, \u0022Why is this a Dev Note?\u0022\n\u003E Then I sat back to read the comments.\n\u003E \n\u003E I was not disappointed.\n\u003E \n\u003E My word SQUAD, what have you done? You\u0027ve sold your soul for 10 cents on the dollar. I hope the Martinis were delicious.\n\u003E \n\u003E For each dollar this game will make on the PS4:\n\u003E \n\u003E SONY\u0027s going to take 50 cents because it\u0027s their console.\n\u003E \n\u003E Flying Tiger is going to take 25 cents because they\u0027re developing the port.\n\u003E \n\u003E And SONY is going to take another 15 cents as a distribution fee.\n\u003E \n\u003E Of the 10 cents you make, you\u0027ll probably end up spending 5 cents fixing Flying Tiger\u0027s mistakes.\n\u003E \n\u003E I may be overstating this issue, but probably not by much. There are a lot of people bringing up Minecraft as an example, but Minecraft wasn\u0027t ported to consoles until after Notch sold the game to another developer.\n\u003E \n\u003E IMO, Squad should have completely finished the game, finished selling the game on PC, then sell the entire IP to another developer for a huge chunk of cash.\n\u003E \n\u003E Leave it up to the new IP owner to figure out how to port the game to consoles after PC development was completed.\n\u003E \n\u003E Well that\u0027s my $.02 anyway, free of charge.\n\u003E \n\u003E Regards,\n\u003E \n\u003E Chris Maillet\n\nGood points well made,"}]}
