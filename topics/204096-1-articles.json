I recently updated to Version 1.12 after most mods switched versions, but I noticed that my GPU(NVIDEA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti)\u00A0load is unusually high since then. Before I was running on 1.10 with quite a few mods and had no issues. But now, both with and without mods, my GPU reaches up to 90% load and has to kick on the fans to a level I simply do not experience in other games that should in theory be way more demanding. The weird thing is, that even with 99% usage and almost worrying\u00A0temperatures the game runs smoothly which makes the thing very weird, if my GPU would struggle because of any real load I would certainly suffer from performance issues, but I don\u0027t! In all my tests (launching a 3 part rocket on kerbal) with 3 clean installs, the issue persisted, both with and without mods. This only happend when launching a rocket, the menues and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E were completly calm. And yes, my drivers are updated and frame limiting is active.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it a problem with my GPU or is there any Graphics option in KSP that is way more demanding than it should be?

The weird thing is also that it sometimes instantly jumps to 99% usage when I load into the Launchpad and then stays there.

I really don\u0027t know what could cause such an overreaction from my GPU, since the game runs smoothly I still suspect that KSP somehow demands ressources it doesn\u0027t need.
