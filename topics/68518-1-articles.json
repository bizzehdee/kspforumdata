Otherwise, the pressures on the back of the plunger will quickly equalize with those in front, and the plunger will not move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you might want to try is placing something (like a thin, breakable and breathable membrane) across the muzzle of the paint ball gun. You would place the ignition switch of the rocket on the NOSE of the rocket. It would be some kind of latched push-button. When the nose of the rocket strikes the membrane, it latches the switch closed. As the rocket continues out the tube, it breaks the membrane, and continues on its way, igniting the engine shortly thereafter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe membrane must be breathable, otherwise the air pressure ahead of the rocket could break it before the rocket gets there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of a membrane, you could try a plastic cap with a bunch of holes in it. It fits snugly over the end of the barrel, snugly enough to stay on until the nose of the rocket strikes it. Also, tie a string to it, and tie the other end of the string to your gun. This way, you can easily recover the cap after firing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn issue with the plastic cap however is the possibility it could get caught around the nose of your rocket and wrench the rocket into a spin. To solve this, instead of a cap, you could use simple some kind of plastic plate that locks in place over the barrel and just levers/flips back after the rocket strikes it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother safety issue is pushing the rocket down the barrel when the ignition switch is on the front. But this whole thing is highly unsafe. Just makes sure you don\u0027t LOOK down the barrel while your pushing the rocket down it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea I head was to use a photoresistor or photodiode as a sensor to detect when the rocket was outside of the dark barrel and into the brighter outside. You could even use an infrared photodiode that is only triggered by an array of IR LEDs at the end of your barrel (through bright sunlight would probably also be sufficient). But these ideas all require more electronics know-how than you probably possess. At the very least, the photoresistor/photodiode would need to be in a circuit that feeds a current/voltage into the base/gate of a BJT/MOSFET, with the transistor being used as a switch that conducts the comparatively high current required to ignite the igniter. If you\u0027re not an electrical engineer or electronics hobbyist, this stuff is probably beyond you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-08T16:27:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2014 04:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T16:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022 data-cite=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you\u0027re using air pressure, you likely can\u0027t just have a plunger on the back that is not sealed against the inside of the barrel.
