After a ton\u00A0of work (5 months) because I didn\u0027t wanna look up a tutorial, I was able to powered land a Reusable Rocket, known as Ender Full Thrust (Ill upload the craft file, however it uses a lot of mods, so it might not work for you, MRS and Kerbal Reusability Expansion should be it, but I might have some other mods in it to.) So here is the mission report\u00A0 I lifted of from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and because the thing sometimes tips in water, I headed to polar orbit. I deployed the satellite at around 40 KM, and flew it into orbit. I then had to switch back to the rocket, as it entered the atmosphere. I fired up 1 of the 5 engines, and slowed down. I only used 1 as it was honestly just more efficient. I ended up deploying the gear at around 5km, as the extra drag kept the thing from tipping over. I fired up all the engines, slowed down, and just about managed to land it. I probably hit ground at around 3-5 m/s, so I was lucky that the landing gear had some good suspension. I actually nearly tipped the thing, however the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fought back, and it ended up stable. And that\u0027s the mission report of the first ever successful flight of Ender Full Thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-28T01:44:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2017 01:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by TheEnderman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETo add a link to the picture\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheEnderman","CreatedById":181542,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-28T01:38:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot a link to the pictures n\u0027 stuff, if you wanna check it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso trying to grab a modlist so I can give the craft file, the only issue is its a 1.2.2 file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheEnderman","CreatedById":181542,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-29T21:51:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoo rip the file anyways \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
