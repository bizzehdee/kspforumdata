Any idea how I could make them printable? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, one of the things I want to do is try to add cockpit lights to the stock parts. But there may be a conflict. I have FASA which has the gemini pod. It has a the ability to light up its windows, but after I made it paintable, the lights no longer were visible. So I\u0027m wondering if there was some way to keep them from conflicting\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tenneko Kazeno","CreatedById":102597,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T23:51:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I use a small program called mbm2png \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www./?yfrtouj6n9zt943\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www./?yfrtouj6n9zt943\u003C/a\u003E It is really simple, just move the mbm to the texture folder, run the converter, and out comes a perfect png. If you put the mbm in the texture folder, in the converter you have to type textures\\filename. You can delete most the other files in this rar as they are just for converting .mu model files, or separate run versions for use on Linux or Macs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, I think the problem with the doors is the same one as you have with the parachute. First try changing the shader option in the cfg file. If that doesn\u0027t work, if you look at the texture, it has the front and the back of the door beside each other, so it may be for animated parts you can\u0027t shade both sides. I will take a look at mapping the materials bay to see if i can actually figure out the problem. Also, don\u0027t use the Alpha shader option as it makes the texture partly see-through in game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the window lights, it may be possible. For stock squad parts, all light emitting parts have an additional texture, usually named filename_emit.mbm, that is set to overlap the lit areas. I do not know enough to tell you how to add such a thing to preexisting parts. As for FASA\u0027s part, have you tried carefully editing the map such that the windows are not shaded. If you have and it didn\u0027t help, most likely there is a conflict with how the program is reading the emission textures that FASA most likely used. Once again though, it could be a shader option problem. Given I think you need the windows to be ignoredby Kerbpaint, your best option is to change the shader option to cutoff or cutoff bump which as far as I can tell hard enforces emission and invisible textures.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps.

What this means is we can put almost any design of a single color on top of the squad textures. As such, the author of this mod set it to say primary paints entire part, while secondary makes strips, and tertiary is a diffuse pattern. And, this is a little different on each part so the only way to change it would be to go in to each part and remake their shader maps. The simpler solution is to realize if you want strips set primary and secondary to different colors, while no strips would be primary and secondary same color. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you mean you are using the pattern option instead of the solid option, all that does is puts on a bunch of preset primary/secondary/tertiary sets, so yes some of those options would have strips and some would not. Just play around with the options till it does what you want, then try and remember what you did for next time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if this really is a bug as in for some of the stretchy tanks secondary is not working at all then please reply calling me an idiot and list which tanks are messed up.
