Then build the base with the Space Built part. Unfortunately, I have little experience with that mod so I don\\\u0027t know if the space built part puts the design next to the space dock (no matter where it is) or just in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T03:59:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\\\u0027t mind a little editing of the persistence file, you can put anything into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, launch a simple craft into the orbit you want to use.
