I think that a way to solve this would be to generate the voxels through the active colliders? I\u0027m not a coder, I\u0027m a modeler and config\u0027r, so I might not understand how it works. But I think that if you generated the voxels based on colliders rather than the mesh, or maybe the scaled mesh, then procedural, scaled, etc parts would work. I think. Good luck, and great work so far. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I report that the airspeed settings changes are not persistent.
