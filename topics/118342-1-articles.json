I wondered why they weren\u0027t there in my game when I saw on the wiki that they were released on 1.0.3. I had 1.0.2 so I launched it with the launcher. But the update button was greyed out. Usually when there are updated like this it would update automatically or if I update it in launcher. Now it\u0027s 1.0.4 so I need help on this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T05:23:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe launcher is very broken.
