It is only seeing pitch and roll inputs. If I select the Yaw input and then activate the rudder, it doesn\u0027t respond. If I move the stick left/right or forward/backward, it does pick it up, but just not on yaw or throttle. I know that they\u0027re working on the joystick, because I can see the results in the game controller test, and the stick works fine with FlightGear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy environment: The stick is a Saitek Cyborg Force. It is calibrated in Windows.\u00A0I\u0027m on Windows 10 (64), running the latest release of KSP (downloaded and reinstalled yesterday, in an attempt to fix the problem), unmodded.
