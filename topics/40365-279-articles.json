Yes its realistic to have signal delay but it would just be anoying from a gameplay standpoint. And agian theres nothing to say you couldnt have a network with enough redundancy to be transmiting a beam in 2 locations. You could just handwave that the burn was planed far enough in advance that they started the secondary transmission an apropreate length of time in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tmbomber","CreatedById":104086,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T21:31:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Everyone,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having an issue with my orbital fusion power plants shutting down while I\u0027m not looking at them...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/KEBVx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a photo gallery showing what\u0027s going on.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a 3.75m fusion reactor along with a like sized generator connected to one of the large microwave transmitters.

What size and type of reactor? what was the fuel? was this vacume or at the launch pad(they get **** all for thrust at sea level but it gets better as you go up) Only way I could think of geting near 40KN thrust would be a 1.25 thorium reactor on LFO. Thrusts on thermal nozoles are sub par to LV-Ns for their weight on most of the smaller reactors and only get slightly better ISP. They do not really become worth it unless your useing the the larger reactors. I think the 3.75 thorium comes out to about on par with a cluster of 13 or so LV\u0027s. slightly heavier but same TWR similar thrusts with a bit more ISP unupgraded and alot better upgraded. The thrust on the thermals will always be anemic unless your useing antimater although upgraded reactors for fission gets an amazing ISP compared to stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if your useing one of the newer reactors added in 10.0 I couldnt tell you as I dont have a handy table with stats for those.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-22T02:50:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2014 02:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by merendel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TomatoSoup","CreatedById":59394,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T04:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having a peculiar problem.
