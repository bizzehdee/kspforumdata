Yes, I can reduce payout, but I feel like increased funds use (rather than reducing payout) allows for more fun. Larger rockets = greater complexity than simply taking away money, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you think?

Now I\u0027m greatly looking forward to sending ships out to explore a system in which long distance trips take several years, the small rocky worlds are like stock, the bigger places with atmospheres are very big and intimidating, and Jool himself is truly a monster of a planet.
