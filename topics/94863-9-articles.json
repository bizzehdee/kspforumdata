Regarding colliders, on such a huge object you\u0027ll probably find you have to \u0027cut them up\u0027 a lot. KSP physics tends to \u0027see\u0027 gaps in exceptionally long edges of colliders.

Okay, that last reason didn\u0027t make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, overhauling the GUI seemed to be a sensible thing to do since I\u0027m also re-structuring the project to make better use of OO. Properly placing code in classes and isolating repeated code to methods in the right classes should mean an easier to maintain and update plug-in. That\u0027s the theory anyway. In practice, I\u0027m a lazy sod and KerbTown\u0027s legacy-code is a hell of endless spaghetti so put those two together and I quickly get bored and go do something fun instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike new features.

A unified GUI where the same stuff was just being presented differently in various scenes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of new features you can probably spot are the ability to \u0027favourite\u0027 sites and then filter the launch selector by favourites.
