The contracts are illogical, dropping Duna missions on us before Mun or Minmus? Yes, this has happened to me many times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked into mods like Contract Configurator and Seti Contracts, Initial Contracts... They help a lost but they don\u0027t stop the avalanche of stock crap contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a simple mod that cuts off stock contracts and allows you to create your own set that is logical and can be used in a storyline type of career mode?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get into KSP days at a time but then the lack of purpose and random in-cohesive contracts just overwhelms me and I have to step away for a few weeks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe Squad will focus on contracts and the way they are generated, allowing for a completely custom setup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T05:22:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis thread touches on several issues, but since you\u0027re asking for mod recommendations, Add-on Affairs might be where you\u0027ll be most likely to receive helpful answers.

However, the starting contracts go for a long time, after orbiting Kerbin, you get Flyby the Mun, Orbit the Mun, Land on the Mun kind of stuff. The only problem is that the contrafts are cluttered with rich tourists that dont give a good money unless you have a SSTEverywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wiseman","CreatedById":116239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T15:56:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EContract Configurator\u003C/a\u003E to create your own contracts and/or use the many contract packs for it, and then use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99869\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStockNoContracts\u003C/a\u003E to make sure nothing else shows up.
