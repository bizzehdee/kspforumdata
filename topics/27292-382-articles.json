I\u0027m now nearly done with the planning, and this is how it looks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll put two relays on the Muns orbit around Kerbin, one leading, one trailing. These will link to three satellites that are sharing Kerbins orbit around Kerbol and will be directly linking to the other planets, where equilateral triangles of relays will then keep the planets covered and linked to their moons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this crazy setup is, that I\u0027d like to avoid having dozens of batteries on my sats to have them last through night/eclipse times, and putting them on the same orbit as Kerbin, they might eventually have an Eve or Moho transit, but nothing that could really block the sunlight. Therefore, they can fully run on solar panels without ever running out of power. Also, since they will form an equilateral triangle no planet should be totally blocked at any time. The sats on the Mun\u0027s orbit on the other hand will experience the munar night for about 40 minutes each period, but since they\u0027ll only have three dishes, their power consumption is acceptable, as is the number of required batteries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue is that I don\u0027t have the strongest antennas unlocked yet, so at the moment I can only reach out to planets not farther than Dres.
