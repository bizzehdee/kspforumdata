If I don\u0027t select the convex option and tell the object\u0027s Mesh collider to use the model itself, objects will collide with the mesh, but they do so with odd angles like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1zVhVeT.png\u0022 alt=\u00221zVhVeT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(and yes that\u0027s a Rockomax-16.
