Also, I work as a producer in the gaming industry, publisher side. So my 2 cents here are actually based on experience with player feedback, player retention, player happiness. A happy player is a player inviting his friend to buy the game too. I don\u0027t actually care about these things being added to the game to satisfy myself, since I\u0027ll always mod my games to bits. I\u0027m just trying to help you guys bring more players in. The more players you have, the longer the game lasts, the more content and mods we\u0027ll have. I\u0027m very passionate about KSP and I\u0027d like it to be alive and active for many years to come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that in mind, I imagine it would be VERY complicated to create a code decent enough to calculate all possible designs, engines rotated in different angles, opposing thrusts, different fuel levels and mods. I get it. But I also know how important it is for the game, nobody plays without dV readings. Some may say \u0022well thats not realistic/its cheating\u0022 but honestly having to launch dozens of rockets till you get it right by trial and error is plain ridiculous and 10x more unrealistic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that in mind, a solution for now to please everyone till they have enough time and manpower to work deep on this issue is to release a simple dV reading, nothing fancy, giving somewhat accurate readings, a round up number as if it was manually calculated by an engineer with a pencil, napkin and a few minutes. Could be something like 2.3-2.5 TWR, 4.5-4.7 km/s dV, just so we have an idea of what the rocket is capable of without having to launch it countless times to find out the hard way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh but it adds to the challenge\u0022 - Sure, the same way slicing off your right arm would add to the challenge of using your TV remote. Why complicate things, why reinvent the wheel. The time spent manually calculating dV or trial-and-error could be much better used creating something new, going somewhere new, trying a new challenge, building something different. If the guy who invented the calculator kept it to himself and left everybody else doing math by hand to \u0022add to the challenge\u0022, mankind would be evolving much slower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the Tweakscale front, any official squad answer on the matter?
