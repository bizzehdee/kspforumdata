This was originally intended to fix a well-known bug in Real Solar System, where planets with very large radii (read: Earth-sized) would end up having very... \u0022bouncy\u0022 water as a result of the precision used at the water surface. However, it also allows removal of the insta-water-death effects, so it is a stand-alone mod for stock KSP users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFeatures:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBuoyancy calculations are now done at double precision rather than stock\u0027s single precision, resulting in much smoother behavior at the surface. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOcean density can be configured per-body; they are currently set slightly higher than reality-based values due to the rather high density of command pods and such in stock KSP. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EModerate speed (~15 m/s - 20 m/s) impacts are only unsurvivable if the velocity is vertical.
