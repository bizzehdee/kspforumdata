I finally decided to upgrade 1.2.1 to\u00A01.2.2. I always copy the latest to its own folder before adding mods. \u00A0Normally I just start over each time but this time I want to keep my game. Besides my ships what files do I need to copy from 1.2.1 into 1.2.2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T06:08:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLazy bones\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust grab the save file from your old game and pull it across to the new one. \u00A0It\u0027s in the \u0022saves\u0022 folder in your KSP directory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course if you designed ships and ran a modded game, then you could find minor or major issues. \u00A0Best practice would be to start fresh and download the mods you previously used again, unless you know for a fact that they haven\u0027t updated, or they have auto-update protocols.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
