In 1.2 all tanks appear to drain at a rate that causes them to empty at the same time. Further, in prior releases, radially mounted fuel tanks that fed a central tank would drain to empty first, followed by the central tank. In 1.2, the central tank drains first, followed by the radially mounted tanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else noticed this? \u00A0Is this an intended design change? \u00A0If so, it has an adverse impact on\u00A0asparagus staging.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-31T11:54:58Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2016 11:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by absincog\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-31T14:03:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums, yes it\u0027s true fuel travels different since 1.2.

I\u0027m using term \u0022crosfeed level\u0022 instead of stage because it seems more apropriate for this craft example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is still issues on some crafts, discovered trough KSP 1.2 beta testing phase. Fuel flow can be correct as descreibed, but visualisation of fuel flow can be wrong. That seems to be corrected for upcoming 1.2.x patch.
