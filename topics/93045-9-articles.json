Once I got \u0022Early Orbital Rocketry\u0022 (which is where I got the Vanguard X-405 engine \u0026amp; Explorer Probe Core), I picked up mystery goo and the geiger counter (I know the latter is from DMagic). I\u0027ve only been launching from KSC so between Water, Shore \u0026amp; Grassland biomes (did pick up a couple scans in Tundra though I\u0027m not sure how) and Low Fly, High Fly and Low Space, I\u0027ve gathered about 140 science so far.

How much science should I have at this stage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy original sounding rockets were usually under 1t until I got Early Orbital Rocketry. Then they were usually 2-4t but mostly because I was trying to hit 160km \u0026amp; 250km altitude records and using the procedural SRB which is a bit heavier then the fueled procedural fuel tank \u002B Vanguard X-405. Now I\u0027m up to just shy of 10t which is definitely orbital weight but I\u0027m also trying to hit 980km for my current contract and can\u0027t think of a way to do that with a lighter craft.
