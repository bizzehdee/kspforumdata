The ModuleEngineConfigs is trying to reference the MERF, which might cause issues too. Try changing the ModuleEngineConfigs part to reference ModuleEngines instead and see if that helps. Otherwise, I think you\u0027ll have to just update to the dev version and wait for a plume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t messed with electric engines because I have no idea how to scale those things. They\u0027re already way overpowered compared to reality, but considering gameplay I\u0027m not sure we\u0027d want to have 16-hour long burns to worry about. None of my mass/thrust calcs work for an electric engine. I\u0027m not knowledgeable enough in electric propulsion to come up with those calcs, so I ended up leaving it alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tellion","CreatedById":116794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T21:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Raptor831\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Raptor831\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Esnip\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the configs *should* not do anything to nerf the ion engine - it does get a thrust reduction to 1.3kN when NFP is installed however, since it would not fit in with the rest of the NFP engines otherwise (that\u0027s one of Nertea\u0027s patches set with :FINAL to incorporate our fixes, basically).
