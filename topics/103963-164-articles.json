First off I can\u0027t imagine you get tired of hearing this....this mod is gorgeous! I have always wanted to use it but having a MBP my computer really couldn\u0027t handle it. Now with 64bit I am excited to add it to my save file. I have looked back quite a few pages and i have not seen this issue reported. So I apologize if has already been reported. I am seeing a pink square on the launchpad and runway. It shows up at other odd times and usually too fast for me to catch a screen shot. But it does consistently happen on the launchpad and runway. It definitely doesn\u0027t happen without scatterer installed. Thanks for this great mod keep up the great work.\n\nMid 2012 MBP OSX El Capitan\n\nScatterer Version 0.0242\n\nKSP.log [https://www.dropbox.com/s/pcybc65bdg6owx6/KSP.log?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pcybc65bdg6owx6/KSP.log?dl=0)\n\nPlayer.log [https://www.dropbox.com/s/j9pm1i59c04ycoi/Player.log?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j9pm1i59c04ycoi/Player.log?dl=0)\n\nEDIT: It seems that the Lens Flare Shader seems to be the culprit.
