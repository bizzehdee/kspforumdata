I would be happy to provide my craft file and even make a camtasia video of the issue if it would help. RT2 is completely useless to me if I cannot resolve this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eokay this appears to be a mod conflict after all. I went and cooled off a bit came back and then just rolled back to vanilla and added only RT2. when I use the flight computer and \u0022node\u0022 it points to the node properly and does not do the spin around the longitudinal axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next steps will be to roll my mods back in binary fashion until I find the one causing the problem. I will focus on mech jeb and mechjebandengineerforall.cfg first. When I find the culprit I will post so that others don\u0027t have to go through this hell.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"somnambulist","CreatedById":62108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T01:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ctbram\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ctbram\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eokay this appears to be a mod conflict after all.

I have a linking problem with a ship since I updated to v1.5.2. I have a lander with an antenna that won\u0027t link with a nearby station with a dish pointed at Kerbin and two active antennae. The station is connected to KSC, but I can\u0027t upload any data to KSC from the lander without docking first. Any ideas? I believe everything was working before I updated, but I\u0027m not 100% on that.
