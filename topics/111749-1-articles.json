And since I have FAR, MechJeb is no longer able to get my rockets to space.\n\nThey begin to wobble and vibrate like mad at about \u003E 200 m/s until they break into pieces.\n\nWhen flying manually, it works just fine. No wobbling.\n\nIs it possible to configure MechJeb to do a more \u0022careful\u0022 or kind of more optimized ascent, to not break my rockets?\n\nHow do you do this? What are the most important parameters to tweak?\n\nFYI: It\u0027s not that I use MechJeb extensively. It\u0027s just that I can\u0027t use it at all for the ascent phase while FAR is installed."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T17:13:40Z","Content":"Set your AoA in ascent guidence to 3 degrees. If the craft can\u0027t take that much turn above prograde set to 2 or 1. The lower you go with this the slower and more stable your turn will be and it will use more fuel. Set the PA to whatever FAR uses. If FAR is using the same pressure values as stock don\u0027t touch it tho. Enable corrective steering. %40 turn rate is good and start your turn before 3km."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T19:09:32Z","Content":"One option is to use the Kerbal Joint Reinforcement mod (also by ferram4) if you are not already, which should help with the wobble. Otherwise struts can help, but they can also make things worse depending on placement and amount. Manually tuning the attitude adjustment tab by decreasing Kd and proportionally decreasing Kp can also help with the wobble."},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T18:32:16Z","Content":"Thanks.\n\nLimiting AoA to 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 helped a ton.

Manually tuning the attitude adjustment tab by decreasing Kd and proportionally decreasing Kp can also help with the wobble.\n\nMy rocket is not wobbling in its internal structure. But it\u0027s cranking and tries to roll and pitch in growing amplitudes until it reaches a certain altitude.\n\nThe MechJeb Controller can barely keep it under control.\n\nBut this only happes during a mechjeb ascent. Manual ascent is pretty smooth.\n\nSo I guess I have to balace the controller by playing with Kp, Ki and Kd to remove this behavior.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I once advised someone to mess with the PID settings, to which Sarbian himself immediately replie \u0022don\u0027t mess with that unless you really know what you are doing.\u0022\n\u003E So, don\u0027t mess with that ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI\u0027m aware of that. ^^\n\nI sometimes have to mess around with control processes in my real world job too.\n\nSo I\u0027ll be cautious.
