It appears like it isn\u0027t possible to actually view where a survey mission wants you to go before you accept it (obv. you can see the planet and what the waypoints are, but that doesn\u0027t necessarily tell you a whole lot). I was hoping/am hoping I am missing something and you can, for instance, view it on a map before accepting one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shadowfax","CreatedById":3742,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T14:53:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo into the tracking building.

Once you accept the mission and get to the launchpad/runway, go into the map screen, click on the area you\u0027re going to, and set it as navigation target.
