The shortest distance might not be what you want to aim for, as you will likely end up with recalculating your bearing all the time (a course following a great circle rarely ever has a constant bearing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA loxodrome will give you a constant bearing, which is easier to navigate by (but a longer route. However, getting where you want to be trumps never arriving as you get lost, even if the route is shorter). A loxodrome is a straight line on a Mercator projection, by the way; which is why it\u0027s popular with seafarers. As a result it\u0027s a popular projection despite its shortcomings on size and shape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MAFman","CreatedById":101780,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-07T14:46:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking of pulling a heightmap directly from the game and using A* to search through it, using the brightness per pixel (height) and the change in altitude over the change in coordinates as a heuristic, as well as arbitrarily assigning infinite cost to points in the ocean.
