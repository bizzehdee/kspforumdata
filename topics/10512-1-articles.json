There are two problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you can\\\u0027t get a stock rocket into orbit that has the power to take off, perform the transit, land, takeoff again, and make another long distance transit journey. And even if you could get suck a rocket to take off and make the trip, you still can\\\u0027t land it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture your normal take off rocket, and picture beeming it up into orbit (or use a launching mod to get it up there). The first problem landing, once its fully implimented will be heat. If you use the engines to slow your descent, your going to use up nearly as much as you would to take off, so you will never have enough fuel left over to launch again. So you\\\u0027ll need some sort of heat shield part to go bellow the engines to keep your rocket from vaporizing while it waits for friction and fluid dynamics (air can only get out of the way so fast) to slow it down. Your also going to need something to keep it upright. If you fire bottom mounted engines, your rocket will immediately invert itself, if it hasn\\\u0027t done so already. So you need either need a parachute or rigging for a top mounted engine to keep your speed under control, and to keep you upright, keeping in mind that either solution when deployed during landing without a lot of support connections to lower parts of your rocket will promptly transform your magnificent vessel into its own fleet, and none of your new, much smaller, ships are going to be in any shape to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you think you need to land slowly on the Mun, wait until your landing a full sized rocket on another, possibly bigger, Kerbin, and your rocket turns into a pancake. We will probably need stronger landing gear that sticks down further, and has some flexibility, to help the rocket come to a stop over half a second instead of all at once, or its going to break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealistically, you need two things. Aside from a array of giant parachutes, or a top mounting array for some seriously heat tolerant engines, you need the ability to refuel a rocket with other rockets, and ideally, you want to be able to assemble a ship in space much like a space station. While you could always build a ship on the ground and refuel it in orbit, possibly on arrival, and after landing (which will require many other vessels to act as tankers, and require the first ship to be carrying a crew support module to carry the tanker crews home in), a ship that is going to handle well during landing is going to handle like garbage during takeoff (if it is even capable to doing so).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, as cool as it would be, there are some parts and features missing that would make this a lot more awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-19T23:00:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the kracken subject, I have encountered the kracken once on a solar escape attempt.
