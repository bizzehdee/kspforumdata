Further, it\u0027s even more efficient than my previous, Juggernaut VI! With a launch mass of just over 6kt (6022.68t), it gives me a payload fraction of 25.24%! Not enough to bump me up in the ranks, but enough to beat my previous score. And the fact that I had just a bit of fuel left at the end of that launch means I could probably have squeezed another 0.1% out of it.... But I won\u0027t do that again! There are so many parts that it takes about 6 real seconds for 1 in game second of launch. That entire process was about an hour from launch to orbit!\n\nNote: You could pretty easily lift an entire space station into 150km orbit with this thing.
