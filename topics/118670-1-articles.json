In order to give the wings structural strength without being insanely heavy, they needed a truss structure. Also, they needed extremely low wing loading, and they got that by cutting the wing loading in half, or in thirds, or even in quarters by increasing the wing area by using multiple wings.

However, there are still a few wrinkles to flying on Duna that can be traps for the unwary, so I recently put together a set of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/131809-Flying-on-Duna-in-1-0-4-Some-General-Guidelines?p=2142986#post2142986\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eguidelines (not really a tutorial) on flying Duna in 1.0.4\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to cut to the chase....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main trick to flying on Duna is landing safely because the ground is very bumpy everywhere except in the bottoms of canyons and basins, airbrakes are virtually useless due to the thin air, and wheel brakes are virtually useless due to the low gravity. There is thus a premium on STOL performance and reverse thrust to stop before some lump in the terrain kills you. So yes, you need a lot of wing, but no, you don\u0027t need 4 sets of wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, this is a VERY good Duna plane (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127863-The-OTC-1-0-4-Edition-Episode-16-The-Pyramid-Scheme?p=2136921\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2136921\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI\u0027m currently flying it all over the place there now in my career save\u003C/a\u003E):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/vP2zm6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/428/19566528873_efbc22f937_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219566528873_efbc22f937_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis weighs 12.16 tons on Kerbin and has 17.32 units of lift. On Duna, this gives it a stall speed of about 35m/s even at 4500m terrain elevation, thanks to having about 1.4 lift/ton. Yet despite having just a single Firespitter electric prop (4Kn/ton thrust), it can climb nearly vertically, go over 1000m/s, and hurl itself briefly above the atmosphere. The Firespitter prop also has a reverse gear which it uses to stop quickly. It might as well not have the airbrakes--they do almost no good at all. The only fuel is the tank in the cargo bay and that gives it enough juice to circumnavigate the planet several times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might sound OP, but the same plane hardly flies at all on Kerbin. It\u0027s got so little power and so much drag from all the lift that can\u0027t quite reach 100m/s or 10km altitude. And it has so much control authority (needed on Duna) that it\u0027s totally squirrelly on Kerbin. In short, it\u0027s about the worst airplane I\u0027ve ever built to fly on Kerbin, which is where all its parts were designed for.

It\u0027s highest and best use is as a simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is ESPECIALLY important when it comes to Duna airplanes. The Duna environment is so different from Kerbin that you can\u0027t tell anything at all about how a plane will fly on Duna by testing it on Kerbin. And in a stock game, an ion-powered plane won\u0027t even leave the ground on Kerbin these days, so you can\u0027t even get the wrong impression of it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E. So if you don\u0027t do some testing first, you\u0027re going in totally blind and the plane will probably crash so fast that you won\u0027t even be able to identify its problems so you can fix the next one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI learn by trial and error. Since I am designing SSTOs, they\u0027ll be plenty of delta-v to get back into orbit. I\u0027m only really looking to design an SSTO with enough lift that it merely can land safely on Duna without the use of retroburns. I only need the stall speed around 70 m/s. My last SSTO stalled around 120 m/s, but it wasn\u0027t designed to fly on Duna to begin with. This really seems like a simple problem of just adding lift, and I\u0027m trying to do that without big wings so that I can more easily land on rough terrain. I don\u0027t plan to fly around the planet cause the game tends to crash after 15 minutes of low altitude flight, so I suspect having to refuel in orbit. Duna to me is still magical cause I\u0027ve only been on it once, and it was a learning experience, and I don\u0027t want to tarnish that with easy mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T19:48:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T19:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E#1) As far as drag is concerned... are you sure?\u003Cp\u003E#2) Heat occulusion is not the same as drag occlusion.

About 10 km up on Kerbin is comparable to datum on Duna for example.
