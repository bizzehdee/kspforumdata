I\u0027m enjoying it, but I\u0027m surprised how much trouble I\u0027m having with the gravity turn. My main problem is I can\u0027t see the \u0022East\u0022 indicator on the navball, which is normally what I point at when starting my gravity turn. The compass headings are all obscured by other UI elements, like the velocity and altitude readouts. Is there a way to move those readouts or otherwise adjust the navball so I can see all four compass directions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a workaround, I\u0027ve just been clicking on the prograde vector shortly after launch, and that does get me to orbit, but not optimally. I think I had the same issue in the training session. I got to orbit, but it was all a bit chaotic. What\u0027s more, the time to orbit seems much faster in this game -- or maybe I just don\u0027t remember how fast it was in KSP1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also had some uncertainty about whether I\u0027m using solid rocket boosters right. The training mission suggested firing both the main engine and the boosters at the same time, then ditching the boosters when empty by activating (staging) their radial decouplers. I\u0027ve had better luck just using the boosters as a first stage, decoupling them, then firing the next stage (stacked) engine. But this has been chaotic too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, a lot of UI elements are kinda tiny for my aging eyes. I\u0027ve tried fussing with the UI scaling option, but it doesn\u0027t seem to change much.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, is there a way to speed up camera rotation while in space? It seems to take a lot of mouse-movement to change the view just 45 degrees, say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
