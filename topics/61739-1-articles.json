If you\u0027re busy with something else and don\u0027t get back to it before the electric charge runs out you can no longer rename the ship or change the type. The name and type is the same as the ship that you just undocked from, and the only way to get this debris off your map is to goto the tracking station and delete it there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point, to get it off your map, there becomes an annoying process to make sure you\u0027re deleting the right thing and not your multi-launch interplanetary ship you\u0027ve been working on for hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a reason we can no longer rename the ship, or have it automatically default to debris at least? Perhaps create a new class of \u0022dead ships\u0022, things with command modules but no power? It seems to me this would be an easy change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
