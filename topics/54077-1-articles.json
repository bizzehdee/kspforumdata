Save the ship, exit ksp, edit the .craft file for that ship, and remove all of the \u0022sym = \u0022 lines from the parts in question. Each of the symmetric parts will have a \u0022sym = \u0022 line pointing to every other part it\u0027s symmetric with. So if you have 6 way symmetry, there will be 6 parts, each with 5 sym lines to remove.

The problem is in the load/save functionality of the VAB. For example if you do the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Make a copy of ship.craft to newship.craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Load newship in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Edit it and hit save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you modified the ship name before you saved, you\u0027ve just overwritten the original ship.craft instead of newship.craft. The problem is that the loader dialog displays the filename, so you see newship in the list after simply copying the file. But the save button uses the ship name to chose the filename to save it to, and the ship name listed inside newship.craft is the same as the one in \u0022ship.craft\u0022. So it\u0027s best when copying a craft file to also edit the name in the file to match the filename.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
