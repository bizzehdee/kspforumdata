They are due to the solar pressure or some gases escaping from ship. Reaction wheels can resist such torques by increasing their rpm. But naturally there are some maximum rpm value. After that they need so called momentum dumping, during which RCS thrusters produce torque so that wheels can be stopped. So, satellites and probes must have the RCS. Most satellites have both systems because reaction wheels are more controllable and no not consume fuel. Manned crafts do not typically need very high pointing precision and they do not need to stay maneuverable longer than couple of weeks, so they do not have reaction wheels (except ISS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like smaller spherical RCS tanks. For example 10 units of monopropellant. Typically I need one RCS operation during the flight (for example when a lander docks to a station or mothership) and it uses 5-10 units. Now I have to take 80 units (or 40 if I take risk of unbalance and put just one tank) which is just useless weight eating limited delta v.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-10T09:27:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2013 09:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Hannu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slugy","CreatedById":76281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T11:44:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI too would like some much smaller RCS tanks in the stock game, in the meantime you can make your own:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/48368-Part-Generator-Version-3-Win-Linux-Mac\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/48368-Part-Generator-Version-3-Win-Linux-Mac\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m1xte","CreatedById":53528,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T15:01:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPicture of rocket on pad please \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/29618-The-Simple-Heavy-Lifting-challenge?p=366461\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post366461\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/29618-The-Simple-Heavy-Lifting-challenge?p=366461\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post366461\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts outdated and works lot better with the pod torque replaced with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DChurchill","CreatedById":60282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T15:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSPX has a half-size RCS tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
