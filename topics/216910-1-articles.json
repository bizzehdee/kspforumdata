At the beginning of the career, I\u0027ve completed the Karman Line quest which should have unlocked the next one, I presume - Downrange 3000 km. However, it didn\u0027t get unlocked, saying I have not \u0022Reached 100 km\u0022 (I assume that is the Karman line quest, correct me if I\u0027m wrong).\u00A0 Looking into the cheat menu I can confirm I\u0027ve completed it (even the game knows it then). Still, the 3000 km downrange quest doesn\u0027t get unlocked, which means that I have only basic sounding contracts and rocketplane/x-plane contracts available.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots including mod list here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/CUNtJ3k\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/lovely personJ3k\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there must be probably something wrong in the savefile, if there is anyone who would be able to guide me with how to edit it so that RP-1 can recognize the Karman Line quest as completed, it would be greatly appreciated. I know I\u0027m stuck relatively at the beginning quest-wise, but I\u0027ve already launched my first orbit so I would prefer not to start completely over. (I didn\u0027t realize there was something wrong since this is my first RP-1 career and all the new features have been quite overwhelming so far.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I should add, this issue was probably caused because I initially started the career as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E only and after a few launches I added RP-1 when I realized the stock tech tree doesn\u0027t make much sense for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, therefore I had a bunch of milestones (and quests) already done when I opened the RP-1 for the first time. When I start a new career, the Downrange 3000 km quest gets unlocked immediately after my first flight, so there is no problem on the game/mod side, there must be one in my savefile attached here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://jmp.sh/iLT7yjXD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://jmp.sh/iLT7yjXD\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings I (unsuccessfully) tried so far:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI un-did the Karman Line quest and completed it both from the cheat menu or with a rocket.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027ve reinstalled the mods and verified files in the store.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI un-did (removed) Uncrewed altitude records from the quest archive.
