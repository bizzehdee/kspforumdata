The design team though it could make orbit and come back. \u201CAround the world as many times as you want on one tank of gas,\u201D he thought.

But it should he able to scale up\u2026 with better engines. It won\u2019t replace the rockets.

It was a design that looked like it would work. But, it had only been flown previously by the computers, on paper.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTower, 108.
