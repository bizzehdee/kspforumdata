I got a lot of fun doing this job. It turned out that this document should consist half of the consideration of the issue of water. Now I thought that it would be great to create a separate document that will be completely devoted to the issue of water availability in the Kerbol system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027m not a scientist and I can not be sure that all my explanations will be correct. I\u0027m just a fan of science. In addition, English is not my native language and I am not able to express complex thoughts correctly. For this I need help to do this work. I hope you are the same science fans as I am and you will get a lot of fun doing this job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the original draft\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/steamp0rt/Kerbalism/files/2056467/kerbalism-water-harvesting.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/steamp0rt/Kerbalism/files/2056467/kerbalism-water-harvesting.zip\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to ask the following people for help:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEditor -\u00A0I suppose that the best candidate is a native english who does not have strong scientific background. To ask more questions and help make the document easy enough to understand for most people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsultants -\u00A0anyone with scientific experience to help me create the most reliable and realistic picture of water distribution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are interested in this proposal and you want to become part of the team to work on this issue, please write me a message that we could discuss the most appropriate approach for implementing this task.\u00A0And of course, I will be happy if you just join the discussion of this issue directly in this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProf. Koberth\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS. As an advance of the idea, a little thought about Minmus. Probably this is crystalline hydrate. Something like copper chloride 2 hydrate or ferric sulfate 5 hydrate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-01T08:33:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2018 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by whirlwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
