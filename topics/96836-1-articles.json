It seems that editing the MNA values in persistence.sfs no longer seems to work? I want to align 4 commsats so that I don\u0027t need to go back and correct their orbits every couple of years... But it seems that doing so no longer seems to have an effect (they ended up wandering pretty quickly actually).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T06:47:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you\u0027ve copied the entire ORBIT block from your reference probe, and only then modified the MNA value to space them out, it should work fine.
