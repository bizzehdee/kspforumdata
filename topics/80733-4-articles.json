If it really is as simple as adding a file and maybe writing a script for updating/packaging/building, very few will have an issue. But the moment modders have to start uploading to multiple places that aren\u0027t their favorite, you\u0027re going to start seeing backlash. Having accounts on tons of different sites and requiring multiple uploads increases workload and the chance that something will be missed. No one wants to add workload because that means less time having fun doing a hobby.\u003Cp\u003EA certain user in this thread isn\u0027t exactly helping your cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I that user?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, I agree with you.

The problem is the fact that people are stubborn and not willing to compromise on anything. They are set in their ways. Until that happens, mods will continue to get buried and updating from new releases will continue to be a pita.

Thats how it seems to me anyways. And its not about blame, thats not what we are trying to do, we are trying to suggest a better method than what we have.
