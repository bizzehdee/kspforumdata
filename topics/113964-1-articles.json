There\u0027s lots of good ones around. Here\u0027s a thread full of useful links: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352)\n\nLaunching a rocket successfully revolves around one simple rule right now: \u0022Heavy bits in the front, draggy bits at the rear.\u0022 The details of how you achieve this can vary, but ultimately it all boils down to trying to come as close to that as possible. Any rocket that follows this rule will automatically fly straight. Any rocket that grossly violates this rule will automatically try to flip over and fly in an orientation where the rule applies better, such as backwards. If that is the case, you will not go to space today.\n\nThe simplest way to make your rocket more conforming to this rule is to build it like an arrow. Make sure the tip is very pointy. A flat surface at the tip will ruin your day very quickly. Form a single, straight shaft without anything sticking out the side anywhere. Finally, attach guiding fins at the bottom of the rocket (ideally ones that can also be used for steering). Like, literally as low down as you can go. Mount four of them in symmetry. [Here\u0027s an example rocket](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44754370/screenshot50.png). Look how pointy and straight and arrow-like it is! Now all it needs is a set of fins at the bottom. It can fly without, if you\u0027re a good pilot, but to be safe, better put some on. Delta Deluxe winglets work well.\n\nOnce you have your rocket built according to the cardinal rule, you need to \u0022un-learn\u0022 the old way of going straight up to 10km and then turning sharply to the side. Instead, go up to 1 km only, and then turn very slightly to the side. Just a single notch on the navball. And then... turn off SAS and take your hands off the controls. Stop steering and just watch your rocket go. You\u0027ll see that it turns sideways slowly by itself, in a very smooth, very stable fashion called a \u0022gravity turn\u0022 (because gravity pulls the rocket to the side). Maybe it will turn too fast - then you need to go a little higher before you start your turn. Maybe it will fly too straight and not turn much at all - then you need to throttle down your engine a bit after you start your turn.\n\nYou\u0027ll probably feel nervous taking your hands off the controls even as your rocket is tipping to the side, but remember, you want it to go sideways to get into orbit. It just needs to tilt at the right rate, which you can control by the timing of your initial pitchover and your engine throttle.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T09:27:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 09:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T09:36:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hello, Squad Developer or anyone.
