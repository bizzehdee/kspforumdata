Items which not contains flammable should not explode.

E.g: antenna melt faster if is\u0027t deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow it should melt? Well, its depends on you. The simplest way i imagine is changing the object geometry(e.g. 4 different condition state 15%,30%,60%,100%).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to increase immensity then the part condition should affect on it\u0027s behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPs.
