So I am trying to modify both and combine them, getting the best of each and minimizing parts that are similar and redundant. What I have found is, the fairings parts from KW are better than the ones from Nova. However there are parts from NOVA that are far more powerful, the massive radial decoupler for instance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany suggestions on what parts to keep and what parts to get rid of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SalmonellaDingDong","CreatedById":57168,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-18T23:10:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre the nova fairings the ones that never want to attach to ANYTHING correctly?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S.C.E to AUX","CreatedById":57273,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T00:33:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyea, and KW automatically incorporates a decoupler into the base.

If that\u0027s the root command pod, wobble tends to be less of an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI pretty much stopped using NovaPunch in favor of KW after I tweaked KW\u0027s heavy struts to have the same mass as stock struts just like NP\u0027s do. The only things I ever really used from NP were the struts, the long radial decouplers, and the 5 meter parts, and after a while I found that I could do everything I wanted to do using KW parts, so I took the opportunity to reduce the game\u0027s memory footprint and load time by dropping NP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think KW\u0027s parts are much more polished, both graphically and functionally. Some of NP\u0027s looked a bit crude by comparison. No shame on the people who made them, of course - resources, skills, time, and effort involved are different for everyone. It\u0027s just that KW\u0027s a tough act to follow! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-19T08:33:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2013 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tallinu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T12:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love KW, the parts are very polished and 3.75 seems a good place to stop, giving you 3 good sizes of parts and plenty of options.
