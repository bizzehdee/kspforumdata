It\u0027s orbit is a little less then 2x the orbit of Jool, like Saturn, and it would be 9000 Km wide. It will of course have rings, and well, I really don\u0027t know what color it should be. I think it should be either white or blue, like Neptune. (I think it\u0027s name \u0022Prominatus\u0022 is a bit too long, do any of you guys have a name that more fits in the KSP style of planet names?) Also, it\u0027s rings would have asteroids, like the ARM patch. (Would use custom asteroids mod) It\u0027s 4 moons are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EThey are in order of there orbital altitude, like Daphy has the lowest orbit and Potatus\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ehas the highest orbit.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDaphy: Exactly the same as NovaSilisko himself described it in his post. It\u0027s orbit will be so 75% of the time it\u0027s submerged in Prominatus\u0027 rings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EFonso: 300 Km diameter, two atmospheres d\u003C/span\u003Eense, and a very mountainous surface. Perhaps it could have tons of canyons, adding to the already hard to land on moon. It\u0027s exactly as NovaSilisko described it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMania (Eeloo substitute): A very odd and weird moon, as it seems to be both as habitable as Europa and as inhabitable as Moho. It\u0027s tidally locked, and on the side facing Prominatus it has cracks in it\u0027s very ice looking surface, like Europa. And on the side facing away from Prominatus, it looks like there\u0027s absolutely no possibility of life. There are (Fake) volcanoes/geysers dotted over the surface, like Io. It has craters absolutely everywhere, and there is also a 10 Km tall geyser near the south polar end of the non-Prominatus side of the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPotatus: Pretty much the same as Inaccessible in Planet Factory, but a high inclination and it\u0027s a Prominatusian moon. It would also be more colored, to well, like a potato.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGP3/Hypat: Actually not a gas giant, and instead is 2000 Km wide, 30 atm pressure at sea level, and also 6gs at the surface. Good luck trying to take off under that, good freaking luck. It also looks like a very large Titan from space, and it\u0027s orangeish from space, but as you descend to Hypat\u0027s surface, it will slowly become a darker red. It\u0027s terrain would be tons of canyons, and the occasional large valley. Now it\u0027s moons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlark: It has faint rings, like NovaSilisko said. It\u0027s also a purpleish-blue color, and is 200 Km across, and it\u0027s terrain would be a mix between small mountains and a normal cratered surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrutat: A small asteroid moon on a high inclination and a noticeabley encentrictic orbit. A potato-ish shaped an 70 Km across, and grey colored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFut: A 10 Km diamter potato shaped asteroid moon. Half of it is grey and the other half is purplish-blue, like Flark, it\u0027s orbit is higher then Brutat and a little more encentrictic. Fut is thought to be a former large part Flark\u0027s ring system, that somehow got into this weird orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, Siliskus, a comet. Because KSP is missing them. It\u0027s a grey-brown color, 5 Km across, noticabley potato-like, and it\u0027s on an insanley encentric orbit. It\u0027s perioapoasis is a bit lower then Moho\u0027s orbit, and it\u0027s apoapoasis is a bit higher then the orbit of Hypat. I wish it could also have the comet effect like in Alternis Kerbol, and it should have a little easter egg tributing NovaSilisko...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd these are some EPIC drawings of these planets made by Felsmak!
