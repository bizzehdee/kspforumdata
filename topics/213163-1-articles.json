So... naturally after about 4 and a half hours of gameplay I turned everything but the rocket and explosion SFX entirely off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2\u0027s audio is very impressive, well designed, atmospheric, and fitting and I can see that it\u0027s brought a lot of people a lot of joy and I\u0027m really glad that they\u0027re enjoying it and praising it. However, it\u0027s also overwhelming, distracting and headache inducing for me in ways that KSP1 was just not. Special prize goes to the beep the tracking station makes whenever you mouse over it. That was amusing for about 10 seconds but now I just don\u0027t want to mouse over it ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is though, everyone is right. The sound design is nice and in many cases satisfying and it\u0027d be very nice to have more granular control over it, or at least a low-sensory-impact option for it with similar (lack of) complexity to KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it is, right now things are just this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022150\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ebo0aLLPYwA?start=12\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Airplane!
