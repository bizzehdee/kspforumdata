I built a ship using stock, porkjet atomic age and quiztech aerospace engines and now I have issues. Mechjeb says that I have infinity delta v while Kerbal engineer says that I have 0. This is for all engines, no matter which one I select it always says this. I have fuel and oxidizer left over in the tanks connect to the engines. Note, this problem only appeared once I entered orbit, so before the delta v calculations were fine. Any suggestions as to what to try?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T01:58:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t the porkjet atomic jet engines run forever?
