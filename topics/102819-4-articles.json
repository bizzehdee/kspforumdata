I was concerned it might gain some awkward non-relevant name that has no reference to anything actually existing (leading to mass confusion when speaking of game mechanics to people whom have yet to obtain KSP, for example). \n\nNever mind the translation issues.\n\nOre is a generic term, used to described \u0022unrefined solid material\u0022. This doesn\u0027t mean the valuable constituents have to actually be a solid. Mercury, for example is extracted from a source ore, which vaporises under heat, and is cooled (condensed) to become a liquid metal (queue Terminators theme).\n\nAll sorts of complex molecules, some of which quite like to burn can become trapped within rock and ore.\n\nThe concept that you could mine ore, crush and extract valuable propellants or materials to form propellent certainly isn\u0027t a new one. At least two or three mars missions (including from NASA) are based on the concept of using raw materials located in-situ to make propellant.\n\nNot sure they\u0027re pounding on rocks; but extracting valuable resources from solid ore is certainly very well established and has been for eons, just considering our own history.\n\nThe biggest advantage, is that Ore can contain such a wide array of components. It\u0027s non-specific meaning the source \u0027ore\u0027 could be used for mods to extract just about anything you could think of. So it\u0027s actually quite a sensible choice. \n\nI sense RoverDude\u0027s rather logical hand in the naming process, just quietly. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T03:47:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 03:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kofeyh**"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T13:50:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I fully support naming the new resource Obtainium.\n\nI agree!"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T13:54:02Z","Content":"So we are going to make fuel from Ore? o\\_O \n\nMaybe there is some name from oil production process that could be used instead."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T14:10:07Z","Content":"Given that\u0027s pretty much what NASA plans on doing (i.e. breaking up rocks to get stuff out of them, including stuff for propellants), then yep.

And one could argue that on a planet or moon where oxygen and hydrogen are extremely valuable, and can be profitably extracted from a naturally occurring solid material (like lunar regolith), then yes, in that case, one term that could be used to describe the stuff we\u0027re extracting fuel from is \u0027Ore\u0027.\n\nAlso note that Ore is not, contrary to popular belief, a geological term. It is an economic term. Go in your back yard. Take a shovel full of dirt. the instant it becomes economically valuable to extract the trace amounts of gold, platinum, or other valuable elements from that dirt is the instant it goes from being \u0027dirt\u0027 to \u0027ore\u0027.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T14:15:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RoverDude**"},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T14:48:06Z","Content":"Ice Cream ISRU?\n\nMintIceCream -\u003E O2\n\nVanillaIceCream -\u003E Water\n\nChocolateIceCream -\u003E Food\n\nRedBeanIceCream -\u003E LFO\n\nRockyRoadIceCream -\u003E Rocketparts\n\nPistachioIceCream -\u003E SolidFuel\n\nGrapeSherbertIceCream-\u003EXenonGas"},{"CreatedByName":"SickSix","CreatedById":119303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T18:19:04Z","Content":"Thank you for the summary!
