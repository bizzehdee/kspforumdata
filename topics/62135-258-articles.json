The KSO as it was was balanced against pre-1.0 stats and physics so its naturally going to have more fuel leftover after circularization because it was meant to use around 4500m/s delta-V to get into orbit, and now the dV to get into orbit is somewhere in the neighborhood of 3500m/s. I\u0027d say either remove the extra fuel in the VAB or take it as extra payload that you can send up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for Mechjeb, it probably just has issues coping with the offset thrust once it starts lowering the throttle. You could spare yourself that issue by just circularizing yourself. Or, by doing the launch yourself.
