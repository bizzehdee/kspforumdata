A single Aerospike engine can drain a tank of jet fuel in approximately EIGHT SECONDS. I\u0027m guessing you shouldn\u0027t normally be firing them on full capacity, but still, it seems like the other jet engines are both far, far more fuel efficient. Am I using it wrong? Is there a set altitude in which it has much greater efficiency? The tooltips are inconsistent between the atmospheric engines, so i\u0027m not sure how they compare, and the wiki article appears to be out of date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what uses you guys have come up with them! Myself, i\u0027m experimenting with using them as SRB replacements.

Don\u0027t be fooled by their jet engine-y appearance, just treat them like normal rockets! (because they are) Their fuel consumption and thrust are actually quite good....for a rocket engine. Just know that you can\u0027t use them with stack decouplers and that they can\u0027t vector thrust. They\u0027re pretty great used as main engines, and as controllable \u0022srb\u0022 style boosters. Also know that the true SRB\u0027s give you way more thrust, albeit for a short period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T08:13:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are rocket engines with the same efficiency in atmosphere as well as vacuum, so good for atmospheric landers or boosters as you said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"princessjane","CreatedById":30815,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T08:14:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly I still think aerospike\u0027s are king of the hill. use a 1 man pod, the largest fuel tank, and an aerospike and learn just how crazy they still are. combined with the new NERV\u0027s for once your out of atmo and... things just got real. they have been balanced a little bit I admit but personally I like it. my big problem is how hard it is to place them, things just don\u0027t want to attach to anything for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Solusphere","CreatedById":32603,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T08:17:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, really?
