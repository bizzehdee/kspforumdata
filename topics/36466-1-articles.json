I am quite proud of it and do not want it to be ruined by this little decoupler. I\u0027m scared that I might accidentaly stage and split the fuel tank and engine away from the construct. Is there any way to remove the decoupler without rebuilding the entire thing? It took me quite a while to put together and a quick way out would help a lot.
