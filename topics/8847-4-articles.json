This launcher-capsule was originally designed for simple orbital flights but the addition of some landing legs and a switch from the Kosmos RCS modules to stock (to reduce the number of mods used) extends its range into Cis-munar space. I has some strange problems with the persistance file refusing to load the last few missions , so I apologise in advance for glitches when I pass on the batton.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh , and for those of you wondering about the name of the capsule I include a completely optional history lesson.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShortly after the launch of Sputnik in 1957 Premier Khrushchev demanded that the space program produce a \u0027Space Spectacular\u0027 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October revolution and one-up the Americans who were preparing to launch their own satellites. Deciding that the triumph of an animal in space would be sufficient , they cobbled together the Sputnik 2 spacecraft in a matter of weeks. As for its passenger , they chose a young mongrel stray called Laika that had been found wandering the streets of Moscow. On Nov 3rd 1957 she was lifted into orbit on an R-7 Launcher , becoming the first living creature to be launched into an orbit around the Earth. Though the mission made headlines at the time (Laika was lauded as \u0027Mutnik\u0027 in the American press) , the story was rapidly eclipsed by the race to put a man into space and the subsequent dash for the moon. Laika herself was destined to die in space , for the Russian engineers had neither the time nor the expertise to design a re-entry module. Within hours of launch the poorly designed systems began to fail and Laika died of heatstroke before the day was out. Despite this the mission must be considered highly successful , for it proved that creatures not unlike humans could Breath , sleep eat and talk (bark) in zero gravity. In recognition of this triumph , I named my humble lander after the dog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c9/Laika.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Laika.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Log\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. On the pad. As you can see , the Laika class is a small ship , and usually does not launch with a fairing. One was added for this mission for the sake of the delicate landing legs. The first stage is all liquid , but would normally include the addition of four small solid \u0027payload assist\u0027 rockets from Jordancox\\\u0027s pack. I ommited them believing that the lander could make the one way trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/2r7vlw2.png\u0022 alt=\u00222r7vlw2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Shortly after 2nd stage separation. Here you can see the lander itself. The legs and large RCS units rather mess up the lines of this beautiful pack , and usually I fly with the smaller Kosmos RCS. This is where leaving out the Payload assist rockets came back to bite me , forcing me to use the capsules main engine to boost orbital speed and make the Trans-munar burn. Much valuable fuel was wasted\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/2ujqoif.png\u0022 alt=\u00222ujqoif.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Munar Disasters! Firstly , I mistimed my TMB. I ended up in front of the mun and had to make an emergency course correction. Then , after correctly lining myself up and burning off velocity to come down manually on the base-site , it became apparent that I would run out of gas. I was forced to take an agonising decision and commit myself to landing on the Capsule rockets alone. That was pretty hair raising. I finally managed to get her down only a few dozen metres from the beacon...and was then mildly suprised to see the rover go rolling past the window! for some reason it decided to start moving when it loaded in range. I have no idea why. This is the view I got after I shifted it back into position manually\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/125o175.png\u0022 alt=\u0022125o175.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion , ive had better missions.
