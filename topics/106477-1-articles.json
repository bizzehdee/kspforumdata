The atmosphere and weight of your vehicle just hinder your acceleration.\n\nI was so worried about my AP and how high it was along with my speed when the thing I should have really been focusing on was getting close to orbital velocity as quickly and effeintly as I could before coasting in to circulurize. \n\nI am making to orbit with a bit less delta v now."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T03:24:28Z","Content":"Yep.

Strap on a bunch and get it up to 25-30k with them and you can carry absolutely ridiculous size ships out of the atmosphere.
