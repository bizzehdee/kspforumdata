Placed satalites in orbit and saved some Kerbals along the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is: What do I do now to get the most efficienty out of my game. Do I build a spacestation?

Filling each with data should be relatively simple - the orbital station can collect from LKO, HKO, then high munar orbit. On Mun or Minmus, data from a single biome is more than enough to fill the data stores. After that, transferring to another system will net you a rather large chunk of science in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, setting up a large orbital base around Minmus with supporting ground mining operations can be helpful. Due to the low gravity, it\u0027s a choice spot for assembling and fueling large interplanetary ventures. The cost savings from sending up only partially fueled vessels adds up fairly quickly. Also, good practice for setting up similar operations on Gilly, Ike, and beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T19:01:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can get an awful lot of science from: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA probe that just peeks out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and comes right back, recovering science \u0022high above the sun.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr dropping parachuted probes to transmit science from the surfaces of Eve and Duna.
