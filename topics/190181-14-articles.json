After she cleared some of the rubble, she found Johnny dead with a pickaxe in his back.

Since none of the other officers could see the shinymonkey, Touta knew that Betsy had a death note since only those who have touched the notebook could see Gobluk. While he could not convince his superiors that Betsy had Kiraken\u0027s power, subsequent investigation found Betsy\u0027s prints on the pickaxe. That gave the cops probably cause to detain Betsy, who was in possession of a notebook titled \u0022Death Note.\u0022 The arresting officers who grabbed the notebook freaked out when they saw Gobluk and tried to shoot him - but nothing worked. Touta, however, was not surprised as he had dealt with the shinymonkey previously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFurther inspection of the notebook found Johnny\u0027s name and cause of death written in the notebook. Chief Trevor Kerman then asked district attorney to charge Betsy for murder, but Trevor remained skeptical as he was unaware of the exact nature of the death note. In addition to that, all of the arresting officers had been named in several lawsuits and assault charges filed by bystanders for property damage and injuries caused by their bullets\u00A0- and all but one of them (Touta) have been suspected of taking illegal hallucinogenic drugs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrevor Kerman will get hit by a school bus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-02T13:52:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2022 01:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Mars-Bound Hokie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rutabaga22","CreatedById":221143,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-02T14:11:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224150833\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022190181\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221656769889\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022192121\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mars-Bound Hokie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, Mars-Bound Hokie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrevor Kerman will get hit by a school bus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne day Trevor was walking down the street when he saw a psychic.
