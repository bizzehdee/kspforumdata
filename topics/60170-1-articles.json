An idea is to give Jool more vertical layers ,such as high orbit, low orbit, upper Magnetosphere, lower Magnetosphere, upper atmosphere, and lower atmosphere. Maybe even have a \u0022radiation belt\u0022 biome for low and high orbit altitudes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes for the sun. A possible biome for the sun could be an area of which a ship can observe the solar wind in various orbits. A star can be just as interesting of a place as a planet if you think about the science of it.
