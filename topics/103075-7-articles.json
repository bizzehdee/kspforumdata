The cost of hiring more crews increases for each additional crew member in your active roster, that is, hiring your 30th Kerbal is much more expensive than hiring your 5th one. This cost increases based on your current active crew count. That means, for instance, that going through 100 Kerbals would be far less expensive than having a roster with a hundred active ones. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure I like the idea of exponentially increasing costs for hiring kerbals. It doesn\u0027t make any sense from a realism standpoint and I\u0027m not sure how it would improve gameplay unless you\u0027re trying to actively discourage large space stations and interplanetary bases with lots of kerbals. As it is, unless things change dramatically for 1.0, there is no need for more than the starting 3 kerbals to do everything, and actually there is so much science available relative to what you can spend it on that you don\u0027t need to do manned missions at all to buy everything. I can also think of a few situations that break that system, like one way manned missions where you intentionally kill the kerbals at the end to save the cost of bringing them back and to keep your hiring costs low. It seems to me that if you\u0027re going to increase hiring costs, it should only be in response to killing kerbals (i.e. not as many kerbals want to work for you, insurance payouts, etc) or if you can hire more experienced kerbals instead of all of them starting at level 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMax (Maxmaps): Tuesday already? Crud. Been way too busy with the business side of Squad HQ to plan the April 1st thing tomorrow. There might not even be one and that makes me sad in the heart. Besides that, helping out Dan with the 1.0 animation stuff, and making sure all the content from our awesome collaborators gets in the game in an orderly fashion. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s kinda amazing seeing the devs working in \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153beta\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 mode, where they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re just adding small things and doing polish instead of crafting behemoth systems. Kinda like modding their own game, really. Mind you, you have to look past the actual behemoth systems that still had to be made for 1.0, aero is big. Really, really big. You think it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a long way down the road to the chemist\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s, but that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just peanuts to the aero overhaul.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the devnotes since 1.0 was announced have had comments about being ridiculously busy with the business side of things. While I understand that there is a lot of work to be done in releasing a game, I\u0027ve gotten the impression that the business side has been dictating the development schedule since the abrupt transition from 0.25 to 0.90 (i.e. the beta in name only), maybe the devs were overconfident and/or pressured into a release schedule? Of course aero is a huge system, it\u0027s not something you schedule for the end of development. For a 1.0 release, \u0027beta\u0027 mode is the ONLY mode the devs should be working in, all the major systems should be in place and more or less working when you enter beta, much less jump to 1.0. Aero still needs to be in 1.0, no question about that, but the development schedule seems to be a bit rushed from my perspective. As I (and others) have said many times, take the time to do this right and release at least one proper beta update with the new systems in place, not just so we can playtest the game but also so that modders can attempt to break things in their own way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I\u0027m glad to have feedback from the developers and I\u0027m glad to see that the game appears to be progressing well even if I don\u0027t agree with the current development schedule. Looking forward to 1.0, it will be a big step forward for the game and I\u0027m excited to see what the modders will be able to do with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T18:03:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 06:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Damien_The_Unbeliever","CreatedById":129715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T17:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bdito\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bdito\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESorry but I\u0027m not going through 150 posts to find the one line that applies.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, instead you\u0027ll assume that you\u0027re the *first person* to make an observation out of 150 others?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my approach to a large thread: a) read it all, *then* comment, or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E assume others are going to have picked up obvious issues.
