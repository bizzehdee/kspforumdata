Of course my 0.9 designs don\u0027t work, because then I often had to lower the decoupler relative to the CoM to prevent the off axis forces from spinning the stack into my engines. Even in 1.0, my stacks often still hit the rocket at first! For some frustrating reason stacks always seem to sit offset on the radial decoupler by default, but I can fix it if I carefully center the booster using offset mode. After doing that, and aligning the CoM of the booster to the radial decoupler center, it all works wonderfully.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
