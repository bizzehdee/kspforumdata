It is not installed on the drive it is waking. The drive only contains media files. No system or user files on this disk. No reason to access. I\u0027m assuming KSP must be doing some kind of scan of all disks when it starts? Anyone know why this happens and more importantly, if there is a way to stop it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a fresh, un-modded, install of KSP 1.2.2 64bit. Win 7 Ultimate 64. I know this is KSP because every time, at the exact moment I double click the exe file, the hard drive immediately spins up, then goes back to sleep after the set time. I\u0027d be happy to provide any more info that may help.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-29T01:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this only when KSP starts? This sounds more like OS level behavior, doing a quick search you will find this happening to others. Back in the old days I used to have a Mac with 2 drives with their own operating systems and the one that wasn\u0027t being used would spin up annoyingly as well. But, who knows, I could be wrong...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shuggaloaf","CreatedById":166874,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-29T02:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do have random times when my drive will spin up so I am familiar with that whole pain but I think this is unrelated as with other programs I don\u0027t get the drive spinning up when I start them. Now Windows may spin up the drive for no reason when I\u0027m not doing anything at all, but this is very specific in that every single time I start KSP it spins up immediately. No other programs cause this specific type of issue.
