To get the actual pontoon parts, you need to get the whole Firespitter mod. This is a big mod and you probably won\u0027t want much in it. I tend to cull parts out of it until it\u0027s just the pontoons, the electric propeller engines, and a few other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how the pontoons look and attach (this is a prototype boat for the Elcano challenge, not a plane, but the pontoons are the same):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/t8aYde\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8802/17802793309_8980e813ca_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002217802793309_8980e813ca_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 5 types of pontoon parts. Front end, back end (includes rudder), wheel bay, center section, and strut. You start with the strut part, which is a thin slice of pontoon cross-section with a vertical attachment leg. Stick this on the underside of the main vehicle. Then you build the pontoons forwards and backwards from the strut adding whichever of the other parts you need. Then brace the whole thing off with normal struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach pontoon part has a tweakable menu with a slider to adjust buoyancy. The default setting is 50%. Always slide this to 100% for all parts in the pontoon. The wheels can also be tweaked to steer and drive as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the parts themselves are pretty much inescapably bulky and not amenable to retracting due to the need for struts (they\u0027re kinda wobbly without struts). HOWEVER, thanks to ModuleManager, there\u0027s a way to work around this by NOT actually using the Firespitter pontoon parts. The pontoon parts get their properties from a module called FSbuoyancy. Using ModuleManager, you can add this module to any other parts you desire, making those parts float just as well as the pontoons. You can also had FSrudder, so you can steer in the water, FSwheel to stock aircraft wheels to give them rover power and steering, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, you can do this already if you have the Firespitter.dll in your game (this is an extremely useful dll, which is why so many other mods use it). You don\u0027t really need to download the whole mod. But I recommend that you do so you can look at the provided parts and learn how the various modules work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T13:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EProblem is, nowadays they make huge amounts of drag so it\u0027s a pain getting a seaplane SSTO off Kerbin without compromising on its design somehow (like way more power than you\u0027d really like for its size).
