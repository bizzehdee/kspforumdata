It seems as though any rocket that includes a 3.75M decoupler and 3.75M fairing has a high likely-hood of crashing the game. I made some effort to experiment with what causes it. But I have to wait a minute or more between tests for the game to reload. I\u0027ve already spent about an hour and a half: here is what I know:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Crash always occurs when decoupler is activated. Doesn\u0027t matter if it is done through staging or manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Part count seems to affect the likelyhood of a crash. Small rockets normally won\u0027t crash the game. Larger rockets (300ish parts) have an almost 100% rate of crashing the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Deployment of the fairing before/after using the decoupler does not seem to prevent a crash from happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-No crashes when using smaller sized decouplers or fairings\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jarraya","CreatedById":148383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T21:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you still having this issue?
