If you use mods at all these days, you almost certainly have ModuleManager in your Gamedata folder. If you\u0027ve got that, then you can make a cfg file to remove this intensely unrealistic and thoroughly aggravating \u0022feature\u0022 of 1.x. Just copy the code below, name it something like \u0022LVN\\_Heat\\_Fix.cfg\u0022, and stick it somewhere in a folder off Gamedata called \u0022zzz-(Your Name Here)\u0022, so it will be the last folder on the list. \n\n    // LV-N HEAT TWEAKS@PART[nuclearEngine]:FINAL{\t@emissiveConstant = 0.99 // was 0.83, other engines 0.80\t@maxTemp = 4000 // restores old value, up from new stock value of 2500\t@MODULE[ModuleEngines]\t{\t\t@heatProduction = 196 // same as Mainsail, down from stock 432\t}}\n\nThis still produces a lot of heat but you can at least run the LV-N at full power for long burns and, equally important, mount it radially so you can have more than 1 of them on your tug and your tug can have docking ports on both ends. The radial mount has to be the slanted 1.25m nosecone---I-beams and box girders still won\u0027t work. And anything small attached to the big central tank will still get very hot and might explode if you\u0027re not careful. But at least the engine functions as intended.\n\nI have no shame at all in resorting to this self-help \u0022mod\u0022. The real Nerva had solved its heat problems and was ready to fly when the plug got pulled. And because the real NERVA was designed for high Isp, low-thrust, LONG burns were exactly what it was designed for. It\u0027s thus totally ridiculous and unrealistic to make it overheat so fast in stock."},{"CreatedByName":"Voyager275","CreatedById":128829,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T23:06:43Z","Content":"Will my vehicle explode if I leave it floating in space"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T23:23:55Z","Content":"Why are people always going for modding the game...
