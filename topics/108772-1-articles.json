If you use mods at all these days, you almost certainly have ModuleManager in your Gamedata folder. If you\u0027ve got that, then you can make a cfg file to remove this intensely unrealistic and thoroughly aggravating \u0022feature\u0022 of 1.x. Just copy the code below, name it something like \u0022LVN_Heat_Fix.cfg\u0022, and stick it somewhere in a folder off Gamedata called \u0022zzz-(Your Name Here)\u0022, so it will be the last folder on the list. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E// LV-N HEAT TWEAKS\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[nuclearEngine]:FINAL\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\t@emissiveConstant = 0.99 // was 0.83, other engines 0.80\u003Cbr\u003E\t@maxTemp = 4000 // restores old value, up from new stock value of 2500\u003Cbr\u003E\t@MODULE[ModuleEngines]\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t@heatProduction = 196 // same as Mainsail, down from stock 432\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis still produces a lot of heat but you can at least run the LV-N at full power for long burns and, equally important, mount it radially so you can have more than 1 of them on your tug and your tug can have docking ports on both ends. The radial mount has to be the slanted 1.25m nosecone---I-beams and box girders still won\u0027t work.

The real Nerva had solved its heat problems and was ready to fly when the plug got pulled.
