In Kerbin gravity, this happens even to quite small rovers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis behaviour is nothing new; KSP has always acted like this. But it\u0026#39;s an issue that is especially problematic for the new cargo bays. They\u0026#39;re designed to carry cargo that is likely to leave and reenter the bay during a mission, and spaceplanes frequently operate on higher-gravity worlds. Without a mod like KAS, it\u0026#39;s impossible to resecure a strutted cargo.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can work around it with belly-docking tricks and such, but those are a complicated PITA to get right.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, how about it, Squad? There must be some way to give the cargo bays a properly solid floor.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T05:02:40Z","Content":"\nAgree fully.

I mean, when there\u0026#39;s a cargo rolling into the plane\u0026#39;s cargo bay there are people who secure it.

If you like building boats like me, you\u0026#39;ll know to add lots of struts, and to strategically place the panels you are using to build it with. Otherwise, the deck and sides just start sagging in on itself and going through itself. The only problem is, unless you are using wing panels, the strut ends stick out and you have a spotted ship, and because when multiple ships are docked, the game thinks they are the one ship. \u003Cbr\u003E\nTL;DR, Ships cannot collide with themselves, resulting in pain.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T03:34:33Z","Content":"\nFerram dealt with this a year ago: \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027ferram4\u0027][CENTER][B][SIZE=4]The Colliders Strike Back[/SIZE][/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n------------------[/CENTER]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]What it does:[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis disables an optimization / improvement made early in KSP\u0026#39;s history that disabled all intra-vessel part collisions. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nParts will not collide with themselves (to avoid issues with landing gear or cargo bays that are dependent on this functioning well), but will collide with other parts on the vessel where they previously did not.
