In this pic im holding down steer left and the rover does nothing (there is a very very slight movement, but it is not enough to change course at all)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Yssn74F\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Yssn74Fl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Yssn74Fl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThem I let go of the throttle while still holding the steering, the second the speed drops below 40m/s steering is re-enabled and (not surprisingly) the rover flips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/lJb9HaN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lJb9HaNl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lJb9HaNl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing this is to do with the way steering is reduced at higher speeds. That is a fine mechanic, but this is a very sharp cut off and means at 40\u002Bm/s you have no way of adjusting the rovers heading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this is a bug as you say. If it\u0027s an intended safety feature it actually makes things worse; obviously steering hard at speed will make you roll, but you could still make little adjustments. This means that you are inclined to hold down the steering hard and then when it suddenly kicks back in you are bound to flip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
