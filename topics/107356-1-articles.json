You will only slow down at approximately 1 local g. On Mun and Minmus, that is quite slow...\n\nEDIT: on review, it appears you are talking about breaking on Kerbin...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T05:38:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 05:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87**"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T05:45:17Z","Content":"I suspect those large wheels produce more torque when active than their brakes do...

I find it useful to use reverse thrust while braking with such monsters.\n\nBe advised, however, that these big wheels have like zero traction on on low-gravity worlds, no matter how heavy the rover. I just tried using them with a large ore miner on Ike that weight 67 tons fully loaded and only 4 wheels, so the ground pressure was pretty high. Still, the thing would slide sideways down even the gentlest of slopes, and accelerated uncontrollably if pointed up or down the slope, despite both brakes and opposite thrust.\n\nSo I\u0027m inclined to believe that these wheels are pretty much useless."},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T06:25:15Z","Content":"Does the braking force change depending on whether steering is locked?

Is that what you mean?\n\nIt\u0027s not a skidding thing, it\u0027s as if steering gets completely disabled above a certain speed and then suddenly gets re-enabled as you drop below that speed.\n\nThis is my very simple rover for testing this; (in a 100% stock install, the only change is to keybindings so that in docking mode W also does translate forwards)\n\n[![Xv4e5xTl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Xv4e5xTl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/Xv4e5xT)\n\nAt that speed (39m/s) I\u0027m still able to steer, you can see the rover tipping slightly. obviously if I was to steer hard it would roll right over, but little steering adjustments can still be made.\n\nThen just after at 40m/s the steering suddenly locks out. In this pic im holding down steer left and the rover does nothing (there is a very very slight movement, but it is not enough to change course at all)\n\n[![Yssn74Fl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Yssn74Fl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/Yssn74F)\n\nThem I let go of the throttle while still holding the steering, the second the speed drops below 40m/s steering is re-enabled and (not surprisingly) the rover flips.\n\n[![lJb9HaNl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lJb9HaNl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/lJb9HaN)\n\nI\u0027m guessing this is to do with the way steering is reduced at higher speeds. That is a fine mechanic, but this is a very sharp cut off and means at 40\u002Bm/s you have no way of adjusting the rovers heading.\n\nI hope this is a bug as you say. If it\u0027s an intended safety feature it actually makes things worse; obviously steering hard at speed will make you roll, but you could still make little adjustments. This means that you are inclined to hold down the steering hard and then when it suddenly kicks back in you are bound to flip."}]}
