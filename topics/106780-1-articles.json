Launched a small rocket \u0022Progress-1\u0022 towards the KSC complex. Approaching the complex at a few hundred meters in altitude, I shutdown the engines and staged (dropping the engine and fuel tank) ... and then after a few moments I deployed the chutes in an effort to (try to) land on my target. When the ejected engine and fuel tank hit the ground an explosion was heard - and then a fraction of a second later the explosion began repeating endlessly and the game froze. There was no exiting the game, Esc did nothing... I pressed the \u0027Windows key\u0027 and got to the main Win 8.1 screen and then attempted to go back to the desktop... at that point, the system displayed a message that KSP was not responding. I had the system force the close of KSP.\n\n*No crash file was created.*\n\n**Screenshot:**\n\nI did not get a screenshot (*sorry*).\n\n**Files:**\n\n[persistent](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ni5o3jsecvbp84r/persistent-2015-05-01.sfs?dl=0)\n\n[craft](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8g4ntx09fbz0qd9/Progress-1-2015-05-01.craft?dl=0)\n\n[output_log](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cendvb5odm57csu/output_log-2015-05-01.txt?dl=0)\n\n**System:**\n\nASUS laptop, i7-4500U cpu @ 2.4ghz, 8gb mem, Intel embedded graphics with additional Nvidia Geforce GT 745M card.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T03:21:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 03:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordFerret**\n  \ncan\u0027t spell"}]}
