Jettisoned boosted fuel storage works excellent. Having outer tanks and engines that feed your core engine does wonders for most stages. Especially for landers like you said. A grouping of outer engines when landed then has the bonus of getting that initial liftoff push. On that topic, the smaller tank groupings and engines work really nice for that I find. My favorite lander atm for the large command module has a half 2m tank with the small 2m engine. Around it 4 of the 400u tanks with the small 1m engine and fuel tanks running to centre. It works very well for a 1m lander and ensures the full 2m tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PhoenixCraftLTD","CreatedById":42778,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-28T15:27:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Secular_Response\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Secular_Response\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat is a huge amount of fuel on that lander.
