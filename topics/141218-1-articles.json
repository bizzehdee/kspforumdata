In 1.0.5 to \u0022safe\u0022 opening speed was too slow on Duna because of a wonky way that number was calculated by the game. They fixed that for 1.1, so now drogues can open much faster on Duna, but the atmosphere didn\u0027t really change (AFAIK).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, that doesn\u0027t really help your situation, just thought I\u0027d let you know. What I would try is once you start seeing your velocity slow the most during reentry (when your deceleration is greatest) fire your engine just until it\u0027s safe for the drogue. Then you should be able to open it and kill your engine, and the chute will hopefully do the rest.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also would be careful about setting your PE too high, 25-30 km sounds right to me, but that also depends on how high your AP is.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-05T02:03:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat changed in 1.1 was that the drag of MK1 parts got reduced by a quarter, which makes a big difference if you use a lot of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can\u0027t fit airbrakes, how about a few control fins?
