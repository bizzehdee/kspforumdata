I don\u0027t think refining of broken features should cease just because people are too afraid to change.

Your statement is a fair representation of something I am going to rant about now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[rant]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the webpage for KSP, you will see, \u0022KSP is a game where the players create and manage their own space program.\u0022 It does NOT say it\u0027s a spaceship simulator, a flight simulator, or an space-based resourcing simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is an ongoing, maddening clamor on the main forum page for Squad to implement feature x, because without it the game is broken. I am heartily sick and tired of it because for each and every \u0022Gimme NOW\u0022 feature, there is a mod available that meets that need to some extent. Advanced aerodynamics is a perfect example. We all know that the current aerodynamic model will be updated. It\u0027s called a placeholder for a reason! This poll is useless because we are going to get better aerodynamics as soon as the devs decide it\u0027s time to work on it. Ferram\u0027s question is far more relevant: \u0022What bits of aerodynamic modeling should be included when the devs replace the placeholder?\u0022 This would allow a good discussion, instead of this divisive all-or-none.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, when someone questions the advisability of implementing feature x for everyone as an in-game mechanic, or points out that feature x is already available as a mod, the response is, \u0022Yeah, but the game is supposed to have it. Look, see how cool it is?\u0022 I am sure you think it\u0027s cool. That doesn\u0027t mean that everyone does. Believe me, if I wanted more accurate modeling of aerodynamics I already would have installed FAR. If I wanted to manage air and food, I would have installed IonForge. If I wanted to design realistic spacecraft and aircraft, I would do so. I do want resourcing, so I have installed Kethane. See? I have the option I want, and don\u0027t bother with the ones I don\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad has to concentrate their small development team ensuring that their game is fun for everyone, not just the subset of the community who are frothing for feature x. So please, please stop whingeing for these niche features to be implemented in the game on the main forum page. Put them into the Suggestions and Development page where they belong. Better yet, go to Addon Request and Support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/rant]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhew! I feel sooo much better now that I\u0027ve gotten that off my chest. I\u0027m heading back to the game and get my science station set up around Minmus.
