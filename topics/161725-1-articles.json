On steam someone had suggested this maybe be due to audio drivers, stopping the \u0022AudioSrv\u0022 service in Windows task manager -\u0026gt; services did prevent the crash but it also led to no sound, updated my audio drivers for my motherboard, uninistalled and deleted any unused audio devices \u0026amp; drivers too. Are there any known fixes to this? I have multiple PC\u0027s and it works fine on the bad one and crashes on the good one, not cool! Just as a side note I have tried reverting to older versions on Steam, verified my files and reinstalled it etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\nThe log can be found here:\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pasted.co/f46451b2\u0022 style=\u0022color:#005782;\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pasted.co/f46451b2\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Samssonart","CreatedById":57129,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-07T19:38:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease also tell us your hardware configuration.
