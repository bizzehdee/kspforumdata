Allow me the moment to fill you in on what you have missed. We started our new space program without any major issues. Well, maybe some issues. Jeb, as you know is a little wild, vehemently volunteered to pilot the first sub orbital flight. The launch was a little shaky on liftoff but smoothed out into his gravity turn. After a brisk splash down Jeb returned babbling about wanting to go again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome time later my team started putting together small probes to investigate the Mun. There were some great pictures from the flyby of the surface, however, someone let Jeb and Bob on the controls and they flew the probe at a two thousand meter altitude above the Mun\u0027s surface. The boss was not happy. Alex pitched the idea of sending a probe to another planet. He wanted to send one to Duna and return. Unfortunately the good idea fairy reared its ugly head and three other teams got a hand in the flight path planning. The probe launched spectacularly and set in a high orbit around Kerbin. It\u0027s first task was another flyby of the Mun with a follow-on flyby of Minmus. David\u0027s team made bad calculations that lead to an many course corrections and a lot of wasted fuel to get the intercept trajectory corrected. This is where we started to have problems. After Minmus the probe was scheduled to make another orbit around Kerbin to slingshot the craft into position for the transfer to Duna, but due to David\u0027s oversight there was not enough time to make the slingshot and still be in the proper position. A last minute decision was made to scrub the Duna flyby and attempt to intercept with Kerbol. Tensions were high when the call came down to start the burn. Unfortunately there wasn\u0027t enough fuel to achieve an impact trajectory and now we have a dead multi-million kerb tin can on a wild elliptical orbit and no one can do anything about it. It should go without saying that David\u0027s team was reprimanded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second attempt at a Duna flyby was made, but this time they strapped on more fuel tanks and solid boosters at Jeb\u0027s insistence. Again the launch was flawless and the transition away from Kerbin was perfect. We waited a long time and watched the probe as it silently drifted around Kerbol and closer to Duna. About five days before we were supposed to start seeing a small red dot from the probe I discovered a problem. It was my shift at the monitoring station when I witnessed all the batteries suddenly drain and I lost all control. The probe was just lifeless. I called in the big think tank guys to try and troubleshoot the issue and that\u0027s when we saw the problem. Alex\u0027s team only put solar panels on one side of the probe and now that side was facing away from Kerbol. A projection was made and we saw that the probe would not regain power until three weeks after it left Duna. Again, Alex was devastated while Jeb made comments about letting him oversee the probe construction next time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently working on another Duna probe but my team is trying to convince the Space Committee to authorize an autonomous lander to visit Eve as that planet\u0027s transition window is coming up. We already have a working prototype of the lander built but Jeb keeps saying something about \u0022more cow bell.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will write again when I have time, but for now I need to calculate how many parachutes I need for a smooth landing on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour friend,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJimmy Kerman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChief Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta Team\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nonya0992","CreatedById":65987,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T22:25:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys, if I could do something better in the telling of my story could you please post to this thread?

Not the least of these problems would be the need to rewrite and reprint an untold number of works, otherwise we would be presenting future students with a lot of words and phrases that would no longer be valid English. Another problem would be that if we removed such words we would no longer have a need for Thesauri and have the problem of deciding which word to keep, or which definitions of words to keep.

Secondary to this, in the case of this story (a letter to a friend) it would make sense for some grammatical or spelling errors to be present (though this is, as I believe I proved, not an error) as it may be an indication of how the character uses language, and not necessarily an honest mistake on the part of the author. Such a device has been used in fiction many times, where a character\u0027s dialogue is written intentionally with errors both grammatical and spelling to indicate a character with less education than other characters in the same story. I believe Mark Twain made extensive use of such a device in \u003Cem\u003EThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for clarifying! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I agree that sometimes \u0022as\u0022 is better than \u0022because\u0022 in describing causality; e.g., \u0022I so foully farted as to clear the room\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Might the dictionary mean that replacing \u0022because\u0022 with \u0022as\u0022 would is the third best use of \u0022as\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I also agree that whatever the validity of \u0022as,\u0022 an error may have been intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the purpose of each word, and synonyms go it is quite true that many words in English have exactly the same, or nearly the same meaning (this is the definition of a synonym). Technically we could remove several words from English, we could even remove some letters from the Latin Alphabet if we wanted, however this would cause several problems. Not the least of these problems would be the need to rewrite and reprint an untold number of works, otherwise we would be presenting future students with a lot of words and phrases that would no longer be valid English. Another problem would be that if we removed such words we would no longer have a need for Thesauri and have the problem of deciding which word to keep, or which definitions of words to keep. This would also make fiction and poetry in particular a lot more bland.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Words that have nearly the same meaning have different meanings, which we should respect\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Down with X, C, and Q!
