Considering the picture is a lunar eclipse, I went hunting for some relationship between the numbers and eclipses. I found that if you take the date of any solar or lunar eclipse and add 6585 days to it and you will accurately predict a subsequent eclipse of the same kind that will closely resemble the one 18 years earlier.\n\nCertainly interesting, but am I on the right track? Who knows. hopefully with more research, I will find out.\n\nEdit:\n\nOk, so apparently that time range is called a saros cycle and is 6585 days long.\n\nWith a little help from twitter, I found this:\n\n![1a8a4bba04.png](http://puu.sh/hjmG8/1a8a4bba04.png)\n\nThe 8th Saros cycle showing the number of penubral, partial and total eclipses.\n\nso there we have it.
