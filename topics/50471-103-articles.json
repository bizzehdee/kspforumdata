That said, I do plan on revisiting this a little more later now that I\u0027ve got a nice grayscale image and a good idea of what the coloration of the surface should be. As for the height map, I pulled a displacement map from the surface image and then gave it some variation with some elevation multipliers based off of the incomplete satellite data. The end result, unfortunately, is that the surface features are a somewhat muddled, though they do exist to a decent degree if you know where to look, but then again, Mercury is quite smooth to begin with compared to the other planets, so this may have been the case even if we had full data. Again, that being said, once I\u0027ve had a chance to work on the other planets, I\u0027ll probably be revisiting this to see if I can figure out a better process that retains some more detail.

This also means that, thanks to the composition of the planet, high points end up with the same coloration as impact sites, meaning they either all have to be craters or all have to be hills. I was thinking for a little while about mirroring the half of the planet we do have a digital elevation model for and then going through some contortions in shuffling and blending to make it look like unique terrain across the whole surface, but abandoned that idea because of its departure from the real thing when I have a really good full surface mosaic for the color map. That being said, I may revisit that idea in the next few days / weeks to see if it produces something realistic enough to pass for Mercury at least, while at the same time improving the surface appearance to a worthwhile degree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the issues with the 8192 maps, they really seem to be system specific as only a few people seem to be having the issue. That being said, I thought the plan all along was to package the 4096 maps and then offer the 8192 maps as an optional upgrade? I\u0027ve done some testing with the reduced maps and while they do degrade the surface somewhat and you can more clearly see the tiling, I think they\u0027ll do fine for most people. Also, don\u0027t forget that once we get at the generic PQS loader (how\u0027s that coming along btw?) we should be able to improve the appearance of the quads below the height resolution. The only area where I might be concerned is the color maps. This is mostly because I\u0027ve been using photoreal mosaics and I\u0027m not sure how well they will hold up as the resolution decreases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a different note, since I\u0027m just about ready to put this thing out into the wild, how would you recommend I go about the release? I get the impression from your response to Andrey that you might be thinking about rolling at least the lower resolution maps into the RSS package in some way, in which case, would I just be sending them off to you to be put on Github? Or should I just put them up myself and then go from there?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T09:24:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I found something interesting when I started looking at Earth elevation data. The height map you used includes ocean bottom terrain (deepest point ~10.911km), but you only offset the height map to -2150m. Then, you\u0027ve got the deformity set at 17300m, which is not quite high enough to account for the total distance from the Earth\u0027s lowest point (Challenger deep ~10.911 below the surface) to the highest point (Everest ~8850m). Anyway correcting all of this to an offset of -10.911km and a deformity of 19.761km increased the available terrain above the surface by about 2500m, increasing terrain definition, especially at high elevations and putting KSC in a 2.5km hole in the ground. That all being said, I\u0027m downloading elevation data right now that ignores the ocean depths , giving more definition to the land. I\u0027m not 100% sure just yet how to actually handle the oceans at this point, though I\u0027m thinking about just giving the whole map a small offset (\u0026lt;500m) on output from the mapping program to ensure the minimum of vertical space is eaten up by a part of the world we\u0027ll never see, at least in KSP...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Correcting for subsurface elevation seems to have killed the ocean some how.

Apparently the ocean doesn\u0027t respond the way I thought I would when you shift the land around it. I figured that giving a 500m drop off at the coast and then giving the height map a -500 offset would simply shift the land down while the ocean elevation stayed the same, instead, the ocean ended up at -500 and KSC at 53 where it always was. The result is that I have an ocean at the bottom of a 500m drop which is full of \u0022islands\u0022 because its only about 50m deep at best and the PQS is popping up through the water.

I\u0027ve been using 50, which often turns out pretty nice, but it also clearly exaggerates the terrain quite a bit when in reality the surface looks almost flat from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did some poking around with both maps to see what differences there were between the two, and there are some that are noticeable, but that being said, I found an interesting effect where, because there were more shades available, and thus more detail, certain areas lost their shape somewhat. Whatever the case, I think it doesn\u0027t make sense at this point to go for the alternate height map as there just isn\u0027t enough difference between the two to make the change worthwhile, after all, aside from gentler terrain by the coast of Florida, you\u0027d have to explore quite a bit to get the benefit of 33m/shade terrain vs. 40m/shade terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fleet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fleet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am having a weird issue with the high res moon maps where the moon is being lit from 90 degrees off from where the sun is.

The original pressureCurve data came from a spreadsheet I devised to automatically create pressureCurve data in a format that I could easily cut and paste into the config file. The Karman line is too abrupt a transition to go from atmosphere to vacuum. At that altitude it\u0027s still too dense and we wanted an atmosphere that faded out into space more gradually than that. It was a little further out originally but Nathan asked me to cut it to 180 so that players could go off-rails at 100nmi, which was the parking orbit used by Apollo astronauts on their way to the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: (I\u0027m not even sure the Karman line actually entered into our conversations though I did calculate it on my spreadsheet for reference purposes to compare to the final cutoff)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit #2: I think what\u0027s in there currently was computed by Metaphor based on more current data than what I used.
