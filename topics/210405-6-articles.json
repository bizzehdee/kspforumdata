Here\u0027s some reasons why I think heatshields work:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUnless you rely on atmospheric capture, you can recover from failing with your heat shields by reloading to before re-entry. So you rarely have to reload to a long time before, and you can usually salvage by either refueling and going into the atmosphere very slowly or by rescuing your Kerbals. So most of the time you can recover from heatshield failure.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere\u0027s a definite reward involved with heatshields, in that good heatshields allows you to save delta-v using atmospheric capture, which is a really cool moment in the game when you pull it off. So there\u0027s a carrot as well as a stick.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThey are also cheap and relatively light weight, so it is extremely easy to add to your existing designs when you have forgotten it.\u00A0 So it\u0027s a recoverable failure from a rocket design perspective as well.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast I don\u0027t think everything that adds realism is good - it needs to interact with the rest of the game in a good manner, as heatshields arguably do. For example, minute long airlock cycles are realistic, but how many people want them in the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question is still exactly life support would be implemented, and I didn\u0027t really see many proposals which don\u0027t essentially boil down to a mass tax. Failures would likely occur during transfers, potentially making you miss your insertion burns, so it is much harder to recover from. There\u0027s no similar reward to heat shields. If you miss it at the design stage you have to add several tons of mass (admittedly, this depends on the implementation). So I am still doubtful this would improve the game - but again, we are talking without knowing how the system would look like exactly. Maybe the designers thought of a way it would be fun. I just know that to me a simple mass tax with death or craft control as the consequence of failure wouldn\u0027t be to me. Fuel is already the main limiting resource and when you run out of that you can at least make sure you end up stranded on a planet or in a relatively nice rendezvous orbit - you have options to mitigate your failure with fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224201265\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210405\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221669068407\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223516\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wheehaw Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Wheehaw Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think we\u2019re thinking about reward versus punishment all wrong. \u00A0If we define reward as \u201CKerbals arrive alive at destination, mission accomplished break out the champagne\u201D and punishment as \u201CKerbals die in any of the numerous ways in which space travel can and will kill you oh god the paperwork\u201D, then we realize that \u00A0punishment is just part of the fun, and that KSP has always been pretty punitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, but 95% of the time you can safe your Kerbals by a simple reload, though they might need rescue or have to abort the mission.

First off, you are most likely to first experience it very early in the game, where you only have a single flight at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the late game most people - especially those a bit newer on the game - do not rely on aerocapture to have enough delta-v. So on late game interplanetary missions, if you burn up in the atmosphere, you can usually load the last save game before your de-orbiting burn. Then you either change the mission parameters or try to somehow get your ship intact through the atmosphere regardless, which is often doable if you have a little of delta-v to spare.\u00A0If you choose to rely on aerocapture, that\u0027s a conscious player choice for a high risk, high reward maneuver.\u00A0 And it interacts strongly with the orbital mechanics, i.e. you really need good heat shields when coming in from a retrograde orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint being HS is unlikely to lead to a loss of a significant amount of gameplay time, unless you make a deliberate choice.

But it could be worth it if LS offers interesting gameplay. For example, failing orbital mechanics can definitely lead to catastrophes. Here it\u0027s worth it because interaction with the mechanics through gameplay is the single most important element of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA LS mass tax still doesn\u0027t sound interesting to me. To give a stupid analogy, having to go on the toilet would make cRPGs both more complex and realistic. And no one is calling for that. The very fact that LS would need to be generously abstracted is what makes it bad gameplay.

Here\u0027s some reasons why I think heatshields work:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUnless you rely on atmospheric capture, you can recover from failing with your heat shields by reloading to before re-entry. So you rarely have to reload to a long time before, and you can usually salvage by either refueling and going into the atmosphere very slowly or by rescuing your Kerbals. So most of the time you can recover from heatshield failure.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere\u0027s a definite reward involved with heatshields, in that good heatshields allows you to save delta-v using atmospheric capture, which is a really cool moment in the game when you pull it off. So there\u0027s a carrot as well as a stick.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThey are also cheap and relatively light weight, so it is extremely easy to add to your existing designs when you have forgotten it.\u00A0 So it\u0027s a recoverable failure from a rocket design perspective as well.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast I don\u0027t think everything that adds realism is good - it needs to interact with the rest of the game in a good manner, as heatshields arguably do. For example, minute long airlock cycles are realistic, but how many people want them in the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question is still exactly life support would be implemented, and I didn\u0027t really see many proposals which don\u0027t essentially boil down to a mass tax. Failures would likely occur during transfers, potentially making you miss your insertion burns, so it is much harder to recover from. There\u0027s no similar reward to heat shields. If you miss it at the design stage you have to add several tons of mass (admittedly, this depends on the implementation). So I am still doubtful this would improve the game - but again, we are talking without knowing how the system would look like exactly. Maybe the designers thought of a way it would be fun. I just know that to me a simple mass tax with death or craft control as the consequence of failure wouldn\u0027t be to me. Fuel is already the main limiting resource and when you run out of that you can at least make sure you end up stranded on a planet or in a relatively nice rendezvous orbit - you have options to mitigate your failure with fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, but 95% of the time you can safe your Kerbals by a simple reload, though they might need rescue or have to abort the mission. It\u0027s hard to end up in a dead man walking situation where you suddenly realize the craft was doomed for the last in-game year, and there is nothing you can do to salvage the situation. With life support it is easy to imagine a situation where you\u0027d have to reload a long time or accept dead kerbals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree. Realism for the sake of realism isn\u0027t good game design. Parachutes and heatshields have benefits. Adding life support doesn\u0027t make anything easier. Maybe if you could turn some life support biproduct into resources it would be nice (Excrement concrete?) or make life support benefit kerbals\u0027 performance in some way it would make things better, but no benefits would make the game worse.

If coming with resources with an small chance with colonies.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nLife support is resources. I\u0027m pretty sure an colony is able to produce enough life support\u00A0 and\u00A0 food is the hard thing to make, before this its not an colony its an base like the bases we make in KSP 1.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou also need enough greenhouses for the base to expand, and extra food can be used on ships. If you have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E of fuel and oxidizer you also has oxygen and water.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this reason they might just use food for life support. I like TAC life support as to recycle water and air you need 500 kg modules for 8 kerbals so you want it on bases or larger ships.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDownside is that it don\u0027t factor in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E. other mods adds greenhouses but water might be an issue.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne obvious fix to avoid kerbals from dying if life support runs out is to simply have them going into coma. To recover them you have to bring them to Kerbin or an colony.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso if your starship\u00A0 fails then you start braking at destination because the empty tanks you dropped had struts holding the ship together. You are 10 LY out and at .2c,\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nRescuing them will be interesting.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHad two issues with life support, first was in an game Jeb going around the Mun, forgot to add extra life support, modified it to an free return rather than entering orbit and cheated and added more resources.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSecond was rescuing an kerbal in retrograde orbit around the sun between Dress and Jool. Made an monster with an 2 km/s chemical stage then 1\u002B8\u00A0asparagus with LV-N and an chemical upper stage for 20 km/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGrabbed the kerbals capsule and wanted to set up an minimum energy free return trajectory then I noticed I has only 100 days of life support.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I needed to reach Kebin in 100 days, luckily I had 10 Km/s left and used 8.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSecond problem was catching the keral, simply use an second of the 20 km/s rockets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
