This doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense to me, but I can confirm that the parts all return to the game once I remove TextureReplacer. There are no noteworthy flags or reports in the debug log (that I can see) indicating problems, and the models do seem to actually load at startup, but they just don\u0027t show up in the game.
