I could come in handy when the economy is implemented. I would call it public service, public service being that the science you collected would be spended on something else beside space travel. Over the year spacetravel has brought forth many clevver inventions that make our lives better each day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there would be a new menu in the R\u0026amp;D facility that lets you compare what you would get in terms of money for trading in science to go to a diffrent cause versus what you would get if you invested in unlocking new things.

But scientific knowledge is non-rivalrous, just because you \u0022spend\u0022 it to design better rocket parts doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t be used for other public goods. I imagine that there will be other ways to trade between science and money once the economy is implemented, like in the types of missions selected. For example, mission taking tourists to space station means big money but no science, mission collecting samples from Mun means not so much money but more science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T20:50:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CyclonicTuna\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CyclonicTuna\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was thinking, would it be a good idea to implement a feature that lets you trade in science for money?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrency exchanging was announced in an interview on another website.
