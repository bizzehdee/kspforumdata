At the moment I have a crew of 4 looking after it. I have fitted it with MapSat, MecJeb, a full Kethane system and a few other toys. The only part my picture does not show is the DSM Reactor and Ion drive. The Engine section looks very cool. If I get good feed back I will upload more pics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt launch it is close to 900 Tons and has over 300 parts. I also put a lot of time in to creating the delivery system for the rocket and it fly\u0027s itself using MecJeb with no issues (Its very slow to turn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i589.photobucket.com/albums/ss331/SWGUNION/KSP/screenshot14.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot14.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Research Center below can be used as a mining facility, Kethane storage facility or a refueling station. It also has the ability to land on Kerbin. It can house 18 Kerbs and comes with a DEMV and all the toys the WSS has. MapSat etc.... It can make it to Mun and land within 10 Hrs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also attached the Dynasat adapter to the DEMV. The one that doubles as a decoupler. Once you activate the DEMV and then the Adapter, It turns the DEMV from Debris into an actual ship so you can jump to it like a normal ship using the map or tracking station. Considering it size, it actually fly\u0027s like a small ship due to the way it is built and the way I managed to displace the weight of the ship. I also had to be very creative with the delivery system on this ship and is my largest build to date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i589.photobucket.com/albums/ss331/SWGUNION/KSP/screenshot25.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot25.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i589.photobucket.com/albums/ss331/SWGUNION/KSP/screenshot31.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot31.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i589.photobucket.com/albums/ss331/SWGUNION/KSP/screenshot29.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot29.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i589.photobucket.com/albums/ss331/SWGUNION/KSP/screenshot32.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot32.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for checking out my ships and if anyone would like to use my ships or use the mas a base design.
