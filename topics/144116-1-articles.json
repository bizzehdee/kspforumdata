The domes are nice, but yeah you would need to make the glass pretty dang thick, and then there\u0027s the problem of maintenance on the glass. You can\u0027t just *poof* the glass and fix it. However, you might just need 2 very large layers of glass (oh... probably 10 feet on each.) seperated by a human sized or larger space.
