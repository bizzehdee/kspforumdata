They weren\\\u0027t even sure it was possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey had found a planet. Or rather they had found a planet capable of sustaining life, and it was close. Relatively close anyway. Galactically speaking, it was right next door. It had water, and air, and dry land. Little else was known about this planet, designated R7h. Some speculated that the irregular dark patches that could be found scattered around R7h may even be cities. So, an expedition was planned to go and find out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this endeavor to succeed, new technologies would have to be invented. They decided to stop mucking about with the unreliable science of cryogenics, and came up with something a bit less invasive. They dubbed it \u0027animated twilight\u0027. It was something a bit more like a medical coma, and certainly a lot less invasive than freezing one\\\u0027s body solid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor propulsion, they decided not to get designs from overly clever high school students, and paid some actual engineers to come up with something appropriate. Something efficient and powerful. The engineers, who had been until now writing papers on metal fatigue and designing beer cannons, jumped at the opportunity to pay off some student loans finally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar technology benefitted the most from this project. As the flight of the ship would take them farther from any star as anyone had ever been before, they finally got around to boosting the effectiveness of standard solar cells. They also came up with a new type of algae-based battery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe approval of the mission, and of the new projects, and new technologies boosted the vigor and public interest of the space program which had been waning in recent years. Exploration had been more or less put on the back burner in favor of mining projects, and this discovery would perhaps get things back on track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, three men were selected from hundreds of applicants. They were not picked solely based on physical prowess, or intelligence - though they certainly were factors. But the theory that there just may be intelligent life meant that whoever was sent would also have to have some diplomatic abilities. The ones chosen were smart, and well conditioned physically of course, but most importantly, they were nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new ship designs worked better than anyone expected. The crew was safely encased in their animated twilight couches, the new ion drives were humming away, and the solar cells and algae batteries were supplying more than enough electricity for three men having a thirty-seven year daydream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGround control and in fact the whole world waited patiently as the years ticked by. Biometric telemetry was surprisingly stable for the entire trip. The only hiccup was when an asteroid decided to spend some time directly in the path of the radio feed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy and by, time ground along - as it tends to do, and the crew were eventually awakened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Have you ever had a nightmare you couldn\\\u0027t wake up from?\u0027 asked the pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Not since I was a kid,\u0027 answered the science officer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Well, this one lasted for about twelve years. It was about how we found some aliens who imprisoned us and kept us as pets - after they found out we were no good to eat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Hmm,\u0027 responded the science officer. \u0027Sounds like you shouldn\\\u0027t have eaten before you got in that pod.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Now that\\\u0027s a good idea,\u0027 intoned the captain. \u0027I haven\\\u0027t eaten in nearly forty years. Checklist and then food.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning through the checklist showed no major issues. All t\\\u0027s were crossed, and only a couple of the i\\\u0027s were missing their dots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Now then,\u0027 said the captain, rubbing his now full belly. \u0027Let\\\u0027s get us a look at that planet.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pilot began preparations for low orbit, and the science officer trained his instruments upon this strange new world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027It\\\u0027s so much like home,\u0027 he said. \u0027Captain, you need to see this.\u0027 As the captain stepped up behind the science officer, his breath caught in his throat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Get me mission control,\u0027 he said, rushing to his seat. \u0027We are not alone - repeat: not alone in the universe anymore. There is life on R7h, and they are sentient. They have cities. They are definitely intelligent. And get this Huston, they are little green men!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pluto100","CreatedById":26442,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-13T01:49:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool story!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshmo","CreatedById":10280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-13T05:25:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.
