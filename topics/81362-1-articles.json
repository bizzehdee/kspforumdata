LEISA is derived from a similar instrument on the EO-1 mission. The second instrument is an ultraviolet imaging spectrometer, Alice. Alice resolves 1,024 wavelength bands in the far and extreme ultraviolet (from 50\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153180 nm), over 32 view fields. Its goal is to view the atmospheric makeup of Pluto. This Alice is derived from an Alice on the Rosetta mission. Ralph, designed afterwards, was named after Alice\u0027s husband on The Honeymooners. Ralph and Alice are names, not acronyms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this article is accurate, then the answer is yes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T01:49:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has two visible light cameras. The narrow-angle camera, LORRI, is used for long-range observations and is black and white. The wide-angle camera, Ralph, is in color. The spacecraft used LORRI at Jupiter, and the pictures we\u0027re getting now of Pluto and Charon orbiting each other are taken with LORRI.
