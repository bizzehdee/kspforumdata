I came up with a way to carry a rover within the stack of a more or less normal rocket:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rUlEh2u.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rUlEh2u.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s made from a pair of quad adapters and a lot of small cubic girders. A Jr port holds the rover in place by its back end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v2iLQ9i.png\u0022 alt=\u0022v2iLQ9i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFour small decouplers allow the rear of the frame to be jettisoned while descending so that the rover is free to be deployed after the ship has landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CNfZWYJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CNfZWYJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the port holding the rover is decoupled, and it drops on its nose. It hits with the stack of cubic girders first which kicks it back onto its wheels, ready to rove.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ThaVZHR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ThaVZHR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had strapped rovers to the side of ships in past, or made them out of hab modules which were just part of the stack, but this struck me as a more elegant solution; at least it stays within the outline of the upper stage this way. It can also be transfered from one ship to another because it has Sr ports at each end. I also successfully rigged it as a parachute drop from altitude and used sepatrons to blow the one half of the frame away after touching down so the rover could be deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-04T23:22:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2014 11:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by JayKay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T01:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice frame; well built. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re after elegant, though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Kerbodyne%2025/Kerbodyne%20Bushranger/screenshot51_zpseb502432.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot51_zpseb502432.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90747-Kerbodyne-SSTO-Division-Omnibus-Thread?p=1504987\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1504987\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90747-Kerbodyne-SSTO-Division-Omnibus-Thread?p=1504987\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1504987\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JayKay","CreatedById":90560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T01:51:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENice frame; well built. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re after elegant, though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, cargo bays are clean.
