So what does this mean\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BF Well, in layman\u0027s terms, you need on average less symbols to express the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding why needs a bit of explanation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is something called scale-invariance which is true for (almost) all sizes (significantly above quantum and below relativity). It amounts to the fact that for any fixed c\u0026gt;1 (c=10 is standard, but any other like c=2 or c=pi work equally well), things of size x and size cx are equally likely. A bit more mathematically: probability is equally distributed on a logarithmic scale. The reason from physics is the scale-invariance of its laws.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has some paradoxical effects: a majority of sizes, lengths, areas, volumes you encounter will start with a 1, 2 or 3 (in base 10); already around 48% start with 1 or 2. This is true regardless of the units used, as long as you use the very same unit each time, be it meter, yard or miles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECall such unit u.

Thus for numbers between u and 10u, being below cu is as likely as being above it. But c is roughly 3.16 and surely lower than 4.
