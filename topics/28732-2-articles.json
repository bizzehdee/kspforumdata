They should also be able to contain Kerbals when inflated (but not when they are in travel mode). Some of the base parts would be nice if they were half cylinders or hemispherical domes so you could rest them directly on the ground. A couple of \u0022cool\u0022 pieces like a partially transparent hydroponics module and maybe a (top) transparent observation/recreation dome would be neat (for when your Kerbals want to hang out in style and enjoy the view). Rover garages with closeable doors?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Moar station parts. Those inflatable modules would be cool for stations as well. An inflatable ring that rotates would be cool (yeah, Bobcat has one, I know). The Ring should also be able to contain Kerbals when inflated. What would be nice for stations (and bases) is a probe sized solid \u0022tunnel\u0022 connector with 1.5m adapters on each side. You can use them to connect parts together (roughly half large truss size in length maybe? Or have both half size and full length versions) and they can act as \u0022tunnels\u0022 between modules for your Kerbals. A partially transparent hydroponics module would be neat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Some more realism parts. Maybe a couple of additions of asthetic parts, like high gain antennas (yes, I know there is already one, but a bigger size would be cool too, or maybe a 4 panel high gain, kind of like the Apollo one). Docking cameras would be VERY nifty for a whole slew of reasons (such as some cool realism for probes, but also to aid in docking). Radiators to dissipate heat would be nice as well. I think Nova did a folding one awhile back that was purely cosmetic around .16 or something. It would be nice to see that back, but actually reducing heat at least slightly from ships (so maybe you could run the NERVA engines full steam or something)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) New capsules and lander cans. Something roughly Apollo like would be cool for a 2 person lander can. A 2 man capsule, either longer 1.5m, but heavier than the 1 man or a shorter 2.5m, but lighter would be nice (Gemini like). A spherical 3 kerbal 1.5m capsule (1.5m connector maybe, but 2.5m in diameter) similar to the spherical probe for things like stations and deep space vessels would rock my world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Working docking bays. Not a whole lot more to explain on that one, but working 1.5m and 2.5m docking bays, maybe in two lengths for 1.5m and three lenghts for 2.5m (1.5m in both \u0022standard fuel tank\u0022 and \u0022jumbo\u0022 lengths and 2.5m in short, standard and jumbo lengths). The smaller bays can be for probes basically and the larger sized ones can be for big probes or very small 1.5m diameter ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Working robotic arms. Very cool and very useful for things like orbital and base construction (so long as moderately strong with a real grasper on them). To bolster this one, grasper handles that you can attach to things to make it easy for the robotic arm to grab it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Nukes! Err, I mean nuclear power plants. This is mostly for later on with resources to provide high power for refining stuff\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Parts for extracting and mining resources\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Moar science. It would be cool to see a few new science instruments. Ones that occur off the top of my head are magnometer, geiger counter, radar, docking radar and soil sample tester. The former I\u0027d think would be rather easy to implement. Just add a stat to planets where some generate magnetic fields and have it vary with the distance from the planet (it doesn\u0027t have to be uber realistic). Geiger counters could either be done super simple (higher readings the closer to the sun, drops down in the shade and maybe one or more planets are rather radioactive) or you could make them a little more complex, where planets with magnetic fields have van alan belts that you model simplistically. Radar...well, I am guessing something like that is needed for resource extraction, but it would be cool to stock be able to \u0022map\u0022 each planetary body. Docking radar, you could have it set up so that any object (debris or ship) that isn\u0027t part of the existing ship will generate a \u0022ping tone\u0022 that is within physics modeling range (the roughly 2.2km or whatever it is). It is generated based on the closest ship and only when the docking radar is activated. The closer the ship the faster the ping. So far away it might be a beep/ping every 30s or something, but get to like 100m and it is up to maybe 1 per 2s, then at 10m it is more like 2 beeps per second and faster and faster until it stops when you\u0027ve docked solid.
