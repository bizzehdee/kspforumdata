A lot of the advice you\u0027ll see on the net predates the changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo nowadays, every command pod or probe core comes with \u0027ASAS\u0027, which is just really a kind of automatic pilot.. when you put sas on it\u0027ll use what means it has at it\u0027s disposal to maintain the heading you put in; that\u0027s rcs, control surfaces, engine gimballing, and reaction wheel torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS modules are in a weird place.. there\u0027s some that are still called sas, some just called inline reaction wheels.

Lower one is the orbital placement vehicle, top one is the actual station (cupola) but with a small engine and 720 tank. Both stages have smaller engines (the Poodles I think) and 720 Rockomax tanks, plus some RCS (and the large Rockomax size tanks) and battery disks. The lower stage has one of those unmanned \u0027pods\u0027 and the upper one also has some solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed that the stock space station has two \u0027reaction wheels\u0027 when I took it apart so I copied this sort of (not knowing if those where there because of the multi-directional docking thing). The top of the cupola has a docking port and then one of the multi-directional docking hubs. In between the cupola and its docking port are the two reaction wheels (exact ones used in the stock space station and same order of stacking).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I get close to 2868 km altitude and I am fine tuning my orbit to get it circularized, I start to notice some very strange behavior with the SAS on versus off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs seems to be common, when you get to a very close to perfect circular orbit the periapsis and apoapsis markers start to quiver and waver, and this seems to relate to everything in the Navball and map view being a bit shaky.

When the two values get really close together the errors in the game will eventually get larger than the difference, so the markers bounce around a lot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd having too much torque can definitely make you start shaking with SAS on. It\u0027s easy to see with just the 1-man command pod by itself. With SAS on it starts shaking a lot; if you decrease the torque in the .cfg file it goes away. But that thing about the prograde and retrograde markers moving is weird. The maneuver node marker can move around a lot when you have a very small maneuver (\u0026lt;1m/s), but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen the velocity vectors do that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can right-click on individual reaction wheel parts and command pods and toggle the torque on and off for that part. Try turning off torque in a few of the wheels (but leave SAS on) and see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T05:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh DMagic.
