Magnetic attraction requires surfaces made of ferrous alloys (i.e. contains iron), which are much heavier, and would require more fuel (and thus be more expensive) to put into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Any magnet strong enough to hold a human or a Kerbal onto a ferrous surface would, by definition, make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to move their feet. Either Jeb would exhaust himself very quickly, or shuffle awkwardly along the surface of the spacecraft hull. Pure electromagnetic boots would require bulky power supplies or a powered tether, severely limiting the astronaut/Kerbalnaut\u0027s range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Any magnet strong enough to hold a human or a Kerbal onto a ferrous surface would also interfere the avionics of a spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- NASA did develop a special kind of magnetic boot (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c2516d70d6951e0ef034434b704a237e?convert_to_webp=true\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epic 1\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f8213716b850eaf1031ddd94ed27b754?convert_to_webp=true\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epic 2\u003C/a\u003E) that used a combination of permanent and electromagnets to toggle magnetic attraction on and off, via \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.cheniere.org/images/radusflxswtch.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emagnetic flux switching\u003C/a\u003E. While definitely more compact and energy-saving compared to purely electromagnetic boots, astronauts still found them too bulky, cumbersome and impractical, and so the project was abandoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Floating and free-flying on EVA is still much faster than clunking around awkwardly on a metal surface, and time is of the essence in emergencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Most importantly, \u003Cstrong\u003Emagnetic boots are not a substitute for gravity\u003C/strong\u003E. On Earth/Kerbin, gravity is a body force (i.e. applies equally to all parts of the human/Kerbal body), and if the astronaut/Kerbalnaut is wearing magnetic boots, only their feet will feel the pull towards the ferrous surface. Imagine how hard it is to move when your feet are fixed to a surface while the rest of your body is floating willy-nilly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FungusForge","CreatedById":148313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T22:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sumghai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sumghai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E*Great big fact storm*\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah.
