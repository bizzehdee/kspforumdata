You can seperate your different networks. Your survey scanners don\u0027t need to communicate with your munbase and maybe a ship passing duna doesn\u0027t need to communicate with the local duna network. As I understand it the current state is to declutter you \u0022spaghetti\u0022 network (wich is also a roleplay aspect) and in future you can/could/will(?) be able to give missions a seperate channel so the relays handle all the communication and then direct it to the various frequencies your different missions are on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMY dream is to have a base on planet x communicating with mission control on channel 1, a rover approaching it talking to his mission control on channel 2 and bopth of them can chat on channel 3 with each other. This is what I imagine this mod will go, and that is a real good opportunity to roleplay and declutter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also encourages diversity in antenna usage. The base in the above example coul use a small dish to establish connection to mission control while the rover (keeping an eye on weight) would use a foldable solution. And to communicate with each other a simple antenna would be enough. If you add some mod for antenna ranges there would be even more challenge behind the whole thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-17T14:24:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2017 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by maculator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxPeck","CreatedById":145248,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-17T14:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223024166\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158851\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221492437339\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002274999\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TaxiService\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n28 minutes ago, TaxiService said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, thanks for testing.

Which is odd. It really does seem like people\u0027s sole interest seems to be roleplaying? For example, in the versions where they\u0027re suggesting that within your group, your antenna would cycle through group members automatically in case of failure, it would be objectively most strategically advantageous to have one \u0022group\u0022 with all antennas such that all antennas cycled through all options, effectively making all antennas into omnis. So again the mod is encouraging you not to use its own features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can think of various ways you COULD make it matter (and think it\u0027s pretty cool if those are included), but was just confused why people are interested in it if not for such ways. For example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you add in (invisible/storyline) civilian radio presence on certain frequencies, and certain contracts require you to maintain satellites in XYZ orbits on those specific frequencies (if you take it off the frequency or move out of orbit, you lose the contract money again). This would give an actual reason to use more than one frequency.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you made different frequencies have different physical characteristics. For example, IIRC visible and radio waves are the only ones that penetrate our atmosphere very well, so those might be best for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E contact, with radio being the least affected, but also radio suffers from lower location accuracy (you cannot optically resolve details smaller than a wavelength of the light used, so radios with 100 meter wavelengths are bad for something like GPS I believe). Some might spread out more over distance, or have higher bandwidths for data, or blah blah, giving an actual reason to strategically use a mixture of frequencies for different tasks.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you add more mods or features for things satellites would be doing passively, then it can actually matter. SCANSat mod is a good example. I don\u0027tremember if it scans while the vessel is not focused, but if it does/did, and if it took a lot longer than it does now to scan, then for example, that frequency would be \u0022filled up\u0022 with constant streaming data, and thus would interfere with any other satellite trying to operate on that frequency (normally in vanilla or with most mods this is NOT the case, because you tend to only communicate with one vessel at a time due to how all comms happen in short bursts and since you only pilot one vessel at a time).

I don\u0027t think *I* will ever need more than two on a given craft (though others will...), and that would take care of a lot of the (minor) issues I have in usability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor now, I am retaining the probe core functionality while adding the frequency function to antenna parts. I am thinking over possible functions of probe cores while the antennas handle the frequency assignment.\u00A0I will write major view on the design of both probe core and antenna later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould a probe core\u00A0contain a list of pre-determined frequencies (up to the max no of antennas attached)\u00A0to be used for certain scenarios?
