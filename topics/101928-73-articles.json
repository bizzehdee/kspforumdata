And that is done due to all the kis manipulation making parts fly around? \n\nIf so you would likely be able to simply attach a dockingport to the part you are trying to rescue without it flying off and then just dock it, negating the need to shove it into inventory (honestly shoving a pod in inventory is somewhat silly due to size anyhow)."},{"CreatedByName":"sardia","CreatedById":149922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T05:38:36Z","Content":"There\u0027s a couple solutions to the problem of parts/kerbals being destroyed and recreated.\n\nA. Do nothing, everything is working as intended.\n\nB. Prevent kerbals from being moved into inventory like Igorz suggested.\n\nC. Prevent or code any illegal parts from triggering the failure of the contract (potentially very hard to code properly, really depends on how the mods interact with the contract).\n\nA and B are probably the best options.\n\nSeparately, there\u0027s the problem with the parts not lining up properly, so the parts fly off when they\u0027re dropped alongside a rocket. I need to test out changes to Igorz object placing, maybe it\u0027ll fix the problem of the detached part flying off.  I know it\u0027s possible to remove and place a nonattached object without imparting movement via KAS but I think tiny camera shifts changes the orientation so the parts aren\u0027t parallel anymore.  That\u0027s probably causing the collision issues, aka parts spinning off into space. This problem I think is more important than a minor or moderate contract bug of kerbals being put into containers. I haven\u0027t gotten around to trying this fix out, nor has anyone else mentioned problems with this.

It has numerous improvements which you may find in the release description.\n\nAs for the bouncing I think the only reason it was happening is false triggering of \u0022release\u0022 event in which case part was aligned incorrectly (it\u0027s a corner case that happens intermittently). In normal case the part gets velocity and rotation of the object it\u0027s being attached/dropped to, i.e. the should be no bouncing. Another case is dropping a part so what it collides with some irregular parts of the other objects (extended panels, antennas, landing legs, etc.). Though, if you drop an object like this you should expect colliding effects ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) I tried to find a solution to not allow dropping if there is a collision but everything I found was very expensive in terms of performance (it\u0027s basically going thru all the parts in the scene and checking them for mesh intersection, it\u0027s VERY expensive).
