Not even with mods like station sciences, only the launch was really exciting doing the science was like im just clicking a few buttons thats it.\n\nSomething like being able to move around in a station (Like be able to \u0022be\u0022 a kerbal and walk around inside a station) would be nice. Instead of being stuck in one seat with limited views.\n\nOne more thing that felt really dumb to me was that shouldnt most experiments be inside the craft not outside like those on the ISS.\n\nIf the above was implemented modules can have an \u0022inventory\u0022 system to carry science experiments (and life support if its ever added). \n\nAnd these experiments can be done in IVA Mode with sorta some minigame inside or something to watch it do rather then just click a menu and it opens and bam you got science.\n\nThis will make things like having a station/base more exciting rather than just for fuel or to make tons of science with the new science lab"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T10:05:00Z","Content":"Moving around *completely* free in IVA would be nigh impossible without restricting the way people can build ships, if you see what I mean here: [http://i.imgur.com/BL9WOi3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BL9WOi3.jpg)\n\nbeing able to move experiment results to the command pod without having to EVA would be great though. No need for a risky spacewalk to see the temperature out there and bring that data into the capsule lol."},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T10:59:52Z","Content":"Just to nitpick a bit: you won\u0027t be able to walk inside because walking requires some gravity... Also, your thread title reads [Intra-Vehicular Activity Activities](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment)\n\nNow to the point: I don\u0027t really think it would work with the game engine and with the game itself. Minigames would quickly get boring and repetitive and interior of a station, too. As for experiments being outside - you often would even detach them and bring to other bodies and see what\u0027s going on there."},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T11:09:15Z","Content":"probably a too massive game mechanics \u0022global\u0022 redesign effort (\u0022for now i guess ...\u0022) imho even if the idea is cool in itself, ksp gameplay remain more oriented about vehicles than kerbonaut.
