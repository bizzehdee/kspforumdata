Even from within himself, and without . There comes a point when he questions his own validity and the reason for his existence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am having the same questions right now. To make sure I stay relevant, I have set a target for myself in life. A difficult one, a very difficult one. To achieve that, I can not afford to have distractions, of any kind. That includes Kerbal Space Program, and even this forum. Thus, I have requested an account ban. I am only awaiting the responses of a few goodbyes to all the friends that I have made in this community, before I walk away..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni am not leaving the community, its too good to walk away from. I am literally tearing myself apart from it. This is one of the last bastions of sanity and goodwill left on the internet. And after this I doubt I will use the internet for anything other than the occasional gmail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe past 2 years have been really good for me with you guys. I loved playing the game, and I loved interacting with you all.
