It\u2019s 1969 but the downsizing of NASA was well underway by the time the Soviets surprised everyone by landing first. So it\u2019s going to take \u003Cstrong\u003Ea lot\u003C/strong\u003E of money to restart Saturn V production. On the other hand, the Vietnam War ended earlier due to stronger political pressure over general science and technology vs. war. So the course of the funding is going to look more like how the Soviets cancelled N1 but then went all in on Mir \u002B Buran, instead of cancelling Apollo and underfunding the lone Space Shuttle.

I feel like the transit through interplanetary space is the most dangerous and unknown aspect of a Mars mission (in 1969). In contrast, stuff that needs to be done under gravity could be done on Earth. Not to say it is best done on Earth, but if you are trying to limit things for budget reasons (think like you\u2019re the White House Office of Budget and Management rather than NASA Administrator), Moon base feels easy to eliminate while space station can actually do things you can\u2019t on Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like I have already decided to go with a space station, and to be honest I am leaning toward it, but I still want to hear opinions.

Maybe it carries Viking 1 and 2 simultaneously there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStage 3: The Mars mission. Based on the proposed Mars mission that was going to come at the end of the original STS program, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s going to take a single, reduced size \u201CSkylab C\u201D (with only three crew) and three S-IVB sized NERVA stages to propel this thing to Mars. That uses up the last of the Saturn Vs. This would take place in 1979 or the early 80s. Unfortunately mass limitations mean the time on the surface is only 15 days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, all hardware would be used up.
