There have been a couple of claims of the CMBR exhibiting structurally meaningful variation, such as circulations or micro swirls, however more recent data shows that the type of data these authors used coukd also be explained by more recent interactions. In addition if there was major rotational velocity, then the frequenicies of the red shift of CNBR would differe acroos our sky just as GBH are able to shifht light into the x-ray range preferentially from one perspective versus another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECNBR is a logical trap of sorts, if you have a theory and it cannot explain the uniformity of the Radiation, then its not a viable theory.

Astronomers call these \u0022active galaxies,\u0022 and Hercules A is one of them. In visible light (colored red, green and blue, with most objects appearing white), Hercules A looks like a typical elliptical galaxy. In X-ray light, however, Chandra detects a giant cloud of multimillion-degree gas (purple). This gas has been heated by energy generated by the infall of matter into a black hole at the center of Hercules A that is over 1,000 times as massive as the one in the middle of the Milky Way. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERadio data (blue) show jets of particles streaming away from the black hole.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E The jets span a length of almost one million light years.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
