If you want to give it a try I suggest you [URL=\u0022http://physicsware.net/pdf/Low-Thrust.pdf\u0022]start here[/URL] on page 9.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T10:34:48Z","Content":"\nThere are a handful of useful low thrust maneuvers that can be described analytically. Good example is raising circular orbit. Everything else is hairy numerics.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T17:43:44Z","Content":"\nI have no idea how useful or accurate it is, but what I\u0026#39;ve tried before is to break it down in sections. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-So you start at a certain orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Calculate the time it takes to reach halfway or a quarter through the orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Calculate the acceleration during that period\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Add that to the spacecraft speed\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Calculate the the orbit altitude based on the new speed\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Repeat\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt will give you a bunch of points that you can then plot out.
