I feel as if I have to post again, just to clarify a few little things.**\n\u003E There is a distinct difference between \u0027being excited\u0027 and \u0027leaving spam.\u0027 If I was *very* excited about a new update, I would write something along the lines of:\n\u003E \n\u003E ...if someone else was *really, really* excited, they may write:\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m perfectly fine with both of these posts. What I\u0027m not fine with, however, is:\n\u003E \n\u003E Personally, I think that no matter how excited someone is, there are far, *far* better ways of expressing excitement than this. If it was done on any other thread, it would be removed by a moderator. It really shouldn\u0027t be tolerated here, either. And while I know that a fair fraction of the posts here aren\u0027t this way, there are also an embarrassing number of them that look *exactly* like this.\n\u003E \n\u003E **So, to re-iterate:**\n\u003E \n\u003E **I\u0027m not grumpy that you guys are excited.** I do want to see 1.0 come out too, and I\u0027ll probably be up late into the night trying to download it when it first comes out. \n\u003E \n\u003E **I\u0027m grumpy because I feel like this thread is the Forum equivalent of a** ***lot*** **of graffiti sprayed near my house.** It\u0027s not actually dangerous and it doesn\u0027t do much harm, but it\u0027s unpleasant to be around for all of the people who don\u0027t want to spread graffiti. Which, in this case, is actually a surprising amount of people! You just don\u0027t hear from them as much, because they\u0027re not posting once every thirty seconds to \u0027spread Hype.\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ~~~\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ...oh, and in case you\u0027re saying, \u0022Well, then just don\u0027t look at it! The Forum is a big place, and there are many other threads to look at.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E I would like to remind people that for up to a week before the update comes out, the HypeTrain has caused the Forum to overload and stopped anyone from viewing or posting anything, in all parts of the Forum. Sure, these outages haven\u0027t been so bad, but it does annoy me that they are more-or-less entirely pointless, and could easily be avoided if people were even *slightly* more restrained. And I know for a fact that it\u0027s possible to breathe in and out a few times and control your excitement (or other emotions) before posting. This is a far better way to \u0027vent your excitement\u0027 than creating a Hype Train, both for yourself and for the KSP community.\n\u003E \n\u003E Again, this is just my two cents. If you\u0027re wondering why I\u0027m posting this here, it\u0027s because I\u0027m hoping that people actually read it and maybe even approach this thread in a slightly different way.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for reading through this. I really will stop posting on this thread now. I promise.\n\u003E \n\u003E -Upsilon\n\nVery nice post, I understand your reasons for not wanting to spam the forums. \u002Brep\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-04T00:44:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2015 12:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mad Rocket Scientist**"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T00:43:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.twitch.tv/gregroxmun](http://www.twitch.tv/gregroxmun)\n\u003E Livestreaming me playing KSP.
