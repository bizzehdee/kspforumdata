I just re-installed TextureReplacer and EVE in 0.24 and at around 6 Gb RAM used I hit the wall for available texture memory. On my system the Linux 64 bit version does not appear to make all your remaining free RAM available for textures and I seriously doubt the Windows 64 bit version is any different. You will probably find that the aggressive version of ATM is not as necessary as before. I have always been able to run with the basic version. Possibly folks with 16 or 32 Gb of RAM will have a different experience,I don\u0027t know but I am interested to know if purchasing more RAM would make any difference. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks as always for the great work rbray89, cheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKaa\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
