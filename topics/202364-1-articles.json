different from the situation you found yourself in with KSP, if you think about it objectively.\u00A0 But it sure \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efeels\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E different, doesn\u0027t it?\u00A0 i.e. it feels like KSP is expecting too much from the player, but the racing game isn\u0027t?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we think about why that is... personally, I think it\u0027s a matter of familiarity.\u00A0 Everyone\u0027s been in a car, and has a basic idea of how cars drive and how steering wheels work, so even if the racing game doesn\u0027t explicitly tell you all the things you need to watch out for, it seems reasonable to expect the player to just intuitively \u0022get\u0022 what they should or shouldn\u0027t do, at least in broad outline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhereas most of us \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehaven\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E piloted a rocket ship, and the problems they encounter don\u0027t seem as intuitive... at least, not to some of us.\u00A0 A lot depends on background and experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example:\u00A0 just to play devil\u0027s advocate for a moment:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou assumed that WASD wouldn\u0027t work... but nobody actually told you they wouldn\u0027t.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe game has lots of different things to try:\u00A0\u00A0 how about not going straight up?\u00A0 how about not coming down nose-first?\u00A0 how about tweaking the settings on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u00A0 KSP has a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebig\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E \u0022trial-and-error\u0022 ethic built into it; it\u0027s expected that you\u0027re going to try different things to find out what works and what doesn\u0027t, so it has a fair amount of license for lots of things not to work.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022

fact, tell you that the parachute was destroyed because you\u0027re going too fast.\u00A0 So the game had a certain expectation that you\u0027d try doing things so as not to come down so quickly-- such as, for example, \u0022don\u0027t fall like a dart\u0022.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain:\u00A0 Not saying that you were \u0022wrong\u0022 at all.\u00A0 After all, you have company; some other people have experienced the same frustration as you.\u00A0 On the other hand... not \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eeveryone\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E has-- some players actually \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edo\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E instinctively try those things and end up never encountering the problem.\u00A0 Doesn\u0027t mean that they\u0027re any better or worse than you, just that they\u0027re approaching the game from a different viewpoint, is all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll certainly grant your point that KSP can be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edauntingly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E hard.\u00A0 There are so many different factors to consider and counterbalance, many of which aren\u0027t intuitive to someone who isn\u0027t a physics major, and the game really doesn\u0027t do much to show you the ins and outs \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eexplicitly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Yes, it has some tutorials... but they\u0027re kinda lightweight and don\u0027t go into a whole lot of detail.\u00A0 That\u0027s understandably frustrating.\u00A0 It is, however, also kinda understandable how it got that way.\u00A0 Making really \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egood\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E tutorials for a game as complex as KSP takes a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of development time and effort.\u00A0 That doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s not worthwhile... but the original KSP was developed on a relative shoestring, with a fairly small number of developers, and they didn\u0027t really have a lot of cycles to spare for tutorial development since they had their hands full just working on the main game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news is, from what I\u0027ve heard about KSP 2, they\u0027ve heard this player \u0022pain point\u0022 loud and clear, and they\u0027re putting a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E more work into having more detailed and useful tutorials.\u00A0 We won\u0027t really know for sure how it stacks up until they release it, of course, but from the teasers they\u0027ve shown us thus far, it sounds very encouraging.\u00A0\u00A0 My guess is that KSP 2 will deliver the sort of tutorials that you would have wished the original had.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-29T17:16:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

aerodynamic forces\u0027 on the way down, no matter what I did, just like many other newbies on this forum.\u00A0 I have been doing the simplest possible configuration in the \u0027Contract\u0027s track - a command module, a \u0027Flea\u0027 solid-rocket booster, and a MK16 parachute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOut of curiosity, what is your air speed when you are deploying the chute? I\u0027m going off memory here, so please forgive me - Normally, for the Mk 16 chute, wait until you are between 15,000 meters and 10,000 meters to deploy. As you reenter Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cs\u003Egelatinous\u003C/s\u003E atmosphere, you will go from having a ring of plasma around your capsule to having an effect that simulates traveling faster than the speed of sound. By the time you get to the speed of sound, and depending on your angle, your altitude should be between 23,000 meters and 18,000 meters. By the low end of that, your capsule speed will, because of atmospheric pressures, begin to drop a little before you deploy your chutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you get to an air speed of no higher than 420 m/s, you can safely deploy chutes. If you have a radial mount drogue chute, you can deploy that at around 600 m/s and allow it to bring you down to around 350 m/s before deploying your main chute (the Mk 16).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a side note, and in my experience, the Mk 16 doesn\u0027t fully deploy until your altitude is between 1,000 and 500 meters. You\u0027ll know it because your air speed will drop to around 12 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that helps some.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stefan_F","CreatedById":221896,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-22T04:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had the same problem and I was finally able to complete it, took me like a dozen attempts. My biggest mistake was, that I stopped steering during the descent I think. I did a nice parabolic flight path ending up horizontal at the highest point at around 10500m and deployed then the chute. Then I used the pitch control to keep my beginner craft horizontally throughout the descent, until the chute completely opened in the lower atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
