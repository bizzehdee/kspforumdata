And I was comparing them to ibeams and other stock parts attached in such long constructs ... and my goal was to have the same behaviour with IR parts. In case they are too weak, I could try to fix something. But if they\u0027re just not hyper-strong... then it is \u0022by design\u0022 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) ... but to be honest, I\u0027ve not yet tested your configuration and if it is not strong enough. I will do this later...\n\u003E \n\nThank you, let me know how it goes and if there is any fix for it if possible.
