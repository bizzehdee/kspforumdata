I\u0027m not sure exactly what happened, I just opened the file and the game was gone. In it\u0027s place was a strange cache of files. I do not have a computer virus, and the game rarely if ever crashed for me so I\u0027m not sure what happened. Any help will be appreciated, otherwise I will just re-download and forge on.
