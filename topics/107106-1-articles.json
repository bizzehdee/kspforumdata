It could fly medium-long haul flights and hold up to 383 people!\n\nVersions:\n\n- Pax: holds 17 pax and 4 crew\n\n- Cargo: smallest mk3 Cargo Bay, roughly certified to 12t. Get a longer runway for more weight.\n\n- SafeGuard: Ever crash your planes a lot? Well, now you don\u0027t have to! Equipped with parachutes and essentially a safer version of the Pax plane, you can easily detach the cockpit and watch the rest of the plane plummet into the ground.\n\nUnfortunately, KSP\u0027s new and revamped aerodynamics does not allow me to actually recreate the capacity of 383, but it can hold 17 kerbals, including crew for the Pax and SafeGuard version, as well as 12,150 units of fuel.\n\nThe downloadable aircraft is/are certified to the runway at KSC with the current loads. Fuel adjustments may increase the plane\u0027s takeoff run.\n\nOther Facts (Pax):\n\n- Loaded/Certified Weight: 46t\n\n- Part Count: 62\n\n- Max Speed (Vne): 330m/s before uncontrollable stage occurs\n\n- Stall Speed (Vref): 179.545556774m/s before stall/slow descent. 156 before flat spin.\n\nThe planes are all equipped with high-density control surface dynamics, A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S and doors.\n\n**Pics:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
