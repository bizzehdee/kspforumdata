I much preferred the old days of proper \u0022expansions\u0022 that cost 20$, but actually added 20$ worth of content, rather than a 5$ DLC that adds maybe 30 minutes of playtime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I actually like what SQUAD seems to be saying about their DLC. . . namely, that their DLC will introduce whole new mechanics to the game. Big, sweeping changes rather than small changes that modders can already provide. Their reasoning also seems sound. . . only the hardcore people are going to be using the more complicated features; and since the hardcore crowd is planning to spend 200\u002B hours on the game, they will be fine spending extra $ on DLC that allows greatly increased complexity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, I would spend $ on DLC that allows realistic moon bases to be constructed and maintained, whereas my brother mostly plays this game to watch rockets blow up, and wouldn\u0027t spend a dime on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that providing a core experience, and then adding DLC afterwards to cater to a more hardcore crowd is perfectly acceptable, and will allow the game to be released to the masses while still providing a unique hardcore experience that so many of us(myself included) love.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. If SQUAD had a donation box, where perhaps if you donate you get a special forum badge or something( or early access to beta builds, or dev blogs or something), I think many people would take advantage of it. I, personally, would take advantage of such a system.

There is no way of getting big chunks of quality content on top of normal game development from the team consisting of 10-20 people.

Having a small team of dedicated and not necessarily experienced people can do wonders. As many indie titles have shown. But having a big studio full of experienced people does not mean an awesome game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i\u0027m not afraid of the DLC per se (as they would be a different breed to the \u0022day one new ending with horse armor on top DLC\u0022 nonsense) but the requirement of additional load on developers could be damaging to the game in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the game is still quite early in the development its quite hard to create \u0022expansions\u0022, requiring another purchase, out of standard development content. If SQUAD manages it then big props for them, but for now they still have plenty of time to get the game closer to finished state and work on more income from there. I think there are plenty of people buying it through steam early access, and there will be a ton more when it releases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for the time being we are struck with purchasing another copy of the game as a donation method.
