Of course, this is the perfect opportunity to bring two of my loves together - space exploration and history! So, what I am asking is for your input in deciding on where to start the class - mainly so i will know the type of textbook(s) I will need to look for as a required text(s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve created a poll to ask for your assistance in determining the starting point for the class. If you want to make comments or suggestions, please feel free to do so.

That in turn helps people to understand that our current view is far from perfect and subject to change if the evidence leads us there. We know a bit about various objects, though far from everything. However, the relation between space and time, time itself and how they all behave around less intuitive objects like black holes and things like dark energy are subject of much confusion and debate. We do not even know whether time actually exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, depending on who is listening, you might want to leave a lot of the latter out as not to confuse things too much.

Most people don\u0027t need to know that a hyperbolic trajectory is a flyby, except the terminology, but they would need to know that most orbits are ellipses, i.e., not perfect circles. Tie that in to a story about Newton. I recall reading that two astronomers made a bet about the shape of orbits, but they couldn\u0027t solve who won.

Many people do not know that the Confederate Army actually used metal body, solid propellant (wood dust mixed with gunpowder and kerosene) as a rocket propellant in some of the battles in North Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia. What amazes me is that 1920 German experiments in rocket design picked up where the Confederacy\u0027s research ended. Germans began playing with the types of bells used and the shape of the combustion chamber can determine the range and speed of a rocket. Even though the Germans were years ahead of the Allies and on the losing side of the war does not mean we discredit their work.

This will give many opportunities for, say, hands-on activities, such as planning basic space missions on paper and other such projects that will involve students. For example, last summer I attended the Da-Vinci Engineering Enrichment Program (DEEP) in the University of Toronto, where we tried to make model rockets (at least it\u0027s a start).\u00A0Anyway, your class will teach about space travel, which to me is much more interesting than bogus ancient ideas about\u00A0the night sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not intend to dwell on the ancients any more than about three lectures as a means to introduce the concept that mankind has always looked towards the heavens with curiosity and amazement.
