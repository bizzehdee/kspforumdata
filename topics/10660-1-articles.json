Its completely stock, and has an absurd delta v of OVER 9000!!!!\n\nBut seriously, it is a bit rediculous. The inner stage (lander engine, Large fuel tank, small fuel tank, capsule) is capable of achieving a 70km orbit by itself (which I have done without mechjeb) [http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10172.0.](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10172.0.) In fact, it is perfectly possible to orbit it, deorbit, and land it, if you conserve the fuel perfectly. You have about a teaspoon of fuel to make the landing, but done right it is enough. I have not been successful on this. My closest attempt, I jumped the gun and burned to 10m/s upwards at 100m above the ground, and my kerbals freefell to their deaths over that last 100m. \n\nThe lander engines are incredibly overpowered for a lot of things. The reason is that after you get off the planet, your total thrust doesn\\\u0027t really matter very much. Rather, what matters is the total momentum you can gain for a given amount of fuel. Hence, the lander engines tiny weight (0.5 compared to 2.0 for its big brothers) really shines."},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T03:05:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The use of FL-T250 tanks when FL-T500 are more efficient?

However, I get a delta V difference of something like 30m/s between the designs, which is really rather tiny."},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T03:21:18Z","Content":"Huh.
