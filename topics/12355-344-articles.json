It flails about, twisting and turning, making erroneous \u0022corrections\u0022 in every direction except the one that will take it down to KSC. The last time I tried it, I gave up on landing guidance, used SASS to aim retrograde and did a manual burn to get the end of the trajectory close to KSC. Missed it by that much. *sploosh* I let it flounder too long, wasting fuel, so it ran out before it could correct course enough.

Sometimes it doesn\u0027t even try to turn me, it just feebly bobles a bit. Again, to re-iterate, RT flight computer can send signals and make changes no problem, as can a pilot with skills and regular old atmospheric control/gimbaling of engines/rcs/sas.
