Is there an edit file I can script to make this enabled? or a patch file I may be missing? Some help would be appreciated as I do not want to manually deploy 18 miners lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-22T02:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese action groups are missing due to\u00A0a bug introduced in 1.3\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/15410\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/15410\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EIt can be fixed by removing \u0022displayActions = false\u0022 from\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003E\u00A0GameData/Squad/Parts/Resources/MiniDrill/MiniDrill.cfg and similarly for RadialDrill.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drarkan","CreatedById":100989,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-22T05:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome thanks. I thought it didn\u0027t work until I had the bright idea to remove the drill from my ship and replace them new, and low and behold it worked.
