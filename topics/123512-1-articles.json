The version of the mod is the appropriate one for the version of the game. The mod itself works perfectly, however there is 1 issue: Solar panels now cause lag. The ships that do not have any (or very few) panels work exactly the same as before, however any ship which has more than a few solar panels now lags quite intensely. The amount of lag seems to be directly proportional to the amount of solar panels (i.e. more panels=more lag). I know this is an old version of the game and all, but if anyone could help it would be appreciated. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: An example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see this Ion Plane, it has a huge amount of solar panels, however without Interstellar installed it runs perfectly fine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iepOrux.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022iepOrux.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, when I install Interstellar it runs at most at 2fps, and becomes completely unplayable. However this also affects ships with only 4 of the large panels (obviously with much less lag.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-22T13:04:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2015 01:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A35K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speadge","CreatedById":145302,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T01:17:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this from some 1.04 interstellar WIP versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of one of the latest changelog said, they fixed some lagging in it.
