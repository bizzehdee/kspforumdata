From the screen shot, it looks like you\u0027ve got Unity 2018.1 installed - KSP is on 2017.1.3, so that \\*may\\* be the issue.  The DDS issue is an ongoing problem, and I\u0027m surprised that Unity still doesn\u0027t have a DDS loader in the tool, considering the ubiquity of that file format.  If I really need to see textures, I\u0027ll have a separate GameData installation for IVA production with the props and IVAs I need, and I\u0027ll batch convert the DDS files I need to something else (like PNG).\n\u003E \n\nYeah, pretty strange how they don\u0027t support the texture format that seem the most common.\n\nI indeed got the newest unity version installed, guess I gotta look if I can get an older one; thanks for the answer!"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-18T13:38:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, MOARdV said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The DDS issue is an ongoing problem, and I\u0027m surprised that Unity still doesn\u0027t have a DDS loader in the tool, considering the ubiquity of that file format.\n\u003E \n\nIts a licensing issue, that has been going on since 2010. I guess Unity and Microsoft (creators of the DDS format), cant or wont come to terms...  \n\nYes, its a PIA for Unity users.  \n  \n[@MOARdV](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/60950-moardv/) can i ask what method you are using to batch convert DDS to png?  \n\nI\u0027ve been doing it manually, file by file, and its a PIA... When I was helping to propulate IVAs for a certain station parts pack, NF Props was updating fast and furiously... So instead of having to convert for every update, I saved a seperate folder of all the converted pngs, (added new ones as needed), and then just copied the folder of pngs into gamedata, anytime the mod updated...  \n\nI still have the folders of pngs for NF Props, TD Industries Props, RPM, MAS, ASET Props and Avionics, and a few other things... Now, anytime i need to work with them in Unity, its usually a quick copy/pasta instead of a day-long dds conversion session...  \n  \n[@Temeter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58056-temeter/) latest 2017.1.3 patch is here (its listed seperately from the main releases for some reason):  \n[https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases)\n\nnice tht this came up...
