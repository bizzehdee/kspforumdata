I also \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E expect that we\u0027d see the surface of Mars attain one BAR of pressure. I think we\u0027d be lucky to attain half that. The remaining water melt will not form oceans or seas. However what water is there would add moisture to the ground, humidity to the air (which would not be breathable) and some seasonal streams, rivers and possibly lakes. There would really be some crater lakes there. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is no native flora (algae-like or bacterial) which can generate oxygen, we\u0027d need to introduce it and seed it there. According to Phoenix lander data, the \u0022soil\u0022 contains chemical nutrients. Even then, it would take a \u003Cem\u003Elong\u003C/em\u003E time before anyone could breath the air in situ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, we should take care of planet Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
