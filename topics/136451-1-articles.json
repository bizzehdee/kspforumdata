I don\u0027t expect a full KSP game engine just for this, at least Squad could let plugins devs try to make something. Just look what FAR did for aero. At least let flapping fins to slowly propel crafts and such. I\u0027ve searched for and there are plenty of open source fluid dynamics sims that can be used for basic/reduced sim versions in KSP. At least Squad could let plugins devs to try develop through API similar to FlightIntegrator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ag3nt108","CreatedById":159944,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T07:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts a cool idea, but I fully agree the development of the game should remain on space for the foreseeable future. \u00A0Otherwise where do we call the cut off. \u00A0Why not add combat mechanics, Aliens, space trading and factions? \u00A0well because thats a different game \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T08:30:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExploring underwater is just a valid and valuable as exploring the \u0027dry bits\u0027 from a scientific point of view. \u00A0From a game angle it gives more stuff to find, and new challenges to face trying to find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, I think the game would benefit from underwater features/anomalies, biomes\u00A0and collectable science etc. \u00A0Currently sinking/underwater counts as \u0027splashed down\u0027 and on the seabed counts\u00A0as \u0027landed\u0027, so distinctions for them would be handy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main focus should, of course, always be the space flight aspect, but with the addition of just a few specialist parts, such as 2 sizes of electric propulsion and ballast tanks, the gameplay possibilities are increased enormously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fatcargo","CreatedById":93302,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T12:35:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for late response, i look at forums when i have time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo add to previous post : so far, mechanical stress and high temperatures are main factors in durability of crafts and structures.
