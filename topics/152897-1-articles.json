I either run out of fuel 100 meters above ground or thing becomes unstable. It also seems to cost a lot of fuel, nearly 20% of total booster stage capacity, to reverse orbit and land at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, which makes the whole thing very inefficient, which is the thing I\u0027m after.

You just have to fly very, steep inefeecient launch trajcetories that takes the first stage up past 80 or so KM. Seperate, then while the first stage coasts to apoapsis you burn the second stage down range as far as possible. Get it out far enough to where you have a good few minutes before the second stage hits apo. Switch back to the first stage booster, perform the boostback, then either stick with it and land it, or switch back to the second stage to burn further out. Ive seen people able to do perform a FaclonHeavy profile successfully like this.\u00A0\u00A0 However i dont do this. I dont like the very steep, unrealistic trajectory. I use BDArmory.
