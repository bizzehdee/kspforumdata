To me it all looks very overpowered, I\u0027ve done Apollo style launches myself which require docking, but even without docking you can get away with a lot less than what you\u0027ve got there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor starters, I see you\u0027ve used two Mk1-2 pods. I\u0027m not sure how you played it, if you transferred your guys back to the orange tank \u002B pod before launch home, or went in the lander, but either way you could land with a landercan instead to save weight. And if you use the same craft to get home from the Mun, instead of transferring to a waiting ship in orbit, you could forego one of the pods. If you do meet up in orbit I\u0027d suggest docking ports, so you can transfer any leftover fuel from the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander seems overpowered as well, again, not sure if you took it back to Kerbin straight from the Mun, but you don\u0027t need a lot of thrust to land on the Mun. If you go with the atomic engines two should be more than enough. Also I see RCS thrusters in triplicate, huge overkill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour last orange tank could be cut up into two stages, using Apollo as a reference a \u0027third stage\u0027 that sends you toward the Mun and then a smaller tank for the pod to bring you back after you\u0027ve ditched the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven then your launcher looks overpowered. I haven\u0027t opened the craft file to look at numbers, but I\u0027ve gotten to the Mun with two stages of 5 orange tanks (middle \u002B 4 around), and a smaller third stage (3/4th of an orange tank). For some extra push you can stick on some solid boosters around the first stage for liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more you have up top the more you need in your stage below, and the more you have in that stage the more you need below it. Starting from the top (your lander) the extra atomic engines, extra pod, extra large RCS tank are all surplus weight. The I beams and girders shouldn\u0027t really be necessary either (at least in that extent). To lift all that you should be fine with orange tank \u002B 4 around it, instead of 6, in which case your first stage wouldn\u0027t need extra tanks, likely not 6 around the central one either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve personally just kept my launch vehicles really simple. Starting from the bottom, stage 1 = 5 (middle \u002B4 around) orange tanks with mainsails, second stage the same, third stage half or 3/4ths of an orange tank with mainsail (or skipper now that it\u0027s available) \u002B payload. First and second stage are capable of bringing around 40 tons to orbit, generally I\u0027m careless with launches and the third stage gets to push the last few hundred m/s for kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMainsails are really powerful so I usually keep my thrust around 80%, also if you use orange tanks engines will overheat easier (known issue with those tanks), even then limiting yourself to 70-80% thrust will make your lifter not tear itself apart without lots of struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope some of this helps, great looking rover by the way!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T14:30:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I said asparagus instead of pancake I mean replace all of your lower stages with a single asparagus setup.
