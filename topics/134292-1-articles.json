The demo is actually one of the earliest versions of the game, so in my eyes it doesn\u0027t accurately portray the final game. Although parts are easy to understand. Engines/RCS thrusters provide thrust which moves the vehicle, fuel tanks hold the fuel for those engines, and command pods hold kerbals, the characters of the game. You need those.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T17:14:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222458843\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134292\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458082459\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022158709\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022unevoie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, unevoie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi all -\u00A0I\u0027m currently playing the free KSP demo and just getting my bearings in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, unevoie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually came across it when I stumbled across a discussion of friendliest online game communities (and from what I\u0027ve seen,\u00A0I definitely agree)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be noted that much of the credit for this belongs with\u00A0our benevolent\u00A0forum moderator overlords.

My advice is to pick a goal, try to accomplish it, then if you don\u0027t, try to figure out why, and if you can\u0027t, then ask a detailed question on the forum.
