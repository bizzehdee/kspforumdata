I\u0027ve made 5 attempts to return a Mk1 capsule (with a heat shield and a Mk16 parachute, nothing complicated) from LKO to the surface. Each one failed. I deployed the chute the second it said that it was safe, but it wouldn\u0027t open in time. I have no idea how I\u0027m going to work with this problem. If anyone has managed to get around this, please tell me how you did it.
