The tricky bit here is we can\u0027t guess how long it will be until 0.91 (or whatever). As a guide my existing tutorial (link in sig and all that) has been getting ~100 views/day. Opinions, everyone? I\u0027m relaxed about the Drawing Board being worth 100 or even 1,000 because it\u0027s something every entry should be worthy of. On the other hand there\u0027s only likely to be time for one or two (at a guess) to be \u0027tutorial of the month\u0027.
