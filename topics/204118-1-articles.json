I\u0027ve been having a problem for the past few days where I\u0027d load KSP and right as it\u0027s done loading all the mods I have installed, it freezes my system, then crashes. This only happens on modded installs. Vanilla installs run just fine, so I\u0027m sure it\u0027s a mod issue. I installed the mods using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E. I\u0027m running Pop!_OS 21.04 64 bit.

The only downside to this is that the modded copy doesn\u0027t get updated when an update comes out, but that\u0027s also a good thing as it won\u0027t break your modded games. Since 1.12 is the last major release for KSP and only minor patches/fixes are expected, the game-breaking stuff is less relevant but Steam will still break stuff on its own so you\u0027re better off avoiding it; the very infrequent pain of updating a modded copy of KSP isn\u0027t nearly as bad as the frequent issues that come with putting mods in the Steam copy.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbelTheLycanroc","CreatedById":213225,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-31T18:27:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis didn\u0027t work. on top of that, I\u0027ve never had a problem with steam and mods prior to switching to Pop!_OS. what else is weird is that on launch, it kills my spotify client.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: could it be a memory issue? it worked on kubuntu on my old system with 32gb ram, but I only have 16 on this new system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-31T18:30:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2021 06:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by AbelTheLycanroc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
