(Please don\u0027t ruin the fun for others)\n\n- No Mods/Plugins allowed (Except for display, visual, or informative mods i.e. Kerbal Engineer, MechJeb etc.) and Stock parts must be used.\n\n- All parts must not decouple (Exceptions are: Launch Clamps and Fairings)\n\n- The Vehicle must remain under 75m above sea level (The Altitude should remain constant at all times, however if your vehicle is over 75m, then a maximum of 5m increase in altitude is allowed).\n\n- No parts can break until it passes the Runway (Any debris will not count as part of the ship)\n\n- The Crew/Command Pod/Probe Core must survive and be able to recover (Pack a parachute!)\n\n- To provide evidence of completion, either record it with a video or add series of screenshots which show the time it took and the craft passing the runway.\n\n- Do not exploit any glitches or bugs to your advantage \n\n- Please state whether you are in the Precision or Sprint League **(Sorry for not adding this in earlier!)**\n\n**These are the 8 lines:**\n\n![SDfAmdG.png](http://i.imgur.com/SDfAmdG.png)\n\nPrecision League:\n\n**How to time:** \n\nStart: As soon as the engine fires\n\nEnd: When your vehicles comes to a complete stop and is on the 8 lines\n\nPrecision League is all about timing, throttle and skill! The main objective is to blast your way to the finish but to brake at the last minute at the end of the runway and **STOP** at the end of the runway without going over it (The 8 vertical lines at the end is the point required for stopping). \n\nPrecision League Rules:\n\n- Do not go off the runway at anytime and don\u0027t fly off at the end\n\n- Your vehicle must stop at 0.0m/s and touch the 8 vertical lines at the end of the runway\n\n- Your vehicle cannot go pass the 8 vertical lines, (the vehicle has to be at least above one of them) but your vehicle can be half on and off the lines.\n\nSprint League:\n\n**How to time:**\n\nStart: As soon as the engine starts\n\nEnd: When you pass the Runway (The 8 lines)\n\nSprint League is all about power, velocity and aerodynamics! The goal is to **PASS** the runway at a high speed to race against time, however you still need to be able to recover the vehicle once you have finished. \n\nSprint League Rules:\n\n- The vehicle needs to pass the entire runway, then brake to slow down\n\n- The vehicle must not be destroyed, and it must be able to recover (Some parts are allowed to break but not until after it passes the indicated lines)\n\n- Go to F3 as soon as you pass the 8 lines to show your time \n\n**LEADERBOARDS:**\n\nPrecision League:\n\nFirst:\n\nSecond:\n\nThird:\n\nMost creative vehicle:\n\nSprint League:\n\nFirst:\n\nSecond:\n\nThird:\n\nMost creative vehicle:\n\n**Competitors:**\n\n- Triop\n\n- t3hJimmer\n\n- Xannari Ferrows\n\n- Vanamonde\n\nGood luck and have fun building!
