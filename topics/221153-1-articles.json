Maybe some kind of physics LoD system where parts are auto-welded to cap the physics part count at some reasonable number?

I would assign affinities between different parts, iterate through the tree to weld each part to the highest-affinity neighbor, and recurse until I hit the target number of physics parts. So for example two parts with the same diameter attached through a node would have a high affinity, two parts with different diameters attached through a node would have medium affinity, a part attached to another part via a surface attachment would have low affinity, and certain parts like docking ports and decouplers would have zero affinity so they\u0027re never welded.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you\u0027d need to decide whether to recompute the welds when docking in space and handle any issues that might cause, it sounds like the kind of thing that could summon the kraken if not handled carefully.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would have to be a halt condition if an iteration resulted in no new welds -- that would mean that some lunatic built a craft entirely out of decouplers and docking ports.
