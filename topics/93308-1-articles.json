That\u0027s why they are not absorbed and simply wander through glass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn colored glass some photons with a specific wavelength have enough energy to excite the electrons. They are therefore absorbed while photons of other wavelengths pass. The glass gets its color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectrons are only allowed to have specific energy levels. For example it can have a low energy state and a high energy state - but not in between! The difference between the states is called energy gap. Let\u0027s assume a photon has 1.5x the energy of the energy gap. It is absorbed by a electron which takes 2/3 of the energy away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens with the remaining 1/3? Will the electron emit a new photon with this left-over energy? Will it be converted to heat? A combination of both?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the awkward English.

Brick is made up of minerals, most of which are transparent in their crystalline form. In fact, most everything is at least somewhat transparent as a crystal. Or as a liquid. Or as a gas. It takes some effort to make something with homogeneous structure opaque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the reason for that sort of goes back to your question. If photon has too much energy, it can\u0027t be absorbed either. Glass is basically opaque in infrared, for example. You\u0027d think if visible light has not enough energy to excite electrons in glass, IR wouldn\u0027t have a chance. But there are levels there that can be excited. Visible light simply has too much energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there are really two ways that something can be opaque. Absorption is one of them, but material has to absorb across a broad range. A lot of organic materials with complex molecules do that. Metals also do that, because they have entire bands of energy levels accessible to electrons. But most non-conducting crystals do not. They might have absorption in a specific band of visible light, giving them a color, but they are still mostly transparent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second way is with refraction and diffraction of light. That\u0027s the real reason why bricks are not transparent. It\u0027s the reason sand isn\u0027t transparent. It\u0027s the reason that snow and crushed glass are not transparent. If you have a tiny little crystal of transparent material, instead of simply letting light through, it will be diffusing light. Take a lot of these together, and light simply cannot propagate in a straight line. What little light gets to the other side by random chance has to travel a much, much longer distance to get there, which means there are far more chances to get absorbed by some impurity. As a result, material is opaque.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T07:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf photon has too much energy, it can\u0027t be absorbed either.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh!

There are usually several levels with lower energy bellow that one. In that case, instead of emitting one photon with all that energy, it will emit several with less energy. This will keep happening until energy levels are low enough to start exciting molecular or atomic vibrations. At that point, that energy is just heat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T08:26:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I now understand how all that works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T10:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022*Aqua*\u0022 data-cite=\u0022*Aqua*\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to detect that light after the light source is turned off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.
