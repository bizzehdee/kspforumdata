Is there any way to download another copy of 1.0.5? I just downloaded a bunch of mods for it, but don\u0027t want to mess up my current 1.0.5.

Can I still have that save without the mods, just not play it, or do I need to delete it? I\u0027ve been playing since .21, and still don\u0027t know these answers...
