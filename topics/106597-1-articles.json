I know TWR 2:1 used to be gold standard for stockaero but for FAR you needed to be closer to 1.3:1 or less so you can probably eliminate most; if not all of those radial engines. I assume this is close to true in NuStock as well (at least it has been working for me so far).\n\n#1b) Speaking of the radial engines; those are the only things keeping the rocket from toppling over earlier because they\u0027re creating a large amount of drag behind the center of gravity (which has a stabilizing effect on the whole rocket). As soon as you stage them off you lose that stability thus the rocket wants to flip end-over-end.\n\n#1c) Somewhat related; the materials lab is very, very light for its size. I suspect it pushed the center of drag in front of the center of mass as a result which is why it worked for you the first attempt and not the second.\n\n#2) As someone said already, you need to keep the nose pointed close to the prograde marker on the navball so your turn will have to start sooner and be more gradual. This is especially true with non-gimballing engines like the LV-30T (or if you\u0027re a cheap ....... like me, SRBs).\n\nGood luck with your future flights!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T16:57:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 04:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WafflesToo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:08:47Z","Content":"This how-to question has been moved to the how-to section."},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T17:30:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A few things I noticed right off the bat:\n\u003E #1) Early in the flight you\u0027re accelerating at between 2-3 G and wind up going way too fast in the lower atmosphere putting a lot of aerodynamic loading on the vehicle.
