There\u0027s a couple high-score categories to be looked at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules: Stock only, No mods, Atmosphere effects must be at 100%, No cheats except unlimited fuel \u0026amp; rcs. To qualify, the pilot must survive splashdown over water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge #1: Tempering challenge - Throw you ship at Kerbin at the fastest velocity you can walk away from! Speed measured at the atmosphere marker (36K), I\u0027m going to set a minimum \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV of 7500m/s \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge #2: HALO challenge - Deploy chutes/airbrakes/start praying at the lowest possible altitude. Free pair of sunglasses for sticking the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be posting my entry shortly. Still perfecting some designs and trying to get good shots. I hope to see some screaming fast entries soon! Have fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
