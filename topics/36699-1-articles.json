I don\u0027t see it in that picture. An aerospike works well for that, though if you need thrust vectoring, consider using LV-Ns or LV-45s, and if you need more thrust:weight consider an LV-30.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also want to be sure you have the right ratio of liquid fuel to oxidizer for your ascent, that you\u0027re not carrying extra liquid fuel into orbit that your rockets can\u0027t burn due to lack of oxidizer. You have a lot of jet fuel in that picture, so that could be unnecessary weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: finally, check you have enough lift... if you have to angle up steeply to stay in level flight at higher altitudes, you need more wing surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"exbyde","CreatedById":58458,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T16:55:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*fixed*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust kidding.

If its toroidal, you might consider changing your placement, or making the thing a 2-jet and 2 toroidal (or even normal due to weight and thrust vectoring concerns). using a splitter on the back of the wide jet body and putting a toroidal behind the 800s.
