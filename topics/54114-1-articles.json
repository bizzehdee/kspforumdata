I suggest to divide the actions in an action group into multiple stages, which have a time delay between them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: Abort - fire escape tower - wait 2 secs - seperate escape tower - wait 2 secs - deploy chute. \u0026lt;= 3 stages\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you can trigger the next action stage by pressing the action group button again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: Abort - fire escape tower - press abort button again - seperate escape tower - press abort button again - deploy chute. \u0026lt;= 3 stages\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this wouldn\u0027t be so hard to implement(but I also think I have no idea how hard it is to implement features like this), but it could make some cool and complex procedures possible(like my example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you like my idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egreetings,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThemorris\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dun Kirk","CreatedById":11365,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T21:24:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got a better idea....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eaction groups can be placed as a stage group. same thing but simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luis","CreatedById":55075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T08:57:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dun Kirk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dun Kirk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI got a better idea....\u003Cp\u003Eaction groups can be placed as a stage group. same thing but simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been saying this since 0.18. The staging sequence should be a kind of action group. The other action groups fire all their actions the first time you press the key; the staging sequence can be activated multiple times and only activates the actions in the next subgroup each time. Why not allow all the part actions to be in the stage sequence? This would let you extend solar panels as part of normal staging, for example. And why not allow all action groups to be separated into subsections by having a \u0027pause\u0027 action to divide them? The first time you hit the key, everything in the first group activates, the next time you press the key it activates the next group and so on. When you get to the last group, it loops back to the first one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would let you have an abort group that fired decouplers, then separatrons, then parachutes. Rather than all of them at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor bonus points, you could even have two kinds of pause action. One that requires a key press to proceed, and one that simply waits for a user-specified number of seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themorris","CreatedById":73387,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T15:42:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, there is already a action group for the staging button.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T22:35:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, but as far as I can tell that\u0027s just a regular action group that is activated by spacebar.

What a good idea. Whilst I\u0027d thought about having a timing delay on the action groups, the idea of putting them in the staging tree is a stroke of genius! It makes remembering what your action groups are much simpler, as you can do all the requirements pre-launch, where you need to. Each AG could just have a simple box with (1), (2), etc etc to denote which button it relates to, but you wouldn\u0027t need to know what was on it if you\u0027d set it up correctly, which I think would help massively.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T17:18:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would effectively turn the 10-element action group set into a 2-dimensional 10xN matrix where each action becomes an action list. Each element would be 1 to N long depending on how many layers are added. AG3 could be 1-long, AG7 could be 21-long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like this idea because it means that the classic staging tree can become a list in the \u0022Stage\u0022 action group. It can still have a graphical representation and auto-population like current but you could add new, previously impossible, functions to the stage list like toggling pod torque, extending antennas, which could be later toggled the other way. The \u0022Abort\u0022 AG being a small list is a prime example where one key pressed a few times does all the abort stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does ask the question how should the lists progress: cycle, one-way, two-way?

Hit its hotkey and they all fire simultaneously, or at least one would expect them to.

I\u0027d assign a radial decoupler, booster rocket, and maybe a guidance module to fire all at once. As it stands now, the ejection force of the decoupler is the only thing giving clearance to keep the rocket from damaging the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, within the action group, I\u0027d assign the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS module -- engage torque\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadial decoupler -- decouple\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDELAY -- 2 seconds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBooster rocket -- start\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if somebody ever invents a proximity fuse, you\u0027d want an additional delay before that engages too, so you don\u0027t blow yourself up instead of the target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d expect it to work in the order of the list.
