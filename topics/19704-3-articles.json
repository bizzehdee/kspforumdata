One could even guess that perhaps the device transmitting the signal IS a pyramid that is now underground given that we have Curiosity\u0027s mast under a meter or two of Duna soil now. If Curiosity is now, for it to be covered in that much soil we can assume would be thousands if not hundreds of thousands of years, thus working back for a pyramid of any reasonable size to be buried it would have to be millions of years old.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above paragraph is primarily inference, just as one would infer that clearly they had nuclear fusion capability as fissions half life (or even plutonium for rad iso power) would have died out and the transmission ceased.
