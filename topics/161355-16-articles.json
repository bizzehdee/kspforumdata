It can\u0027t really go badly wrong - KSP could only continue being developed for so long before it stopped being profitable, maybe much more will get done in that timespan now. Maybe that timespan will be larger, who knows. I love squad and all, but the problems that have spanned multiple versions, defying so many attempts at fixing... maybe some of them can get resolved now, depending on what kind of resources KSP will have access to. Either way, I\u0027ve gotten 6 years out of a game I got with a $7 donation, which is fine by me. I still have most of my previous installs, taking up quite a number of gigabytes - even if this goes horribly wrong, I can fall back on those for at least another thousand or two hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Edit- As the dude below said, KSP 2 could be a thing.
