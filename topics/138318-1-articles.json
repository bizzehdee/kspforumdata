I would like to replicate that behavior. I\u0027ve been looking into transmitting science experiments and such, but I can\u0027t really tell how the orbital scanner module is doing it. There is no experiment definition for it, and as far as I can tell you can\u0027t create and hand a transmitter ScienceData without having an ID to go with it, which you get from the ScienceSubject class, which you get from the ScienceExperiment class, which comes ultimately from the science definitions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow is the orbital scanner transmitting science without a science definition? Is it OK to build an instance of ScienceData from scratch and throw an ID in it that hasn\u0027t been defined? I suppose there could be a lot of manual overriding going on with the whole transmission process and science gaining process, but seeing as how it works with any antenna (and requires an antenna in the first place), I doubt it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-02T09:06:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2016 09:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wheffle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wheffle","CreatedById":74893,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T09:06:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas able to find a little bit of info on this and figure out the rest.

You can use GameEvents.OnTriggeredDataTransmission to add your method to the list of methods that will receive the callback. The callback hands you the instance of ScienceData that was sent, the vessel it was sent from and a bool that is true if the transmission failed. As far as I can tell, the R\u0026amp;D system will ignore a triggered ScienceData altogether, so the actual parameters of the ScienceData (amount, ID, title, etc.) don\u0027t matter, and any science added and completion messages have to be done yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
