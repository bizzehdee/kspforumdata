New to KSP, as i just got the game after many days of wanting it. I have to say, its a hell of a lot better than i thought it was going to be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have question however. I quite enjoy sandbox mode, getting to make anything id like, but i can never seem to build a plane that actually flies without being horrible sluggish or flipping out of control on take off. Is there a trick or something to building the space planes or are they just some better than others at not horribly failing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T04:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAircraft are the hardest things to make in this game.

KSP is a blast, if you like it now you\u0027re going to love it more once you get better. When you\u0027re building a plane, turn on the mass and lift indicators. I recommend putting your wings right on the center of mass, and set your canards/elevators so the lift is just behind the center of mass (because fuel moves back as your ship burns through it). If you\u0027re still having trouble you can cheat a little bit and add a few reaction wheels to help keep your craft a bit more stable. Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rivin","CreatedById":125440,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T04:32:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah ive been finding that the rockets are easy to make, however orbits are still difficult for me. i keep doing the tutorial okay but then when i go try to make one myself, i never have enough fuel and never know where to start my burn. (height to start)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe planes somewhat work for me when i make huge wings, so there\u0027s that. just very slow turning and then rapid flipping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T14:24:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe consensus is that it is usually best to start your gravity burn about 10,000m (\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1 1000) high-- at this point, you\u0027ve risen above the soup and about half the actual atmosphere.. If you want to practice when to start the burn, you can turn infinite fuel on with the debug menu (F12). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor planes, you may want to look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/search.php?searchid=3469418\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esome examples\u003C/a\u003E to help you out.
