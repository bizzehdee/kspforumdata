So, let me start by explaining my problem!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELately, I\u0027ve been trying to use a decoupler or adapter \u003Cem\u003Eunderneath\u003C/em\u003E Liquid Fuel Engines to attach booster rockets or to have more stages. Unfortunately, when this happens, the Engine will prove absolutely 0 thrust, even though it looks as if the engine is operating as it should. Am I missing something here? I\u0027ve been looking for the last day or so and only finally decided to make a thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is much appreciated!
