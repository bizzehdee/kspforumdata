Also, not really a bug, but the mk2 cockpits are extremely sensitive to heating effects, and will straight up explode with no warning on reentry, even when there is no visual representation of heating."},{"CreatedByName":"Jananton","CreatedById":83920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:19:43Z","Content":"Number 2 is intentional. Heat and how to handle, or get rid of it is one of the new features of KSP 1.0\n\nIn fact all parts are influenced by radiated heat from engines and other heat-sources like for instance the new mining drill.\n\nRemember that in the vacuum of space only radiation lets it cool down and that takes quite some time.\n\nGreets,\n\nJan"}]}
