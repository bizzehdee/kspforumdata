Tech trees are pretty much by definition finite\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E, so some other kind of science sink is needed. It is just very hard to come up with something that isn\u0027t just converting funds costs into science costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience can be very much summed up as the process of producing new knowledge.

This would still be a finite sink though. Unless this was extended to needing to spend science in order to be able to spot asteroids, and the numbers you spot being dependent on the amount of science you spend. Hmm... There may be potential there. Particularly if the asteroid creation mechanism is extended to stuff like comets and Kuiper belt objects. You would need to use only a small amount of science to spot near Kerbin asteroids, but literally astronomical amounts to spot Kuiper belt objects. Being procedurally generated, these would effectively produce the infinite sink mechanism I am after. Rewards from contracts that involve these objects should also scale with the inaccessibility of the body in question.
