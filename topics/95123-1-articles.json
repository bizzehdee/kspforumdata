Initial planets start positions randomised? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This way optimum launch windows would be different for every new game. Helping make each career a bit different. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Program objectives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen starting your career define a primary objective for your agency. These could serve as a way of adding variety to your games and also providing \u0027victory conditions\u0027 for those who want them. On reaching your objective you can quit and claim victory or continue with or without a new set of objectives. As a rough idea they could be along these lines...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea. Business - you\u0027re in it for the money. Make X amount of funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb. Research - Gain X science overall with a surplus of X.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec. Prestige - It\u0027s all about the image. Gain X reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed. Exploration - Visit X number of planetary bodies etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously there are others, and combinations of these would add extra variety. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Anomalies - Make the locations of the monoliths more random.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Within certain parameters randomise the locations of the monoliths. This would ensure that you need to search for and discover them and not rely on memory. They could also serve a purpose (such as science or rep bonuses) to make it beneficial to find them. Although an in - game detection system of some type would be required for this and care would be needed when generating them to ensure they don\u0027t end up completely buried etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other anomalies could stay as they are as curiosities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I love this game - and it\u0027s still a work in progress so lots still to do and finish off before release and after. Really looking forward to seeing how it grows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T14:32:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E#1 will break many tools used to plan interplanetary maneuvers for very little gain.

As a long time player I\u0027m fairly used to setting my own goals and objectives, but I\u0027ve been enjoying the new contracts in 0.90 more than I expected.

I guess you need funds to upgrade, science for better parts and reputation... not sure what that does. But it\u0027s not possible to go all for money without science, or the other way around. You need both for both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. monoliths are ridiculously hard to find. You can randomize them, but I personally will never ever find them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess you are implying that the game gets repetitive if you restart it? I agree with that, but there isn\u0027t that much to be done about it. I guess every game gets repetitive if you start over. There are some randomized things in the contracts, like the survey missions. But apart from the cords it\u0027s all the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver tried some mods that add planets and moons?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Damien_The_Unbeliever","CreatedById":129715,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T16:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy (1) are you just basically looking for them to apply a hidden offset so that we say, advance the entire system from its current starting position by (say) 493 days and then call that \u0022year 1, day 1\u0022 in that career game?

You do make some good points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 I agree that this would probably be more trouble than it\u0027s worth as it would go unnoticed by the vast majority of players anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 The idea behind this is that IRL all Space Agencies will have an agenda of some sort, either of their own or imposed by their governments etc. This woukd be a way if simulating that. And yes to achieve any of the objectives I mentioned a combination of all the available methods will need to be used. But how you use them may vary depending on what you ultimately want to achieve, thereby giving a different focus to your game and encouraging you to try different strategies if you want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3 Yes monoliths are nearly impossible to find without any \u0027tools\u0027, even if you do have an idea where to look. But discovering them can be fun. Currently once you have found them you know where they are when you start a new game. With their locations randomised, and some detection tools in stock, then new play options are available. That said, I can foresee various problems with mechanics of actually locating them randomly initally. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPandaman.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
