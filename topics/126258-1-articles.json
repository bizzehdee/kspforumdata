Trajectories plots the course of an aerobraking or reentering spacecraft while taking into account the rotation of the planet and atmospheric drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, back to the point - this would actually be a good idea to implement; however, it would be pretty hard, considering how you\u0026#39;d have to record the orbital position of every ship, moon, and planet for it to work right. Perhaps a good method would be to use a 2D video which would be exported to mp4 format.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SchweinAero","CreatedById":126909,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T12:04:53Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027FCISuperGuy\u0027]Not really.
