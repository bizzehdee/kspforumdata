The Damned Robotics parts are cool if a little chunk, and the Robotic Arms Pack is neat but not that realistic as it uses magic magnetic effects from Lazor to grab stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is to use little docking ports to simulate the end effector and latch points akin to what NASA use on ISS and (formally) on Shuttle payloads. This way you\u0027d have to steer the two together and then dock them. What I don\u0027t know is if, for example, moving a module with another docking port with a docked arm will screw up the docking process? Perhaps this is why it hasn\u0027t been tried before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m going to try some stuff using Damned Robotics and the Jr docking port to see if it works.

In the early Shuttle program the MMU (equivalent to the RCS backpack in KSP) was used to fly out to a satellite and attach a latch point on a few missions.
