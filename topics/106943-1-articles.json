Anyways, I noticed some parts on my jet had overheated due to a particularly long atmospheric flight. So I landed, and let them cool off. However, the emissives don\u0027t seem to be working as intended. First off, they don\u0027t show up until to 50% mark at which point they just start glowing. After letting them cool down, however, they were still glowing bright red. According to the F10, they were not overheated at all. So I did a quicksave/quickload and voila, the parts were no longer glowing. I can\u0027t say if it happens to EVERY part, but in this case it was the goo canister and the first two non-retractable landing gears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EASUS G550JK\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECore i7-4710HQ @ 2.50GHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8GB DDR3 @ 800Mhz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EnVidia GeForce GTX 850M w/ 2GB DDR5 @ 1000Mhz\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T19:16:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
