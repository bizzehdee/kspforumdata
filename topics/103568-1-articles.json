There\u0027s nothing it can do that other electric engines can\u0027t.\n\nThe thing that makes it different is its power rating. The Dawn space probe uses 2 kW thrusters; it has three but that\u0027s just for redundancy. It only fires one at a time. The VF-200, in comparison, runs at 100 times that power throughput. It\u0027s that throughput that allows it to fly these shortened Mars trajectories with payload sizes suitable for human travel.\n\nHowever, you could achieve the same throughput by clustering, say, two 100 kW multi-channel nested hall thrusters, [like those being developed atthe PEPL at the University of Michigan](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t\u0026rct=j\u0026q=\u0026esrc=s\u0026source=web\u0026cd=3\u0026ved=0CDUQFjAC\u0026url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeepblue.lib.umich.edu%2Fbitstream%2Fhandle%2F2027.42%2F107090%2Frflorenz_1.pdf%3Fsequence%3D1\u0026ei=SqgjVcLtM8O2sQH2t4DgBg\u0026usg=AFQjCNHlRT5JG292Drq7hJ_TIDnbhKqSnQ\u0026sig2=INZj2Jce-B6G55FA6sciXQ\u0026bvm=bv.89947451,d.bGg\u0026cad=rja). Considering that the VASIMR is at the lower end of the electric efficiency range, a hall thruster operated at the same power throughput would post similar thrust/Isp numbers... perhaps having a somewhat lower Isp but a comparatively higher thrust. It would require packing more fuel, but would also have more oomph to accelerate that extra fuel along with the spacecraft.\n\nOf course, no power solution to drive a 200kW electric propulsion system exists today. Even the entire power output of the ISS devoted to the task wouldn\u0027t be able to run it. As such, discussing the merits of a 200kW engine is a bit moot. **We should perhaps be dicsussing the power generation solution that brings us to Mars in 40 days**, not the engine. Because as far as engines go, we have several different options just waiting in the woodwork. ESA just three years ago successfully tested a 19,200s Isp, 250 kW engine and then canned it and put it on a shelf because there was simply no use case for it in the foreseeable future.\n\n(A lot of this has to do with [there being a relationship between payload/dry mass, mission dV, specific power and electric engine Isp](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t\u0026rct=j\u0026q=\u0026esrc=s\u0026source=web\u0026cd=3\u0026cad=rja\u0026uact=8\u0026ved=0CC8QFjAC\u0026url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dtic.mil%2Fcgi-bin%2FGetTRDoc%3FAD%3DADA513936\u0026ei=LbTjVIPDL4HsoASN6oC4Dw\u0026usg=AFQjCNHxL-4st7lrzUUJ8ryVdkY7mrtXKw\u0026sig2=Ff5jujM1ebpyCb6YuCd71w\u0026bvm=bv.85970519,d.cGU). For any given numbers of the three former, there is an ideal engine Isp for that mission profile. At our current technology levels, we\u0027re creeping around the 3000-4000 Isp range to GEO... and a lot less than that to Mars. Only better power generation equipment will let us actually use high Isp engines efficiently.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T10:26:49Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 10:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"SeaDog","CreatedById":116151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T11:05:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The main drawback seems to be that we\u0027d need to get everyone feeling comfortable with nuclear devices in space.\n\nDon\u0027t underestimate the difficulties of nuclear power...

We\u0027re talking a big reactor here that has to be quite effective in terms of energy to weight AND electrical energy to heat, that can\u0027t rely on gravity or massive input of coolant in the form of air or seawater in case of emergency, which humans would depend on for several years for their survival.

This reactor would have a mass of 200 tonnes. \n\nHow would you launch it even if it could be built? \n\nLooking at the performance of actual reactors that have flown in space the specific powers is like 50 times worse. I did see a design proposal for a reactor called SAFE-400, which would have a specific power ratio of 13.5, still over an order of magnitude higher.\n\nAd Astra, the company behind VASIMIR, made a handy spreadsheet that shows what could actually be done with more reasonable performance characteristics.\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/Glover_1-19-11.pdf](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22015656/Glover_1-19-11.pdf) Page 25.\n\nEven 10 kg/kw it\u0027s not possible to beat the Hohmann transfer, and the \u0027sweet spot\u0027 configuration takes over two years.

Mind you, that\u0027s a huge claim. According to what we in the public have been told, calling it TRL 1 or 2 would make more sense. TRL 3 implies that they\u0027re so confident in their preliminary research that they can try for a laboratory proof-of-concept of the underlying principles. Of course, considering the whole Cannae drive shebang, a different explanation might be that they simply skipped the theoretical science TRLs 1 and 2... because they can reproduce a thrust effect in the lab without actually having any underlying principles to work with, or understanding why.\n\nThe Cannae drive research project is not really taken seriously right now, though - there\u0027s no budget assigned for it. It operates on \u0022discretionary\u0022 funding (whatever spare change the lab management can scrape together for them on the side) and makes only slow progress because of that. For example, they are struggling with doing vacuum tests because there is no money to buy vacuum hardened test components required for the RF excitation in the device, and they wrecked the non-hardened components they had on hand trying to get at least *some* scrap of vacuum data.\n\nThe VASIMR meanwhile is at TRL 6, with the contract just signed meaning to push it to TRL 8. There\u0027s at least a decade of serious development work that separates these two projects, even if we assume that developing a quantum thruster is as straightforward as developing a MPDT (which it is most certainly not). So we\u0027ll probably see VASIMR equipped spacecraft fly for a good long while before they get replaced with Q-thrusters (although, the mere fact that we can speculate on replacing things with Q-thrusters is mindblowing enough)."},{"CreatedByName":"TythosEternal","CreatedById":117821,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T17:30:05Z","Content":"I first read the following article in 1999, and it subsequently defined the trajectory of my academic career through grad school. It\u0027s worth a read even now as a layman\u0027s introduction to the field and specific devices.\n\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=RsHqYbQ6maEC\u0026printsec=frontcover\u0026output=html_text](https://books.google.com/books?id=RsHqYbQ6maEC\u0026printsec=frontcover\u0026output=html_text)\n\nAt the time, VASIMR looked like a very promising technology--and the basic concept still does. For a while, though, it looked like the main export from Ad Astra had been press statements and interviews like these. A few years ago, though, they started producing some real data and (even though there were a lot of unforseen efficiency issues) things looked genuinely interesting. The ISS test was going to be a key milestone, a viability demonstration after which power would be the only major remaining hurdle (though not a small one, to be sure). Everyone in the field, regardless of their opinion or cynicism, was excited for the test.\n\nWith that test having been canceled, though, you\u0027re taking about a relatively unproved technology (compared to contemporary, flight-proven EP devices) that\u0027s been draining research resources for 45 years. Even with a sound concept and in-lab prototypes, I\u0027m not optimistic about the project\u0027s future when the lead scientist is back to making exaggerated claims in popular publications to increase awareness in his project shortly after his main (and arguably the only realistic) roadmap to operation has, for better or for worse, been quietly guillotined. It\u0027s a sad, but common and familiar, state of a project nearing its last legs.\n\nPutting my crystal ball glasses on (and with my tongue safely ensconced in my cheek), I predict Ad Astra will not survive. The VASIMR engine will not reach an operational status, but the technology will be sold and used to evolve existing EP devices. Over time, you will see SS/L and Boeing (etc.) come out with smaller radio-injected fuel streams and maybe even evolved virtual nozzles. Once NASA reaches a point where they release an RFP for manned interplanetary engines, there will be multiple experienced sources who will scale up their own products to deliver. In the meantime, multiple scientists from Ad Astra will go work at a fusion lab somewhere until the next big breakthrough in large-scale electromagnetic engine comes from some random shed outside of Manchester."},{"CreatedByName":"nilof","CreatedById":119624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T07:59:13Z","Content":"Some news:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Aoa0waHiHk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nHighlights:\n\n1.

Essentially, nuclear reactors are never going to get better than flexible blanket or thin-film arrays in the inner solar system, period. With DSS megarosa arrays or ATK\u0027s upgraded megaflex arrays, the power can readily be scaled up to multi hundred kilowatt levels, at about 4 kg/kW.\n\nWith 2 MW of these arrays and either nested halls or Vasimr, you have faster than chemical transits to Mars, in the 4-5 month range. 800 kW is enough for ~8 month transfers with one third of the mass needed using chemical. Regarding payload, this is assuming an architecture similar to the one outlined in the Nasa DRM 5.0.\n\n 40 day transits are made of pixie dust and Ad Astra is imho ill-advised to mention them, but shorter transits with far less mass needed in LEO are definitely possible, and probably the best path to Mars at this point.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T08:05:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 08:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nilof**"},{"CreatedByName":"Karriz","CreatedById":58036,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T09:50:21Z","Content":"Is the flight test confirmed to go to the ISS?

At a higher T\u003Csub\u003Ecold\u003C/sub\u003E, conversion is less efficient, hence there\u0027s more waste heat. But, radiators radiate far more heat per unit area ([scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law) as T^4^), so their size might shrink, for some parameters.\n\nThere\u0027s a tradeoff between efficiency and radiator size; saving radiator mass might push towards higher temperatures and hence lower efficiencies."}]}
