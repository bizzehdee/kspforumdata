A few years ago, though, they started producing some real data and (even though there were a lot of unforseen efficiency issues) things looked genuinely interesting. The ISS test was going to be a key milestone, a viability demonstration after which power would be the only major remaining hurdle (though not a small one, to be sure). Everyone in the field, regardless of their opinion or cynicism, was excited for the test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that test having been canceled, though, you\u0027re taking about a relatively unproved technology (compared to contemporary, flight-proven EP devices) that\u0027s been draining research resources for 45 years. Even with a sound concept and in-lab prototypes, I\u0027m not optimistic about the project\u0027s future when the lead scientist is back to making exaggerated claims in popular publications to increase awareness in his project shortly after his main (and arguably the only realistic) roadmap to operation has, for better or for worse, been quietly guillotined. It\u0027s a sad, but common and familiar, state of a project nearing its last legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting my crystal ball glasses on (and with my tongue safely ensconced in my cheek), I predict Ad Astra will not survive. The VASIMR engine will not reach an operational status, but the technology will be sold and used to evolve existing EP devices. Over time, you will see SS/L and Boeing (etc.) come out with smaller radio-injected fuel streams and maybe even evolved virtual nozzles. Once NASA reaches a point where they release an RFP for manned interplanetary engines, there will be multiple experienced sources who will scale up their own products to deliver. In the meantime, multiple scientists from Ad Astra will go work at a fusion lab somewhere until the next big breakthrough in large-scale electromagnetic engine comes from some random shed outside of Manchester.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nilof","CreatedById":119624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T07:59:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome news:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Aoa0waHiHk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighlights:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Essentially, nuclear reactors are never going to get better than flexible blanket or thin-film arrays in the inner solar system, period. With DSS megarosa arrays or ATK\u0027s upgraded megaflex arrays, the power can readily be scaled up to multi hundred kilowatt levels, at about 4 kg/kW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 2 MW of these arrays and either nested halls or Vasimr, you have faster than chemical transits to Mars, in the 4-5 month range. 800 kW is enough for ~8 month transfers with one third of the mass needed using chemical. Regarding payload, this is assuming an architecture similar to the one outlined in the Nasa DRM 5.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 40 day transits are made of pixie dust and Ad Astra is imho ill-advised to mention them, but shorter transits with far less mass needed in LEO are definitely possible, and probably the best path to Mars at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T08:05:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 08:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nilof\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Karriz","CreatedById":58036,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T09:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the flight test confirmed to go to the ISS?
