The guys and gals of the other tribe must have been sexier than the ones they saw every day.

The contrary is the case: there are no (maybe one) hint of intraspecies violence in the lower stone age (until ~15.000 before now), but with the emergence of settlement there comes battle and killing. Pressure was not the reason of domestocation, it was the outcome. There was no reason for the start of plant growing and 1000yrs later domestication.

Highly durable RNAses are not just produce by one species here and there, species produce many kinds of RNases and a great\u00A0many produce highly stable RNAses. Some of the most \u0027ancient\u0027\u00A0are combinations of RNA and small polypeptides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u00A0is one particular critter that is going to be a real problem with RNA. The logic here is that free phosphate has a problem, we can see the problem olong the coast of Florida, in natures it exist at very low concentration of sea water, not just any sea water, but sea water that has abundant plant life. Very quickly phosphate goes down, but not by bioaccumulation. During a primative sea there would have been alot of partially reduced metals . . . . .\u00A0copper I, iron I and II. The only metals that become fully oxidized are sodium, magnesium, etc. Sulfite/sulfate/sulfide\u00A0was also not so oxized.. But the moment the cyanobacterium start fixing CO2, redox\u00A0rises, then local phosphate concentration\u00A0starts to drop, sulfate concentrations rise. Phosphate is a trivalent ion,\u00A0heat it up to about 60\u0027c and it pretty much precipitates on anything except the monovalent cations. So that free soluble phosphate drops around photosynthetic redox potentials, and where the worlds greatest phophate reserves, such as in UTah,\u00A0are found before the GOE. These cyanobacterium can fix nitrogen if it disaapears, but not phosphate, they require phosphate in the ppb range to fix nitrogen, this is probably and evolved efficiency, in ancient survival required recycling linked phophate. and as you see large outbreaks of cyanobacterial nitogen fixation are wholey not good for other life forms, their nitrogen forming cysts are filled with some of the most toxic organic known to eucaryotes. When they went through the local sensitive biotypes, of course they are going to chew up RNA from the dead organisms for phosphate. So right within\u00A0one phyla you have a virtually\u00A0perfect sustained block for any new RNA based life from ever developing, RNA nor phosphate is stably available at the concentratins required for life to form up until humans arrive and produce sustained agriculture. Yeah,msure volcanoes belch it out from time to time, huge dieoffs can create conditions were its stable, but not long enough for life to evolve.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a scenario whereby cyanobacterium killed off\u00A0all life, and blocked eucaryotes from evolving. But fortunately for us archaean were very diverse, and the predator can become the prey, Eucaryotes split the role of phototrophs and quelled the big cycles. Not only ridding the world of RNA based nonvirals but both DNA bearing alternatives. As we know however archae can live in very bizarre circumstances including places where those poisons are not stable. So once\u00A0archean communities get established with stable DNA inheritance, the cyanobacterium cannot kill them off, and you see the rise of obligate commensal communities.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that actually defines the problem. When we talk about evolution and when\u00A0we specifically talk about a transition between a probable\u00A0bioneogenesis and evolution that can be monitored via paleontologicalnand molecular cladistics, we are talking about the natural history of the Earth and not the natural history of any other world, maybe without a comparable\u00A0in the universe.
