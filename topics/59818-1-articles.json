corps - a deep-space manned mission that would pass ahead of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, conduct a series of observational reports and materials analysis, and return. Several days later, Engineering turned in their prototype for review. Unfortunately, someone spilled coffee on the blueprints and the \u003Cem\u003EKerman Voyager\u003C/em\u003E plans were abandoned for fear that the caffeine had somehow corrupted the design. (Only later did they learn that the pot had been \u003Cem\u003Edecaf\u003C/em\u003E.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStuck with soggy blueprints and a looming deadline, Engineering dusted off the schematics for their failed \u003Cem\u003ELongshot\u003C/em\u003E unmanned probe and scribbled in new parts until they were pretty sure it would carry a Kerbal into orbit without exploding. Best of all, having a live pilot meant this time it wouldn\u0027t run out of battery charge halfway to Minmus and end up orbiting the sun as an inert heap of metal. Thus, the \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot 1\u003C/em\u003E was born.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222014-01-12_00005.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f321/Kieve/2014-01-12_00005.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssigned to the \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E were five of the most courageous pilots Command couldn\u0027t figure out what to do with - Kerny, Diloly, Jenmund, Danbrett, and Heneny. Tired of being passed over for missions - and particularly, of being neglected in favor of unmanned drone craft which Command was so enamored with - they were only too happy to accept the assignment. Since the \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E was being ferried into orbit by the well-tested Orbital Hauler lifter, the five felt perfectly safe as they were strapped into their cockpits. Kerny, being the senior pilot, was assigned the lead capsule and would have control of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222014-01-07_00001.jpg~original\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f321/Kieve/2014-01-07_00001.jpg~original\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrue to form, the Orbital Hauler engines got them into orbit with plenty of delta-V to spare. Deciding to burn off the extra fuel before dumping the main engine, Kerny left the final stage attached, using it to boost them into an escape trajectory. Even then, there was still half the fuel left. Clearly, Engineering hadn\u0027t thought to downsize the OHL any for the lighter payload. If they had, the \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s crew would have discovered the problem much sooner...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was more than a day out from Kerbin when Kerny decided the extra weight of the massive OHL would impede their ability to maneuver, and was unnecessary for gaining a return trajectory. He hit the release to decouple the stage - but the OHL remained firmly attached. Confused and troubled, he went on EVA to have a look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222014-01-05_00006.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f321/Kieve/2014-01-05_00006.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222014-01-05_00007.jpg~original\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f321/Kieve/2014-01-05_00007.jpg~original\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thick struts keeping the \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E stable were bolted down tight between the Hauler and their vessel\u0027s own heat shielding. There was nothing he could do to dislodge the derelict engine from their craft - and worse, the added weight would make reentry impossible. The \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E would shatter when the full weight of the OHL hit their chutes. To make matters worse, Jenmund and Danbrett were trapped in their cabins. A fault in the doors prevented them from exiting, meaning even if a rescue ship was sent up, two of the crew would still be lost to the void. Distressed, Kerny radioed Command to inform them of the situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution, when he heard it, sent chills down his spine. \u003Cem\u003EThey were going to ram the ship.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem, Command explained, was the adapter the struts had been bolted to. If that could be destroyed, the rest of the ship should have no trouble disconnecting from the OHL. It was risky and dangerous, but Kerny knew it was also their best chance to get free of the offending lifter stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222014-01-07_00002.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f321/Kieve/2014-01-07_00002.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222014-01-07_00003.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f321/Kieve/2014-01-07_00003.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt dawn, the newly minted \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Javelin\u003C/em\u003E was sent up. Essentially a drone-controlled battering ram, the long nose section had been impact-tested to a speed of 30 meters per second. The adapter ring on the OHL could only withstand a third of that. Waiting in intersect orbit, the \u003Cem\u003EJavelin\u003C/em\u003E would meet the \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E as it returned, the two would match orbits, and the drone would attempt to destroy the OHL adapter and the struts holding it to the \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo help match up with the \u003Cem\u003EJavelin\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s orbit, Kerny was to conserve the rest of the OHL\u0027s fuel and burn retro just enough to cancel their planned escape from Kerbin. The rest would be used to bring the \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E into a stable orbit around Kerbin again. Rendezvous however, would not be for another seven days. In a week\u0027s time, they\u0027d find out if the \u003Cem\u003EJavelin\u003C/em\u003E would work - or kill them all in the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil then, it would wait...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222014-01-05_00005.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f321/Kieve/2014-01-05_00005.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSmall floodlights flickered to life as the dormant \u003Cem\u003EJavelin\u003C/em\u003E woke from its slumber. \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E was returning - it was time to match orbit and free the trapped vessel. At some point, debris had sheared off two of its solar panels, but the \u003Cem\u003EJavelin\u003C/em\u003E was still receiving plenty of charge from the remaining six, and had plenty of battery reserves. When \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E was within range, it would be ready.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn board the \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E, Kerny was lining up for their aerobrake pass. As far out as their craft had ventured, it would take more than what was left in the OHL tanks to realign their orbit into something resembling stable. The \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E shuddered and the smell of burning ozone filled the cabin as it scorched through Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere, but soon enough they were settled once more around their homeworld, and on a near-perfect intercept with their robotic rescuer. Even after matching its orbit, the OHL \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E had plenty of fuel left. Wryly, Kerny wondered if maybe they should have just made a pass by Eve before coming back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike an inquisitive beast, the \u003Cem\u003EJavelin\u003C/em\u003E drifted in close, examining the \u003Cem\u003EDeepshot\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s underside, and the faulty linkage that fastened it to a lethal amount of dead weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222014-01-14_00020.jpg~original\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f321/Kieve/2014-01-14_00020.jpg~original\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio crackled to life as Command relayed the drone\u0027s report. \u0022\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Javelin\u003C/em\u003E reading green, Kerny.

Their primary goal would be to extract as much Science data from Duna, Ike, and the surrounding space as they could. To this end, their first act was the development of the SEED module - a self-contained disposable unit housing all available scientific equipment and instruments. After readings were taken, the data could be collected and the units jettisoned to save weight. After their SSTO idea fell through however, the SEED project was suspended, pending further review.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, the Kerbals turned their attention to the centerpiece of the mission - the \u003Cem\u003EDuna Orbiter\u003C/em\u003E. This mobile station would be responsible for bringing their explorer team into Duna\u0027s system, and serving as a base of operations while smaller vessels were sent down to the surface to collect data. To enhance stability, docking ports were doubled-up, with space for three fuel tanks and three nuclear boosters in an alternating radial configuration around the central tower.

All of these ascents were performed with drone cores, leaving Sigby bored out of his mind most of the time. Meanwhile, Engineering struggled to finalize the SEED puzzle. With SSTO use abandoned, that left them with traditional landers. The trouble was, their lander designs thus far had no accommodation for extra devices docked to them, nor had they attempted to land on a planet with atmosphere before. It also left the question of how many launches Command was willing to do in order to complete the \u003Cem\u003EDuna Orbiter\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s payload. Two booster pylons were scheduled to go up in the next few days, plus a launch for each of their six proposed SEED landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, one of the engineers revisited the SEED concept itself. Slimming it down until it was barely more than two materials labs and an RCS tank held together with duct tape, he proposed the new design was small enough to be mounted under a traditional lander. The weight was almost nonexistent, and would be jettisoned before return. They reviewed the data from the \u003Cem\u003ESeer\u003C/em\u003E and developed a new lander, carrying just enough ground clearance to mount one of the redesigned SEEDs.

I\u0027m not overly fussed about restarting, as I\u0027ll still have all my designs and subassemblies saved (just a matter of doing the grunt-work and contracting to restore the tech and building upgrades - and most of that I worked through in two days).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll input is welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just an amusing little by-note.
