Aliasing often happens in the time-dimension when taking discrete samples of a repeating analog thing and the sample rate isn\u0027t fast enough to give you enough \u0022in between\u0022 positions to see the repetition properly. (i.e. if you use a film camera that captures video at 24 frames a second you can\u0027t get a proper animation of a wheel spinning at anything faster than half that (12 revs per second). It will start looking like it\u0027s standing still, or going backward. And that\u0027s assuming the wheel has some obvious visual feature you can use to see how far it\u0027s rotated (i.e. a line painted marking a radius from edge to center.) If the wheel has symmetry that repeats several times through its rotation (i.e. spokes every 30 degrees so you can\u0027t see the difference between it rotated at 0, 30, 60, 90, etc degrees and they all look the same) then the problem happens even at much slower wheel speeds. This sort of effect you see in old westerns, where the wagon wheels rotate backward in the film, is a kind of aliasing.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn pixelized graphics, one type of aliasing that occurs is to have jagged stair-step diagonal lines when the analog thing being simulated was meant to be a straight line. This happens in font renderers as well as in 3d graphics renderers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that specific context, anti-aliasing refers to making the pixels along the edge of the line a shade partway between the color on one side and the color on the other side of the line rather than just making them fully one or the other color. The human vision processing system is used to dealing with less than perfect resolution from its retinas, and having to \u0022cook\u0022 the data quite a bit before your conscious brain sees it. When it sees an area of one color next to an area of another color, and the sensors right on the edge between them are registering colors partway between those two colors, it will pick this up and interpret it thusly: \u0022my retina isn\u0027t high-res enough to resolve exactly where this edge is, and so I\u0027m getting a bit of a fuzzy result here. If the color I\u0027m getting from this pixel on my retina is closer to the color of the area on the left than the color of the area on the right, then that\u0027s telling me that the real location of the edge is closer to the right side of this single data pixel than the left side of it.\u0022 The purpose of computer graphics anti-aliasing is to trigger this behavior that the human brain is already hardwired to perform. The brain is already used to interpolating between the \u0022pixels\u0022 of its retina. By feeding it information simliar to what it\u0027s own retina would feed it if it wasn\u0027t high-res enough to resolve the pixels of the screen, it makes your brain \u0022see\u0022 the smooth edges just like it would when viewing an object that\u0027s naturally coming out \u0022pixelated\u0022 on its own retinas (due to fog, or poor focus, or the object being too distant, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, your retinas really do have pixels and really do have to register images in a \u0022digitized\u0022 way - unable to see the data points between \u0027pixels\u0027. It\u0027s just that your natural \u0022pixels\u0022 aren\u0027t arranged in a nice regular Cartesian grid like they are on a computer screen. It\u0027s more like a random shotgun scatter pattern.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T21:22:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow are jagged lines an aliasing artifact?
