I use to be able to control the ships even without rcs units and it worked fine, albeit it was a little slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\\\u0027s say I try to turn by pressing the D key. The ship starts turning but it also starts rotating and soon enough, I lose control of the ship and the only way to fix it is by using the engine. Another thing I\\\u0027ve noticed is how much all the ships I\\\u0027ve had enjoy breaking the connections between itself and other pieces, in particular the decouplers. I\\\u0027ve noticed with plenty of weight, the engines are fine. But as those tanks empty, the ship starts wanting to buckle under the added stress. And so far, all my ships enjoy rotating even with ASAS on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s a nice little challenge having to completely change your rocket design though, since the added power of the new engines is too much for most of the parts to handle at full power. Lots of struts spam.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
