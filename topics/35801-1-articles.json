Unless you give the thing a huge kick when you do that, though, you\u0027ll only have a few hours on the surface, tops. If you\u0027re going to expect someone to survive for several days, then you need to bring along something about the size of the Apollo capsule at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say the best you could do (thinking Mercury, here) is have a small crew capsule undock from the large interplanetary habitat a few days (maybe a couple weeks, tops) before encounter, give itself a significant dV kick to give at least a day on the surface in head start time on the mothership, then perform a direct descent and landing to the surface. The ascent vehicle would be very small (think like some lawn chairs on top of a fuel tank), and would have to perfectly time the launch and boost to intercept the mothership, which would then be responsible to maneuver in close enough for either capture with a robotic arm or EVA. The savings for this system would be in not having to slow down and reboost the interplanetary habitat, as well as whatever dV could be saved by using the flyby as a gravity assist maneuver to get an encounter with Earth on the way back out. The costs would come mostly from the extra kick you\u0027d have to give the lander in order to get a lead on the habitat, as well as the extra costs of slowing down from the non-optimized encounter by the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving thought about it, it doesn\u0027t sound so crazy after all in terms of the savings/cost analysis, and I could imagine seeing some potentially large mass savings for an actual mission, depending on lots of other parameters, like the actual mass of the required interplanetary habitat for shielding and other purposes, etc. The real problem with this plan is that there is very little time for anything to be fixed if even a single thing goes wrong once the lander leaves the habitat, and there is absolutely no backup if there is a significant delay in the ascent phase. Even in Apollo, they could have fiddled with the engines on the surface and waited for the next orbit of the CM, and the CM could come get them if they got into a bad orbit due to engine trouble after liftoff, but with this plan, there would be exactly one chance for the engines to work, and after that it would likely be impossible to reach the habitat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, I don\u0027t know the exact mechanics of the flyby. Maybe you could arrange it so that you had some extra dV in the ascent stage so that you could catch up to the habitat after a little bit of a cruise. All these things add weight, though, and cut into the savings in the first place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that there are this many considerations tells me the plan isn\u0027t totally crazy, and it may be worth a look just to get an idea of the feasibility of it.

That unit is 1.3 tonnes of mass on Moho.

Before trying it I really am trying to gauge if you could accurately catch something going by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second thought was to send 2 separate ships with the second being the return vessel that doesn\u0027t slow down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know.

Flybys are a lot easier than intercepts though. If you have enough delta-v to get out of Kerbin\u0027s SoI and a little more for trajectory correction maneuvers, you can visit the SoI of any body in the game provided you\u0027re willing to wait long enough.
