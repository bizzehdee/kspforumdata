There\u0027s also the fact that even if asteroids in KSP had gravity, it\u0027d be so negligible that it wouldn\u0027t be worth simulating. Take the case of a class E asteroid; they max out at a mass of about 3800 tonnes (3.8*10^6 kg) and are about 30 meters across. Surface gravity can be derived from Newton\u0027s Law of Gravitation, which states g = GM/r^2, where G is the gravitational constant of the universe, M is the mass and r is the radius (we\u0027ll treat the rock as a sphere even though it\u0027s procedurally generated and never perfectly spherical). 30 meters across means a radius of roughly 15 meters. Given those values, the surface gravity - and mind you, this is for the largest rock that KSP generates - is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eg = GM/r^2 = (6.67*10^-11 * 3.8*10^6) / 15^2 = .000001126\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is about 1/43,500 the surface gravity of Gilly, if I\u0027ve done the math right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T20:18:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xXIndestructibleEVAXx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xXIndestructibleEVAXx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E.....because the asteroids are just big, ugly parts that aren\u0027t accessible in VAB or SPH that spawn randomly around Kerbin.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could edit the asteroid config to make it appear in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T20:29:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Engineer Of Stuff\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Engineer Of Stuff\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou could edit the asteroid config to make it appear in the editor.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the editor first loads, I see a moment or two with a jumble of parts in the sidebar; pretty sure an asteroid is there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T20:41:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022amorymeltzer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022amorymeltzer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen the editor first loads, I see a moment or two with a jumble of parts in the sidebar; pretty sure an asteroid is there.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make it appear permanently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lhathron the Elf","CreatedById":118706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T20:42:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Engineer Of Stuff\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Engineer Of Stuff\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou could edit the asteroid config to make it appear in the editor.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.
