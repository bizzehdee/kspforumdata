But I don\u0027t see how I can have enough precision in placing them one by one without using 8 distinct targets and planning each rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could edit a save file to add temporary \u0022VESSELs\u0022 with desired properties to have the required targets, and then delete them once I have reached my goal, but that doesn\u0027t feel right. At least to me. There should be a way to do so while playing the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d like to have, is an option at the Tracking Station to create a virtual target object (VTO?) orbiting a planet, a moon or even Kerbol, and adjust its orbit and position freely so I could set it as a target later to rendezvous with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I would first have to select the celestial body I want to orbit around, then click a button to create a VTO with default properties, then adjust its properties to match what I have in mind. Then launch whatever strange rocket I built for my satellite, select the VTO and target it, and rendezvous with it. When happy enough, I\u0027d delete the VTO at the Tracking Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this an interesting suggestion? Is there already a mod that give this functionality?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd does anyone have a better name than VTO?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T20:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can roughly get your orbit where you want in the map view.

The game already plots orbits for contracts; it would be cool if the player could harness that functionality for his own needs. Would need a UI, of course...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
