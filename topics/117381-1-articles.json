But there is no reason why that wind speed vector has to be zero.\n\n**Weather**\n\nDefine the wind speed vector as a function of position and time for any point in the atmosphere. For example, you could have a planet with strong equatorial storms where the wind speed varies wildly from zero, making a polar landing safer. Or you could have biomes with updrafts and downdrafts that allow for gliding.\n\n**Rings**\n\nCreate a narrow volume of atmosphere around the planet with well defined edges, with a wind speed vector equal to the velocity vector necessary for a circular orbit. This ring would constitute a navigational hazard that would need to be avoided in one of three ways:\n\n1. Simply not crossing the equator between the inner and outer radii of the ring.\n\n2. Matching velocities with the ring such that passing through the ring does not cause sufficient heating to cause damage.\n\n3. Use a heat shield correctly oriented to protect your ship as you pass through the ring."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T09:50:50Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to see more rocks and visible gravel in the planet rings.
