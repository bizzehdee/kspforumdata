I couldn\u0027t get back on working on the development of this mod for a long time and may not be able to do so sooner. So this project is officially haulted for the time being. If someone out there who could work on this mod to update it or even make it better is more than welcome to do so. \n\n![shipEffects.png?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/42m2qy2ssomxg59/shipEffects.png?dl=1)\n\nWe all wished we could hear our spaceship cry while entering Eve, or accelerating with a bunch of Mainsails. This mod fills in the remaining gap in the sound effects part. This adds rattles, vibrations, stress sounds to your ship depending on how much thrust, gravitational and atmospheric forces is your ship enduring.\n\nThis is my first mod ever written, thanks to the peeps at [Kerbal Sound Overhaul Project](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55227-Kerbal-Sound-Overhaul-Project) for sharing as much information they can.

Playing with This and Kerbquake completes the experience. \n\nBTW, it is possible for you guys to create your own soundpacks for this. the original soundpack I created was focused on a more realistic side but I wonder what others could come up.
