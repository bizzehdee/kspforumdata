I have no indication what is causing this as it is happens randomly. Different rent vessels \u00A0with different parts. The only solution to stop it is to quit ksp and reboot. If I go back to the tracking station the orbit stays correct. If I fly the vessel from which I undocked and the undocked one is still in physics range that force is again applied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal Kommander","CreatedById":167507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T03:05:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI keep having phantom forces acting on my rockets.
