How are the voxels calculated by nuFAR? The main difference is that each \u0022flap\u0022 that makes up the nozzle is its own object. Same with the inner ring of flaps. I did that so that the animation would be possible (which I just remembered that I forgot to enable again...\\*sigh\\*). It also uses two thrustTransforms, both named the same, and both of those are underneath their own objGimbal. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![tPKVdyTh.png](http://i.imgur.com/tPKVdyTh.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![8IxyZWMh.png](http://i.imgur.com/8IxyZWMh.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T01:08:52Z","Content":"So ferram4 and I figured out that the problem is that the colliders are not closed.

When you place the wings in symmetry you then have to reverse the thrust on the wing that now has the flag pointed at the floor. If you first place a wing upside down then you will have to reverse that one and leave the other at default. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
