Pictures of the plane will help. A craft file, too, but I think that\u0027s of limited us because someone will need all the same mods as you to test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s your altitude when you reach 200 m/s (if high, you might be slowing down too much and stalling in thin air)? Does the craft fly well slower on takeoff (if yes, your center of mass might be shifting after burning fuel)? What\u0027s your angle of attack on descent: sharply nose up? Are you going into a flat spin, tail slide, or just dropping like a stone after 200 m/s?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing you can try is to lower your nose a bit near 200 m/s, maintain velocity, then start nosing up again near runway to bleed off speed. If your plane still stalls at 200 m/s at sea level, you need to add wing area, or shift parts around to keep center of mass ahead of center of lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s your takeoff speed? If you can\u0027t takeoff from the runway slower than 200 m/s you should probably add wings or adjust your center of balance and lift. Takeoff, cut your engines, and see how your craft glides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a last resort, if it\u0027s a wing area issue and you don\u0027t want more wings for whatever reason, come in very fast and trigger airbrakes, thrust reversers, chutes just before touchdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Syczek","CreatedById":163803,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-19T16:34:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/NESX3XS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/NESX3XS\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMine Space plane.

I suspect that when you slow down, the control surfaces can no longer overcome the weight of the forward portion of the craft. Try shifting some of the wings farther forward.
