They just need to slow progression as you get higher up the tree so you don\u0027t unlock it all so quickly. They could have a geometric progression in science cost and science rewards so that, say, Kerbin-based science yields only 10s of points but basic rocket tech that\u0027ll let you get to the Mun and Minmus also costs only 10s of points but the earliest interstellar engine could cost 10,000 points, and to get that, you\u0027d need to have interplanetary colonies with research labs that could produce thorse points. And the endgame tech could cost 1,000,000 points which you could only (realistically) earn by building an interstellar colony.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224331166\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022220090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221697643097\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022143148\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cephalo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/18/2023 at 6:31 PM, cephalo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience in my opinion, should be where nearly all your funding should come from, and there should be a marketplace where people are looking for experiments done in different environments, and you try pack in as many as you can per mission.
