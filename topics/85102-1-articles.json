I\u0027ve installed on an iMac, but have found that my son\u0027s can\u0027t fully use the game when they use there log ins. I can get to the point of starting a new game, but nothing ever loads, even with admin permissions. I\u0027ve even tried creating their games using my user, then I can access the saved game, but functionalities such \u003Cem\u003Ereturn to Main Menu\u003C/em\u003E do not function. I\u0027ve searched the web and the forum to no avail. I\u0027m I stuck just using the main user account or is there a solution. I welcome any and all Kerbaunaut advice for this new explorer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbanaut Relpek\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sun","CreatedById":66710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-21T05:16:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10charsgrr\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T11:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a strange issue. I know squat about iMac OS, but is it possible to copy over or reinstall the KSP directory into their accounts directly?
