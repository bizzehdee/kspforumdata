Names Dusty, I\\\u0027m from Canada (Eh?) Spend most of my time sitting on my computer playing games, or trying to program new ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I bought KSP a few days ago and I\\\u0027m loving it so far, can\\\u0027t wait to see what comes out in future patches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was looking around in options and noticed the I could use Flight Controls. I dug out my old Saitek X45 but I\\\u0027m having some issues, half the buttons don\\\u0027t work, pretty sure its the drivers not the controls them self\\\u0027s, so if any one else is using a pair send me a message, I\\\u0027m going to try to check the forms fairly regularly. Until then I\\\u0027ll stick with the keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also looking at making a mod I\\\u0027ve got some experience in C# as well as few other languages but i don\\\u0027t know where to start on making a mod. I can\\\u0027t seem to find the basics for the programming side of a mod anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help. and Hopefully I\\\u0027ll be around to help other people once I\\\u0027m more experienced and know what I\\\u0027m doing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elater everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-08T16:04:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
