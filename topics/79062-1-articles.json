On this carrier, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m on year 1, day 12, 3h, 52min. I have completed 52 contracts. Have completely unlocked up to tier 5 in R\u0026amp;D. And have had 8 or 9 rocket launches. 3 have been escape trajectories out of Kerbin. A couple of mun landings, and other flights. I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even gone to Minmus yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about, it takes a certain amount of time to construct a vehicle before it can lift off. Based on part count. A few parts, a day or two. Something massive, could take up to a year or more. Planes might need to work differently. I know you can time warp to the date, but it might make things feel a bit more long term.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t if this would be possible either by Squad or a mod.
