This is more realistic, and requires you to do more mission planning. Your ions ran out of Xenon and you forgot to put a Xenon converter on your ship? Too bad, shoulda thought of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I like the idea of trace element extraction returning a percentage of the Karbonite. You\u0027d have to play with the numbers so that it\u0027s balanced, but again it\u0027s realistic and makes better use of the available resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat mod BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"freedomispopular","CreatedById":67616,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T20:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving only read the first few pages and not tried the mod out yet, here are my immediate thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

I don\u0027t like the idea of Karbonite existing as a solid, liquid, AND gas. I totally get it for reasons of simplicity, but I\u0027d really love to see added realism/gameplay by splitting each form into different resources -- perhaps even having unique/multiple resources on each planet -- each having different efficiency, efficacy, and value. Granted, that\u0027s not particularly useful right now since there\u0027s basically only two fuel types in the game, but maybe that could change in the future...Or maybe at some point this could integrate with Real Fuels?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkthespy","CreatedById":7644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T20:26:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sober667\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sober667\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehmm is posible to throw something like insane long anchor(like from cas) to \u0022 simulate\u0022 landing on the surface of jool? or is posible to land with ANYTHHINK on jool?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure internally Jool is an actual rocky planet, but only technically.
