KSP has some funny stuff going on with water impact. For a perfect zero-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E entry they should be able to take 3x their impact rating (15m/s for control surfaces?). I believe this impact resistance gets reduced with the sin of the angle. (I could be wrong, so folks can correct me.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I would do is build it with the surfaces\u00A0flat to the disk, and have them set on deploy at 0 degrees. Start with a fairly low RPM, and slowly increase the deploy angle and RPM until you\u0027re moving.

The prop blades are drawing a corkscrew through the air/water, and that corkscrew gets stretched out the faster the craft goes. You want the blades to have an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E relative to that corkscrew (say 3deg).\u00A0 Generally speaking, aim for the maximum RPM at all times, and adjust your deploy angle to preserve that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t done an electric sub yet (I just know entirely too much about KSP physics), so I\u0027d love to see the eventual results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Isidro22","CreatedById":197173,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-26T22:20:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk I see, would it be better to set the KAL (I think that\u0027s what the controller is called) to modulate the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E with throttle and set the torq and rpm to constant after the craft submerges?
