Which isn\u0027t an excuse for breaking the law and the forum/spaceport rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly, having having an \u0027unofficial\u0027 version competing with the official one is not a good idea anyway. It\u0027s happened before with Mapsat, and resulted in a lot of people having trouble when trying to switch back to the updated official version, which wasn\u0027t compatible with the old \u0027unofficial\u0027 one. In this case it also prevents the actual problem from getting fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPorting an old version is not in and of itself a bad thing: doing it without having the rights to do so is. The CORRECT thing is to ask Innsewerants to either release the mod under a permissive license or to give permission for you to modify it and distribute it. Barring that, the only other option is to restart from scratch. Copyright expires 70 years after the death of the author, so \u0027he hasn\u0027t been around for months\u0027 and \u0027there\u0027s no way to contact him\u0027 aren\u0027t valid excuses. There ARE ways to contact him, actually, just not through the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if it actually wasn\u0027t possible to contact him, modifying it and distributing the modifications are both illegal absent explicit permission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T02:56:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELast post on this \u0027issue\u0027.
