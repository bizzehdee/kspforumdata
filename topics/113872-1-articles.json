Occasionally I\u0027ve seen parts overheat a bit, but mostly in reentry. In game the UI gives no clue as to how much heat is being radiated by the vents, if any, or why they might be used. Can anyone explain to me? I would like to be able to start using them in my new craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERadiators pull internal heat from the hottest parts on the craft and radiate it off into space.

There is also a mod to auto-enable this feature whenever you launch your first vessel of a session.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackHat","CreatedById":138278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:38:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are intended to be used on very hot engines (Nukes for instance) or power generators (Space station or Moon Base power supplies) or Converter plants that convert the minerals on your Moon bases to Fuel/Oxy/water/food, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese types of things tend to run for very long times and get very hot.
