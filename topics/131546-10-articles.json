If they\u0027d just add those two (very simple) mods into the game, it would make me happy enough to recommend to my less nerdy friends. Fact is, Stock KSP is too ding-dang hard. Nobody wants to guesstimate their missions or crunch eleventh-grade algebra every time they log on, and wobbly rockets just makes no sense.

Usually because they provide too many options, too much complexity and don\u0027t integrate into the game as completely as they should. However I think a ton of the mods people suggest here could be added successfully after being tweaked significantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChatterer - Remove the Chatterer settings UI completely and replace it with a single on/off toggle in settings. Improve the quality of the beep audio file. Default to on for new players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E - Remove all game UI. Offer a simplified deltaV calculator in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E after upgrading the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to level X, price the upgrade to X in career mode so that players are likely to be already completing contracts at the difficulty of round-trip manned missions to remote planet surfaces. For in flight UI that helps for various things, add more sensor parts that come with an electrical cost and mass cost that can be opened just like the gravity meter etc. So your Landing-assist Laser Range Computer can give you their guess as to when to suicide burn, etc. Put these somewhat high\u00A0up in the tech tree. This kind of information is already present in the game and working well. Think about how parachutes tell you when it would be safe to deploy etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal alarm clock - Remove the in-flight UI and add alarm management to the Tracking Station after tracking station is upgraded to level X. Where X is priced at a range where players are starting to fill a lot of contracts by executing them in parallel.\u00A0 I think it would be in keeping with the game to add optimal transit window finding as a capability of the scientist of high enough star level, although realism would dictate that the ground station could always do the calculations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechjeb - There are a few tedious tasks where I think automation doesn\u0027t kill the spirit of the game. For example holding an aircraft/rover\u00A0on a certain heading. Restrict this capability to when the craft has a pilot on-board with a certain star level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemoteTech - Add a new part to the highest levels of the tech tree that gives a programmable guidance unit. Add control latency based on the distance of the kerbnet signal to the nearest pilot on the game\u0027s hardest difficulty level. The programmable guidance unit is immune to the latency for local control. Add more career mode consequences to loss of crew events at the hardest difficulty level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E - Either adopt steam\u0027s support on this or make a custom module management in the game instead of an external C# program that is a challenge on different platforms. Making it easier for players to install mods would take the sting out of choosing to not incorporate ideas from most mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the above ideas work well for career mode. Because they don\u0027t burden new players or ruin the first time experience of learning about orbital mechanics. However I think it would create problems for new players starting in Sandbox mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsers who don\u0027t want to fly lots of missions in parallel won\u0027t need alarm clocks, but they won\u0027t see the extra UI clutter too often since they probably won\u0027t spend a lot of time in the tracking station\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsers who don\u0027t want automation can avoid including pilots on their missions and instead enjoy the benefits of having engineers and scientists instead\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsers that don\u0027t want to program launch sequences can simply never use the remote tech part. Those that have mastered manual piloting can take the game to the next level by creating re-usable scripts to take the tedium out of building a remote base that might require 100 launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the most contentious one would be \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E and a delta-v readout. Certainly without it at the beginning of the game users will have to experiment to get a feel for \u0022how much\u0022 is enough. However it will rob them of the challenge of creating extremely\u00A0efficient, complicated missions on their own later on. But I think the number of people who would actually break out a calculator and benefit from that motivation is probably much smaller than the number of people who would start launching much more ambitious missions around the end game due to being able to calculate delta-v easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Thought","CreatedById":186712,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-25T04:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223135198\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131546\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221501402325\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175356\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MiffedStarfish\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/30/2017 at 4:12 AM, MiffedStarfish said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want any mods in stock.
