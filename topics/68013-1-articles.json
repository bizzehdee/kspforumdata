Mostly completely silently while we prepared. Hunter\u0027s Moon is not as far along as I feel it should be before reveal, but the testbed needs exposure and so HM has to be there too. The main push of development is still to come where most of it will be completelt overhauled. That time is only a week or so from starting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the description of the testbed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan for this game was to develop a greatly simplified version of the Hunter\u0027s Moon (see website for details) hunting mechanics that didn\u0027t depend on any of the main game features, and that put the focus on the AI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first reason for the testbed is to act as a research project for my final year of university by analysing the merits of training a complex Multi-Agent System with a Genetic Algorithm rather than doing it manually, the second reason is to aid the development of Hunter\u0027s Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe data for analysis is provided by a user study at the end of each play-through of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game will randomly pick an AI configuration at the start of each game (either manually tuned, or computer tuned), that adjusts the behaviour of the wolves. Both attempt to maximise the fun of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this project is concluded more AI development will be done to make it do everything HM requires and to flesh it out, but the basic foundation is here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDetails on the big game, Hunter\u0027s Moon, can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://gomisadventure.com/index.php/games/hunter-s-moon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s based on this ancient Dwarf Fortress mod idea: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=63082.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeedback and survey responses are very much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foamy","CreatedById":608,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T23:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnalysis of results is tomorrow; I have a reasonable number of results but not as many as hoped.
