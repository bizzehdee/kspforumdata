What I meant by relying on the core part is that when you start a new build by picking a part, symmetry goes around that part as it is initially placed. If you rotate it 90 degrees and attach something below it after rotation, and then attempt to put something by symmetry onto the attached part, symmetry won\u0027t work properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no way around that, it\u0027s simply how it works.

Your problem is that you started with the initial module turned to the side. Find the module that makes your entire construction green. Click under it to separate the bottom piece. Then click on another module and use a 4 way angler and then add the construction to it so you can get the array to be in the correct axis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
