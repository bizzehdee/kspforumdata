This means that increasing the durability of a ship has little bearing on the result of an engagement: While it might force one\u0027s opponent to use more ammunition than he or she would otherwise have wished (which is comparatively insignificant for the same reason: High warhead capacities), the defender will not survive the encounter. I do not like this; I feel it defeats much of the enjoyment of battling, as one is more or less playing a game of elimination, removing vessels one by one until a player runs out of ships. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, I propose to limit the quantity of ammunition that any ship can discharge in one turn. I feel an optimal restriction is ten tons\u0027 or two missiles\u0027 worth of munitions; i.e, one can fire an unlimited number of rounds as long as their combined mass is less than ten tons or two missiles of any (though perhaps cut further to one if someone brings a twenty-ton missile to an engagement) combined mass. Thus, it becomes possible for a durable ship to survive an engagement to unload the armament it was not able to fire its first turn, while a less durable ship might only be able to fire a salvo\u0027s worth (a salvo being a number of rounds obeying the above restriction); this would make effective armor truly matter in a strategic sense. Additionally, it would reduce the advantage given to the player that moves first, as without the basic guarantee of a kill the first turn becomes less decisive, as well as, in my opinion at least, make battles more interesting to watch and participate in: The final engagement might come down to the actions of two tattered, battle-scarred warships in a final struggle for dominance, rather than an undamaged ship simply firing at another and destroying it. Finally, fighters and bombers would see their value increased: With such salvo-size limitations, a fighter or especially a bomber could unleash almost as much destructive power in one turn as could a capital ship, sacrificing \u0022staying power\u0022 (these ships would likely exhaust all of their armament on their first turn, or, if they did not, would be easily destroyed by opposing warships) for first-strike capabilities. I feel that such considerations are currently lacking in battles, what with the massive power advantage possessed by capital ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese changes would, as they would make fighters and bombers more effective, increase the attractiveness of carrier designs. However, carriers are basically never used in the Naval Battle Club for a number of reasons: They are massive with high part counts and consume valuable tonnage; they are vulnerable due to imposed restrictions on their armor, making them soft targets for enemy warships; and most importantly, they introduce what I and no doubt most others feel is an unnecessary intermediate step between engagement and actually firing rounds. Why have fighters carry small ammunition loads from a large carrier when one can simply have a capital ship carry much more by itself? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, carriers could see renewed viability if the previously described salvo limitation were to be accepted. I propose this be done in a number of ways: First, by removing the \u0022heavy armor\u0022 restriction from them, as they are vulnerable enough having to provide a hollow internal space for structurally weak fighters without having to use far less durable armor across a majority of their surfaces; second, by removing fighter tonnage restrictions and capping total fighter mass to a certain percentage of carrier mass; third, allowing every fighter on the carrier to perform a sortie (rendezvous with target, discharge armament, return to carrier) in a single turn; and fourth, applying salvo restrictions on a \u003Cem\u003Eper fighter\u003C/em\u003E basis, meaning that each fighter, and not the whole carrier, is bound by the ten-tons-or-two-missiles rule. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese changes would combine to make carriers less of soft targets (though they would still be more massive and vulnerable than their non-smallcraft-carrying counterparts) and make exotic, intriguing combinations, such a battleship that can deploy a single fighter for striking long-range targets and softening up ships before its own turn, more viable. Additionally, carriers could support a large bomber and several small fighters, rather than a few fairly homogenous fighters of similar sizes and tonnages, while still being restricted as to their maximum sortie size so that they do not become too effective, as the fourth change would give carriers first-strike capabilities comparable to those of a capital ship with the current rules. I feel that this is balanced, however, by (again) the intrinsic vulnerability of carriers, their large sizes and tonnages, and the fact that they themselves shall likely forgo their own armaments in favor of additional fuel and missiles for their carried smallcraft; this introduces additional design considerations that I think are missing in the current \u0022metagame,\u0022 if it can be called such. Similarly, carriers are so ubiquitous in the realm of science fiction and space-based warfare games that I think it would be unfortunate if we were not to make allowances for them here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that the numbers I gave and even some of the smaller changes are highly flexible and could be easily adjusted--for example, one might wish to cap salvo tonnage limit at fifteen tons rather than ten, or make maximum carrier sortie size also proportional to its mass; I am simply looking for feedback on these ideas, rather than suggesting they be implemented immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy apologies for the wall(s) of text, but I would much rather construct a long argument than an insufficiently supported or fallacious one due to attempting to compress my ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, this might not be a bad idea.

However, missiles and armor are fairly evenly matched as of now; ships can simply fire more missiles than they can effectively armor against. This is true in reality as well: Could a fighter survive its own missiles being shot at it? Could a battleship survive its own bombardment? Probably not. But this is less relevant in actual warfare because the defending side can take active countermeasures to prevent or reduce damage, whereas we cannot due to the turn-based architecture of the battles. Real military actions would have exactly the same problems if placed in our situation; it is just that real life is not turn-based. This means that, if we simulate real-time engagements as best we can, no matter how advanced our weapons and armor become, they will remain in approximate balance; restricting salvo sizes is a good way, at least in my opinion, to do this, and so can endure for a long period of advancing technology because improvements in offense and defense will to a large extent negate one another. This negation will keep the situation static to a sufficient extent that rules that do not depend on technology but rather on how the game is played will not have to be changed unless something very fundamental about the game is altered (like moving to true multiplayer); technological advances do not alter gameplay sufficiently to do this.

It is in three parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Which carrier fighters move first is determined not by the tonnage of the carriers but by the Thrust-to-Mass ratios of their fighters with attached payloads. This means that ion-probe fighters will still move before standalone ships, but will be one of the last fighter groups to take their turns, giving up some of their first strike capabilities but retaining some initiative in exchange for their efficiency and smaller mass as compared to fighters propelled by other types of propulsion. This change makes sense from a logical perspective because, if we were battling in real-time, the slowest fighters would hit their targets last. If a sortie includes several types of fighters, the average of their TMR is taken and used for turn ordering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Fighters within carrier ships will move before any independent vessels, but the carriers themselves will not move until after all standalone ships have moved regardless of their tonnage. If one faction has multiple carriers, their turn order will still be in order of mass, just deferred until singular ships have made their move. This passively encourages larger carriers, as the penalty for an increase in size is less given that they need already wait, and a more heavily armored and thus heavier carrier will be more likely to survive to its own turn and its fighters\u0027 next turn. This also means that hybrid ships with powerful armaments, like the example of a battleship with a deployable fighter that I gave earlier, can preemptively launch a weaker attack (5 tons or one missile) against a standalone ship, but will have to wait until that ship moves before it can bring its full armament (10 tons or two missiles) to bear upon it, which I think is both more interesting and more balanced--such ships will no longer have the opportunity to take two turns before their opponent takes one, giving the opposing ship time to retreat or retaliate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: This is the most complex of the changes in this amendment to my proposal. I first remove the cap on the maximum tonnage of fighters that a carrier can have, and replace it with a maximal sortie size, measured as the mass of deployed fighters with their payloads. As I could not find even a set of rules that would give the effect that I wanted, I turned to the creation of an algorithm to compute it based on a number of factors. The algorithm is \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gmwSTYm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gmwSTYm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere S_max is max sortie size in tons, m_carrier is the mass of the carrier, m_fighters is the total mass of the carrier\u0027s fighters, T_fighter/m_fighter\u002Bpayload is the average TMR of launched fighters and their payloads, and n_fighters is the number of launched fighters. \u003Cem\u003Ea, b,\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Ec\u003C/em\u003E are constants whose variables affect how the algorithm behaves; I am still determining what they should be. However, as of now, the algorithm gives a reduced penalty for larger fighters (they still take up sortie mass, but maximum sortie size increases slightly to compensate), penalizes fighters with low TMR, and gives a small penalty if to a large number of fighters. This value is then multiplied by the mass of the carrier (larger carriers can field more fighters) to give the maximum sortie mass. These parameters were chosen because they all affect the amount of real time that would be needed to conduct the sortie; the longer the time, the less the sortie can carry (the best compensation one can achieve in a turn-based realm). The values of the constants are not yet set and can be changed to increase or decrease the effects of various fighter parameters on sortie sizes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, I am pleased with the flexibility that this approach gives; it maintains carrier viability while weakening abuse of salvo mechanics in manner that can be easily adjusted to suit combatants\u0027 desires or the will of the entire club.
