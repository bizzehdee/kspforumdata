I somehow managed to get nine-times symmetry on it.\u00A0I only put one\u00A0set of (nine) struts\u00A0on it, out of habit. I didn\u0027t even use launch clamps, but the 1800 ton behemoth\u00A0stood on the pad with only a little sag. After the photo op,\u00A0\u00A0just for kicks and\u00A0expecting it to erupt in a sea of explosions, I launched it. I had forgot to press \u0027Z\u0027 or even \u0027T\u0027 for that matter, so it struggled off the pad with a TWR of 1.06. I didn\u0027t realize this until at least 500m up\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yl9VKvf.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yl9VKvf.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t put on a single separatron, so I figured jettisoning the SRB\u0027s would kill it. The explosions seemed to confirm up, but I guess that was just some of them cooking off in the Twin-Boar inferno.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JPsoHNj.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JPsoHNj.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy this time I was hoping it would make it to space, so I used a slight spin to separate the strap-on boosters\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZT0kXO8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZT0kXO8.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, I hadn\u0027t tried to do anything close to a proper gravity turn, so my trajectory left a lot to be desired. But the Ap never did quite reach space, topping out at 69,900m The second-stage Rhino didn\u0027t quite have enough TWR to get it to orbit, even with all 24 NERV\u0027s firing. I may have finally pulled it into orbit, but once that Rhino burned out I had no attitude control, so that oversized nuclear tug had to be abandoned to a fiery doom.\u00A0Remember, this thing was never supposed to fly. No reaction wheels, RCS or vernors at all, aside from what the crew capsule had. Uh-Oh! The Crew! There were no parachutes either!\u00A0But there was a third-stage Rhino, which served double-duty, first as a heat-shield, then to slow down for the splash-down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Njryhsn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Njryhsn.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the mission that was never meant to happen went surprisingly well, even if it didn\u0027t succeed, but at least there were no fatalities either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater, knowing that it wasn\u0027t going to explode, I was barely able to get it to orbit. It helps to be at full throttle off the pad. It was still pointless, as there was no power generation on board, and that nuke-tug was hauling around a bunch of useless oxidizer anyways. And still no parachutes. Not the most efficient design, but it was only meant for a photo op.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T04:45:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKudos for getting that monstrosity to space \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Guess you\u0027ve earned the Whackjob medal \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
