For instance processing a surface sample from Duna on the surface of Duna would only enable using ore for over-thrusting on the most basic engines. You\u0027d need a surface sample from Duna processed in orbit around Eve for Aerospike, or processing a Duna surface sample on Eeloo for Ion engines.

The only thing I found NF that cause it to have a problem is the stated file CryoTanksISRU.cfg which straight install (NFP I believe it is) does includes the file that causes the problem. Also remember to clear the MM caches between test as that can sometimes causes a MM file effect to linger after the actual file was removed.

If / when -MM- returns we can find out more, of otherwise if someone picks this up to continue it. This mod adds far too much to let it go by the wayside. I think both of your ideas sound good, one line to increase output and another to reduce power usage.
