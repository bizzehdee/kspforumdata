(you would switch over to ion engines at the very top of the atmosphere- perhaps relying on KSP-Interstellar\u0027s plasma thrusters for scaled-up multi-dozen megawatt ion engine power to reduce burn times if enough Microwave Beamed Power were available...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I would like to hear player\u0027s ideas on the feasibility of this in KSP.
