From my understanding\u00A0of this article, there is planned to be no funds/contract system in the game,\u00A0because dev team considers, that it was too grindy in the original game. I disagree with this position. In fact the Career Mode is my favorite game mode for a very long time now. The only time i\u0027m not playing it, is when i feel an urge to tinker and have fun with airplanes in sandbox, which is one of my\u00A0hobbies (BTW this is why i really expect KSP 2 to improve in this area as well, but that\u0027s the story for another time), but when it comes to playing a campaign of\u00A0my own Space Program - Career Mode is my only choice. I\u0027ve never been an active user on this forum, or on any forum tbh, but the threat of not having this, EXTREMELY important feature,\u00A0in the sequel, made me sit and write this post anyway. I really hope, that sharing my thoughts here, will make players give it a seconds chance and\u00A0KSP 2 devs reconsider their position about adding it to the game, because it really deserves it. And here is why.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0Firstly let\u0027s talk about why the\u00A0Career Mode was called \u0022too grindy\u0022 in the first place.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0The contract system in the original game pretty much consist of the list of the\u00A0simple objectives and rewards with some RNG integrated, and feels like it was done in a hurry by someone, who had little idea about how to realize the feature in the first place and took completely wrong approach. As a result of that most of the contracts were about pressing certain button at certain speed/altitude for a minor payout. I\u0027m not arguing, with the fact, that it\u00A0was indeed very boring. It was. But it is important to note, that is an issue NOT with career mode itself, but rather with the way contracts were implemented, so it shouldn\u0027t be used as a reason to not include the career mode into the sequel.\u00A0The thing that is also worth noting, is that a\u00A0lot of people, who\u0027ve tried career mode, abandoned it almost instantly, without investigating the game mode further. Because of that\u00A0they\u0027ve had no chance of understanding good and important concepts, that this mode introduced to the game, so the community opinion about career\u00A0mode being garbage\u00A0was born. But i am not one of those people. I am one of the few, that gave the Career Mode a chance to prove itself. And spoiler alert - i wasn\u0027t disappointed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0The importance of the \u0022Funds\u0022 concept.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0KSP is a game about building rockets from parts and launching them into space. Some parts are better, some are worse, and some might come in handy in a specific situation, while being completely useless in the other. A good half of the fun in this game comes from designing a unique vessel, that serves specific purpose and taking some trade-offs in the process.\u00A0In the game like this, it is VERY important to keep the parts balanced, otherwise your\u0027re gonna end up with a same design being an answer to every question, which is obviously not good and will for a fact make the game boring. There is of course a lot of ways to balance parts, such as mass and size for all parts, and some unique parameters for a certain part category, like range and throughput for antennas, lift and drag coefficients for wing parts and\u00A0thrust and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E for engines,\u00A0when sometimes you sacrifice some thrust, in order to squeeze more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E out of your vessel, that is to reaching your destination\u00A0destination, and other times you don\u0027t get a luxury of having good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP,\u003C/abbr\u003E because\u00A0you need a lot of thrust to push your massive 1000t craft out of the atmosphere. And in Career Mode there is also a cost.\u00A0Why is it so important you might ask? Answer is going to be complicated.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0Let\u0027s talk about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s are great! They have almost no mass, they take almost no space and they generate electricity absolutely for free, regardless of any conditions. The only downside of them is the fact, that they generate electricity at really low speed, which can be countered with just using more of them. You can see where i\u0027m going with this. Why would i ever use solar panels and huge batteries(not even mentioning the fuel cells), when i have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s unlocked? If i\u0027m playing Science or Sandbox i can just put 20 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s on my craft without any trade-offs and completely forget about the electricity as a game concept. Not good. But in career mode i have a clear reason to not do so - COST. For the same money, it costs to put\u00A02\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s on my vessel i can launch a rocket to the Mun that will land there and return safely to Kerbin with crew onboard. A bit more ridiculous example: Why wouldn\u0027t you use a Daedalus engine to propel your 500kg probe into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E? Same answer. COST.\u00A0And that is where the\u00A0Career mode absolutely\u00A0shines. Not only it introduces a necessary\u00A0balancing factor into the game, that prevents player from\u00A0thoughtlessly spamming parts, that are \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E in other game modes,\u00A0but on top of that it also\u00A0FUNDAMENTALLY changes the way you approach designing your spaceship, by introducing unique trade-offs, that are present in no other game mode.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* You\u00A0want to launch a communication satellite to the\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.

I can just take all the data from them and not take extra weight back with me.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0Career: \u0022Damn these GRAVMAX and Double-C Seismic Accelerometer are so expensive! I think it\u0027s worth trying to recover them! Let\u0027s see...I can try snapping all the science on top of the crew module right near the parachute and hope, that it won\u0027t overhear on reentry... OR...

Hmm...\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0The Career Mode adds\u00A0new\u00A0and, most importantly, interesting challenges(or puzzles how the Devs are calling them) of getting to space, in the game\u00A0that is ALL ABOUT the challenge of getting to space.

You might still do it for fun or challenge, but the whole concept of making reusable rockets or even \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s becomes pretty much pointless!\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0In conclusion:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPros of Career Mode:\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Balance for the expensive late-game parts\u003Cbr\u003E\n* More challenges for the player\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Encouragement for a player to reuse rockets\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCons of Career Mode:\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Was too grindy in the original game (which, as i explained earlier, is not even an issue with Career Mode itself)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0I think it is clear now, that Career Mode\u00A0brings so much\u00A0to the gameplay. It makes the game even more in-depth and realistic (you have to remember, that rocket science IRL is not just about getting to space, but rather getting to space with the cheapest and easiest way possible, which is often forgotten by KSP community), it introduces A LOT of new opportunities and challenges to the player, that NASA,\u00A0SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab and every other rocket company IRL\u00A0faces and has to deal with. And i not just absolutely love that. For me it is ESSENTIAL in the game like KSP. And taking all this good stuff\u00A0out of the game, just because original game had\u00A0not enough good ways to farm the money? It\u0027s just unacceptable\u00A0in my opinion. So we have an essential, for this game,\u00A0mechanics - money and a fact of grinding said money was boring in the original game. What do we do in the sequel? I would answer - instead of\u00A0removing\u00A0money from the sequel entirely, it is better to rethink the way player earns this money. And i have some ideas on how to do so, that\u00A0i\u0027d like to share.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Not all contracts in the original game were boring. Most of them yes, but not all of them. Tourism for example. Riding couple VIPs to the Mun and back is nowhere near\u00A0a bad gameplay. It had it\u0027s issues of its own, like the required destinations would be a complete mess (for example land on Minmus\u002Bcomplete suborbital flight on dune on the same flight, which complicates the mission by a lot) if you visited a lot of celestial bodies, but that could be manipulated by the player. My strategy about it was:\u00A0if you land on the Mun to unlock Mun contracts, but then won\u0027t go to Minmus or any other place, so the game gives you contracts, associated with only Kerbin\u00A0(suborbital\u002Borbit) and Mun(fly by\u002Borbit\u002Bsuborbital\u002Bland), and all of these objectives could be completed within nice and simple Mun landing mission. If you want to learn more about this method of farming you can check out\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1557575971\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethingy\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0in the Steam Workshop, that i\u0027ve posted a while ago. TL;DR: rocket with 16 VIP seats could make profit over 2 millions per flight if you get lucky with contracts. Again for a relatively simple Mun landing mission that will take 30-60 minutes that is not \u0022too grindy\u0022 at all. My suggestion here - leave VIP contracts in the game, but limit the objectives in the\u00A0way, so there will be one single destination for the whole contract, that is shared by all the VIPs in it. And maybe some multiplier for flying a lot of VIPs at the same time (single VIP - 50k, x2 - 55k each, x3 - 60k each and etc.), to reward player for taking time and effort in designing big and capacious spaceships.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Another example of good contracts are\u00A0Rescue contracts. You get free Kerbal\u00A0in your Space Program(just\u00A0a reminder that in Career Mode you have to purchase Kerbonauts for those who haven\u0027t played it) and you also get paid for it on top of that. Pretty good stuff.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Contracts for putting 3rd party satellites on the required orbit are welcome as well. Also in my opinion it would be better if the game had some pre-build sub-assemblies instead of telling player to build the satellite\u00A0himself(ex. \u0022Hey here is my satellite. Put it in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E with 350km apogee,\u00A0400km perigee and 10deg inclination.\u0022 Player accepts the contract and\u00A0gets a sub-assembly of this satellite and only required to send it to the desired orbit)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Contracts for resupplying satellites/space stations. Player accepts the contract, pre-made craft spawns in orbit, and player has to dock with it and transfer certain amount of resource to complete the contract.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Pretty much advanced and combined previous 2. Client gives contract to get sub-assembly to orbit, some time after player completes it the same client gives another contract to send new sub-assembly to the old one and dock them together. Repeat until the whole space station will be finished. Some time time after that player will start to get resupply contracts from same client.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll these contracts will NOT be \u0022boring\u0022 just by their nature, but can\u00A0become boring IF the pay is bad, so the player has\u00A0to focus on them too much. On the other hand, if player would get paid well for completing them, they WILL be VERY much welcome in the game. I\u00A0would happily complete as many of them as needed, to fund my Space Program, considering again, that\u00A0the paycheck is reasonable.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Concept of funding researches with money would never hurt\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Idea of KSP 2 is to explore new horizons and find a new home for Kerbal kind. But that\u0027s a long term goal. To achieve that goal player has to get through a number of simpler objectives. And that Way could be similar to something like this, if the Career Mode will make it to the sequel:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll starts with a cheap prototype rocket launch, continues with couple of commercial satellites being\u00A0put in orbit and some tourists being send\u00A0suborbital,\u00A0to\u00A0fund the research and construction of new and better rockets. With new tech comes the Mun landing, that unlocks Mun tourism and funds more research. After that\u00A0player starts thinking\u00A0about building colonies, to expand his reach, so the great exploration begins. From Duna to Eve, to\u00A0Jool and Laythe and anywhere within the Kerbol System, until the Great Interstellar Ship has been constructed, while ALL\u00A0of that being funded by commercial flights i described above. Colonies start to become independent and will use on-the-spot resources to build rockets. So at this point the money will start to lose its value for exploration and after Kerbals arrive to new star system they will have no use for it there at all. All that of course while on Kerbin player can still continue to expand the commercial side of his Space Program.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd one more important thing to note here, that the \u0022Cost\u0022 concept should still be present for colonies, that mine resources, in order to build a rocket. This can be implemented through a lot of multiple ways, i\u0027m sure everyone can think of one. Here is the first thing, that\u00A0came to my mind first(don\u0027t take this one\u00A0too seriously):\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Add to the game basic resources like Copper and Iron, that will be good for most of the stuff and can be found almost everywhere\u00A0and some rare ones, like Uranium or Titanium, that will be required for high-tech stuff. Each part in the game will it\u0027s cost in the resources. When player attempts to launch build a craft in the colony game calculates total cost of the craft in resources and checks, if the colony has enough of these resources in its storage. Simple. Should work perfectly. This process can also be complicated by adding more different resources/making some resources to not be mineable directly, but rather\u00A0craftable from other resources (like plastic from oil, or microschemes from copper and iron, etc.)(Factorio vibes yes \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E). This \u0022cost in resources\u0022 thingy can also be applied to Kerbin, so that instead of paying for the rocket directly, player will pay for the resources, necessary for the rocket.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n* The thing above can easily be a limiting factor for why player can\u0027t build a Daedalus engine on Kerbin. It would simply cost to much. So instead of buying it\u00A0player will be forced to go and get resources, necessary to construct it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n* And if that seems\u00A0too complicated it is still a solution\u00A0to make \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s on colonies require funds for rockets, just like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E on Kerbin, in order to simplify things. (although i\u0027m not a fan of this approach)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n*\u00A0Also great addition to this would be an ability to disassemble landed vessels into resources, for the sake of\u00A0reusability.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve been typing this for couple hours already, so i\u0027m\u00A0tired and starting to lose track of my thoughts.

What??? I agree that a mode that forces design compromise adds depth to the game, though it was always an issue to me that the \u0022normal\u0022 mode rapidly becomes too easy, while the hard mode starts off too tight for cash (I also realise you can set custom levels, which I do).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne option for rewarding play/avoiding grind is for an \u0022automatically repeat mission\u0022 option: once you have succeeded (once? twice? more?) in a specific mission with any given vessel, you should be rewarded with a function that allows that type of mission to be automatically \u0022harvested\u0022 in future using the exact same craft, which can happen \u0022off camera\u0022, and which reduces your cash by the cost of your vessel initially and then adds the recovered amount and reward back subsequently. This introduces a cashflow and timing consideration for your missions, and a further twist could be for an RNG \u0022mission fail\u0022 event which adds no reward back, the % chance of which you can see before toggling the \u0022farm this mission type\u0022 button. This turns an initial success into a revenue stream (with a chance of any event resulting in a cash burn only - hence needing the player to consider what their reasonable \u0022buffer\u0022 should be - obviously not enough cash means the farming mission won\u0027t be launched), and over time could compound with other missions you choose to harvest in order to progressively increase your income (and make it a recurring form of income) that still limits your choices without leading to a bankruptcy scenario, and also rewards careful players with, potentially, faster progress.

How they were added had issues. I\u0027ve always thought KSP would lend itself more to an \u0022endless gameplay\u0022 model of play, rather than the unlock stuff style we got. Funds would make more sense to be the result of (Recent achievements) X (Historic achievements), so you have to keep doing stuff, but have more freedom to take it the direction you chose. Picking from a list makes it feel more like just another game.

For example, no need for a refuel contract if a station actually needs refueling, and you have reasons of your own to have stations full of kerbals out in space.

I also spent almost all of my time in career mode and had a lot of fun despite career mode\u0027s many problems. Early on I liked considering the overall cost for each launch and being incentivised to recover as much as possible. Unfortunately the presets for building upgrades and the balance of cost and mission returns were so bad I had to do what most players do and custom tailor the settings, and even then it never really functioned well. Part costs were out of whack, early mission rewards were too stingy, and late rewards were so lucrative I ended up with unlimited money and no reason to even think about it thereafter.

Almost everything about KSP 1\u0027s balance--the focus on launch costs, building upgrades, the volume of harvestable science points and the scope of the tech tree--all really lent itself to maxing out money and tech within KSOI. By the time you were mounting your first crewed mission to Duna you had entered the late game, and as we\u0027ve seen from a number of informal polls most players never even got that far. KSP sounds like a much different game. Getting to and landing on the mun is still tutorial territory, mid-game will be colonizing the outer and inner planets, and the late game will be exploring other star systems. This will probably mean way less emphasis on orbital delivery\u00A0and much more focus on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith that mindset, and with a healthy respect for a players time, what does money really add? There are two main aspects I think--the pressure to make more efficient rockets and the incentive to reuse and recover vehicles. I think there\u0027s a clue in the Shadowzone vid about how they\u0027ll tackle the former: by creating stricter limits on craft size and weight. These could be upgradeable as you level up your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and Launchpad, but across the board you\u0027d be inclined to build smaller and lighter whenever possible. Unfortunately reusability wasn\u0027t handled well in KSP 1 either because the physics range precluded most first stage recovery schemes, but it did incentivise space planes at least. I usually opted for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E tailsitters myself, which were fun to design and fly, but even I\u0027ll admit after a few dozen times manually landing payload lifters got old.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUltimately making a good game is about\u00A0maximizing the time players spend doing things that are fun and minimizing time the spend doing things that aren\u0027t fun. For KSP that core experience is building and flying spacecraft. Part of what makes that fun is of course the challenge of optimizing limited resources, but to me that should be streamlined as much as humanly possible so players can\u00A0focus on building and flying. Do we really need 3 different currencies to do that? I tend to think not, and though I wouldn\u0027t have thought of it myself maybe money isn\u0027t even really necessary. If the process of exploration generates points (whatever you chose to call them) and those points can be spent on part R\u002BD and building upgrades I think you could safely discard money entirely. If there are no contracts, just branching sets of potential exploration goals, then you don\u0027t need reputation either. I think it\u0027s possible that ditching all that managerial dead weight could free players time and produce a game in which within 5 or 10\u00A0hours you\u0027re already starting your first bases and colonies and getting into the real meat of the game. Keeping it to a single abstract currency also leaves more room for complexity when it comes to generating and managing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E resources. In theory that could lead to a progression that\u0027s both accessible and robust, because new resources and new layers of complexity are added in as you move out and discover them on other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-30T18:17:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2020 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Acid_Burn9","CreatedById":192392,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-30T19:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223793673\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194292\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221590831968\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268648\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Master39\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Master39 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me those are all challenges way more intriguing than the career and science modes of KSP1 and that\u0027s without even having to add an abstract layer of invisible entities that need launches from you in exchange for money, you are the one needing those launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are intriguing for sure, but that doesn\u0027t really mean it cannot be combined with career mode and made even better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223793875\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194292\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221590861953\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that mindset, and with a healthy respect for a players time, what does money really add?

I guess i\u0027m not launching this thing.\u0022 Most of the times problems like this can be solved with tweaking by clipping parts into each other, but it\u0027s not always the case. Sometimes you need you craft to be exact size for your own reasons. Yes there will be orbital shipyards in the game, but they will be available in somewhere in mid-game or even late-game. Then again player will not be encouraged\u00A0to\u00A0build more efficiently as long as it fits limitations. So what is the point of them? To ban player from launching big and inefficient rockets? It should be players decision and if he doesn\u0027t want to do so - fine. Let him pay excrements-ton of money for his inefficient monstrosity. Don\u0027t just ban him from doing what he wants. After all he is the one playing the game and it is up to him how to do so.\u00A0I don\u0027t think that it is a solution to ban player form anything. Player himself\u00A0should come to understanding of why it is better for him to build his monstrosity on the orbital shipyard,\u00A0instead of launching it form Kerbin. And that can can done exactly with money. \u0022Oh damn it will cost me 2 billions of billions to build a rocket, capable of putting thing thing into orbit. I can save a lot of money if i\u0027d just build it there in the first place.\u0022 Cost\u00A0is the key to efficiency. Not size, not weight, not anything else in the world. Everything always comes down to cost. Why is it better to build a huge ship in the orbit? Because it will COST to much to put it in orbit in one go with massive and expensive rocket. Why is it better to build a craft\u00A0that can do exactly what it needs to do and nothing else, instead of putting useless\u00A0on your ship? Cost. You don\u0027t want to throw your money away on the stuff you don\u0027t even need. Why would you want to reuse your rocket? Cost. I cannot say this enough. Cost is an ultimate measure of efficiency. Maybe not exactly in money. That is not the point. I talked about how money can be replaced with resources, necessary for parts. It doesn\u0027t matter that much in what form COST will be implemented, as long as it will be implemented.

I guess i\u0027m not launching this thing.\u0022 Most of the times problems like this can be solved with tweaking by clipping parts into each other, but it\u0027s not always the case. Sometimes you need you craft to be exact size for your own reasons. Yes there will be orbital shipyards in the game, but they will be available in somewhere in mid-game or even late-game. Then again player will not be encouraged\u00A0to\u00A0build more efficiently as long as it fits limitations. So what is the point of them? To ban player from launching big and inefficient rockets? It should be players decision and if he doesn\u0027t want to do so - fine. Let him pay excrements-ton of money for his inefficient monstrosity. Don\u0027t just ban him from doing what he wants. After all he is the one playing the game and it is up to him how to do so.\u00A0I don\u0027t think that it is a solution to ban player form anything. Player himself\u00A0should come to understanding of why it is better for him to build his monstrosity on the orbital shipyard,\u00A0instead of launching it form Kerbin. And that can can done exactly with money. \u0022Oh damn it will cost me 2 billions of billions to build a rocket, capable of putting thing thing into orbit. I can save a lot of money if i\u0027d just build it there in the first place.\u0022 Cost\u00A0is the key to efficiency. Not size, not weight, not anything else in the world. Everything always comes down to cost. Why is it better to build a huge ship in the orbit? Because it will COST to much to put it in orbit in one go with massive and expensive rocket. Why is it better to build a craft\u00A0that can do exactly what it needs to do and nothing else, instead of putting useless\u00A0on your ship? Cost. You don\u0027t want to throw your money away on the stuff you don\u0027t even need. Why would you want to reuse your rocket? Cost. I cannot say this enough. Cost is an ultimate measure of efficiency. Maybe not exactly in money. That is not the point. I talked about how money can be replaced with resources, necessary for parts. It matter that much in what form COST will be implemented, as long as it will be implemented. Money is just the most straight forward way to implement it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLots of good points. I don\u0027t even necessarily think\u00A0we disagree, it\u0027s just that we\u0027re thinking about it in different ways.\u00A0I think what\u0027s necessary here is understanding fungibility and how it\u00A0feeds into gameplay tradeoffs. Right now you can use money to buy more parts, purchase building upgrades, and hire new kerbals. You can\u0027t use it to unlock new tech or more prestigious contracts, that\u0027s what science and reputation are for (except of course using the admin strategies, which I think we can all agree are pretty poorly thought out.) But this doesn\u0027t have to be the arrangement. I fully agree having some\u00A0type of currency\u00A0that you can spend in multiple ways creates player choices and that\u0027s a good thing. What I\u0027m wondering is do the choices we currently have make for good gameplay? In fact, do parts themselves need to have a cost right away? Right now the early tier assembly buildings have a part-count limit, which I think a lot of people realize is a bad mechanic. It makes much more sense and creates a more interesting design challenge if you just can\u0027t build a rocket bigger than the assembly building itself. Whether you can actually get it onto the launchpad has to do with its mass. Those are pretty easy to understand constraints. The nice bit is you aren\u0027t \u0022banned\u0022 from building a bigger rocket because you can chose to upgrade the building itself. That upgrade is one outlet for our in-game currency. But what if you could use this same currency to unlock new parts instead of buying existing ones? Now your strategic trade off is \u0022I can either build a bigger rocket or I can build a \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C/em\u003E rocket.\u0022 That seems like a more compelling choice to me, and the nice thing is it cuts out all of the rigamarole of contracts entirely.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou could of course call this single currency \u0022money\u0022\u00A0or you could call it \u0022science\u0022 or \u0022adventure points\u0022 or whatever you want. What really matters is how a player generates it and what they can and can\u0027t spend it on. We live in a very money-centric world right now, so I can see why you would think that\u0027s the only\u00A0logical way for things to work. But I its worth considering how this changes once interplanetary and interstellar colonies come into it. If I\u0027ve got a Duna colony and Im mining enough resources and fuel to build rockets there, why should I spend Kerbin-money on it? And if Kerbin-money ceases to be useful after you\u0027ve started building colonies why base the whole game on it?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom a progression standpoint I think one could easily imagine that parts are basically free on Kerbin, but if you want to build them on other planets you need to spend \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E resources. You might think \u0022but wait why wouldn\u0027t I build everything on Kerbin then?\u0022 and the answer is you still have it ship it to where it\u0027s going. Much easier to mine the resources in situ (also for \u0022free\u0022) and make things where you need them. The currency you generate from exploration is spent on upgrading your capabilities rather than on raw material.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is all speculative of course.
