One that simply says \u0022Explore this place\u0022. You go there and the contract status gets marked as completed, or half completed. Then the contract expands with new objectives like \u0022There\u0027s an interesting spot 2km away from your landing site. Go find out what\u0027s so interesting about it!\u0022 Of course some objectives would be optional or time-based with or without penalties.\n\nBascially: Main (simpler) objective achieved leads to another (more complicated) one.\n\nMaybe if the whole contract system would be redesigned to work like this the contracts tab would be less cluttered, messy and chaotic. Paired with vessel spawns (more complicated ones like abandoned space stations of the rival space program or ore haulers, or even abandoned surface outposts) it could lead to more interesting missions than we have now. Also people who want to do more than just land on a planet, or are interested in finding more easter eggs/surface structures would finally have an opportunity for an unexpected space adventure.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T00:08:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 12:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T03:31:09Z","Content":"While having the expanding contracts would work for a game where you can send units out in a few seconds... It takes days in KSP-time to send out a rover to the Mun; let along further planets like Duna. But I do agree that there needs to be some sort of thread that ties together the contracts system. Maybe even some sort of science archives UI for the contracts screen.\n\nThe contracts need to have the parameters spelled out when accepted; because KSP (and spaceflight) is all about design and planning your mission.

What you are suggesting more like deciding now that New Horizons has passed Pluto we should go back and examine Neptune with it. Or like after Apollo 11 landed on the Moon, if they asked Neil to just pick up and move the craft around to the other side (which is actually quite a good comparison because he had 0 fuel when he touched down).\n\nLike I said, this could work if it were EVA only and the mission \u0022extras\u0022 occurred within the range of EVA travel.
