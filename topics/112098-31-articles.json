As we discussed, a fairing-based aeroshell is too aerodynamic (even with drogues and airbrakes) and the lander just can\u0027t bleed enough speed before it hits the ground.  But I really don\u0027t want to deal with the additional part count of something like a radiator panel-based aeroshell.  What I\u0027ve started doing is testing an EDL without any aeroshell.  The fairing/aeroshell on the HLV-6\u0027s are retained during transit for any aerobrake captures, but after the deorbit burn, the entire aeroshell assembly is jettisoned.  The lander is stabilized by a drogue chute in the back, and without an aeroshell, it has enough total drag to slow itself down enough that it won\u0027t start tumbling in the lower atmosphere, and the Duna atmo is thin enough not to encounter any heating.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Majorjim said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I cant wait to see you completed pack mate.
