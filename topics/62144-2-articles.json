It\u0027s why my creations always max out at around 2500 parts. Sometimes I encounter it with as little as 1700. I\u0027d be building my apollo style crafts much bigger than I currently do, but it\u0027s always technical problems with the game engine that limit me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found it occurs most often if I ever use the ctrl-v function to undo a mistake. Regular use of the symmetry too also causes it. You know what my big rockets look like: I often build a central core, built 1 of the strap-on sections and then the other 5 or 7 come from symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s strange though because the bug is often VAB only. If I load a vehicle which has \u0022lost\u0022 lots of struts through this bug, sometimes they still appear when I load the vehicle to the launch pad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s something to do with the difference between the way the VAB and the main engine handle the craft files. In the VAB it\u0027s constantly auto-saving the ship so you can revert any changes with ctrl-V. I suspect the resources used for this feature are the difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of 10,000 part crafts. I did accidentally create one. Sort of. I was building a regular rocket, and somehow managed to accidentally select the whole thing and reproduce it in 6x symmetry, boosting it to over 12,000 parts. It make my computer freeze trying to load the vehicle, and when I restarted the game the craft file wouldn\u0027t load. It froze my pc every time. I eventually deleted it because it wasn\u0027t a flyable rocket, it was 6 rockets clipped together...... but just having the file in the folder would cause the pc to hang for a minute or two when I brought up the list of ships to load.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T14:09:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s always good to know just where your limits are.
