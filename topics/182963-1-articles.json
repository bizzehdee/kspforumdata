I have some(ish) programming experience, but I don\u0027t know how to start, how to actually make the mod work and what software to use. It would be nice if one of you experts gave me a tutorial or something on how to get to modding. It would also help if you told me how to make textures.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_evil_martians","CreatedById":191036,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-20T00:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm on the same level as you so ill refer you to tutorials via the internet and IMO \u00A0(In My Opinion) its great to get tips and advice from skilled mod creators.
