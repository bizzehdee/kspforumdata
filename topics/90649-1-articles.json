We have a very high temperature \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E oceans ... while technically they could be of water, other stuff in game or to be in the game soon point otherwise ( in game: Eve doesn\u0027t have rivers. That means it doesn\u0027t rain in Eve, a thing that points to a very high ebullition point liquid in the oceans, a thing that in Eve clearly excludes water, even if very salty. To be in game: Eve oceans will be harvest able for fuel ( that was sort of confirmed by in the last friday KSP-TV dev stream ) and according with the buried plans Harv had for the resource harvesting, the liquid in Eve oceans will be harvest able for fuel, but not for oxidizer, unlike Kerbin and Laythe oceans ...so , no water ). Others , like Scott Manley, suggested that it might be some kind of liquid metallic alloy ( Manley specifically suggested mercury, that was discussed to be used as rocket engine in the pat in RL ), that , while beating with other stuff in Harv\u0027s plan ( like Eve\u0027s oceans being a source for ( still not existent in game ) nuclear fuel ), is hard to reconcile with it being on the surface of the planet, and not in the core ( even if they didn\u0027t sunk to the core, there would be surely a layer of silicates in the surface of the planet ( like in all rocky planets in our solar system ), and those are far less dense than liquid metals )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore , Eve is \u003Cem\u003Epurple\u003C/em\u003E .

More, even if you want to say that it has ice under a coat of something not volatile, Minmus has rock boulders on the surface, a thing that makes absolutely no sense if Minmus was made primarily of ice ( the same reason to shun mercury oceans on Eve: relative densities ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, on what minmus IS made of: the flat surfaces are most likely some kind of silicate glass, indicating that Minmus was possibly starting to diferentiate ( dense stuff going down , made more easy by melting of the interior layers due to gravity and radioactive decay. Due to that, that process only happens in stuff above a certain size and makes the objects spherical ( the molten materials tend to fill the gaps ) ) early in it\u0027s history when something basically froze the process in the middle. What could do that ? that is a nice question ... that I don\u0027t have the answer to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaythe\u003C/strong\u003E: Laythe is actually easy to explain for the most part. It is the most interior moon of Jool, thus the tidal forces tend to produce heat, heat that is enough to make the water in there liquid. More, it is not a water world because it suffered a major impact in it\u0027s early history that almost shredded the moon, leaving a almost hemispherical crater whose rims are above water level. It also has enough oxygen for jet engines to work, a almost sure sign that it has life ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the stuff that doesn\u0027t make sense: First, Laythe has ice caps. If you think about that, if the oceans of Laythe are there because of Jool\u0027s tidal forces, it doesn\u0027t make sense than there are ice caps ( unlike in Kerbin, where the heat to melt the water comes primarily of the Sun radiation, thus making that the poles get in average less power from the Sun per area than the tropics ). Other thing to consider is how that Laythe \u003Cem\u003Ehas\u003C/em\u003E a atmosphere at all: if you look at the RL moon of Jupiter that is more closely in the situation of Laythe, Io, you will see a planet that loses atmosphere to Jupiter because of the same gravity that melts it\u0027s interiors to create sulfuric volcanoes. Laythe should had lost it\u0027s atmosphere long ago ( there is no sign of atmospherical replacement mechanism in Laythe ) ... unless both the atmosphere and the oceans are recent features of Laythe and that the planet once was covered in a ice layer and had no atmopshere ... like all the signs point that RL Europa and ingame Vall are. So maybe we had once a snowball Laythe \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETylo\u003C/strong\u003E: Tylo in certain aspect is the opposite of Laythe. Tylo has the surface gravity of almost 1g and, regardless of what is made of ( lead, maybe? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ), it should have a atmosphere due to that. More, as it is far from the Sun and not that close of Jool, it should even have more atmo than Kerbin ( maybe even comparable levels to Eve ). But there is none :/ \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only explanation I heard that made any amount of sense for that is that Tylo, for some reason, did not outgassed much in it\u0027s creation, thus there was never a atmosphere to be taken away, but that flies against the existence of ( spoiler in front : read at your own peril ) the Tylo cave. Caves are very peculiar stuff and only happen where there is erosion ( and no atmo and no liquids in surface = no erosion ) or as the result of tectonic activity, a thing that normally results in outgassing ) ( end of spoiler ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In other words, Tylo should have a decent atmosphere, most likely made of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, with most likely more that 1 atm at surface, but itisn\u0027t there. So where did it go ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, there is more wierd stuff in game, but most of them are explainable ( say, like Pol spires, that are most likely extrusions of liquid from the inside that freezes when it passes the surface ).
