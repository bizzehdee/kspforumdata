So having two sets of engines is absolutely out of the question; any advantage they\u0027d give for greater thrust would be lost by their extra mass cutting into the deltaV. For the same reason, I recommend your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E remains between 0.5 and 1 (kerbin values); any advantage you gain with more thrust is lost for the greater engine mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne may wonder if using rhinos instead of wolfhounds would improve matters; one rhino thrusts as much as 6 wolfhounds, for half the mass, so it is conceivable that what you save in lower mass compensates for the lower Isp. Being one who uses a lot of large ships, I did experiment on it, and the answer is just no. The mass saving on the rhino is not enough to compensate for lower Isp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one possible competitor are the nuclear engines. Those have over twice the Isp of the wolfhounds, but they have a lot less thrust. I know for personal experience and calculation that for a Vall lander nukes are bad, because to get enough thrust you need so many of them, so much wasted mass, you\u0027d get better results using wolfhounds. But Mun is smaller than Vall, so maybe for Mun a lander based on nuclear engines may save some fuel. worth experimenting on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krazy1","CreatedById":203523,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-15T19:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built some big rover/ rockets and the hardest problem with stock parts is the wheels.
