From what i know they want to fix some issues with Ryzen-2, which wont come for at least a year. The CCX link design isnt something you fix with a new stepping, its a fundamental part of the architecture. I can only imagine one short term \u0022fix\u0022 for the bandwidth limitation; currently it seems that the link speed is coupled to the RAM frequency. Maybe they can add in a factor, so even with cheaper RAM it could run at full possible speed, but even that would be to big for a simple new stepping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T15:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick look into it myself indicates the performance penalty will be partly alleviated with an OS that understands the relationship between the cores.
