If there is some problem doing it why not simply make is so there is one unmoving node. The node simply stays at the open position of the node and never actually moves. When you open and close the shielded docking port it merely makes the node invisible and inaccessible and reverses this on opening.. Should this not be insanely easy to do? How has this not been done since this came out? And why would they not want this? Make a little code so you cannot close it while it\u0027s attached to something.
