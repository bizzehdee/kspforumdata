So I check and it says 264/500 storage. The experiments I ran didn\u0027t complete because of storage limit but this 264 of storage used seems to have come out of nowhere.\n\nI tried transmitting science, which does nothing, the data still shows 264/500. I tried discarding my experiments and collecting them again, but I no longer have the \u0022reseach\u0022 option. Only \u0022keep\u0022 and \u0022transmit\u0022 on each summary.\n\nI\u0027d really appreciate anything on clearing this up\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T21:26:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nurb**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T21:20:00Z","Content":"I get that if you try to do more then one at a time.
