Maybe it was useful in earlier versions but I wouldn\u0027t recommend it anymore. I only autostrut launch vehicles across docking ports and side boosters. It helps much more to figure out where your station mass is concentrated and not to put heavy tanks far out to the sides, connected by normal docking ports.
