I personally would have had turbojet engines, low bypass turbofans, and high bypass turbofans, with turbojets being best at high altitude/speed, low bypass being a good compromise engine, and the high bypass engines for low altitude/high fuel efficiency. I don\u0027t know why C7 didn\u0027t do that in the first place, but then he might not have known about jet engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T00:41:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Trux\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Trux\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETurbo jet is more efficient at high altitudes, jet engine is more efficient at low altitudes\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the turbojet has a far higher top speed (2400 m/s rather than 1000 m/s), and has higher thrust starting around 500 m/s or so, which you\u0027re likely to be reaching above 10km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic jet is more fuel-efficient than the turbojet at low-speed flight: it has peak thrust at a standstill.
