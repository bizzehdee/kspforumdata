There is no substitute for trial and error. Build a ship that looks the way you want it to look, probably around a single jet engine to start. Concentrate on making the jet work first, that\u0027s the hard part. Do your best to fly a profile like the one Slashy cited. Then:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Did you run out of air before you got to a good altitude? Add intakes, climb slower and build speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Did you run out of jet fuel too early? Add more, or climb faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Did you lose control of the ship?
