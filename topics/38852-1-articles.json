You have some control systems that give SAS, some that give Reaction Wheels, and some that do both. You have some pods that have SAS in automatically, and some that don\u0027t, without any seemingly logical reason as to why. To simplify things and make it all more transparent, I\u0027d like to suggest the following two changes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) ALL command systems have SAS installed automatically. This goes for all the manned pods, the Remote Guidance systems, and yes, even the tiny little probe cores. They should also all have Reaction Wheels, but usually fairly weak ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) ALL control systems are changed to be Reaction Wheel parts, and named as such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way, you don\u0027t have to worry about whether or not you have SAS installed, since you are guaranteed to have it installed on every ship that is controllable. It also makes the control systems easier to understand, since they all do the same thing, just in different sizes. This should help clear up a lot of confusion about the new system, and also allow for cleaner and simpler rocket designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T19:03:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe devs are working on it.
