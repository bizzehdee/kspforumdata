Most importantly, energy flow is critical for maintaining low entropy, which you can\u0027t have life without. So we only need to look for life either on planets/moons that orbit a hot enough star, or these that give off its own thermal energy. We also know that some form of phase transitions will be required. You cannot manipulate entropy otherwise. This puts upper limits on temperatures. Id est, surface of a star itself is not a good place to look for life. Finally, and this is more of an extrapolation, we assume that evolution takes its time. That means the stable environment should exist for a long period of time. This effectively leaves us with planets orbiting stars or their moons as the only places to look for life. As that, in itself, places constraints on types of environments we deal with, we can make further statements on the types of life possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, while the habitable zones, as currently defined, are somewhat anthropocentric, reasonable limits for where we should look for life aren\u0027t that far out from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, all of this assumes life that has naturally evolved in that environment. If we consider pan spermia or artificial life, a lot of these restrictions disappear. We are suddenly looking at any number of asteroids, comets, gas giants, rogue planets, and maybe even some dwarf stars as potential safe harbors for some kind of life.

Very few elements have the properties of DNA that allow for protein construction, sequencing, and what not. As you know, DNA is the code that makes us... us. All life, even on-life like viruses have DNA. We\u0027ve yet to observe a life form on Earth without DNA, and Earth has had several billion years to work on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside of that, it may be theoretically possible for life to exist without DNA - I\u0027ve read some concepts of plasma or hydrogen gas based life-forms being possible, but I digress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EViruses, and some bacteria, use RNA, which is similar to DNA, but more durable, and less likely to mutate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T06:26:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022falofonos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022falofonos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat if it were an adaptive self replicating probe relying on complex encoding of data within a double helix????!!!!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the SQUIRRELS, I knew they were up too something!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T07:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lobsterbark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lobsterbark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EViruses, and some bacteria, use RNA, which is similar to DNA, but more durable, and less likely to mutate.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERNA is single chain not dual like DNA so it should mutate more.
