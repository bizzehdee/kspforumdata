His tutorials are great and best way to start with the game. Better than any wiki, etc. He show and explains the basic in detailed and easy to understand way.

But Scott Manleys begginer tutorials are much deeper (seriously approx 10 hours of interesting stuff) and they dont just cover what to do, but also why to do it and what would happen if you do it another way. After his videos the game is much easier to understand by \u0022common sense\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you are beggining I really suggest to watch at least first fours his videos. Then all the ingame tutorials. And then go for career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
