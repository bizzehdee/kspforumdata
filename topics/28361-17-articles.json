The adapter texture maps can be rescaled to 1/2 size in both axes and still have a good level of detail - right now, each endcap is budgeted as much texture space as the entire rest of the part. One could also convert the PNG to TGA format - this isn\u0027t a memory optimization, unless the PNG memory bug is still present, but it is a video performance and image quality optimization, since the game does not create mipmap chains for PNG images. Any part using textures created from a PNG source will show sparklies and other artifacts of a non-mipmapped image, and it is a less efficient use of the GPU (granted, this game is CPU limited for most users). There are some other options to reduce the memory footprint, but it entails some more radical efforts that increase the maintenance cost for sumghai to implement them - like replacing some textures with dummy textures and using texture substitution that KSP 20.x or 21.x introduced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFWIW, I\u0027ve resized the endcap textures and converted all of the textures to TGA in my local copy.
