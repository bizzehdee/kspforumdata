I have no idea whether this is fixable in Scatterer or not.\n\nI see that similar issues have been brought up, for instance by [@harbingerdawn](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/16550-harbingerdawn/) (30 pages and 14 months ago).\n\nIn my case, I observe a NullRef on a DepthToDistanceCommandBuffer caused (according to the stack trace) by a call to RenderProceduralDragCubes from B9 Part Switch. This causes Scatterer to give up ([Scatterer] Removing DepthToDistanceCommandBuffer) and fail to display the sunflare.\n\nI suppose the NullRef could be happening [here](https://github.com/LGhassen/Scatterer/blob/master/scatterer/Core.cs#L423-L427) but I do not know the code and sadly I do not have the dev environment set up to recompile/debug it.\n\nI have reverted to the Stock sunflare for now (albeit with Kopernicus), but if anyone has suggestions I am open to trying things in order to track down the root cause further.\n\nCheers."},{"CreatedByName":"GroundControl2MajorTom","CreatedById":159308,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-06T22:22:25Z","Content":"Any idea when Scatter will work with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E?"},{"CreatedByName":"Zesty","CreatedById":112248,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-06T23:06:10Z","Content":"Really looking forward to it as well!

Before submitting a bug report for a mod it\u0027s a good practice to make sure you don\u0027t have any other mods installed. Remember that mod authors are contributing their time for free. While most are happy to help support their mod you can save them time by making sure your issue is actually caused by their mod and not something else.\n\nIn your case you have several mods that aren\u0027t Scatterer related - notably you have SmokeScreen installed, which isn\u0027t a Scatterer requirement. If you read the first line of the SmokeScreen description it says: \n\n**\u0022SmokeScreen is a plugin whereby artists can add improved engine effects\u0022**\n\nI\u0027d be willing to bet your issue is more likely related to SmokeScreen than to Scatterer. BUT before you go on the smokescreen forum and say \u0022your mod\u0027s broke\u0022 you might want to research THAT mod a bit because SmokeScreen is really an enabler for other mods (like RealPlume) it\u0027s not designed IIRC as a standalone mod.\n\nSome other suggestions to help you out:\n\n1. The best way to test mod bugs is to just create a separate KSP install called KSP\\_TEST or something like that and only install the mod in question along with plus any dependencies. This way you can be sure you\u0027re reporting about the correct mod.\n2. If the mod clearly states that it\u0027s for an older version of the game, then it\u0027s not really a \u0027bug\u0027 if it doesn\u0027t work in the newest version. Scatterer says it\u0027s a work in progress \u0022[WIP]\u0022 and that it\u0027s designed for 1.6.1, so it\u0027s not intended to work with 1.7.1. In your case, i don\u0027t think that\u0027s the issue, but still a good thing to remember.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-07T14:53:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2019 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Tyko**"},{"CreatedByName":"Inacio","CreatedById":9248,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-08T15:01:40Z","Content":"![kgoQW5n.png](https://i.imgur.com/kgoQW5n.png)\n\nIs there a fix / way to prevent white skies?"},{"CreatedByName":"Gameslinx","CreatedById":144828,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-08T16:48:34Z","Content":"Hey!
