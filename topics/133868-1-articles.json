Career mode is fun and all, but it\u0027s about management, and collecting scientific knowledge while expanding your space program. It\u0027s fun, but a more story oriented mode would be cool. I don\u0027t know how, maybe having story missions, or mixing the two together and have management while having story missions. But then again, part of the fun (at least to me) is making your own story... So I don\u0027t know... I won\u0027t complain without one, and I suppose there\u0027s more important things to do\u00A0other than adding a whole new mode...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T02:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027d be a great way to take players through a tutorial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atlas2342","CreatedById":155194,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T09:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus, clear up questions about Kerbalkind itself...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T10:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, there\u0027s no official word from Squad on this but I suspect that they\u0027re happy leaving KSP without an official story and letting everyone create their own stories within the game. I could be wrong - it may just be something that they haven\u0027t got around to yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the moment, JakeGrey and I have been pondering a total conversion mod based on my \u003Ci\u003EFirst Flight\u003C/i\u003E story. That would certainly provide one set of answers about kerbalkind whilst giving them a fairly compelling reason to go to space - and keep going to space. Plus it also builds on some familiar KSP memes - for example, the ubiquitous Kerman surname has a deep historical reason behind it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe think that most of what we\u0027d need is already present in other mods but getting everything to work together would be a challenge. It would be a big job, apart from the story itself - which would most likely need to be adapted to include more space stuff and less Kerbin-side stuff - we\u0027d need to rebuild the tech tree, with massively overhauled flavour text,\u00A0have new buildings appearing at various sites around Kerbin in response to scripted events, possibly even have some elements of multiplayer worked in, or at least have some sensible looking AI ships flying about. I don\u0027t know if the new Kerbalpedia will be moddable\u00A0but that would be really helpful for fitting a lot of the background story in in a relatively player-accessible way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anybody is interested, please feel free to drop by the First Flight thread - linked in my signature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T01:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d kinda like to see something a little like \u003Cem\u003EUplink\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s story mode: wide-open sandbox with randomly generated missions you can complete for cash, but every once in a while you get a special mission that is part of a long-term ongoing story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dragonaether","CreatedById":153369,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T22:11:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love ksp for career mode, and i don\u0027t think ksp is a good game to make a Story, it\u0027s a sandbox, management game and it\u0027s funny for that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it could be a funny thing something like kerbal cold war and you can choose one of the two side, but this mean add into the game an AI. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-12T00:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea of a series of\u00A0missions and contracts that follow a continuing theme/storyline, and as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105132-klgraham1013/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105132\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105132-klgraham1013/\u0022\u003E@klgraham1013\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0said above it could be ideal for a tutorial. \u00A0But I would\u00A0only want it\u00A0as an additional \u0027twist\u0027 to the contract system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T22:43:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to see a player gameplay style influenced missions.
