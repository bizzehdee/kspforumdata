I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll quote it here in fact: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CPhysics.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Joints can now have separate anchor points configured for both connected rigidbodies.

We are completely re-doing the joints, to have much more control over how they link together, and not least, how much we want them to be bendy and wobbly. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not eliminating the wobble altogether, as that would actually be removing a lot of what makes failures fun. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re aiming to have better control over it, so we can have wobbly bits where we want them to wobble, and more rigid connections where things are supposed to be firmly attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edoes this also mean that i can put an upsidedown quadcoupler under a rightside up quad coupler and have it connnect at all 4 points? because currently it only connects at 1 corner and will sag very badly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FITorion","CreatedById":7606,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T04:02:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt means that parts that currently have one connection point between them like fuel tanks and engines may have more than that after this update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat might also correct the issue you mention.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T05:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it just means that connections will be stronger.
