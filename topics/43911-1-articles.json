I was pretty excited about this next piece (the science facility, with a cutting-edge array for mapping graviton rifts), as it was a beast to design and get into orbit. I was closing in on the station, and as I got within 100m, I was confused to see so many little markers floating around. At first I figured it was just that each piece gets its own marker, which seemed odd to me, as I\u0027d think once assembled they\u0027d become one. I was on the dark side, so I just kept moving forward, hoping to see more once I got closer. Then my lights hit it, and I could see what was happening: the station was in pieces. It was perfectly fine when last I\u0027d left it. Now it was in 3 chunks, presumably with the crew having an Apollo 13 moment, running around patching holes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gotta\u0027 be honest - I\u0027m pretty bummed.

You\u0027ve described some limitations I wasn\u0027t aware I should be careful of. Yes, I had some clipping on the station (middle of picture below). I guess I\u0027m unclear about what degree of clipping is ok. Very often when parts are rotated in 5 degree increments, there\u0027s clipping at the joining edges, though only a little (as on the big truss array above). In the truss example, it seems fine. When I rotate spotlights into position, they\u0027re often wildly clipped, but they seem fine. Is there a degree of clipping that\u0027s ok and one that\u0027s not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I just revisited Icarus (the aptly named station now in pieces and destined to be deorbited), and saw that SAS was on. Is that a problem? From the posts above I should be careful there\u0027s no flexing in a station before I leave it, but what about SAS and RCS? Should those both be shut off, or are they unrelated to this misfortune? I\u0027m eager to learn all I can to ensure there\u0027s no repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thought: I\u0027ve installed a few mods, but after installing the FusTek station modules, when I\u0027m in the VAB with the Pods tab up, it lags me terribly.

Seems we only have a few more weeks to wait. My system may not be helping, but it\u0027s run other demanding games pretty smoothly. I\u0027m getting the impression that KSP is unusually demanding on resources. I played EVE for a while, which is visually much richer (polygons aplenty, and lots of work for a video card), and had no issues at all unless there were hundreds of ships in the same place.

Fortunately they were all in section 2, so I was able to save section 1. I rebuilt section 2 to get rid of the overlap on that part I mentioned above, added an escape pod, then relaunched it. As an aside, I freakin LOVE the docking cam addon. Section 3 was still drifting nearby, so I hopped in it and hooked it up. The shot below is the current state of things, where I\u0027ve just detached the last booster section before I send it into the atmosphere. Section 2\u0027s booster remains attached until I can drain its fuel into the next section: the fuel port. Though I\u0027m getting wary of adding more sections: it\u0027s VERY wiggly now when I do any maneuvers. As in \u0027going to break apart\u0027 wiggly. I think there\u0027s an addon to add the reenforcing cables in orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been getting WAY more lag using these FusTek station parts.
