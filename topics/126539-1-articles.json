That is what this challenge is about. \u003Cbr\u003E\nTo complete the challenge you must:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Land on eve. The lander must be manned, and have a capacity of at least 4 kerbals. \u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Perform an EVA. At least one kerbal must get out of your lander and plant a flag. \u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Optional surface operations. You can skip these, but they will provide a useful score boost. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[spoiler=Operations] \u003Cbr\u003E\n-Set up a base: The base must be able to hold at least 6 kerbals. Additionally, you\u0026#39;ll need life support, either from an actual life support mod or a stock stand-in. If you go for stock, you need at least 1 air intake and 100 ore capacity for every 2 kerbals. If you go for modded, it needs to be able to support the on-board crew for at least 1 year.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Science it up: Perform at least 3 experiments other than EVA or crew reports while on the surface. Points based on science earned (or science that would be earned if you were playing in career).\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Rover journey: Land and drive a rover. It must carry least 1 kerbal. Points based on distance traveled, top speed and kerbals on-board.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-The deep purple sea: Land and drive a boat. It must travel at least 100 meters and carry at least one kerbal. Scored similarly to the rover challenge.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Circumnavigator: Circumnavigate eve. You can use a rover or a plane, but it cannot leave the atmosphere. Points based on time and kerbal capacity.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/spoiler]\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Takeoff. Lift off from eve. You must bring back all of the kerbals you sent, unless you made a base, in which case you must bring up at least half of the kerbals that landed. The kerbals can switch vehicles, and do not have to use the original lander. However, they must return to kerbin, or reach a space station in kerbin orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[spoiler=Scoring] \u003Cbr\u003E\nPart 1: \u002B10 points for every kerbal aboard. -5 points for every part destroyed on landing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPart 2: \u002B10 for every kerbal leaving the lander. \u002B20 for planting a flag. \u002B20 for planting a flag more than 100m from the lander\u003Cbr\u003E\nPart 3: \u002B20 bonus for completing all optional operations. \u003Cbr\u003E\n[spoiler=Operation scoring] \u003Cbr\u003E\n-Base: \u002B10 for every kerbal with life support. -5 for every kerbal without.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Science: \u002B1 for every 5 science. \u002B2 for every different type of experiment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Rover: Top speed\u002B(kerbal capacity*5)\u002B(distance/20)\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Boat: Top speed*2\u002B(kerbal capacity*5)\u002B(distance/15)\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Circumnavigator: 25 \u002B (10*capacity)\u002B 150/time (in minutes)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/spoiler]\u003Cbr\u003E\nPart 4: Size: Bonus of up to 30 if very small. Penalty of up to 10 if excessively large. \u003Cbr\u003E\nCrew: 5*capacity\u002B10*kerbals onboard\u003Cbr\u003E\nBonuses: \u002B50 for SSTO, \u002B25 if reaching high EVE orbit, \u002B50 if returning directly to kerbin without refueling or transfer. Up to \u002B30 for aesthetics.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/spoiler]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[spoiler=Leaderboard]\u003Cbr\u003E\nBest total score:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBest Lander:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBest Ascent vehicle:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBest looking craft:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBest surface vehicle\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBest base\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/spoiler]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy mission is coming.\n"}]}
