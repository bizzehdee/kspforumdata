Its use is fairly widespread, and many major mods rely on it for compatibility with ther other mods, as you might have noticed while using said mods. It allows you to edit other parts at runtime, allowing you to change all kinds of properties for differente existing parts without needing to overwrite Squad\u0027s actual files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way you can make changes to the way other parts, stock and mod alike, behave, as long as you know how they are actually configured, without:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Kinda blends in with 1, it makes that your mod is easily installable and removable. Each part has its own part.cfg in a seperate folder, so if you replaced all those, getting the originals back without a full, clean install could be a pretty big hassle if not properly prepared. This way, people can easily place and remove your mod without altering anything related to the base game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

Generally, distributing copyrighted material isn\u0027t allowed, wether or not you provide credit to the original author. You can always change them for yourself, but you aren\u0027t really allowed to redistribute entire part files mostly made by Squad. And as i mentioned above, you\u0027ll run into other problems, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, to be honest, this is exactly what ModuleManager was made for. I don\u0027t really get what you mean by \u0027what program i need to use for it to work\u0027. You just write your mod, using the ModuleManager API, then provide the ModuleManager files along with your mod (You can do this without problem since ModuleManager is Creative Commons, as far as i know), and then people can install your mod like any other mod and use KSP to run it :-). All you need is KSP and, at the basic level, a text editor, like notepad :-). So why redistribute Squads copyrighted content, when you can use this? It increases compatibility, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
