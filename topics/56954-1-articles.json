The announcer seemed to indicate that they\u0027d remain firing for around 1 minute and 44 seconds but it seems like with it\u0027s already limited OMS system Delta-V budget (~300 m/s) that they\u0027d want to hold off on using the OMS engines until they\u0027d exhausted the main engine fuel supply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked up the STS-131 payload, and the total mass came to just over 15 metric tons, which is well below the maximum payload capability of the shuttle ~24 metric tons, so I don\u0027t think unusually high payload mass is the reason here.
