There\u0027s one problem. I have a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1.02. It just hovers there, above the launchpad, not tipping or anything, just very slightly drifting forwards.Is there any way I can bring my TWR up to a decent number without messing up the centers of mass/thrust? Or will I have to completely restart?Thanks for the help,Luke\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-23T05:10:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2015 05:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Saltless Lemons\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T07:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoar boosters. You don\u0027t need to restart, but you will need to rejig. Without pictures it\u0027s hard to give specific advice that relates to your launcher... I\u0027ll assume you\u0027re using a Shuttle-system in that you have a large main fuel tank, SRBs and the Shuttle attached to that... Just add some more SRBs until you get enough TWR. You can easily offset the SRBs into each other so that they don\u0027t look so ungainly. Yes, you may then need to rejig the Orbiter\u0027s positioning and the such, but it\u0027ll be a case of tweaking rather than a from scratch redesign.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T20:50:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would d/l and use the Procedural Parts mod and change your stock boosters in to procedural boosters.

You must pay the gravity well toll of 1.0 for a given SOI body, anything after that will go towards accelerating. In your case, your extra 0.02 TWR * Gravity of Kerbin@sea level is the equivalence delta-v of just under 10 cm/s^2, or about a light stroll in a vertical direction if you\u0027re lucky enough to stay straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means you\u0027re paying the toll but aren\u0027t thrusting enough to benefit from it. You need more boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EId set aside your SRBs temporarily and augment your main engines until they slightly exceed the 1.0 TWR by themselves for your shuttle with a maximum test payload. This will allow your shuttle to cruise on whatever acceleration your SRBs provide at launch with just enough excess throttle to make course corrections as needed while burning efficiently during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow add your SRB stage and you should see your TWR climb nicely. If it is a significant TWR hike, you can then save fuel by throttling down your mains to save fuel then re-throttle them during SRB separation. Or if you want to extend your SRB burn, you can throttle them down and they burn slower to help safely push through the thicker lower atmosphere at safer speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI, personally, am a fan of liquid boosters that I also feed their fuel into the main tank so when the boosters are spent, they leave the main fuel tank full after first stage separation. Hope these thoughts help.
