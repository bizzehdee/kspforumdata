That nutty guy has not only two different sizes of Raster Prop being used, but several of them for the primary seat. Add to that the holographic HUD projected on the glass that displays real-time data about your current orientation and drive power status, and the fact that with all those different window panes and their corresponding JSI transparent transforms... well, it\u0027s a wonder it runs at all on my low-powered laptop. I turned off the transparent pod part of the part config, leaving the internal config alone completely, and just that improved things a ton. The windows and opaque from the outside, but otherwise everything works as intended. I think part of it is the extra load of polygonal faces being rendered and the real-time data that\u0027s being processed and displayed even when you\u0027re viewing those monitors from \u003Cem\u003Eoutside\u003C/em\u003E the pod. if those JSI panels could display a generic image instead of all that data when viewed from the outside, it would perform better (but look a lot less cool). If those little buttons all over those consoles were turned into a lower-quality mesh or even hidden completely when outside the pod as well, that would likely fix the problem completely. I\u0027m also a little skeptical as to the need for all those separate transforms for each pane of the front windows. For example, I believe the Pano-pod developed a while back manages the create an entire 360 degree view of the interior on the pod, with at least as many consoles and a lot more polygons than the ASET pod and nearly 3 times the individual glass panes \u003Cem\u003EALL\u003C/em\u003E while using a lot less transforms and at least a third of the performance hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s actually quite a mystery why the ASET pod is so hard on the system really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried the new rover body you put up and its initial performance hit in the SPH is at least 10 times less than the ASET pod.

If, however, we want to duplicate the original part and end that duplicate then we actually have two options on that front. You can either give up the MM patch and simply use a MODEL node to reference the model path while placing this config in your own mod\u0027s folder, or we can simply replace the \u0022@\u0022 character in the MM config with a \u0022\u002B\u0022 character. Combine that character change with a few additional edits at the top of the file and it will spawn a brand new part based on the stock configs. Otherwise, the patch I posted above \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E work. I have yet to test it however. It\u0027s getting late and KSP takes quite some time to boot up.

Upon attempting to check my action groups with the modified wheels attached, I ended up with a complete GUI lockup with null exceptions being spammed to my log. I haven\u0027t checked the log quite yet to see what happened, but I suspect it has something to do with other MM patches making modifications to the same part which require a stock module to be present but aren\u0027t checking if that module is there still before applying. I\u0027m going to test the duplication method later on as well. I would actually think that method would be preferable to most users, but I\u0027d probably include optional patch replacements if the user wants to just override everything. Actually, if we go the duplication route we wouldn\u0027t even need MM patches, just need to reference the model using the \u0022MODEL\u0022 node format and put your config in your own KF directory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might be able to take over that area, but I\u0027m unsure about the separate thread. My reasoning is, first off the list, that when someone downloads a new mod fully of goodies that can also be applied to the stock parts, they don\u0027t want to have to go somewhere else to find those configs. Second on the list is that if I were to release the MM configs as a separate addon, with a dependency of your mod, I would have to separately license my work as a subset of your work since in reality I\u0027m just adding a few @ symbols and deleting some unnecessary lines. I lack the ability to do any of the real work behind the scenes, and I lack time to learn it because I\u0027m still in college and not yet even beginning my BA. (I\u0027m a late bloomer.) Third on the list (last one I promise) is that because I\u0027m a student I may not always have time to update these configs (not to mention that I don\u0027t have the ability to update more than just the MM patch, and people would be asking me to fix things I have no ability to fix) I may have to suddenly disappear for a while to focus on some large project. If a major KSP update comes through during that time and a major rework of the MM patches is needed, I\u0027ll not only hate myself, but the rest of the MM users out there will hate me for not being around to help them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would do, in your shoes (so to speak), is keep everything together in one release thread. Post your new stock CFGs to the github and I\u0027ll do what I can to convert them into patches for a stock-overwrite option. I\u0027ll send you what I have when/if I get them where they need to be. If you want, offer them as a separate download or just wrap them into the complete package with an optional folder with an alternate method of install. i know it sounds complicated, but in the end it\u0027s usually better to offer as many options as possible. Who knows, maybe I\u0027ll get inspired to write a batch file to help customize the installation for whichever way they want to update the stock wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all assumes I can get the other wheel-based mods to stop making game-breaking modifications to the configs before I can get to them. this also assumes that it isn\u0027t your modification of that stock wheel that screwed it all up.
