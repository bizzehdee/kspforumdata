I know, it sounds easy, but the fact that it was first performed only in 1961 should tell you something. (Other than with light, of course. But that\u0027s boring.) In contrast, e/m was done at the very end of 19th century. And as a rule of thumb, any experiment they managed in 19th century, you can reproduce at home. Though, some of the early radiation experiments I would not recommend trying to reproduce. For example, Rutherford\u0027s Experiment (which is, technically 20th cen, but still very easy to set up.) requires a strong alpha source. You don\u0027t need a lot, so you can probably get away with something perfectly legal, but I still can\u0027t recommend it to someone as an at-home experiment, because radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of particle physics experiments have radiation danger, of course. What\u0027s nice about e/m is that you can do it with energies on the order of keV, and that just produces some UV. If you go up to higher energies, working with an electron gun from CRT, for example, you\u0027ll start hitting dental X-Ray energies, and that\u0027s where you need to start worry about shielding. People \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E built cyclotrones at home, and you can get to hundreds of keV with that stuff. On one hand, it\u0027s really cool, because you can start doing some real particle physics at these energies. On another, safety requirements, as well as costs, are on a completely different level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might be able to think of some other experiments that can be done with either a very weak radioactive source or an electron gun, but the reason e/m comes to mind is because it\u0027s simple, about as safe as these get, and very visual. So it\u0027s actually fun to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ah, speaking of visually interesting, simple, and still going after the same idea as double slit. So long as you are building/modifying an electron gun and a vacuum chamber, you can try doing electron crystallography. All you need is a target in front of your electron beam and a fluorescent screen a bit behind the target. You are a bit limited in choice of targets, compared to X-Ray or neutron source, but there are some fun ones. It\u0027s a bit hard to do this with a proper crystal at home, but if you do, say, powdered graphite, instead of dots, you\u0027ll get rings. Measuring radius of the rings will give you lattice constants of graphite. So this is a sort of 2 in 1 experiment. You do a solid state experiment, measuring lattice constants, but also confirming wave-particle duality of electrons, similar to double slit, which is a particle physics experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-24T23:16:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2014 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoenix Aerospace","CreatedById":26120,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T23:16:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdeas (easiest to hardest):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Make graphene with scotch tape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Home-made cloud chamber.
