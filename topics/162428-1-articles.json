Science career does have the benefit of easing a new player into the parts tree without overwhelming them with choices and limiting their progress due to having to pay the bills. You could start a sandbox save and/or a science save at the same time where you get to try out different stuff without impeding your progress.

But since you asked, I\u0027ll give my opinion. Thus far, I\u0027ve only played career, and it\u0027s been a blast. I like the added incentive of money and contracts. It can make things tough early on, but that\u0027s part of the fun. There was a time when I actually couldn\u0027t afford to launch a rocket. Missions to Duna/Ike and Eve/Gilly cashed in at about the same time and I was rollin\u0027 in dough. As others have said, you\u0027ll also get ideas for things you might not have thought of. I\u0027ll take a contract at Dres just cuz I haven\u0027t been there in a while. And then I remember that it\u0027s fun to go to Dres. You\u0027ll get the Ike 3 Course early on, but as your reputation goes up you\u0027ll keep getting better contracts for more money. Some I\u0027ve gotten are the Ultimate Jool 6, The Eeloo 6, The Eeloo 4 Journey, and The Bop 4 Rally. Just cool things to do. And even though I\u0027ve got about 90 million bucks, I still try to make things as cheap as I can and stick to my \u0022no rockets without profits\u0022 rule (superseded only by the \u0022no Kerbal left behind\u0022 rule and the ultimate Kerbal reason, \u0022just because\u0022). If you\u0027re already in a career, then just keep playing until you get bored. Then remember (like me), that you haven\u0027t really messed with planes or spaceplanes, shuttles and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s, and who knows how many mods are out there. This is a game that simply has no end. Whatever you choose to do, I\u0027m just glad you\u0027re on board.
