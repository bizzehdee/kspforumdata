For burns much longer than 1 minute, it would accomplish exacly nothing, for burns much shorter, you\u0027d feel the arbitrary timewarp restriction forces you to wait through about half a minute of slow timewarp, still looking to turn it off at the right moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T10:40:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re at 10000x timewarp or whatever the maximum is, it should stop about 2 minutes before, or you could specify exactly when timewarp should stop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerrM\u00FC","CreatedById":78387,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T12:15:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood Idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the game has a pretty good idea, what the duration of the burn will be (most of the time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ), maybe it could stop the warp a reasonable time before that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion is: Only for the craft you are flying at the moment, or for every flight in progress?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
