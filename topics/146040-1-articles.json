I know that\u0027s it\u0027s impossible to accelerate time when the speed is increasing but in my case the speed slow down, is there any way to make these maneuver faster or will i have to let my computer running for 2hrs ?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSorry if this qestion has already been asked i didn\u0027t find an answer \u00A0when doing a research.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(and i apologize for my average english)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-17T01:27:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums!\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, you can make it go faster... but only up to a maximum of 4 times normal speed.\u00A0 Hold the ALT key while pressing \u0022.\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExplanation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two kinds of warp available in KSP:\u00A0 \u0022physics warp\u0022 and \u0022regular\u0022 warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegular warp is available in speeds of 5x, 10x, 50x, 100x, 1000x, 10000x, and 100000x.\u00A0 So you can go really fast-- but it\u0027s limited.\u00A0 You can only use it if you\u0027re landed (and not moving), or if you\u0027re in a vacuum.\u00A0 And you can\u0027t be running engines while it\u0027s doing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhysics warp means that the game engine is running all its usual physics calculations, but time goes a lot faster.\u00A0 This is what you get when you\u0027re in atmosphere, when you\u0027re either airborne or else moving over the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally, the game will automatically do regular warp if it\u0027s in space (or landed and stationary), physics warp otherwise.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EHowever, you can \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eforce\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it to do physics warp by holding down the ALT key and then pressing \u0022.\u0022.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you want to speed up time during your burn, just do that.\u00A0 You can go to 2x, 3x, or 4x.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA word of caution:\u00A0 ships get jittery at the higher physics warps.\u00A0 Depending on your ship design, it may even damage itself.\u00A0 So if you have a very big and floppy ship design, and/or very powerful high-thrust engines, and/or lots of reaction torque, you may want to be careful going up to 4x.\u00A0 However, if you have a low-power engine (such as you describe), it\u0027s probably fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-17T05:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/77565-105-bettertimewarp-v22-customizable-time-warp-and-lossless-physics-warp/\u0026amp;page=7\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EThis mod\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0among other features allows faster physical warp.
