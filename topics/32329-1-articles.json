Also, I never finished Chapter 2 or even started chapter 3, so I think it would be a good way for you to suggest things that could happen in the Story, so here\u0027s chapter 1, I\u0027ll finish chapter 2 and post that also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 1: The Beginning\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a fine day on Kerbin, it was a fine day for a launch, as Bill Jeb and Bob get into the cockpit, they waved half heartingly at the surface below (this was their 11th launch, all others exploded) little did they know that this mission would be a success.

Mission Control gives the okay to launch, and with the deafening roar of the engines activating, the ship shoots up at 50 M/s and climbing, Bill and Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAAAAAAAAAAAH D:\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 HAHAHHAHAHHA WHOOOOOHOOOOO!!!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 At 5 kilometers up they drop their first pair of engines and their solid rocket boosters and at 12 Kilometers up they drop the rest of the lifter stage and proceed with gravity turn, Bill \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFUEL LEVELS AT 79%, REACHING ORBBITAL VELOCITY!!!!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Indeed, they had just exceeded 550m/s and were at a 45 Degree angle on their 90 degree mark, all was well. Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C57 kilometers above sea level, we\u0027re near the limits of our atmosphere!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. They then hit 70 Kilometers, the beginning of space, Jeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDropping Gravity Turn Stage, engaging Orbital Operation Stage\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, they then settle into a 71 kilometer by 101 Kilometers, not the most perfect orbit, but good enough. No One has any idea of what to do next....but then Bill has a flash of inspiration \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI KNOW! How bout we start burning at Mun rise? That way our Apokee will be were the Mun is when we pass by it!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, with this plan in motion, they burn at their pro-grade marker at Mun rise and sure enough, they get an encounter, they then wait 8 hours to reach their destination. In that time, they do some EVA work. Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI\u0027m gonna go see to those engines, we don\u0027t wanna arrive and find out that our main engine is burned to a crisp\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAlright you go to that, I\u0027m gonna grab me a thing of koka-cola\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. As the Crew voyage ever closer to the Mun, they wonder how they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to land...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was it, they finally got into the SOI of the Mun and burned to get into orbit at there Perimun, now their orbital stage is all but spent, all they needed to do was burn the rest of the fuel to deorbit themselves and descend onto the surface....Jeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell, if this doesn\u0027t work at least we\u0027ll be remembered as the first kerbals to try.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYep....Ready guys?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bill and Jeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CReady.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAlright, here goes nothing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. They burn whatever bits of fuel they have left in their orbital stage and descent onto the surface. Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDescending at 560 m/s guys...\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bill \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAlright, at 22 kilometers, fire up the engine and start burning\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. And so they descended, getting ever closer to the surface of the Mun...Jeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CUh guys? ASL reads 33 Kilometers but my radar altimeter reads 31 Kilometers...\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bill \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAlright, Activate engine and push to 30% throttle!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CRoger!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Their Speed slowly decreased and at 9 Kilometers they saw their first mun rocks, Bill \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COkay, since we\u0027re going at 230 m/s and the Mun rocks seem to be but 9 kilometers down I think we should power up the throttle a little!!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 After they pushed their throttle to 50% they watched as the altimeter was reading 2k, but still they were going quite fast... Bill \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThrottle up to 75%\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, then they were but 15 meters of the ground, and having a pleasant descent of 1 m/s...Jeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C7 meters...6 meters....5 meters...4 meters....3 meters...2 meters...1 meter aaaaaaNNNDD TOUCHDOWN!!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb watched as the stress from his comrades face was washed away. Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWHEW! So who\u0027s gonna take the first step?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGuys don\u0027t you remember the rocket paper kerbal we had 2 years ago? I\u0027M going to first one to take a step.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 As he rose out of his seat, opened the hatch and went out the door, he was thinking of something cool to say...Bill \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAww man... I thought I won the rocket paper kerbal...\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 And as Jeb was about to take that first step he said \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFor thousands of years we looked up at the Mun and wondered, We wondered what it was, we studied it with telescopes, sent probes to it, but the most obvious reason we came was because it\u0027s there.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Then Jeb took the very first Kerbal step on the Mun, and on that day great joy washed over Kerbin, they had FINALLY landed 3 Kerbals on the MUN! After 12 years they finally did it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13 days later their expedition to the Mun was over, and it was time to return home, as Bill Bob and Jeb piled into their rocket they waved good bye to the barren surface that they spent so long on. Jeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDo you guys ever think we\u0027re gonna see this big black rock again?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bill \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI do hope so but I like the view of it from Orbit.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI for one can\u0027t wait to come back to it, those rocks there are extremely interesting!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Then they fire up their engine and did an Immediate gravity turn, they couldn\u0027t waste ANY fuel this time. Jeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CReaching Escape Velocity! Hold on to your lunch guys!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2And they watched as their predicted Kerbin Perikee descended into the atmosphere, they hoped for a direct descent, and just as their perikee was no more, they ran out of fuel, Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDecoupling landing stage, now we\u0027re just a capsule and a parachute.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The hours ran by, and they waited until they were in the atmosphere of their beloved planet, it was 16 hours flight time when they finally felt the G\u0027s, Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CPredicted maximum of 12 G\u0027s, oh dear Kerbol...\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDon\u0027t worry! We\u0027ve faced 9 G\u0027s right!? I\u0027m SURE we\u0027ll be okay \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. And they descended HARD onto the surface of Kerbin, and it was 10 Kilometers up when they deployed their parachute, and at 500 meters ASL the parachute fully deployed...Bill \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CUgh....I feel SICK!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThat\u0027s the super fast change of atmospheric pressure messing with your inner earlobe...\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAWW MAN THAT Was AWESOME! We were like WHOOSH, and it was like VROOOEEEUM!! And I was like WHOO HOO, and you guys were like, OH NO!!

This was to be a permanent colony, with hydroponics and water mined from the surface of the Mun, there was to be a communications tower and at least 2 rovers, but the main focus of the base was too do some geologic study on the infrastructure of the Mun, this base could continuously receive models AND survive on its own for many years. It was this mission that the trio separated, Jeb \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI have to say I\u0027m a bit jealous of you 2, you\u0027re going to be exploring the solar system and I\u0027ll be on this big dead rock...\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bill \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u0027s alright Jeb! I bet one day we\u0027re all going to be together again!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bob \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIndeed, my desire to be with you guys is stronger than my desire to go to Duna...\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. As they got into their separate Mun Buses they waved goodbye to jeb, little did they know it would be 23 years before the saw each other again...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
