Mun and minimus both have tiny surface gravities and no atmosphere so that the delta V to lift off of them is small. To more accurately simulate a flight to another planet, try doing a double munar return with a single ship. That is Kerbin - Mun landing - Kerbin landing - Mun landing - Kerbin landing. This would give a better idea of the delta V it would take to say do a kermars return mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I have only been able to get to a crashland on the Mun on the second launch off kerbin, but I am getting there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the OP.
