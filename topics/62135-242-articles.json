I install everything, and when I go to launch KSP, it just closes, without warning, and leaves nothing. It used to crash right after the ModuleManager loaded, so I removed it from the folder, it now loads to the end and just crashes. So, I tried moving all the items under the Parts folder in the KSO folder in gamedata to the Parts folder in the KSP directory, still no change. By the way, I installed the mod using the automatic installer, manual install, heck I even tried to install each pack individually, it still does not work.
