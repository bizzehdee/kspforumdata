It is human nature to approach what we do not understand through the lens of what we do observe around us. It\u0027s the same with geocentrism. Even our space exploration and search for extraterrestrial intelligent life efforts are based on geocentric theories about what is out there. NASA\u0027s attempts to find \u0022intelligent life\u0022 are based on finding planets in \u0022habitable zones\u0022 defined as a temperature range that can support the existence of liquid water. This is because on Earth, nearly every form of life contains H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO in some form. Who\u0027s to say that all intelligent life must depend on water? What if there is a form of intelligent life that thrives on ammonia in the same manner as life on our planet requires and thrives on water? Who is to say that all intelligent life must be carbon-based? Once we get beyond of thinking of life as having a similar genetic makeup as we have and stick with what we know all living things must do (reproduce, feed to produce energy, respirate), then we develop a wider net in the search for intelligent life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T19:51:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery point in space is the center of the universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Earth on the other hand is most certainly not stationary in space, if we\u0027re at the center of the universe right now then a \u003Cem\u003Esecond \u003C/em\u003Elater we\u0027re dozens of kilometers away from that point unlikely to ever return.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T19:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222304903\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126879\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449082445\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002241764\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Doconicus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n57 minutes ago, Doconicus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would ask, how would or could someone create a Kerbin Centrism model to see what that would be like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a planetary modder, just a plugin developer, so take this with a grain of salt.
