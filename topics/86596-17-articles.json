One thing with this mod, sure, is that proper handling of weather comes first, visual effects later. With code now running without major problems, is possible to experiment what happens after a consistent interval of in-game time. While each test run takes longer (we can\u0027t yet use timewarp in game, that feature will come later), unexpected behaviour is revealed and needs be corrected. Sometimes, it\u0027s just a single error in how an equation was entered in code, so takes very little to fix after the issue is discovered (oh, how many little bugs come each day). But the simulation increasingly shows to need more precision too, so more or better equations have to be used.

And kerbal wind is someone ripping off the very first version of KWS and running with it. Kerbal Wind wouldnt strictly conflict with KWS but it is not recommended to have with it. Kerbal Wind is just forces being applied how you want them, like a wind chamber, last i checked it didnt have a random component to it so it was just you telling wind which way to hit the craft. I suggest waiting on the update for KWS as it\u0027s getting closer and closer to release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
