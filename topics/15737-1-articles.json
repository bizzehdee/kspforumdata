I don\\\u0027t even know if there is a docking mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. But I knew there must be a way to dock a ship with default parts. I decided that when I said \u0027Docking\\\u0027 I would consider it a success when the two ships would function and move as one. A classic way to do this is to attach lander legs to your ship and \u0027claw\u0027 you ships together, but that\\\u0027s not very reliable since legs snap easily or have glitched out whenever I\\\u0027ve tried them. So, I decided to get creative. Here\\\u0027s what I came up with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, its a tube made of empty fuel canisters with the command module on one end and retractable wheels on the other at angles to form a rudimentary iris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, because of some bug, some of the canisters detached and went flying off. I lost exactly half of my \u0027tube\u0027, but I could still manage to hold the reconnaissance shuttle if I was careful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship dubbed \u0027Birdcage\u0027 managed to pilot the other ship around for about a minute before it slipped out of one of the missing sides. I had planned to use the Birdcages fuel for re-entry but since they were no longer docking I had no choice but to EVA my reconnaissance shuttle and latch the pilot to the side of the pod and re-enter that way. The Birdcage managed to slow down just enough to get down to 25,000m before running out of fuel at which point I returned to the spacecraft to review the situation. The Kerbal from the Reconnaissance ship was no longer on board and to my horror was floating 13km away and getting farther from the ship. He had 60% fuel and I managed to fly him to the Birdcage but didn\\\u0027t have enough fuel to slow down and he bounced off into space and to his inevitable demise during re-entry. His relatives were informed of his demise and had the song \u0027Major Tom\u0027 by the Shiny Toy Guns played to them for Awesomes sake. The pilot of the Birdcage screamed to hard in terror that his mouth would never close for the rest of his life until he choked on a mosquito while driving down a highway in his roofless konvertebal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, here are some screen caps from the whole experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if anyone can help me get those nice big images, please do.
