First of all, ANY air-launch-to-orbit proposal has the problem that no matter how high your starting altitude is, you can only save about 1 km/s out of 9 km/s. To get a reasonable payload capacity, you also need an ENORMOUS carrier aircraft. I doubt any practical air-launch system could handle more than 20 tons of payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis proposal is even worse. They\u0027re accelerating the entire balloon to orbit, which means their system is basically an SSTO with a high-altitude launch pad. To make matters worse, balloon envelopes are extremely heavy compared to their contents. Even if you filled the balloon with hydrogen and used that as propellant, good luck getting a mass ratio anywhere near what you\u0027d need for orbit. And remember all that drag the balloon is supposed to generate on reentry? It\u0027s generating that same amount of drag on the way up, but is supposed to spend several DAYS at mesopheric altitude. 50-100 km is where relatively compact metal capsules do a lot of their deceleration. Columbia broke up in that altitude range, and expendable spacecraft probably break up even higher. Even if the balloon survived, the drag losses would be astronomical. Finally, assuming the balloon makes it into orbit, it\u0027s envelope is extremely thin, on the order of a few microns. It is also an extremely large (tens of thousands of square meters) target for micrometeoroids and orbital debris. The thing will be turned into swiss cheese.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T23:10:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried this \u0022cobra braking\u0022 maneuver with my small cargo spaceplane tonight, and I have to say I\u0027m impressed.
