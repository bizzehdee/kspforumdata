The ship was controled by a probe \u003Cem\u003EProbodyne HECS\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and had no crew or tourists only initially. It consisted among other stuff of uncommanded seats of\u00A02 \u003Cem\u003EMk 1 Crew Cabins\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and 1 commanded seat of\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0Mk\u003Cem\u003E1 \u003C/em\u003ECommand Pod\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0I rendezvous successfully with kerbal to be rescued.
