Why? Mostly because you\u0027re not overwhelmed with all available parts at once. You get to know them, do few missions, get more science, advance in tech tree, get new parts and repeat the whole process. Once you\u0027re familiar with the basics, or just curious of some things - go sandbox. Also sandbox is mostly for making your own goals, while career/science is most about contracts (well career more, because funding is essential). I guess Science would be the easiest mode for getting the hang of things (no problems with funding).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JackBush","CreatedById":149535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T16:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to both of you; good advice.

Find out what every single button does and how to use it. Importantly, learn how to use the four build gizmos in the SPH and VAB in the top left hand corner next to the parts tab. These will help a lot! Learning to build in KSP is essential, start out by learning the basics, then as you become more familiar with the controls, EXPERIMENT!
