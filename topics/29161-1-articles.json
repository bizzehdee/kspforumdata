It has a rocket engine and everything. And RCS, and a coupler! If anything is designed to get into space, it\u0027s this.

Fourteen times it inexplicably rolls over and explodes. Requires length of entire runway and the little drop at the end to get in the air without losing rocket engine. Much like every other spaceplane, it inexplicably always wants to yaw off to the left on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Spend three minutes gradually inching the nose around to the heading I need. Lose plane at least once as it completely departs from controlled flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Fly for ten minutes. Entire flight has to be done at a pitch of 45 degrees, and that\u0027s just to get a small amount of vertical gain. Despite the fact that the wings on this thing are massive and it\u0027s got two giant jet engines, it\u0027s utterly incapable of straight-and-level flight. Attempting straight and level means dropping from the sky like a rock. Apparently the concept of lift is a foreign one to Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) At around 18km with the jet engines rapidly losing efficiency and almost no intake air, I close all the intakes, turn off the jet engines, and turn on the rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Watch as spaceplane \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Erockets to the heavens\u003C/span\u003E continues to have to fly at a 45 degree angle, doesn\u0027t gain speed in any appreciable fashion, and takes almost all of its fuel and goes absolutely nowhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis pretty much sums up my experience with every spaceplane I\u0027ve ever tried to use.
