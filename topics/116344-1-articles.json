Now after Dildred and Bob Kerman arrived to connect it all together, I realized that I had the wrong idea about how FlexTubes were supposed to be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I thought was that I could use one flex tube on one module and link it to some empty wall on another module. I now stand corrected on this, as some quick experimentation led me to conclude that I need an actual flex tube in each end. So, now that I\u0027ve learned this the hard way, are there any workarounds to resolve this, so that I won\u0027t have to launch my entire base from scratch again?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I was thinking was to hack/cheat by doing this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Edit the flextube part, so that they are detatchable on EVA, like KAS struts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Somehow edit one of the supply containers via the savegame to include a few of the flextubes (Or if this fails, launch a separate supply craft with some tubes onboard)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Attach flextubes to the empty walls where I was intending to link to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Link it all up as per original intention\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Edit all changes back to normal and enjoy my Minimus base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy questions then are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Would this be the easiest way of going about this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If so, how? Some pointers on how to make these parts KAS-detatchable would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Is there a simple way of changinc the contents of a KAS supply crate? (I have a lot more explosives than I\u0027ll ever need, and if it comes to it, some of them can be flex tubes)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T20:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou say KAS you mean KIS ? and would think you could pick a part and surface attach it with KIS and then you might have to edit the flex tube to attach to the node of the part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T08:40:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re still using the pre-KIS version of KAS, then yes, you can also make these parts KAS-attachable with a MM config.
