Now after Dildred and Bob Kerman arrived to connect it all together, I realized that I had the wrong idea about how FlexTubes were supposed to be used.\n\nWhat I thought was that I could use one flex tube on one module and link it to some empty wall on another module. I now stand corrected on this, as some quick experimentation led me to conclude that I need an actual flex tube in each end. So, now that I\u0027ve learned this the hard way, are there any workarounds to resolve this, so that I won\u0027t have to launch my entire base from scratch again?\n\nWhat I was thinking was to hack/cheat by doing this:\n\n1. Edit the flextube part, so that they are detatchable on EVA, like KAS struts\n\n2. Somehow edit one of the supply containers via the savegame to include a few of the flextubes (Or if this fails, launch a separate supply craft with some tubes onboard)\n\n3. Attach flextubes to the empty walls where I was intending to link to.\n\n4. Link it all up as per original intention\n\n5. Edit all changes back to normal and enjoy my Minimus base.\n\nMy questions then are:\n\n1. Would this be the easiest way of going about this?\n\n2. If so, how? Some pointers on how to make these parts KAS-detatchable would be nice.\n\n3. Is there a simple way of changinc the contents of a KAS supply crate? (I have a lot more explosives than I\u0027ll ever need, and if it comes to it, some of them can be flex tubes)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T20:09:09Z","Content":"You say KAS you mean KIS ? and would think you could pick a part and surface attach it with KIS and then you might have to edit the flex tube to attach to the node of the part."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T08:40:52Z","Content":"If you\u0027re still using the pre-KIS version of KAS, then yes, you can also make these parts KAS-attachable with a MM config. See [A Mechanic is Jeb](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71683) and just add in flextubes if they\u0027re not already there.\n\nWith the newer [KAS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514) \u002B [KIS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113111) there\u0027s no hacking necessary; you should be able to simply snap a flextube to the side of the building, and then use it as if you had added it in the VAB.\n\nI don\u0027t know how to edit the container\u0027s contents, but you could save a copy of your persistent.sfs, put a flextube in the container, and then look at the difference."}]}
