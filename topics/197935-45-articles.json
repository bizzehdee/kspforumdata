KSP is really in its own genre at this point in time (a couple devs have tried to emulate unsuccessfully). KSP is all about the struggle to get into space, and a relatively accurate depiction thereof (without needing a supercomputer for true physics calcs and orbital mechanics). Space Engineers and Emperion are the \u0022fantastical\u0022 depictions of where we could be in a couple hundred years... Kerbal is a depiction of where we could be in our lifetime if resources are dedicated to it. This is one of the reasons I stopped responding to the people in this very thread that are negative about the game and trying to use their force of will to create a minority voice to change the base formula of the game. It\u0027s not about \u0022seeing large starships undock in orbit while viewing from the surface of a planet\u0022... that\u0027s just not the aim/goal of Kerbal, it\u0027s about \u0022near future experiences\u0022 if we have the vision and drive to get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-06T21:50:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2022 09:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by saxappeal89129\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatsEJstandfor","CreatedById":220814,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-06T22:09:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it\u0027s safe to assume anything like that quite yet.

Simply set the \u0022departure\u0022 and \u0022arrival\u0022 orbits to be identical and the automated supply run feature would probably interpret that as a \u0022keep this thing in this orbit\u0022 instruction, in other words it would allow you to \u003Cstrong\u003Eautomate station keeping\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, if you can set conditions for other actions to happen besides just keeping a course, you could set it up so that satellites that are almost out of propellant would execute a pre-planned de-orbit burn or send themselves to a \u0022graveyard orbit\u0022 with new satellites being automatically launched to replace them, or alternatively they could signal to send for a vessel to refuel the existing satellite (assuming you put a compatible docking port on it when you built the thing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would replicate quite well the #1 reason old satellites are decomissioned IRL (lack of fuel) without bothering the player beyond setting it up (unless they want to get involved in it manually, of course).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe #1 reason IRL satellites are decomissioned or go adrift is that they simply run out of propellant to be able to keep their \u0022orbital slot\u0022 in geostationary orbit (like most geostationary communications satellites), or lose the ability to maintain orbital altitude if in LEO (like Starlink satellites are designed to gracefully deorbit themselves if they malfunction, since that large solar panel creates quite a lot of atmospheric drag (which is a thing at those low orbital altitudes)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while your concerns are valid, I think the solution is already in existence (tho it might need some minor modifications).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: And yes, of course, they would have to increase the orbit radius of most/all of the moons of Jool (and any other gas giant with similarly close-orbiting high mass moons).\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever as far as I\u0027m concerned that doesn\u0027t constitute a \u0022change\u0022 to the KSP 1 solar system so much as it constitutes a change to make the physics make sense (because for a game that has a lot of realism in its orbital mechanics, the orbital configuration of Jool and its moons is not long-term stable AT ALL).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT 2:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is probably the SINGLE concession to realism that I think should be made in KSP 2, because it is the one that is most impactful to the \u0022fly\u0022 aspect of orbital mechanics. Not life support, not random (or not so random) part failures, not \u0022removing metallic hydrogen from the game because that doesn\u0027t work like that\u0022, none of that matters as much as N-Body physics (and along with that having the solar system have a configuration that is compatible with N-Body physics).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then again, Orbiter ALSO solved the orbital drift problem. You see, it had another option for the physics, \u0022orbit stabilization\u0022, which does pretty much what my \u0022automated station keeping\u0022 idea does, but it does it fully automatically. I\u0027m not sure how it works, maybe it just nulls out the influences of the gravity of the other celestial bodies when in a low orbit around a planet or moon (that\u0027s my best guess), but it sure did work to keep the ISS where it belongs around Earth without me having to do anything to it (back when I played Orbiter that is).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo maybe the best approach to N-Body for KSP is for it to only have an effect when it really makes a difference, which for my purposes would be \u0022twice the orbital radius of geostationary orbit on a non-tidally locked planet or moon\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause being able to park a satellite or an orbital \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E at someplace nice and stable like L4/L5 (or in an orbit around another lagrangian point, such as L1/L2) is just such a nice thing. Yeah the lagrangian points tend to be quite distant from a given planet, but there\u0027s just so many interesting things you can do with them, like the mentioned satellite or station (or colony) parking spots, or using them to create a \u0022grand tour\u0022 trajectory that use a tiny amount of propellant because the assists all basically pass thru lagrangian points of various planetary bodies and moons (there\u0027s plenty more you can do with them, I\u0027m just scratching the surface).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just don\u0027t want a player to find a neat trick that NASA used with regards to orbital mechanics, and be unable to replicate it (or disincentivized from replicating it) because of KSP 2\u0027s simplified orbital physics modelling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT 3!, Give it up for Edit 3!:\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou know, additionally, without non-spherical gravity sources, you can\u0027t even get a proper Sun-Synchronous Orbit (which is the ideal orbit for practically any kind of mapping satellite). Instead, you\u0027re forced to wait for the planet to turn under you, which if it\u0027s tidally locked will be a very long time indeed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that might only matter if we get ScanSat-like functionality in KSP 2, but I see no reason we shouldn\u0027t get something like that. Using a satellite to map a planet is a thing that takes some amount of time significantly longer than a player would be likely to just wait for, instead they\u0027d be doing something else in the background, it really shouldn\u0027t work like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E orbital resource scanner (the one you put in a polar orbit) works at all, that thing\u0027s far too quick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-09T21:57:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2022 09:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
