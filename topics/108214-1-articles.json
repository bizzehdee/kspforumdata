I\u0027m used to play with FAR, but it\u0027s not updated yet, so I tried with the stock aero. Yesterday finally I discovered the beautiful \u0022Instell Incorporated Experimental Technologies\u0022 that provided me with the mighty Scramjet Engines. After a couple of try with some small planes, I tried for a proper MK3 cargo plane. \n\n![qaeHTb8.png](http://i.imgur.com/qaeHTb8.png)\n\n![b5Sikf0.png](http://i.imgur.com/b5Sikf0.png)\n\n![Xj6iDHi.png](http://i.imgur.com/Xj6iDHi.png)\n\nThe problem is that this ship is unstable at high altitude. It seems that the engines are aligned with the CoM, but my nose continue to fly by itself. Can someone please help me?\n\nCraft Download: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/qqmfi6kdk8gih22/SSTO%20Test%20III.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qqmfi6kdk8gih22/SSTO%20Test%20III.craft?dl=0)\n\nMod Requested: TweakScale [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112693](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112693)\n\n Instell Incorporated Experimental Technologies [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119735-1-0-2-Instell-Incorporated-Experimental-Technologies](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119735-1-0-2-Instell-Incorporated-Experimental-Technologies)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T14:57:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nansuchao**"},{"CreatedByName":"stardog573","CreatedById":80918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T15:12:33Z","Content":"Problem is that CoM of your craft moves toward rear as fuel is consumed. Because jet engine consumes fuel evenly from all fuel tanks, short tank at front will be empty when long tank at rear is half-empty. Even if you put long fuel tank in front of cargo bay, CoM still will be moved because front tank is farther from CoM than rear tank. Try to maintain position of CoM during your flight.\n\nAnd if you don\u0027t locate CoM of spacecraft at center of cargo bay, same kind of problem will be happened while you load/unload cargo.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T15:14:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 03:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stardog573**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T15:15:09Z","Content":"Yes, for that reason I use TAC Fuel Balancer, but no solution with that."},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T17:18:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, for that reason I use TAC Fuel Balancer, but no solution with that.\n\nI am looking at your design, and seeing as I have already given up on the new stock aero and am using the NuFAR dev build I can\u0027t offer much advice.\n\nThe problem is the air up higher gets much thinner now, so airhogging just doesnt work as well as it once did. So once you lost your jets to provide gimble force to keep the nose down you are now relying on very thin canards to try and keep the nose under control. I would suggest using RCS thrusters to help with that in stock. Also I would stay lower till you get your speed up then use that to transition to a higher altitude. \n\nOh and as a long time FAR user you will LOVE the NuFAR!\n\n![WcNoh0P.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WcNoh0P.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T17:42:53Z","Content":"Thank you very much Hodo.
