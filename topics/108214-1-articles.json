I\u0027m used to play with FAR, but it\u0027s not updated yet, so I tried with the stock aero. Yesterday finally I discovered the beautiful \u0022Instell Incorporated Experimental Technologies\u0022 that provided me with the mighty Scramjet Engines. After a couple of try with some small planes, I tried for a proper MK3 cargo plane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qaeHTb8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qaeHTb8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b5Sikf0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022b5Sikf0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Xj6iDHi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Xj6iDHi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that this ship is unstable at high altitude. It seems that the engines are aligned with the CoM, but my nose continue to fly by itself.

Because jet engine consumes fuel evenly from all fuel tanks, short tank at front will be empty when long tank at rear is half-empty. Even if you put long fuel tank in front of cargo bay, CoM still will be moved because front tank is farther from CoM than rear tank.

So once you lost your jets to provide gimble force to keep the nose down you are now relying on very thin canards to try and keep the nose under control. I would suggest using RCS thrusters to help with that in stock. Also I would stay lower till you get your speed up then use that to transition to a higher altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and as a long time FAR user you will LOVE the NuFAR!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WcNoh0P.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WcNoh0P.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T17:42:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much Hodo.
