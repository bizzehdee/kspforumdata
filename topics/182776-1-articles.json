I\u0027m running kerbal under steam on a Windows box and about 10% of the time it hangs while loading. Either immediately on loading or as soon as I select somewhere to go in the space centre. It\u0027s not a major problem as it seems transient and a restart usually fixes it but it is strange particularly as this only happens on my bigger computer (i5 based gaming PC, 8Gb RAM, 2TB disk, GTX 1050, twin screens). If I run it on my laptop (i3, 8Gb RAM,\u00A00.5 Tb, bog standard integrated graphics) the entire system crawls along and gets quite hot but it is absolutely stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-10T16:13:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2019 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by jnbspace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-10T17:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait for it to hang again and then post your output.log into something like dropbox, and share the link.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Hard to diagnose the problem without some context.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre the games\u003Cem\u003E identical\u003C/em\u003E on both machines?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jnbspace","CreatedById":195299,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-12T21:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTa.
