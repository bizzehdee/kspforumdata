They had the same pressures on them that we have now. Probably more. We worry about money, because all security comes from money, food, healthcare, shelter. If you have lots of money, and are very careful with your social networks, you can get yourself a good\u00A0 reputation and earn respect. Respect, reputation and money gets you a mate, who maks you happy then helps you make a bunch of little resourrce sinks. Which means you need to collect more money. All the while you worry about others who want to take your thing, but if someone does, society automaticaly upholds your rights as a victim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe H/G doesnt have the nice single asset to collect.

Their reputation and respect is tied directly to their ability to manage their social networks. But their reputation and respect is what stops their tribe mates from stealing their things while they are out hunting, their protection from victimisation is not a given, but rather depends on the mood of their peers. So a HG is likely to spend much more time on social activities then we are. A well liked person can murder a disliked person and get away with it if they have kissed the right donkeys first. But on the otherside, a person who has to devote more time to survival (maybe they have an elderly, non productive mouth to feed as well as the usual pack of dependants) spends less time with networking, so falls out of favor.

Respect, reputation, property, that all is just our (your) fantasy and is naturally strongly biased. There are, in fact, a lot of hints that all of these did not exist until maybe the late ice-age, the last hunters of the open cold-steppe called magdalenien (roughly 15.000 before now). They lived in a paradise, built yurts and (a little jokey) just where waiting for food to come home.
