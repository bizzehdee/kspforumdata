Dock radial fuel tanks for Asparagus staging on the sides (maybe 6 or so), and dock a nuclear thermal rocket on the back. Have some chemical rockets get it into interplanetary space (don\u0027t want to irradiate Earth), and fire up the nuclear thermal rocket. Use Asparagus staging for maximum efficiency, and once the burn is complete, undock the thermal engine and put it on a course to crash it into the Sun or Proxima Centauri (don\u0027t want to irradiate Proxima b, either).
