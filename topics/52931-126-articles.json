The canopy will slowly drift downwards, but due to air drag, the canopy will still remain inflated, while the riser lines slacken. Eventually, the canopy will pancake flat on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejpkerman, you\u0027re effectively suggesting the parachute canopy somehow will push out all the air underneath it and turn back into a neat long strip (and later, a folded bundle), and that somehow, the discarded pilot chutes will magically reappear and the mortars will un-fire. It\u0027s like attempting to unboil an egg.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T03:05:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jpkerman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jpkerman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot to distract but just to run something up the flag pole about the autocut/deploy/topple over questions...\u003Cp\u003E 1. Could the chute have a strong SAS value that applys for a few seconds after auto cut and then cuts off? I have found that landing with SAS on helps prevent toppling over on slopes and helps with what appears to be some kind of rebounding game physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. Could the inflation animation simply run in reverse before the chutes disappear?

Stupid Chris set out to make better chutes that behave more like their IRL counterparts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReal Chutes don\u0027t help your probes be stable on landing. That\u0027s your job to deal with. If you find SAS works for you then use SAS. If you find using RCS to stabilize them works then use RCS. Or use broad landing legs. Or land on flatter terrain. Or install KAS so you can grapple to the ground (ala Philae). In each case though, that\u0027s your responsibility to figure out. The chutes did their part already by getting you on the ground at substantially lower than terminal velocity or supersonic speeds.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDo you know what happens to chutes in real life?
