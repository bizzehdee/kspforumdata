The vessel has around 300 science packed on it, and I have no idea how to send a ship to return it. I can get to the vessel rather easily, but once I get it how do I \u0027attach\u0027 the two ships and de-orbit the lander?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T21:44:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it has fuel and there is Kerbal inside it, you can deorbit it even without electricity. Let it coast to apoapsis, then set minimum throttle (right above zero) and turn the ship retrograde - engine gimbal still works so it will turn. Once it is turned retrograde, use full throttle and burn until the periapsis is in atmosphere. And then just land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T22:02:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s a probe and it has retracted solar panels (Why you would ever want to retract them is beyond me) you can send up a Kerbal to manually extend the panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as \u0022Attaching\u0022 two rockets together you need a docking port on each ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T22:04:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Kashua said, but you probably want to aim for a periapsis around 25 - 35 km above Kerbin\u0027s surface, even though atmosphere starts at 70 kms. The lower atmosphere will slow you down faster. If your periapsis is above 40 km, it will likely take several passes for your to deorbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T22:07:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf it\u0027s a probe and it has retracted solar panels (Why you would ever want to retract them is beyond me) you can send up a Kerbal to manually extend the panels. \u003Cp\u003EAs far as \u0022Attaching\u0022 two rockets together you need a docking port on each ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the claw with a solar panel attached to it, put a decoupler to separate the claw from the rescue rocket.
