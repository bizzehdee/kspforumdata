E.G. removing some propellant to add KIS storage, or include some different resources (no clue why on that one).  Could also potentially make adding Life-Support supplies a bit easier as they could be added as a second sub-container that would allow for the player to adjust the amounts/ratios of the various LS supplies (or remove some in favor of more KIS storage or otherwise).  Thoughts?\n\u003E \n\nThere was a little MM mod out called Command Inventory that put KIS inventory slots in anything that holds a kerbal, including your pods. I haven\u0027t seen it back for 1.1.2, but I\u0027m sure it\u0027s nothing to update it. After all, it\u0027s just a few lines of code that took the number of kerbals that pod could hold and multiply it by 300 for storage capacity. Probably the only thing I\u0027d like to see KIS on your parts are more containers. But, with the introduction to your station part, I can see that being very handy and you are working on it. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-02T22:28:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2016 10:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ComatoseJedi**"},{"CreatedByName":"Musil","CreatedById":132791,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T01:15:54Z","Content":"I am having a problem where quite a few parts appear invisible.

So far I haven\u0027t actually hooked it into the engine module or worked on making the data persistent in any fashion; it is merely a visual float-curve tool at this point.  Bit of UI/accessibility cleanup to do on it as it is a bit...finicky to use (as it re-sorts the entries after every change... trying to set the \u0027time\u0027 value is a bit difficult); will likely go to a manual-update system where the user presses a button to update the displayed graph and sort the entries.\n\nToday/tonight I\u0027ll be working on adding in the \u0027preset\u0027 thrust curves and the ability to load, use, and edit those, along with the first pass at some sort of persistence for the custom curve data.\n\n[@blowfish](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119688-blowfish/)  do you know if I can mark a FloatCurve with [KSPField(isPersistent=true)] ?  That would pretty much just \u0027solve\u0027 the problem, but I\u0027ve never tried it.  My other option would be to encode the data for the entire curve to a single string and store that as a persistent field (no idea if there is a size limit on those strings.... a fully defined thrust curve could be rather large); have done similar with a few other modules with good results, but would prefer to not resort to such hackery if it can be avoided..\n\nAnyhow, the SRB thrust curve stuff is literally the last thing on my pre-balance-pass TODO list.
