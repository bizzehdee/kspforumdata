This is rather dissapointing since the game offically supported the 6DOF mouse since .23. Having moved the camera with the mouse while in any editor, if you attempt to place a part the part will instantly appear behind the part list and be unselectable. parts placed before moving the camera with the 3D mouse will stil be selectable.\n\nThis is a crippling bug. While it\u0027s great that KSP now also supports TrackIR, not being able to use the 3D mouse in the editor makes the whole process of building craft unenjoyable and (personally) unplayable.\n\nThis bug has been confirmed since .90. It\u0027s too bad it wasn\u0027t fixed for the offical 1.0 release.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103227-3D-Mouse-%283Dconnexion%29-unusable-in-contruction-%2832-and-64-bit%29-in-90](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103227-3D-Mouse-%283Dconnexion%29-unusable-in-contruction-%2832-and-64-bit%29-in-90)\n\n[http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/3838](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/3838)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I use a 3Dconnexion Space Navigator mouse with KSP. It was also officially supported with the start of KSP .23\n\u003E The problem I have though is in the contruction buildings. At first the camera is centered to the middle of the VAB (which is normal). If I build my rocket without touching the 3D mouse everything is fine. Though as soon as I used the 3D mouse to rotate or move the camera I am unable to place any parts anymore. When I select a part from the part list it instantly plops into the VAB an I am unable to select it or move it. Thus making it impossible to build anything. I can only place parts for as long as I don\u0027t touch the 3D mouse. Once I do I can\u0027t place any parts at all anymore, even if the recenter the camera using the noramal mouse controls. After that I have to either reload the ship I\u0027m building or leave the VAB. But I can still not select any parts that where placed into the VAB while I was using the 3D mouse. I can however still select free floating parts that had been placed into the VAB from before I used the 3D mouse. All these parts are just free floating. They are not connected to any spacecraft. They also vanish if I reload the ship or exit the VAB (which is normal). I can still select parts that are part of my rocket. As long as I built the rocket without touching the 3D mouse.\n\u003E \n\u003E This is 100% repeatable on both 32 and 64bit windows version of KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Nihilus","CreatedById":97741,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T01:18:57Z","Content":"You are not alone.
