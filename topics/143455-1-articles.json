I have been playing KSP since 0.23 which back then I was more like a Crazed Kerbal who thought that aiming right at the moon works and things that make logical sense but little did I know that that\u0027s a bunch of crazy talk and boloney! And I didn\u0027t get into actually play the game and do everything without using hyperedit and that was... Now! That\u0027s right after a year of not playing KSP I came back and starting learning how to play, and land on\u003Cs\u003E the \u003C/s\u003E\u003Cstrike\u003Emun\u003C/strike\u003E Duna, Annd right what I\u0027m doing landing on duna using bare bone knowledge of interplanetary travel. They said landing the mun is hard, Its actually hard to land on the north pole (Which I very much did land on the north pole).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways Enough of me rambling about how great my piloting skills are (Oh surely Doge you must be so great at it) and yeah I wasted 11 years in KSP waiting for a angle... Angles are slow and rage inducing to look at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I did a rescue mission on the mun which I landed 8.7km from a crash site so that is close (What a bunch of crazy talk). Anyways I\u0027m going top this off with a picture!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align: center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vxFFo17.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562px\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vxFFo17.png\u0022 width=\u00221000px\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-10T02:03:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Dogenutt. The Imgur link you want is the BBCode option. I tried to fix it for you, but I can never remember how since Imgur hid the link options of other people\u0027s pics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, welcome to the forum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYay!
