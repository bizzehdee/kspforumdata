Aside from the standard editing tools you find in photoshop, Google (to search for textures) and generous as well as proper use of high resolution texture generation. There just isn\u0027t a magic tool or set of tools that can do it all for you, it really is a process or workflow you\u0027d have to learn. There are some awesome tutorials out there by Ben Mathis, as well as the Polycount forums which I\u0027ve been a member for years. Lots of industry professionals there give many tips and you\u0027ll find all sorts of tutorials covering map generation, workflow, understanding topologies (to make subdivision easier) and so on. It would be impossible for me to give folks a straight answer without an hour long tutorial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually start with a master model. The master model rarely gets into the game. This model is sub divided in a way that has as few poles as possible. This makes it easier to sub divide the model upwards (for high res version) and downward for the low polygon game asset. Mudbox and other sculpting tools (such as Zbrush) hate models with too many poles, so understanding edge loops and topology is kind of important. The reason I say that is because it\u0027s all linked. As a very skilled artist once said; the days of making a 3D model and then slapping a texture on to it later on is pretty much over. The 3D model -and- the texture is kind of done together in a way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not uncommon for me to make two separate models completely. For the KSO, I believe I made a total of about two copies of it from scratch... I know for sure I made like three different wings and two cargo bays. This was because the low res wouldn\u0027t subdivide properly into the high res, requiring that I construct essentially a new model from scratch. Unfortunately the second model wouldn\u0027t cast properly without a lot of projection errors so I had to rebuild them again. This normally doesn\u0027t happen on characters since they are usually a single piece. But for the KSO since it was a bunch of parts, you have to do so much more work. Although had I known what I know now about attachment nodes, the KSO would have been done in about half the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dfg3Qrh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Dfg3Qrh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zxi5ztx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Zxi5ztx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-All of the high resolution components of the KSO. Every screenshot I\u0027ve shown you guys, those objects have a high resolution component. Even the flat windows have a high resolution counterpart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-From 1 million polygons, down to just 12,000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nPFj2nG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nPFj2nG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The high resolution mesh of the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have your high res and low res UVed, you then use one of several tools (it depends on your 3D modeling program) to spit out a texture island map. This helps you in photoshop to figure out where everything is and where the edges of everything is at. When UVing you want to relax all surfaces and islands as well as kill as many seams as possible. You then want to get all islands in proper locations to save and use as much of the UV space as possible the most efficient. Understanding how UVs work is very important and it can take some practice. I sometimes will make certain islands larger than others if I want more detail in those areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DCTqXob.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DCTqXob.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the image above you\u0027ll notice that the Ambient Occlusion map was used as the primary shadower throughout the diffuse. I play around with the brightness and contrast values as well as hues until I\u0027m happy with it. I typically set it to a greyish brown hue since video cards do not like true 0,0,0 black. Once that is set I start texturing. Either painting them by hand or using textures from my library or online. I bake more textures such as the normal map so that I can use them to push light values, get detail, or blend an area in with its geometry (such as folds on clothes). A normal map can also be used to generate your edges, although do to how complicated the KSO was, I had to do most of that by hand. Since the outside of the orbiter was going to be kept plain and not too weathered, I did most of the edge work in the interior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Cv6iCzx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Cv6iCzx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The cockpit interior with its edge map turned to 100%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Edge maps are screened into your diffuse -and- your specular to push edge highlights out. Edge maps along with Ambien Occlusion are crucially important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the KSO wasn\u0027t going for a realistic look I didn\u0027t do a color map. However a color map, or a color diffuser layer on your diffuse is really important in breaking up your colors (in real life light scatters and nothing is perfectly white, or grey, or any one color). However a color diffuser (or scatterer) typically goes better with a dirt and grit layer. Again, the clean look of KSP just wouldn\u0027t work well with such layers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion there is no simple step or tool that I use. Instead I use a process that I\u0027ve been trying my best to perfect over the years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Master model with proper edge loops and topology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-High Resolution model with as many details as you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Low Resolution model\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Unwrapping UVW and relaxing your islands along Face or Edges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Moving mirrored UVs off by a tile offset\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Generating a UVW Island map to be used in photoshop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Generating a Normal Map, Ambient Occlusion, and any other map necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the maps you generated to help you put together your diffuse map and specular.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lyze Of J","CreatedById":61687,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T17:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh my, what beautiful internals, it looks very similar to some of B9\u0027s stuff, and could you release an image with a single rudder design, I read that you can use a v tail or a center tail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mushroomman","CreatedById":236,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T18:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs much as this looks amazing and I\u0027ll use it when it comes out, I\u0027ve never been fond mods that can only be used to build one specific thing.
