I don\u0027t know why, but NodeHelper does not report back the proper node locations when it accesses that data from the part itself, and if you use the numbers in the output from NodeHelper, upon reloading the game the nodes will be really whacky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news... I\u0027m having a real problem with the GUI again. I added a button to the bottom, again using another mod as a template. I\u0027ve checked and rechecked that no separate definitions or \u0022using\u0022 statements are different between the files, and copied the original code that simply checked the state of a button and executed a command when it was pressed. i added that in to our GUI and set it\u0027s text to \u0022Save and Close\u0022 and then, when the \u0022if\u0022 statement found that button to be in a \u0022true\u0022 state (which is returned when it is pressed) it then sets the variable \u0022isGUIEnabled\u0022 to false, which should cause the next check that the game does to OnGUI() to hide the GUI, and then makes a call to \u0022KFPersistenceManager.SaveConfig()\u0022 in the exact same manner than the \u0022onFalse\u0022 method does it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then added a debug log entry to that \u0022if\u0022 statement to make sure that the stuff inside it was actually being called properly. In-game I get no debug log entry, no configs saved, and no closure of the GUI. All I get is a Nullref error in my log. I re-checked my template mod, which I have tested to make sure \u003Cem\u003Eit\u003C/em\u003E works, and it does. So, I have no idea what is wrong with \u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E implementation of it. There\u0027s literally no difference other than the names of the methods to match the mod \u003Cem\u003Eexcept\u003C/em\u003E that in the template mod the config saving method is held within the same class.

Oh, is that the part that he used transforms to define the nodes in? yeah, so, if you were to define the nodes in the format that other parts tend to use, and strip out the transform nodes, it will simply use that form of node instead. The only reason for editing the model again is if you still want to use the transforms to define the nodes. My understanding is that the nodes are now much more strict about the orientation of a node when compared against the orientation of the connecting node on the other part. This could be nice when dealing with parts that have no attach node defined and are not capable of being attached radially. For instance, issues with really small engines being stack attached to a large fuel tank, you have a lot of issues with the engine wanting to snap to the bottom node with the bottom node of the engine, instead of attaching with the top node, and ending up inside the tank.
