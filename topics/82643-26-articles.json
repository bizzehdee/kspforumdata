I want parts that burn up during reentry and I\u0027ve struggled to get the game to do this without a lot of other issues. One of the major problems is that solar panels are far more durable in the atmosphere than I would like and I haven\u0027t found a way to change this. They\u0027re so durable in fact that they act as air brakes and slow the reentering satellite below the speed at which reentry heating would cause the satellite to burn up. The route I eventually discovered that produced results I liked was to lower the maximum temperatures using values from some research I\u0027d done into high temperature creep (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_(deformation)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewikipedia link\u003C/a\u003E). It turns out this works really well for burning up satellites in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the low maxtemp makes the temperature overlay always present because ambient temperature is approximately 40% of maxtemp. I figured the constant appearance of overheat warnings would bug people and I couldn\u0027t find a way to adjust the threshold for the overlay appearing. My conclusion has been to abandon interesting thermal performance for now and see about getting a working version tested.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T21:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice to see you back Orcmaul we all get caught up in RL cant be helped thanks for explaining the issues with the thermal stuff hopefully you can get it worked out and looking forward to your next release\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T22:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat to see you back, and I\u0027m sure there\u0027s people out there that know their way around the stock heating system and are willing to help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry Nertea or Streetwind, they\u0027ve been making the NearFuture reactors and radiators work with the stock heat system, so they should at least have a clue about how to make those solar panels work the way you want them to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I had to hazard a guess, I\u0027d try normal part temperature limits (1.3k or whatever the smaller probe cores use) emissivity on par with stock solar panels (OX-Stat or smaller non-retractable ones), mid-range part conductivity, high skin to internal conductivity, and mid-low thermal mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe is that the part responds somewhat quickly to external temperature influences (thermal mass), just as good as other solar panels at getting rid of heat (emissivity), \u0022okay\u0022 at transferring its internal heat to other parts (part conductivity), and the whole part tends to stay at the same temperature (skin-internal conductivity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if I forgot any parameters, but that should make a solar panel that isn\u0027t hard to burn off if left deployed, but won\u0027t show a temperature bar or explode just because it\u0027s landed on Eve or some other hot planet or moon (Moho excluded, EVERYTHING\u0027S hot there).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T21:02:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecraaaap I can never remember which mods use mm/dd/yy for their update dates and which ones use dd/mm/yy except for when it\u0027s obvious (16/7/15) - so I got momentarily excited when I saw 5/9/15 for this thread and was like whoo hoo!!
