Just look at the green line for transsonic design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you do exactly what you already did - move stuff around a bit, and try to reduce wave drag area by a couple of 0.01m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to know more, google \u0022area rule\u0022, possibly also \u0022shockwave\u0022, or hypersonic airflow or stuff like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERudder needs to be set for 0 roll reaction.

That usually does a good job for preventing RUD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, keep in mind that the engine power is always at a given speed and alt. At 0 alt and 0 speed it won\u0027t usually have max thrust.

Also applies to area ruling planes (-\u0026gt; green line)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: Ok, actually surprisingly well area ruled. Just 3 places which are definitly adding alot of drag:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intakes. Ducting air through your plane basicly reduces cross section - in this case this means that the cross section reduces and then risies again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust behind the intakes the radial attachment points have a lower cross section - again, reduced cross section where you don\u0027t want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the rear, where the wings end, there is a very steep reduction in cross section.
