The folks back on the ground will be very pleased!\u0027 said Jeb. \u0027Lets take it back to the ship!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two Kerbals carried the rock back to their ship, and stowed it and themselves on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I can\\\u0027t wait to get this back! Let\\\u0027s go home!\u0027 Jeb said with excitement. He pressed the big red button. The little craft shot upwards into the vacuum, Leaving a storm of Lunar dust in it\\\u0027s wake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn their exited rush, they had totally forgotten about their comrade Bob, who was quickly out of radio contact range. The sudden swirl of dust made him look up to see the spaceship leaving without him. He shrieked in desperation, even though he was well aware that, in space, no-one can hear you scream...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few hours later, Jeb and bob were being shaken about in their seats during the re-entry phase back into kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere. Then the parachutes opened, slowing their descent for a soft landing, assisted by the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Perfect landing!\u0027 Jeb and Bill high-fived each other. \u0027lets get this rock back to base. Bill, Bob, see to it that the rock gets safely to the science guys!\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly then did it strike either of them. They had forgotten Bob on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Oh no! What are we going to do now Jeb?!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027There\\\u0027s only one thing we can do. We\\\u0027re going back for him.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027But we only have three tanks of fuel left! It would be impossible!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027It isn\\\u0027t impossible, It\\\u0027s Kerbal!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a minimalist ship I made that can get to the Mun and back, twice. I just felt like giving it a bit of a story, I rushed it a bit at the end lol, it isn\\\u0027t very good, I know, any suggestions for improvement are welcome. Anyways I have attached the ship and pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just a few tips that might be helpful: My general flight plan is Straight up until first colour change on atmosphere indicator (~12km), at which point I lean over 45 degrees. I then carry on until the second colour change (~30km), and lean over about 90 degrees. Then circularize for 70km. This applies for the first Mun ship and the second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor landing with the parachutes, I usually try to land in the ocean. Slow down initially with the chutes, then at about 150m, thrust the engines at maximum. This should slow the craft down just enough for a soft landing, assuming you have very little fuel left in that stage (as there should be if you\\\u0027ve just been to the Mun and back).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Analogy","CreatedById":28969,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T22:38:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFriggin brilliant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Analogy","CreatedById":28969,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-22T05:19:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, do you know that the structural pylon is half the mass of a radial decoupler and is just as useful? It\\\u0027s only .2 mass saved per decoupler but for all these ultra-minimalist things I\\\u0027m always seeing you do, it might add up to something significant in one of your builds. It would save you .8 mass on the upper stage of this ship, which is pretty significant... Basically a third of a fuel tank worth of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-22T07:02:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMe like the story! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apotheosist","CreatedById":9399,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-22T12:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Analogy, Thanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E And yes, I have considered using the structural pylon, however I prefer using the usual decouplers as I am familiar with them, and it allows my craft to be more easily compared to/used with earlier versions of the game.
