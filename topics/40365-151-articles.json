Capping the radiators at an absolute minimum of 2.7K allows the radiators to start up correctly and then the generators and radiators can adapt to the spacecraft\u0027s actual power/heat situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll get this fix out soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T12:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving issues with solar panels and transmitter, sitting at 1Gm from sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT...
