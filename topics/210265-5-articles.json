I think it\u0027s entirely based on what you\u0027re raised with. People in countries with metric still use some imperial measures because they linger in cultural places and because their parents used them. Anyone raised with metric has an intrinsic understanding of metric and would say the human brain isn\u0027t wired to think in imperial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI 100% think and visualize in metric, and the little imperial I do know is due to it still being used in some places or because it is equivalent to something in metric. I know a foot is roughly 30cm because of rulers that have it on one side. I know inches because that\u0027s what warhammer 40k uses. I give my height in feet and inches because that\u0027s what everyone here does, but if asked how wide, long, tall something is, I\u0027d give an approximate answer in meters or centimeters. I know a gallon is about 4 liters because of a big milk jug. I don\u0027t know what a pop can is in imperial, but it is 355 milliliters. A small bottle of pop is 590 mL, large ones are 2 liters. I have no idea what a pint is. Go to the candy store, you pay by 100 grams. I fill up my car with liters, and I know how many liters the tank holds. I would have to convert it with a calculator if asked for it in gallons. Gravity is 9.81 m/s^2. I know how far things are in kilometers. I know miles are a bit larger, but couldn\u0027t tell you exactly off the top of my head. The only\u00A0Fahrenheit I know is that the oven is at 350 or 450, because the ovens we get are the same ones sold in the US, 32F is 0c, and -40 is the same in both. But I couldn\u0027t say what is hot or cold without converting to Celsius. Ask me what is a cold day, I\u0027ll say below -20C, ask me what is a very cold day I\u0027ll say -40C. Ask me room temperature, 20C. Ask me a hot day I say above 30C. No idea what those are in F unless I look it up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis extends to places you might not expect. A few years ago I was out on an industrial worksite for the first time, and expected the guys might be more familiar with feet and inches. To my surprise, everyone just wanted the measures in millimeters same as supplied on the drawings. And I was informed that all the work they do now is in mills, nobody wanted to deal with feet and inches. Makes sense, most of the guys are the same age as me now and grew up with metric more than imperial. I ask them to measure something for me, without prompting I get the answer in mills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is from a Canadian engineer who works often on US projects, where I do my work in metric before converting to imperial to give it to them, because its way easier to make mistakes in imperial.

The size of the planets and their orbits change to make the gameplay quicker and more fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess, is that KSP is already very comfortable with greatly scaling down sizes and distances. The whole ksp system fits inside one AU of earth\u0027s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is how I imagine the game design discussion might go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat gameplay purpose does separating tiny 1 AU star systems by 4 real scale light years serve? Except to make players wait longer to arrive. KSP2 is going to have an improved time warp, hopefully with faster options. But whatever the speed of the time warp, traveling between systems won\u0027t be instant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo does it make good gameplay sense to have players wait fifty or one hundred years in game, maybe five to ten minutes at max time warp, doing nothing as their ship travels to another system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes it make sense for them to abandon all their local ships and colonies and stations for fifty to one hundred years to warp their ship to the next star.

Cut all the distances by 1/10 th or some other figure. Now, it\u0027s 5 years, 10 years. A couple minutes of time warp. Still a long time, and still a long distance, enough to impress that space is massive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut now we have a problem. Now, the nearest star will say distance 0.4 light years. Obviously this won\u0027t work, because everyone knows the nearest start is 4 light years away. Nate Simpson even said four light years himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, we make a kerbal light year. We make it suitably smaller. We make the distance between systems smaller, easier to manage for the gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause everyone knows what a meter is. But only a fraction know what length a lightyear is off the top of their head. 90% of players probably wouldn\u0027t even notice if the game used a different length for a lightyear. Because even if they know how long a lightyear is off by heart, the game doesn\u0027t need to display meters and lightyears side by side. Meters could be used inside a system \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and lightyears outside it between them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not saying I am absolutely correct.

This is just my best guess based on what gameplay design courses I have taken and how KSP 1 did it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if the KSP2 devs decide that the game is better with smaller distances between stars. If they decide it saves them computing power to improve performance and stability, it saves players time, it makes the game more enjoyable. If they decide making the change makes KSP2 a better game. If they decide that the only thing lost is extra empty space and wasted time. If they decide to make up a kerbal version of the light year to make it all make sense.

But that also creates a cascade of things to reconcile in the units and constants (the time it takes wouldn\u0027t actually change much, as \u0022shorter\u0022 trips under full baristochrone trajectories take similar amounts of time). Most importantly, the actual value for a light year measured in meters is going to be wrong, which is bad for anyone who looks it up on the wiki and is woefully misled by distances that are an order of magnitude off.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis applies to any value that you assign a light year. If it isn\u0027t 1 ly, that means it isn\u0027t numerically accurate and people will probably want some sort of reason for that within the lore of the game. The 1/4th ly measurement probably works well for this, but then again, it isn\u0027t accurate and will throw people off when trying to convert from lightyears to meters. 1 ly is the only numerically accurate answer but it misrepresents the size of a light year by being too large for the rest of the game. So you have to decide what criteria you want to fill when scaling light years.

The interesting thing about a baristochrone trajectory is that the time to cross any distance increases with the square root of that distance, ignoring relativity and other effects. So crossing a distance in real light years is only 3 times as long as doing the same in deci light years. Between 30 and 100 years, the gameplay implications are pretty similar. However, the real consideration here is delta-V. If you want to take advantage of the square-root law, you have to be in a full baristochrone trajectory - no coasting phase. With smaller light years this is much easier as you have to burn for less time along the journey, while there is more challenge in getting enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to make a \u0022quick\u0022 journey in large light years.
