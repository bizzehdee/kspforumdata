A Mars Cycler is basicly a craft that has a special kind of trajectory that encounters Earth and Mars on a regular basis with out any fuel, using just gravity to sling shot it from each body (heres the wiki article for more details: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_cycler\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_cycler\u003C/a\u003E).

The only advantages i can think of may be that it would be easier to calculate the route to mars/duna, because you would only have to intercept the cycler. The other is that it may have a good and reliable life support system, and more space for the travelers to hang out. Well actually, one is good for playing ksp, the other would be good for real life.

That way the shuttles could have minimal life support and other supplies, using less fuel to manoeuvre between orbits while the passengers spend the bulk of the journey in the larger craft. That advantage is largely lost in KSP due to the lack of life support. The other interesting thing about an Aldrin Cycle is that the Cycler\u0027s orbit would have to be in resonance with the orbits of both of the destination planets, so it wouldn\u0027t be a simple Hohmann Transfer. In at least one direction the journey would be significantly shorter than in a Hohmann transfer, but the orbital period of the cycler would have to be at least twice that of the inner planet I think. I\u0027ve thought about trying to set one up in KSP, but then I think that it would be largely useless.

While these exist in the literature and should be possible in KSP they have a significant disadvantage. Most Earth - Mars ballistic cycler set ups require \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eat least\u003C/span\u003E 12 cycler vehicles to cover all the conjunction opportunities, unless your willing to wait 15 years before missions. In addition those that utilize gravity assist (all of them that use under 14 vehicles) require precise control, this is a challenge in the real world (esp when solar winds can be pushing a cycler off course). In KSP navigation is skewed by floating point errors during SOI changes that require course correction maneuvers as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs 12 to 14 cycling vehicles would be expensive to build, put up to speed and maintain most plans looking at cyclers in the literature for Earth -Mars transit have at least intermittent propulsive requirements. As an example, the trajectory of the Aldrin cycler using only gravity assists on it\u0027s fly bys would take it 100\u0027s of KM\u0027s below the earth surface, this is mathematically correct but challenging for space craft. This makes propulsion to make up the difference favorable. Electric propulsion (ion drive) has favorable mention in many papers. Of course that creates the challenge of calculating, \u0022optimum non-impulsive propulsive gravity assist maneuvers\u0022. apparently the computer used in the testing of that took up to 20 minutes to find a solution to a single maneuver. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was not aware of this when I attempted my first Kerbin - Duna cycler probe by following an Aldrin cycler style trajectory of one orbit every synodic period while attempting to use gravity assists.
