You see, imagine the constructin of the ISS(or MIR). Imagine only the core module had RCS. So every time a new module arrived the whole thing had to go for docking and use its tiny RCS thrusters. Same here, I mean if every part has balanced RCS each one can be easily docked. The ship with the engine and c few modules might not have had perfectly balanced RCS. That is why everyone puts RCS on every individual part of the ship for easy construction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manskal","CreatedById":73159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T06:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is fantastic!
