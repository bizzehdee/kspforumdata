Kipard posted a few pages ago, here are a few resources from older NASA docs that might be useful:\n\nRocket engines and tankbutt:\n\nNASA SP-125, Design of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines, is an early edition of Huzel and Huang\u0027s text on liquid rocket engine design. There are newer editions that are probably more relevant to modern engines, but this one is a NASA publication and is freely available. It can be found here: [http://ntrs.larc.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19710019929\u0026qs=N%3D4294129240%2B4294965930](http://ntrs.larc.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19710019929\u0026qs=N%3D4294129240%2B4294965930). It\u0027s a long document; some items of interest include Figs 3-2, 3-4, 3-7, 3-10, 10-10 to 12: biprop liquid engine layouts (both pump and pressure-fed); Figs 4-20 to 23: thrust chamber layouts; Figs 8-1 to 3: tank and engine configurations; Figures 9-1 to 5: engine mounting and interconnecting components; Figure 9-19: possible propellant duct routing for a gimballing engine; Figures 9-23 to 25: gimbals; Figures 10-26 and 27: photos of engine clusters.\n\nMost of the information in this book is probably too fine-grained detail to be of interest to most, but if you want to make sure your engine is realistic by actually doing the engineering design ...\n\nRCS placement:\n\nNASA SP-8028, Entry Vehicle Control, located here: [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700019228.pdf](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700019228.pdf). The figures in this monograph show the locations of RCS jets for control during re-entry for Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and X-15 vehicles.\n\nSEDR 300, Project Gemini Familiarization Manual, ought to be a good resource for this as well, but what I think is the relevant chapter (8, Guidance and Control Systems) is omitted from my copy as it was confidential at the time. I believe the whole thing is in the public domain now, but I can\u0027t find a version on any NASA servers. Perhaps someone else knows where to find a complete version.\n\nSolar panels:\n\nNASA SP-8074, Spacecraft Solar Cell Arrays, can be found here: [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710028154.pdf](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710028154.pdf). This one is mostly about the electrical and thermal design of solar cell arrays, but some Figures 14-16 show some mechanical layouts.\n\n---\n\nNASA released a whole series of monographs on subjects related to space vehicle design in the late 1960\u0027s through 1970\u0027s, numbered SP-8xxx, which you can find listed in this catalog: [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19810013465.pdf](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19810013465.pdf). Generally each is focused on a particular design area (e.g. wind loads during ascent or solid rocket motor igniters), and so does not contain much big-picture information that a modder might be looking for to just determine how something should look. But they\u0027re worth knowing about."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T22:29:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E -lots of awesome stuff-\n\nMucho, mucho gracias - Cpt.

All previous aircraft that had nose access moved the cockpit with the nose.\n\nVisor is an fitting name as it behaves as an visor and not like an nose cone who is removed then you want to access the inside.\n\nAs I understand the high cockpit of the 747 was selected because of its cargo version. It would give you an open cargo bay and an door as wide as the bay. The space behind the cockpit was for people following the cargo and spare pilots, it was too small to use as an effective passenger compartment. One the modern versions first class is typically put here, this also give the first class passengers the joy of calling the main deck the cargo compartment. Calling the upper deck an visor would however be plain wrong and an misunderstanding.\n\nDid not know that some planes also lifted the cockpit even if I see that it should work.\n\nRelated why do planes with rear cargo hatch like C-5 and C-17 also have an front hatch too? I know military want an rear door because it let you airdrop stuff and bring your own ramp. For civilian use you prefer an front opening as its lighter, no ramp and you don\u0027t need to have an huge opening in the tail, you would anyway use special equipment to load and unload. \n\nBut why opening in both ends, has the rear door some downsides who make you want an front door? have seen they loaded massive stuff trough it."},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T16:51:45Z","Content":"\u003E But why opening in both ends, has the rear door some downsides who make you want an front door? have seen they loaded massive stuff trough it.\n\nTo use a Nautical term.

This system is a series of angles right? Well the main bearing part (the Dark Grey L shape) has 3 bends on it not one like you would think at first look. Also the Door hinge is on the OUTSIDE and BELOW the door when the door is closed, meaning the open door\u0027s top edge is BELOW the closed doors lower edge by several inches even though they are the SAME door edge.\n\nWhen I go to the Air museum I will see if they still have the space shuttle Engineer\u0027s book I donated years ago to them. if they do, I might just be-able to get you exact dimensions and angles of those parts.

This landing gear has a solid plate instead of an axle between the two wheels (think a series of 4 parts to connect the wheels, two squares that each have a triangle on the opisite end. The joint where the square and triangle meet are hinge lines, a Hydraulic ram is attached to these hinges, pulling up to retract and pushing down to deploy. A control arm, not unlike that which holds the front tires of your car on and straight is attached at each end of the triangle right next to the wheels. This narrows the entire assembly as it rises up into the fuselage. The whole assembly is then covered by the drooping door in front of the main wheels.\n\n[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/F-111B_CVA-43_approach_July1968.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/F-111B_CVA-43_approach_July1968.jpg) \u003C-- US Navy official Photo so no Copyright.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T03:23:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 03:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pappystein**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T16:52:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Almost all of what I have is copyright material so I won\u0027t be-able to post much directly.

The book predates Challenger by atleast 2 years but I remember a plethora of dimensioned drawings dealing with the various parts of the shuttle crew could work on or around.\n\nCool\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Something that would be nice for a Landing Gear mod, A Mk1 and Mk2 version of the F-111 main gear.\n\u003E Not the best photograph but notice how the main gear seems to HANG. This landing gear has a solid plate instead of an axle between the two wheels (think a series of 4 parts to connect the wheels, two squares that each have a triangle on the opisite end. The joint where the square and triangle meet are hinge lines, a Hydraulic ram is attached to these hinges, pulling up to retract and pushing down to deploy. A control arm, not unlike that which holds the front tires of your car on and straight is attached at each end of the triangle right next to the wheels. This narrows the entire assembly as it rises up into the fuselage. The whole assembly is then covered by the drooping door in front of the main wheels.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/F-111B_CVA-43_approach_July1968.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/F-111B_CVA-43_approach_July1968.jpg) \u003C-- US Navy official Photo so no Copyright.\n\nOne thing at a time."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:09:15Z","Content":"Pappystein have you been to that museum?"},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T12:36:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pappystein have you been to that museum?\n\nNo RL has snuck up and bit me in the hindquarter. I am in a forced move mode ATM. Good news it has allowed me to buy my First house. Bad news, the home needs a lot of work before I can take a trip to the museum. \n\nI did take a look at more pictures on the net and it looks like the part for your Shuttle door is a 3 bend for a total of 120 degrees part, not a single bend for 90 degrees. Since the Shuttle doors open about 120 degrees that makes sense. I hope that helps."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T23:55:02Z","Content":"**What does everyone think of adding a section with cutaways to the sticky?** \n\nSorry for the large image.\n\n-- Image removed because it\u0027s from a book not in the public domain --\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-12T01:57:07Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2015 01:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt.
