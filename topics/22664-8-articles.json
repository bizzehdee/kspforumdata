I appreciated in Crew Manifest plugin how you could bring back a lost Kerbal if you needed to. I don\u0027t want to lose Jeb Bill or Bob, and yet the VAB editor constantly resets the pilot to the first availible. Well, some missions I don\u0027t want to use the main three, and I swap them out for a new recruit. Except, if you go back into the VAB on the exact same craft, it will reset to the first availible, usually Jeb. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E If I manually pick the pilot, don\u0027t reset it, KSP.
