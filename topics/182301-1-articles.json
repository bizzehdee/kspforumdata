I haven\u0027t got anything quite that good, but I\u0027ve got a couple of fun anecdotes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5 college buddies of mine and I decided it would be a good idea to hike Giant, early last May. What we didn\u0027t realize was that any trail in the Dacks in early May is going to be covered in a foot of sheet ice, where it isn\u0027t 2 feet deep in snowpack. And none of us had brought crampons or spikes, and three of the six didn\u0027t have a great deal of experience walking on ice. Somehow, we made it as a group to about 3/4 of a mile from the summit (somewhere around the turnoff from Rocky Peak Ridge), but at that point those aforementioned three decided that the going had gotten too hard, and turned back. The remaining three (myself included) forged on to the summit, but it was slow going. Eventually, several falls and one minor cut later (after one of the guys slipped and fell on some rocks), we made it up to the summit, and then back down to where the other three had retreated. Upon re-union with the rest of the group, we discovered that one of the guys who had turned back had injured his arm (sprained it, or pulled a muscle, or something - we never quite worked out what). So we had to make the remaining 2 1/4 miles of icy, slippery trail with a guy with only one working arm, a poor sense of balance, crappy shoes, and not much experience with ice. I count myself lucky that I made it to the summit without slipping and falling, but even that didn\u0027t stop me from falling down 3 times on the descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomewhat less exciting (from a things-going-wrong perspective) was our trip up the Dial/Nippletop loop. Nothing bad happened, but the weather conditions made several sections of the hike very creepy. It was really cloudy that day, and the summits of Dial and Nippletop (as well as the whole ridgeline between them) poked up into the clouds, which means we got several miles of trail with ~30 feet of visibility through the mist. It genuinely felt like something out of a cheesy horror movie, with the way the ground seemed to drop off and vanish to either side, disappearing into the clouds. Easily one of the most surreal places I\u0027ve ever been.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-20T05:52:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223543770\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182301\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221550641429\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157062\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022IncongruousGoat\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, IncongruousGoat said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre we doing tales from the Dacks now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a good idea, thread has been split, starting this one anew.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
