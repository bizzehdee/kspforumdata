There should not be any scale slider on the station, the docking port, or the SC-A parts -- none of them support scaling.  If you do have scale sliders on any of those parts -- there is something \u0027wrong\u0027 with your installations (other mods?)\n\nHowever, it looks like you are trying to use the wrong size docking ports.  You want the DP-0 (0.625m) docking ports for compatibility with the SC-A.  The DOS modules should all have an adapter option that is compatible with the smaller docking ports.  Select the proper adapter for the station-core mount (it should be labeled 4:1 or 4-1), add the proper docking port (DP-0), and it should all line up perfectly.\n\n(Yes, it is intentional that the Soyuz has the same size docking ports as the Apollo; and it is also intentional that these are a different size than those used on the Orion.... )\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-30T17:11:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2017 05:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"RaiderMan","CreatedById":180001,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-30T17:38:35Z","Content":"oh that explains so much....its RECESSED into the ruddy orbital module on the soyuz...  \n\nI\u0027m stupid.."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-30T21:54:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 15 hours ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Mage, would it be possible to allow modification of say a fuel tank outside the editor if you have N rocketparts on hand? Right now just thinking of being able to change what it contains, I have a giant booster tank on my space station that brought up rocketparts and it would be more useful to me if I could switch it over to LH2. Pathfinder allows freely changing containers and although that certainly makes things easier, I never much liked it from a design standpoint.

Delta V on such a setup would be less than half of an ideal tank of a similar over all volume.  Honestly probably closer to 25% of that ideal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E.    Converting such a tank to fuels would be the last resort of the desperate. \n\nConverting a Fuel tank to a \u0022wet or dry workshop\u0022  is easier because you are REMOVING parts of the tanks.   However the interior of such a setup is VERY spartan.  That is why the US finally decided to rebuild a Saturn IVB tank on the ground for Skylab.  They could make the interior safer, and more useful many expensive rocket launches.    Building a fuel tank with the accouterments for use as part of a space station\u0027s habitable section would greatly reduce efficiency as well but now you are talking 50-75% idea \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E...\n\nThis is why in real space flight none of these convertible systems have ever actually flown and been used for anything more than some basic tests."},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-01T05:50:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues/525](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues/525)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The main problems standing in the way of implementation are.... it was never intended to be used in the field.

I could change color but metallic and glow did not load or somehing. Moving the sliders did nothing. i think it might have something to do with the ERR logs, right? I am using Textures Unlimited with PBR.\n\u003E \n\nThose messages are \u0027normal\u0027 and expected for quite a few models.  As I don\u0027t use the stock shaders for my parts, but HAVE to export them from PartTools with the stock shaders, they end up with missing texture references.  Do not worry -- the proper textures get assigned to those models through plugin-code.\n\nNow... if you actually have parts that are -missing- textures... then you can worry.  You\u0027ll know, as they\u0027ll show up gray/white/mirror metallic in the editor.\n\n(technically, those messages shouldn\u0027t exist... they are an \u0027error\u0027 message, and should indicate something has gone wrong.  However... stock code does not cooperate very well with unassigned materials/meshes, and from an implementation standpoint *the textures names should never be encoded into the binary model file; they should be handled through config-based setup).*\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Agustin said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Moving the sliders did nothing. i think it might have something to do with the ERR logs, right? I am using Textures Unlimited with PBR.\n\u003E \n\nSimply because *not everything has been converted yet*.  I\u0027m a single person, with only finite amounts of time.  I also manage multiple mods, have a full time job, and life outside of modding and KSP.  SSTU has -hundreds- of models and textures and -thousands- of texture-sets that need to be converted.  Its a lot of work.  It would still be a lot of work for a whole team of people.  Not going to happen instantly, or even \u0027quickly\u0027.\n\nIf you have a list of parts/models (need to be very specific on what .mu model / meshes), feel free to file a GitHub issue with the information.  Can\u0027t guarantee when I\u0027ll get to converting any particular part/model, but if it isn\u0027t on the issues list, I can nearly guarantee that it will get forgotten about."},{"CreatedByName":"Agustin","CreatedById":172127,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-01T15:47:43Z","Content":"![UmWXvKF.png](https://i.imgur.com/UmWXvKF.png)\n\nthat intertank has no metallic shaders....

Personalty I do not know, but what\u0027s for sure is that even if they released a PBR on top of it your stuff would still be awesome. Your part modularity is better, we can make everything looks like it came from the same factory. We can\u0027t do that with stock look and philosophy. If they are going that way you have a long long advance, they would have to redo everything.  \n\nI think you should be flattered. And I think you will be even more flattered when they release it."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-02T02:25:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 minutes ago, Sudragon said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E One wonders if they read the forums. you\u0027ve had clustering for how long?\n\u003E \n\nI have my suspicions that their implementation will be specifically for dealing with \u0027pre-built\u0027 engine clusters; e.g. the KR-whatever-X4 (with 4 nozzles) and Twin-Boar (2-nozzles), and will be more intended to deal with \u0027single engine failure in a cluster\u0027 and/or engine-out capabilities.  Just my guesses though; mostly because I highly doubt that stock will start supporting dynamic multi-nozzle engine clustering."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-02T05:01:35Z","Content":"![lockheed-ppe.jpg](http://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lockheed-ppe.jpg)\n\n![iCW57oy.png](https://i.imgur.com/iCW57oy.png)\n\n(faked the robot arm with a couple beams)\n\nThe COS parts are substantially smaller in diameter than Lockheed shows the DSG versions, above. I faked the airlock with a MFT tank. An airlock part that works like the new docking ports (variable backplate, ideally with the node less submerged) would be cool. Either surface mount it (almost no backplate), or extent the backplate such that it\u0027s something like the one shown above."}]}
