In the absence of missions, I often resort to fabricating narratives.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0Rather than pondering about the agency, my thoughts revolve around the individuals within it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat was Jeb\u0027s routine this morning?\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow did Simeen become interested in STEM?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot everyone may share these musings. I believe this stems from the significance once placed on a single Kerbal and their current perceived expendability. The notion of a limitless supply of replacements is unappealing to me. I cherish the idea that each Kerbal is significant.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis perspective has inspired me to craft stories for the members of my rival Space Programs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGlimpse in the Life of Kip Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0Kip\u0027s morning misery knew no bounds, compounded by the ungodly hour and the blaring wail of the alarm through the 4th generation \u201CSomno-Toob,\u201D an outdated relic from Zipko Industries. Toggling the switch for the 50th time only served to heighten his rising frustrations. In a fit of pique, he kicked furiously at the small port where the induction pads were mounted, but his blows were reduced to muted thuds in the viscous water of his sleeping cylinder. Finally, the pneumatic hiss of the pump mechanisms signaled his release, and Kip emerged, dripping and disoriented.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0He barked a throaty cough and scratched places better left to the imagination before he finally removed the crust from around his eyes. He took a half-dried ink pen and scribbled across today\u0027s date. The\u00A0sight of the calendar dredged up bitter feelings: a prominent picture of him above the \u0022KERBAL KOMETS\u0022 banner. A hollow reminder of his glory days and the treacherous nature of friends. Scratching the days of the calendar had the added effect of reminding him of recent incarceration, the relentless ticking of days toward an uncertain future.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 He struggled to bring his thoughts back to the present. He thought he would never truly feel excitement again but only ten more days until he would be back in a cockpit. \u0022Ne-Ferious Enterprises\u0022 seemed unconcerned with his past or his penchant for questionable habits, a fact for which Kip was extremely grateful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 A stray thought sparked an eager smile. Nothing was quite as exciting as flying at Mach 5 or passing the Karman line, however, Slinky\u0027s did offer its own brand of excitement and danger. Yea, he would miss Slinky\u0027s, with its garish neon lighting, and the ecstatic shrieks of middle-aged cougars tossing bills on the stage.\u00A0 His smile faded as thoughts turned from shallow meetings in dark alleys to the only one that ever really mattered and the heartbreak that lingered still.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0Valentina Kerman: his love, his muse, his co-pilot in life.\u00A0 Everything had changed on that fateful day in Joon. He still remembered the acrid smell of smoke, choking him in the cockpit as both engines of his K-11 Skibble flashed and he took a dive into the crowd. Sadness filled him. That K-11 was such a beautiful plane. He and Val had shared their first kiss in that cockpit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0But, like his love and those three Kerbals near the crash site, his K-11 Skribble was burned beyond any recognition.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0Bitterness tried to swallow him as\u00A0he pushed those thoughts aside, his eyes instead narrowed as he steeled himself to focus on the path forward.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0In ten days, he\u0027d be airborne once more.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0For now, he would endure the dregs of his current existence, dreaming of the roar of engines, the rush of air, and the thrill of the skies, where he hoped to reclaim his lost glory. The final countdown had begun, and Kip knew he would succeed. That despite the losses, the indictments, the insurance scandals, AND betrayal by the hands of his best friend, he had ten days to prepare. Prepare for his return to the heavens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-04-30T20:40:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2024 08:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Apr 30\u0022\u003EApril 30\u003C/time\u003E by Fizzlebop Smith\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizzlebop Smith","CreatedById":227275,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-02T20:38:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Brave Firsters\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ELeeboo Kerman was an adventurer, or so she told herself ten thousand times that day. She would repeat it to herself every time the frigid bone numbing cold threatened her grip, she repeated it every time the bitter wind would howl up from the deep chasms below. The damnable wind was a dogged foe, one that did not rest.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe mountain was resolute and domineering but totally indifferent to her plight. It cared not if she reached the summit or failed miserably. The wind, however, was a nasty and bitter enemy determined to pluck her from the cliff and see if she could fly. Though it had never been proven, she was pretty certain she couldn\u2019t. She took each gust she faced as a challenge, a dare to ascend higher. With every shiver and icy step, her resolve hardened like the permafrost beneath her boots.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EMinutes bled into hours before Leeboo spied a suitable spot. A jagged section of stone protruded out beyond a crevice in the rock wall. With a grunt of effort she leveraged her body against the immutable cliff face and up into sheltered recess. There within the barest of sanctuaries, Leeboo took out a bar of Flooyds Crunchy Crunch and let her mind wander.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EShe thought of legends like Kirby Mckerman and the famous Kinity Kermin. These individuals are what Leeboo liked to think of as the \u201CFirsters\u201D. The Illustrious vanguard of the incredibly brave. Pioneers who etched their names into the annals of history with the ink of audacity.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWith the vigor of her idles coursing through her veins, Leeboo clambered out of the crevice and set her eyes toward the summit. The peak loomed as a silent sentinel against the cobalt sky. Its apex was a beacon to her unyielding spirit. Eeach meter she scaled was a testament to he tenacity. This was a dance with danger that only a TRUE kerbal would perform.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EEventually, Leeboo crested the ledge and her vertical ascend was through. All that was left was a short but steep path of uneven ice and loose scree. Shortly upon the path to the tippy top, Leeboo Stumbled. Her foot slipped on some loose rocks and she tumbled into a drift.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAs she stumbled to her feet and began to regain her bearings, she noticed a translucent veil of frost. Something had been uncovered when she disturbed the loose rocks. She gasped and she noticed a weird face beneath the ice, a tentacled face. There were hands, and arms! It looked like the famed Kerakaen of old myth and legend. One of the Sky People documented through cave painting by neolithic Kerbals!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIn that moment her heart beat like a thunderous drum.
