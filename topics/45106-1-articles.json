America went through an imperial \u0022stage\u0022 between the Civil War and WWI. But I also find that video biased. It appears as if it only focuses on the wars caused by imperialism. It barely touches on the massive economic gain our economy made, listing only a few resources we were able to tap. To be honest, I will admit this was a dark period in American history. The video only focuses on America as if America was the worst \u0022empire,\u0022 completely overlooking the suffering being caused by European powers in Africa. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly feel this video may have an underlying political message, but maybe its just me.
