It would be cool to have a surface contact indicator light so you know when you have touched down and can cut the engines, like the Apollo missions had. I think IVAs have great potential to be awesome with all the instruments and lights that could be added in the future!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vespasianus","CreatedById":26881,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T11:10:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould be good to be able to see the radar altimeter outside IVA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T11:13:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried a few Mun landings with the radar altimeter, and it works like a charm (the only thing I find odd is its scale, as it will suddenly decrease once it goes below 1k and 500m).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
