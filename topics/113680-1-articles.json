Mod creation in Kerbal Space Program (heck, in video games) is new to me, so development of this mod might take some time; I promise you though, if and when I do actually complete the mod, it would have been worth the wait, as I have an oft-problematic attention to detail that borders on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Eventually, I will (hopefully) be posting Work-in-Progress images here, as your feedback certainly means a whole lot to me. I may even have questions regarding balancing issues and other game-related stuff that the more experienced players could answer for me. Anyway, now onto my goals for this mod.\n\nGoals:\n\n1. Create Probe cores that reflect those that humanity uses.\n\n2. Create Lander legs that also reflect their real-life counterparts (such as those that Philae uses... I love the design of those Landing legs)\n\n3. Antennae and Dishes that resemble those found on some of our most famous spacecraft.\n\n4. New realistic Solar Panels, such those on the ESA\u0027s ATVs.\n\n5. Probe cores that contain a fair amount of resources (eg: Cores that contain the propellant, eliminating the need to attach a fuel tank onto your spacecraft)\n\n6. Any other features that I can\u0027t think of at the moment.\n\n7. Any features that the community would like to see. Heck, I would hope to enlist the assistance of more talented and experienced modders out there, seeing as how I am completely ignorant when it comes to KSP mod creation)\n\nMy Ideas So Far:\n\n1. The antennae from the Iridium satellites (both the larger antenna and those smaller ones on the front end of the satellite (the four smaller dishes - [http://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IridiumSat_CliffFlickr.jpg](http://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IridiumSat_CliffFlickr.jpg))\n\n2. The landing legs on the Philae spacecraft (not the best image, but here you go - [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/thumbnail/philae.gif](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/thumbnail/philae.gif))\n\n*So, there you go! Wish me luck, as I am treading within uncharted territory.*"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T13:53:36Z","Content":"Awesome!\n\nMaybe you should consider on making Solar Panels that look like the ones on the CoRoT spacecraft?\n\n![coro_silo_1.jpg](http://www.russianspaceweb.com/images/spacecraft/science/corot/coro_silo_1.jpg)\n\nAlso, maybe you should make some static stock-a-like triangular Solar Panels."},{"CreatedByName":"fallout2077","CreatedById":131638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T15:21:20Z","Content":"I can\u0027t say I have even seen triangular solar panels, Astrofox...

This way, nobody has to wait for the whole mod to be completed, and you can start playing around with the part(s) as soon as their complete.
