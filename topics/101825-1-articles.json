You will see a file called \u0022System\u0022. Don\u0027t touch that. \n\n\\* Copy the \u0022System\u0022 file, paste it there and rename the copy to what you want.\n\n\\* Open the copied file with a text editor (like Notepad) and delete everything. \n\nNow the \\*fun\\* part begins. Start writing the code. Start with this:\n\n @Kopernicus\n\n {\n\n Body\n\n {\n\n name = Sarvin\n\n flightGlobalsIndex = 700\n\n//The flightGlobalsIndex is just a number that acts like an ID for your planet.

Anytime you open one you must close it.\\*\\*\n\nOk guys, that was the planet creation itself. But, if you want to land on that moon the custom texture will disappear and a copy of a stock planet template you used will replace it.
