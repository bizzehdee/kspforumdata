A simple Duna landing requires almost as much delta-v as getting to Duna\u0027s orbit from LKO and returning back to Kerbin, so you really don\u0027t want to carry any extra stuff to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer stage is essentially a big fuel tank with 2-4 nuclear engines. Add the usual stuff (SAS, RCS, batteries, solar panels / RTGs, docking ports, and a probe core), and you get an unmanned ship that can go pretty much anywhere and function as a refueling base once it gets there. If one big fuel tank isn\u0027t enough, you can always send another transfer stage without payload. If you attach the engines in the same way as in your current ship, the fuel in the small tanks should be enough to return an empty refueling base to LKO for refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Duna lander should need about 1500/2000 m/s delta-v (atmosphere / vacuum), assuming that you use parachutes to kill the speed for landing. Building the lander around the Mk1-2 Command Pod is a good idea, because then you usually don\u0027t need separate SAS modules, batteries, and RCS fuel tanks. Personally I prefer to use a large docking port at the bottom of the lander to connect it to the top of the transfer stage, because it provides a rigid enough connection for the heavy three-kerbal lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTO crew shuttles can be quite simple. The one I use was originally intended as a Laythe lander, but it found better use, when it easily reached the orbit during flight tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/stuff/laythe_lander.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022laythe_lander.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T19:16:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShameless self-promotion: the first craft in my\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48610-My-roundtrip-ships-for-download\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E reuseable interplanetary ship thread\u003C/a\u003E has made multiple trips to Duna, Eve, and Dres, while hauling 70\u002B ton payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOops.

Their thrust is only 10 kN less but they\u0027re 1.75 tons lighter each. Also, if you\u0027re going to Duna, is it for career for the science? If so you might want to work a lab in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did an extended mission to Minmus for my second trip as a proof of concept for Munar operations and later Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main ship is my Mobile Orbiting Support Station. When fully fueled it has the same capacity as a single orange tank. To bring it up from the surface I had to have it only half fueled due to its mass. It uses a Poodle since they\u0027re fairly light and have good vacume isp. It has just under 4000 m/s dV when fueled and carries 400 units of monoprop in radial tanks. Docked to the MOSS is a lander with 2 science Jr\u0027s and 2 goo canisters. Also docked is a data courier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission profile is to have the MOSS arrive first and establish orbit. Two of the crew move from the capsule to the lab module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander then follows on it\u0027s own transfer vehicle. Once the lander reaches orbit it docks with the MOSS. Any fuel remaining in it\u0027s transfer stage is moved to the MOSS. The lander then undocks and after moving away from the station detaches from it\u0027s transfer stage. The lander then deorbits and lands on the surface to take material studys, goo observations, crew reports, eva reports, and surface samples. The lander than does a suborbital hop to a new site and repeats the process. Anything with a 100% transmit value is sent. All other data is kept for delivery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander then returns to orbit and docks with the MOSS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbal in the command pod goes EVA and recovers the data from both goo containers and both science Jr\u0027s. He also gets the data from the lander capsule then returns to the MOSS command pod. Taking the data packs from the instruments disables them, but the crew in the lab can repair them for the next mission. The lander refills it\u0027s fuel and RCS tanks from the MOSS and undocks for another trip to the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce enough science data is gathered a courier is dispatched from kerbin. The ship is small. parachute, Mk1 pod, RCS tank and thrusters, probe size landing gear and a sheilded docking port. I use a mod called Tweak Everything that allows me to start with the sheild open to put it on a transfer stage. It\u0027s about 1.8 tons so a fairly small rocket will get it off the ground and on it\u0027s way to Minmus. While it\u0027s only propulsion is RCS it\u0027s got just under 700 m/s worth of it so you can enter minmus orbit and dock with lots left. It\u0027s actually a bit too responsive when docking and I\u0027d prefer for it to be a bit weaker. For a Duna mission you\u0027d need a larger transfer stage that would be refueled at duna and used to get back to kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the courier docks, he EVA\u0027s and takes the collected data from the command pod of the MOSS. He reboards his ship, undocks and returns to kerbin using the atmosphere to brake. The parachute insures a soft landing and the legs keep you looking professional. You can even direct your landing site on the way down with any remaining RCS fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the tracking station recovers the ship you get return bonuses on all that science data while the crew back at minmus is free to continue collecting more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my Duna mission I\u0027m thinking of a similar system but the first stage would be putting a kethane operation on Ike for orbital refueling. I can get a tanker to minmus with a reasonable payload of fuel, but I think Duna would be much tougher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, perhaps you can use some of the ideas here for your Duna mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/3298062012329246822/DDDAD79AA7A791F91BDA6CD9D4CAEDCF157E4EBD/\u0022 alt=\u0022DDDAD79AA7A791F91BDA6CD9D4CAEDCF157E4EBD\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T19:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHell with it - I\u0027m bored.

Two of them put together would be 82.76 tonnes. Does that sound about right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few redundancies are obvious in the design - you don\u0027t need both batteries and RTGs (unless you intend to transmit data). I\u0027d also submit that it would take a very long time for you to go through the amount of fuel contained in two large RCS tanks, but you do what you want to there. The nose cones are also not really necessary - you could do something more useful there such as swap it out for something functional such as a senior docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall though that\u0027s not that much in terms of mass - if you send two fragments to Duna seperately, you can rendezvous them in orbit. Your transfer stage only needs enough delta-V for a one way trip (~1100 m/s). Say 1400 for a nice margin of error. Four nuclear engines mounted off the bottom of FL-T100 tanks, mounted radially to the side of an X200-16 tank and connected with struts and fuel lines, will give you 1379.66 m/s of delta-V, enough to make the trip comfortably with a little to spare. Go with FL-T200s on the sides if you\u0027d like a little extra for the rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal Mass would be 62 tonnes.

The only questionable bit is whether it has sufficient TWR to lift off of Duna.
