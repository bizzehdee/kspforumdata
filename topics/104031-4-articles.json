However, those methods are even easier to develop countermeasures for. Bombers? Surface-to-Air Missiles. Missiles? Harder to take out than a bomber, but technically still possible, depending on how much time you have before it hits and the type of missile. Rods from God? Nothing short of destroying the deployment satellite before it deploys (or while it\u0027s deploying), if there even is one (the rods could be satellites all to themselves, deployed in a constellation, not to mention the possibility of countering anti-satellite weapons). Destroying a satellite has varying levels of difficulty as well. There are probably some situations where rods from god would be useful in the real world. But they are still very, very, expensive.\n\u003E \n\nModern warfare tends to be profoundly asymmetrical. The people being bombed tend to have no countermeasures to bombers.

It would not be like the movies.\n\nWith regard to orbital bombardment in general, the math is simple.  Let\u0027s run the numbers for a telephone-pole sized piece of steel impacting at 10km/s."},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T10:17:02Z","Content":"Steel has a density of 8t per cubic meter.  A .5r by 10m h telephone pole is roughly 8 cubic meters of steel or 64 tons.  This is about as heavy as any feasible impact device would be with current or foreseeable technology.  Heavier impact devices are possible but require much more complex systems.\n\nanyway 64000kg at 10000m/s will yield 3.2 e10^12 joules.  Each ton of TNT has 4.2 e10^9 joules of energy.  So you are looking at something in the kilotons of yield.  Airbursting a steel telephone pole is doable, but difficult, so this would be an effective bunker buster to remove another nations nuclear stockpile or ICBM silos, but not for airbursting over troops or cities.\n\nIf one wanted to wipe out Three Gorges Dam or Cheyenne Mountain, this may be a better way to go than a high yield, nuclear ground burst.  In reality, smaller flechettes are more useful.  These things due to mass and perhaps a light-reflecting coating would be impervious to current and foreseeable ABM tech.\n\n\u0022But Goat, iron meteorites fall to earth all the time without leveling cities!  Surely these iron telephone poles can\u0027t be that destructive!\u0022\n\nIron meteors entering our atmosphere rapidly find themselves melting at their leading edge stagnation points, tumbling and eventually disintegrating.  An iron-tungsten or DU impact or that had a ceramic leading edge or an an ablative coating would retain its mass.  \n\nThe weak point for this system would be time of flight.  While the projectiles aren\u0027t susceptible to ABM, the platform would be highly susceptible to ASAT/ABM.  So higher orbits would provide more energy and time to react, but long time of flight (hours or days) one you rifle your orbital weapon.  In that time, targets and inventories can be moved.  Energy dissipating paint is visible and iron is radar reflective, so there would be a fair bit of warning from an impending strike.  \n\nPerhaps these factors make the weapon system more useful for retaliation than deterrence?\n\nAnyway, in the movies these types of this strike out of the blue.  Moscow, Beijing, Washington or Brussels would have time to evacuate targets and coordinate retaliation before these things land.\n\nAgain, this is the reason why smaller flechettes have more tactical and strategic applications.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-03T13:34:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2016 01:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jonfliesgoats**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T13:39:46Z","Content":"Another thought on airbursting a steel projectile falling from high orbit:  Iron meteors do this all the time due to ridiculous thermal gradient within the projectile.

In later wars it would be less relevant. WW2 mass bombardment is also very rare after the Vietnam war.   \n\nOrbital flechettes has some weaknesses, if they are fleche sized they would burn up / slow down too much to be practical.   \n\nflechettes is mostly released from an artillery shell or rocket some distance ahead of target I guess 100-300 meter.   \n\nGoing supersonic would make release harder too.   \n\nNow if you go larger, you have an good perpetrator but you need an good guidance system.   \n\nPlasma effects would make it hard to adjust trajectory during reentry.   \n\nClosest to this today is the Chinese ballistic anti ship missile.

We keep trying and failing to win through bombing campaigns because doing so is politically expedient.  We can sell a cheap war to our people where only a handful of people are at risk of bleeding.  The reality is that winning any fight is damned bloody business.  \n\nI believe in aerospace and have committed my professional life to aerospace in one form or another for decades.  Victory is impossible without air dominance.  However, air dominance in and of itself doesn\u0027t win wars.  As long as we pretend we can fight on the cheap and clean by relying on gizmos, we will keep losing to illiterate rice farmers and goatherds.\n\nI sincerely hope I am wrong about my deductions.  If strategic bombing works/ed, it means a lot of lives and a lot of my time hasn\u0027t been wasted.  Can you think of examples of successful strategic bombing?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-03T18:31:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2016 06:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jonfliesgoats**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T18:30:01Z","Content":"On a separate note, 84kg of reentry mass equals one ton of TNT.

A JDAM bomb has a Circular Error Probably of 30 m with inertial guidance, meaning a 50:50 chance of landing closer or further to the target. And that\u0027s with a mere couple of minutes free fall time, a longer flight time worsens the error.\n\nRegarding cost, I wonder if a kinetic bombardment platform would necessarily be \\*that\\* expensive really. High estimates for the cost of the SLS rocket are $35 billion, let\u0027s attribute that full cost to launching the Doomsat and wild-guess developing the satellite itself costs the same kind of money. So $70 billion total or thereabouts. That\u0027s a lot by the standards of normal people, it\u0027s even a lot by the standards of NASA spaceflight or to the world\u0027s wealthiest people. But the US military spends $600 billion \\*a year\\*, and expects to spend $1500 billion on the F-35 fighter over its lifetime (OK, to 2070, but still). By military spending standards, kinetic bombardment doesn\u0027t look so expensive after all, especially if you can make a program out of it with multiple sats each capable of multiple strikes."},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T18:34:44Z","Content":"Launch would be expensive, but your kinetic platform never has to land, refuel change crews, etc..

If every 500b GP bomb dropped by a B-17 or B-24 had landed within a few meters of specifically designated targets (not just \u0022factory X,\u0022 but each bomb aimed at specific elements, uniquely), then such bombing would have likely been very effective indeed.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  The sort of area bombing utilized vs Japan (and to a lesser extent, Germany by Bomber Command) is another story, and more applicable to some forms of orbital bombardment. Not \u0022extinction level\u0022 bombardment, but perhaps *local* extinction level bombardment. Ie: hitting someone with something akin to a small asteroid. The largest possible effect that contains the bulk of effects within countries that are not a problem. Ie, you hit country A, and perhaps B and C have some minor effects since they are nearby, but country D that is a major power is totally unaffected.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Example targets would basically be places that you wish to no longer exist. At all. The sort of thing you could do with a nuke, but that has all the baggage of a nuke. Same sort of counter-value targeting, however. This is entirely legitimate for certain targets, IMO (IS leaps to mind).\n\u003E \n\nYes, with precision guided weapons its easy to destroy key target unless deep underground or hidden.   \n\nThis also applies tactical, hit command centers, artillery and supplies then all the way down to machine-gun positions and the rest become much easier.   \n\nHowever tactical its easier and cheaper to use planes or artillery.   \n\nFor the US area effect has become an special case regarding bombardment, common as you need to hit trenches, supply dumps, vehicle parks even enemies in the open but default is more and more becoming point attack. Others will follow here.   \n\nThe large scale city bombings was more like nuclear strikes, fortunately rare today. Cities will still be wrecked if you fight over them but this is more tactical as you fight over every house with heavy weapons.   \n\nNot something you would use orbital bombardment for.   \n\nSee two uses, main is deep buried target, here an telephone pole long rod perpetrator will goo far down. Second is rapid strikes on target of opportunity"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T18:54:46Z","Content":"How fast can you deorbit something accurately?

If you can bypass early warning radar, resolution on IR systems is poor.  You could deorbit a number of leg-sized penetrators to collapse cave complexes, submarine oens and revetments in one foul swoop one could stop, say, an invasion across the strait of Formosa before millions of people die.\n\nStealthy orbital strikes could actually save few, perhaps?\n\nINS accuracy: deoends on some other things too.
