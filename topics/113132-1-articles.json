I\u0027ve gotten the rocket into orbit a few times, but only when I\u0027m lucky enough to have the rocket tilt roughly east in the beginning.

The issue here is that those SRBs don\u0027t have thrust vectoring, and your winglets don\u0027t have control surfaces. The net result is that you have very little control over the direction of travel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to use more liquid fuel and not so much in the way of SRBs. The Swivel engine is a good engine to use in the early game, and combined with a pair of the SRBs, can give you good control and TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
