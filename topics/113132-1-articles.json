I\u0027m playing in sandbox mode and I\u0027ve made the following rocket:\n\n[screenshot 31]\n\nThis is my launch procedure: press t to turn on SAS, press space.\n\nAfter about one second of doing nothing, the rocket tilts a few degrees.\n\n[screenshot 32]\n\nAfter about six seconds, the rocket seems to tilt way more, probably because gravity is pulling more on one part more than another. It\u0027s like an unintentional gravity turn.\n\n[screenshot 33]\n\nI tried again without the stability enhancers and got this (basically the same thing, different direction):\n\n[screenshot 34]\n\n[screenshot 35]\n\nEvery time I relaunch it seems to tilt randomly in a different direction. I\u0027ve gotten the rocket into orbit a few times, but only when I\u0027m lucky enough to have the rocket tilt roughly east in the beginning. Is it because the rocket simply has too much mass to be stable?\n\nCraft file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxMn8--P71I-Q3RIME9nc0VEU2s/edit?pli=1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxMn8--P71I-Q3RIME9nc0VEU2s/edit?pli=1)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T20:16:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pillook**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T20:00:38Z","Content":"Activate the \u0022Center of mass\u0022 indicator and the \u0022Center of lift\u0022 indicator in the rocket lab.

Your suggestion, Cairol, works, but it is just short of enough fuel to get into orbit (at least for me).

The issue here is that those SRBs don\u0027t have thrust vectoring, and your winglets don\u0027t have control surfaces. The net result is that you have very little control over the direction of travel. \n\nMy suggestion is to use more liquid fuel and not so much in the way of SRBs. The Swivel engine is a good engine to use in the early game, and combined with a pair of the SRBs, can give you good control and TWR."}]}
