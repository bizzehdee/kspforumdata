Decouplers don\u0027t transfer fuel, so put the fueltank between the decoupler and the engines. Than, move all 3 those engines into the same stage tougether, so they all fire at the same time.

So once the first engines run out of fuel, hit spacebar will fire the decoupler and drop the engines away. Hit spacebar again activates the next engine. Once that is empty, you ran out of fuel and will start to fall back eventually. Hit space bar will fire the decoupler, and now the commandpod will fall alone. Hit spacebar again will open the parachute. Do this at about 5km above the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of extra remarks: You can put the stabalizers at the bottom of the rocket rather than at the top. Not big a deal now, but it\u0027s alot safer if you build bigger rockets. No need to worry about parts that stick out hitting them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis rocket does not need the stabalizer part under the commandpod. The pod itself has more than enough torque to keep the rocket under control. Adding that much more will make the controls very sensetive. There is such a thing as to much torque\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goldham","CreatedById":73478,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T00:43:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMove those Winglets down too, they cause instability when above the CoM which can be shown by pressing the leftmost button right below the Symmetry button\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oddible","CreatedById":74605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T01:25:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember the whole point of staging is dumping some of the weight that you no longer need, after dumping a stage you still need to have a functional engine and fuel to continue your journey. You can think of horizontal or vertical staging. Your current ship has vertical staging, you\u0027re dumping the bottom section. However, in your ship you are merely dumping the engines! You\u0027ll no longer have engines after you stage! Try something simple first (actually I think I\u0027ve never in my life used that three way adapter thing). Just put a command pod at the top, a fuel tank, and an engine. Then put a decoupler, then another fuel tank and another engine. Make sure the staging is correct on the right side (the bottom most stuff need to be at the bottom of the list) - and put everything in its own stage. Launch and hit your space bar to trigger dumping the stages when they fuel tank at the bottom is out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T01:32:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA somewhat simple three stage design that can be sent to orbit Mun and return.
