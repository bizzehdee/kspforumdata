You can clip for sure, but thrusts aren\u0027t pushing out past secondary parts that may block the thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eclip any engine to the top of a fuel tank, and thrust works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadd any part to the bottom of the fuel tank (such as an intake, or second tank, or even another engine), and thrust is cut off entirely. no push (well there is some but its like less than 1%), though the engine is running. as if the thrust is now blocked by the second added part. i know, the change is more realistic, but for clipped designs it renders aesthetics clipping for VTOLs and SSTOs impractical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is deadly to many pre .23 SSTO designs, and kills all stacked VTOL designs. anyone found a work around yet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplease do NOT turn this into a clip vs no clip thread. this thread is for clippers to confirm this issue and discover a work around.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-18T09:07:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2013 09:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by inigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T09:05:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is great news \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E and now Rapier doesn\u0027t seem to be too OP? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T11:16:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027m wondering how you did your engine clipping - my usual engine clipping still works for the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can\u0027t have any part blocking the exhaust of your engines (the emmision point can be \u0027inside\u0027 another part, that still works. but if you have any part \u0027below\u0027 the emmission point, it will effectively block the thrust. and there\u0027s nothing new with that - it behaves like that since quite a long time...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mesklin","CreatedById":73898,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T11:34:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith my crafts with engine clipping still work too, no any problem\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T12:06:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sgt_flyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sgt_flyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei\u0027m wondering how you did your engine clipping - my usual engine clipping still works for the moment.\u003Cp\u003Eyou can\u0027t have any part blocking the exhaust of your engines (the emmision point can be \u0027inside\u0027 another part, that still works. but if you have any part \u0027below\u0027 the emmission point, it will effectively block the thrust. and there\u0027s nothing new with that - it behaves like that since quite a long time...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust one thought I had once I saw you, a builder whom I know knows his stuff, confirmed my hope that the title was a confusion with the inner workings of engine clipping and it\u0027s all business as usual:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPhew!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I don\u0027t even know how many things I have flying around in my save with clipped engines.
