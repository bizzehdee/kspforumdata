My original intent with this one was a general purpose parts tester - something that could fit an object the size of a Mainsail engine in the cargo bay - but I decided I should go ahead and try to design it to where it could be used as a large cargo orbital transporter in a pinch. FAR gave me red lights for beta and r on the runway at Mach 0.35 and at 10k/Mach 1, but in both cases the simulations showed decreasing oscillations; it greenlit the plane at 15k/Mach2, 20k/Mach3 and - for the first time - 30k/Mach4. Sounded like I had a winner on my hands - so I launched the thing. Discovered after it rolled over and crashed that the SPH had kicked me over to radial symmetry on the main wing (I think it had to do with how I\u0027d set up the outboard engines) and it wouldn\u0027t let me reattach the stupid wings in mirror symmetry. To say I was annoyed at this turn of events is an understatement, one I\u0027m only using due to the rules of the KSP forums regarding the use of profanity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways - can I walk y\u0027all through the design process I used for this craft? I\u0027m still looking for help on this score - what I\u0027m doing is largely based on the advice I\u0027ve received on this thread up to this point. This will be math heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay - so as always, I start with my payload. I want to haul a Mainsail engine to orbit - so I\u0027ve got six tonnes of payload. 25% design payload fraction means I want to build a plane that has a mass of around 24 tonnes. I\u0027ll need a Mk3 Cargo Bay to contain the Mainsail due to its size, but I should be able to use the shorter bay. I want a 0.75 TWR on the Runway (per eddiew), and I know RAPIER engines output 80 kN of thrust each on the Runway (from observation), so I know that each RAPIER will conservatively support about 10.75 tonnes of airplane: TWR = T /(mg), (mTWR) = T / g, m = T / (gTWR) = 80 / (9.8 *0.75) = 10.88 (which is not a nice figure to work with, hence I round it down). Since I want a 24 tonne aircraft, I\u0027ll need three RAPIER engines. And since I\u0027ve got three RAPIERs, I know my plane oughta be able to support up to 32.25 tonnes (10.75*3 = 32.25), so I\u0027ll actually design it for \u003Cstrong\u003Ethat\u003C/strong\u003E mass instead. Knowing that, I can calculate my fuel needs: 40 units per tonne of both oxidizer and liquid fuel, assuming a kickover to rocket mode above 30k going about 1400 m/s. That comes out to 1,290 units of both LF and LOX. If I want to use the plane for its original intended purpose, I\u0027ll just drain the LOX before loading up the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I begin building my fuselage, starting with a large RGU followed aft with a Z-4k battery. To the nose I add a Protective Nose Cone. I then add a 2.5m-Mk3 adapter, put in the Mk3 Cargo Bay, put another 2.5-Mk3 adapter (going back down to 2.5), then a short 2.5-1 meter adapter. I decide to put a single RAPIER in the centerline tail and put the other two outboard, each with a Radial Engine Body. To the front of the outboard units I attach a short 1m-Mark 2 adapter, and on each of those I added a Mk2 Bicoupler, with a pair of Shock Cone Intakes on the ends of those. I\u0027ve got more fuel in the craft at that point than I need, so I decide to drain the 2.5-1 meter adapter as well as the outboard components, and balance the remaining fuel between the two 2.5-Mk3 adapters, running fuel lines inside the cargo bay between the two tanks. I also run fuel lines from the aft tank to the outboard units. Checking the mass distribution, I see that I\u0027m a little heavy aft, so I add a large RCS tank for ballast immediately aft of the battery. RCS Build aid tells me that my CoM will remain reasonably stable, so I run with this setup. I set up tricycle gears - one gear up by the nose, two on the outboard units. I\u0027m using my customized Large Gear Bays for this since I\u0027ve got a big plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I begin calculating what I need as far as wing surfaces are concerned - for these, I\u0027m using those formulas I came across the other day. First, my final fuselage dimensions are 21.8 meters in length, 6.3 meters in width and 3.8 meters in draught. Fuselage should be 70-75% of the total wingspan; I go with 70%, so I know I want the wingspan to be 31.14 m (21.8/0.7 = 31.14). Chop that in half for a single wing - 15.57 meters - and then subtract half the fuselage length from that: 12.42 meters is the desired span of the wing. As far as the wing chords goes, I want it to be 1/6 the total wingspan, so 31.14/6 = 5.19 meters. I should have a total wing area of 5.19 * 12.42 * 2 = 128.92 square meters. I\u0027ll generally shoot for a 45 degree sweep of the wings if I can manage it. Horizontal stabilizers are 25% of the total wing area - 32.23 square meters, and the vertical stabilizer should be 10% of the total wing area - 12.89 square meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming I want the fin to have a 4:1 aspect ratio - so 4x * x = 12.89, 4x^2 = 12.89, x^2 = 12.89/4, x = sqrt(12.89/4) = 1.795 meters, the chord of the tail. The span will therefore be 7.18 meters. Again I\u0027ll shoot for 45 degrees sweep. For the horizontal surfaces, I\u0027ll have two canards at 2:1 and two stabilators at 4:1, so that\u0027s 2x^2 \u002B 2x^2 \u002B 4x^2 \u002B 4x^2 = 32.23, 12x^2 = 32.23, x^2 = 32.23/12, x = sqrt(32.23/12) = 1.64 meters. So my canards will have a span of 3.28 meters each and the stabilators will have spans of 6.56 meters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the dimensions calculated, I whip out Procedural Wings (going to install B9 Procedural Wings today to see if I get better results) and build the various surfaces to the tolerances I\u0027ve calculated, and then start attaching them. Fin first, then canards, then stabilators, wings last. After that I adjust their positions so that the CoL is not too far aft. Each wing surface is set to .7 strength and 100% of the axis to which it\u0027s designed to control. When I think I\u0027ve got a plane that might fly, I head to FAR and check its stability with the usual benchmarks: 0k/Mach0.35, 5k/Mach0.85, 10k/Mach 1, 15k/Mach 2, 20k/Mach 3, 30k /Mach 4. If I get a red number, I check the simulation for the subscript indicated with an initial value of 5 and see what the graphs do - I know I\u0027ll have problems if the graphs diverge or it shows an increasing oscillation, and that the problem is tolerable if it shows a steady or decreasing oscillation. After all that, I hit the Intake Build Aid magic button, make sure the front gear is set up properly, and go test it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright - flaws in this process: I want to hear about it if there\u0027s something I\u0027m doing wrong (besides, perhaps, any accusations of over-analyzing things).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T15:34:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need pictures to get a proper idea of what you\u0027re doing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not as simple as a handful of formulas; the best wing dimensions vary based upon TWR, planform, wing strength, flight profile and mission.

With this one, I went back to the RC glider ratios and I added a Large ASAS Module. FAR also green-lit this one at the crucial 30k/Mach 4 mark - in fact, it only gave a single red-light for the standard benchmarks for the entire flight profile, and that was to the M\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B4e\u003C/sub\u003E parameter at 0k/Mach 0.35 (one I don\u0027t know how to test in the simulators).

I obviously screwed something up there - the plane\u0027s dynamic pressure exceeded 40 kPa; FAR gave me the Q warning and seconds later I was treated to the sight of the wings and canards ripping themselves off like something out of a 1920s Bugs Bunny cartoon. How do I avoid that? I\u0027m assuming what happened was that I was going too fast as the atmosphere thickened up; I\u0027ve heard that the shuttle performed \u0022S-turns\u0022 to bleed off speed during the approach and I\u0027m assuming that I should\u0027ve been doing the same (rather than just letting the increase in density slow me down; rather a stock aero approach come to think of it) - how do you execute that maneuver properly?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T14:32:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have enough control authority, deorbiting is just a case of gliding down to land without drama; the problems come when you don\u0027t have enough horizontal control surface area and your CoM is shifted way off CoL, then you\u0027ll just lawndart. I deorbit about 1/3d an orbit before the runway, using the Trajectories mod modified for FAR I\u0027ll put the target on the runway which gives an orbit track for the default orbit view over the runway of about 15km I think. Sink rate will get up to about 150m/s or so but if I hold the craft pitched up a couple of degrees, or just 0 pitch then usually it\u0027ll reduce to something useful of say 30m/s well before dangerous levels of dynamic pressure build up, provided my CoM is roughly around CoL.

Good question there - how much payload do you think this plane would be able to handle given its end conditions? 34 tonnes / 0.96 TWR at takeoff. The numbers would say 11 tonnes for a 25% payload fraction; my TWR at takeoff in that scenario would be 0.73, which would be low but acceptable - my principal concern then would be whether or not I\u0027d have sufficient fuel to make orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one exhibited the same behavior as the other plane I was flying over the weekend - once it was in space, I couldn\u0027t get it to fly straight. I verified the CoT and CoM were aligned in the SPH...so I\u0027m wondering why it\u0027s doing that. I imagine the only reason why I got it into orbit was the fact that I had set the Ap a bit higher than 75k this time and had time to make corrections. An ugly orbit but an orbit nonetheless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...landing. Yesterday I began with my usual starting point halfway across the planet and Trajectories helped me put the red cross right over my KSC ground markers. The deorbit went relatively okay up to about 20,000. That was when I was watching my Q, my rate of descent and the data from NavUtilities - I was attempting to keep my rate of descent around 150 m/s and had to pull up my nose. At 10k, still going Mach 2, I pulled up a little hard and went into a spin. Recovered from the spin at Mach 0.5 and 4000 meters, so that part worked out - but that\u0027s definitely not the way I want to lose speed and reduce Q, I imagine. I should mentioned I was crabbed out (if that\u0027s the proper term) at the time - spoilers deployed, flaps fully extended. Probably should\u0027ve retracted the spoilers when I entered the spin...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I got into the pattern, relatively lined up on the Runway, slowed my rate of descent to 5 m/s, then fouled the approach and crashed. I think it was because I wasn\u0027t level at touchdown; that sort of thing used to screw me up with stock aero on occasion. It\u0027s been a few weeks since I\u0027ve done a landing of any kind - and my first attempt at one in FAR. I did quick-save the game so I can try again; any pointers on things I should do differently this time (like, not put myself in a spin to lose speed)?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T13:42:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 01:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
