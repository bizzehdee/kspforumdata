I\u0027ve noticed that some parts, like the ladders or airplane landing gear, are fully extended when in the VAB or SPH. Although this is true, the landing struts (e.g. LT-2 or LT-1 landing strut) are not fully extended. Perhaps they could change this, as it would be helpful in knowing if your gear is long enough to touch the ground before you realize it isn\u0027t. Thoughts on this are appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T22:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight be a good idea, but I always test them in practice on the launchpad. Even better than eyeballing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso gives you a stresstest. Suspend the lader a few meters above the ground with a launch stabalizer. Extend the legs, and drop the lander on the pad. It survived? Raise the lander higher, and try again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mdosogne","CreatedById":68302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T02:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love the option of toggling the initial state in the VAB; this could serve two purposes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- check the length of the gear without a test launch, which might be important when Kerbits (or whatever kurrency) is introduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I have some SSTO VTOL designs which require Launch stability enhancer to hold them in place before I can lower the gear, to avoid damaging the engines. Again, in career mode it would be nice to toggle the initial landing gear state and avoid the extra cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ernest3.14","CreatedById":75412,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T03:06:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETweakables!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lexar","CreatedById":88540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T07:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs long as i can clip parts into them i am ok with that.
