Was this discovered before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe steps :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Line up Kerbin and the destination planet at the correct phase angle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For inner transfer, launch closest to midnight possible, for outer transfer launch closest to noon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Line up the moon so your launch site is leading it by 10-20 degrees (faster speeds needs slightly less degrees, but too much speeds might make you overshoot orbits like duna\u0027s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do one burn all the way to the moon, aim for center mass until it starts flipping out your inclination but do not flip it, just stay at the very edge (At this point the orbit predictions will lie to you, do not believe it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When properly lined speed up to x100k time and the ship should pass right trough the mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Reach sun orbit with relative boost to speed, wait till periapsis and correct for planet\u0027s SoI interception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty easy to do, not much turning involved.
