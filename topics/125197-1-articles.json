In 1.0.5 the radiator is trying to dissipate the heat generated by the fairing friction with the atmo , but it can\u0027t do it because it is enclosed, so it heats up.

Maybe the best solution is simply to put more parts in between the fairing base and the radiator? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-12T16:42:17Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2015 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r_rolo1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Death Engineering","CreatedById":68528,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T17:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t even know if a radiator was needed, TBH.
