It\u0027s been a great help to me over the last few days that I\u0027ve had KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy name is Chris. I lived in Florida in the 70s/80s, was at K(ennedy)SC on a school trip for Columbia\u0027s first launch, and have been obsessed with space ever since she re-arranged my organs from ten miles away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn particular I\u0027d like to say thanks to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1) Scott Manley for the basic tutorials, (on YouTube) which took me over the initial ignorance bump.

I do enjoy the manual stuff, but I really appreciate the automation of the yawn bits. It\u0027s also been a great teaching aid though; there\u0027s nothing better than learning by example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a few questions about on-orbit construction, but will put them in the appropriate sub-forums. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, I wish you all the best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T02:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh yes, Scott Manley.
