I just had a horrible experience and now I\u0027m curious about something. The last few days I\u0027ve been exploring the moons of Jool, and everything was going fine... until I got to Tylo. I suppose it was my own fault for not doing my homework, but once I tried to land my little explorer ship the nightmare began. It quickly became apparent I was not going to be able to slow down fast enough, and I almost burned up my engines getting re-circularized and out of there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I was back in orbit I checked the numbers, and even though it\u0027s a moon, Tylo is third biggest body in the solar system, with a 0.8 gravity and escape velocity of 3068 m/s. And I\u0027m beginning to think the it\u0027s hardest place to land on, even worse than Eve. Eve may have an even greater gravity, but it also has a nice thick atmosphere to add some drag and slow a ship down. The only real issue landing on Eve is not overheating. Tylo has nothing to add drag, it\u0027s just you vs. Gravity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m curious everyone else\u0027s opinion...

If I could build it in real life I would be comfortable flying in it. Ignore the science vessel and everything attached above that. The main lander starts at the lander can on the left. It was a ship I put five poodle engines on each controlled by their own reaction wheel. It had 8 landing legs attached. I built and tested this thing to the death, even going as far to figure out the real math behind how I could build an efficient lander. Starting from a 30km orbit in the planet, you could land and return anywhere on Tylo with ease with this lander... (yes, one of the tricks to conquering Tylo is to get extremely close to the planet so you can conserve precious fuel for the landing sequence and knock off some velocity). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would burn fuel perfectly so that by the time you were about 5-10km above the surface, all the extra tanks were jettisoned and you would just be running the 5 engines each with a single fuel tank and reaction wheel, making it extremely easy to maneuver on the strong gravity of Tylo with fuel to spare. For breaking orbit, you would use up what was remaining in the four surrounding engines and then the single poodle engine in the middle would fire, having enough delta V to get back into orbit. It also had a science Jr. attached with all of the experiments on it, so you could do full science research while orbiting and landing on Tylo. I had a video of it a while ago but lost it. I made Tylo look like Minmus difficulty with this design. I also landed on the moon over 20 times with it. Also the entire vessel for landing was made using stock parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI consider Eve the hardest by far. It is like the ultimate boss fight in KSP. I have played almost 1,000 hours and never actually got a ship to return from Eve. I\u0027ve used other people\u0027s designs, built my own. I could never return. Before 1.0, I was working on a design using Hyperedit. I could make Kerbin have the same gravity/atmosphere as Eve and I was testing several designs. One did get to orbit from sea level. But I never took it to Eve because it would take me forever to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T07:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELand: Tylo, for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve only requires you to stick a lander can/pod behind a heat shield, set SAS to follow retrograde, and deploy parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo requires judicious use of the throttle, cancelling out horizontal velocity, and a very shallow trajectory and/or suicide burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturn from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore 1.0 nerfed many of the engines, you could (or could almost) land on and return from Tylo in a single stage...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was nearly stock:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-mxp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10644428_10103065172726113_3016715501731693213_n.jpg?oh=d87479b4b2b888488318c00c65b8aa6d\u0026amp;oe=563D8BC9\u0022 alt=\u002210644428_10103065172726113_3016715501731693213_n.jpg?oh=d87479b4b2b888488318c00c65b8aa6d\u0026amp;oe=563D8BC9\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main differences: I made the cosmetic (at the time) nose cones into fuel tanks with the same mass ratio as the other 1.25m tanks, and I buffed the thrust/TWR of the aerospikes to 200kn from 175...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a KR-2L would have done it SSTO as well (slightly worse Isp, much better TWR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso there could be a hybrid engine approach with a LV-N to help the whole way, and contribute more on ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo de-orbit, land, and re-robit may still be doable post 1.0...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt certainly can be done with ISRU...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve ascent vehicles.... well, so far I haven\u0027t got one down to the surface of eve in one piece, and then back up to orbit, in a craft less than 90 tons...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, you can try and land at a high elevation, but I\u0027ve been trying from sea-level, or nearly so (so far my landings were at \u0026lt;603[altitude displayed from the craft is higher than altitude of a kerbal standing at the bottom] and 866).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo eve is definitely harder to return from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI staged like crazy... and from ~90 tons starting, I got 0.96 tons to orbit (a lander can\u002B spark\u002B FL-T200 fuel tank and a 350m/s worth of fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still haven\u0027t done the mission fully legit...
