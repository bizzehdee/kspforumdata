Attempting to LAUNCH a network following this \u0022guide\u0022 (really isn\u0027t, I can\u0027t do guides) will probably not go well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and when I mention a dish being targeted towards something, I am also assuming that dish to either be already activated or to be activated after the target has been set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERighto, think that\u0027s the ground rules or disclaimer covered I think, let\u0027s get started with the checklist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0. All satellites are in the assumed places. (4sats in geo, suitably spaced. one sat inside minmus soi and so forth...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Activate Com32 on all the Geo-sats (that\u0027s the 5Mm version, right?) for KSC and fellow Geo-sat connecting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BD Addenum: There should be an omni-line between one or two geo-sat and KSC depending on the alignment of the 4 geosats, and omni-line between all geos, if not, something is wonky and the next bit wont work, might as well stop here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Target one DTS-M1 from All Geo-sats to Minmus. (technically with a 4-geo-pattern you\u0027ll only need 2 opposing sats to point to minmus for coverage, but I like redundancy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Target one DTS-M1 from satellite orbiting Minmus to Kerbin. (if for some reason using KR-7 instead of DTS-M1, the cone should still be enough to cover geo-sats, but not 100% sure)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E4. Have ... um...\u003C/span\u003E Scratch that, damn this was a short list. Maybe add a couple more satellites to Minmus? So you don\u0027t get blackouts due to the minmus-sat being on the wrong side. (do step 3. for all sats at Minmus expected to connect directly to Kerbin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay, you should now have active connection between Minmus-sat and KSC, via the geostationary-sats if KSC is behind the horizon, by simply using planetary targeting for long range communication. Feel free to change the cases on Minmus to Mun, except you can\u0027t, since the Mun doesn\u0027t exist! Anyway, once this post is done and the Mun pops back into existence, the same procedure should work for connecting the Mun as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, \u003Cstrong\u003EI think\u003C/strong\u003E the KR-7 has enough angle to cover the Kerbin geo-sats from Minmus, but not 100% sure, so if using those instead if DTS-M1, double check the cone display. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Pretty sure the KR-7 doesn\u0027t have the cone to cover geo-sats from the Mun and any dishes bigger than that have such a tiny cones at this short ranges they can barely cover a fly. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is merely to connect via planetary targeting, obviously this wont work as a proper network for flying your probes due to the lack of communication with the active ship, however I\u0027ve thrown some thoughts hastily together that could use this as a control network:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, and that concludes the reasonably well thought out portion of this post, the rest is me getting a bit bored and tired and running with it, there might be issues with functionality, read the rest with some additional thought, for the stuff above I tried to make sure everything is written and thought of correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo right, we have spare stuff and just connecting a sat isn\u0027t all that exiting, lets do a mission with our brand new network (assuming it works, no point trying this if things fell apart in steps 1-4...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. activate the Com32 on minmus-sat . (and if you want to be boring, point the spare dish at active vessel)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Launch a vessel with a 32 and a DTS-M1, probably a dipole for the ascent as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. open the 32 once out of atmo, target the DTS towards Minmus or the Minmus-sat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Perform a Minmus-injection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. If you need a mid course correction, your minmus-sat (pointing a dish at kerbin) should pick up your ships M1 (pointed at Minmus, or directly at the sat), and help bounce the signal back to Kerbin.. Well, assuming you stay between Minmus and Kerbin, and the Minmus-sat isn\u0027t behind Minmus in it\u0027s orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Once you get close enough, the direction of the cone and location of your ship will probably not line up anymore and you will lose connection, but at that point you\u0027re hopefully getting close enough that you get picked up on the omni. (this is the bit that becomes boring if you just point a dish from minmus-sat to active vessel, and from active vessel to minmus-sat, or since we had spare dishes on the geo-sats, you could have pointed their dishes at active vessel, and the active vessel DTS towards kerbin, being even more boring \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. If you have a connection, decelerate for gods sake! If not, well... It\u0027s a nice view I guess, hope you don\u0027t crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, that\u0027s a lot of text, I might have mucked something up so I take no responsibility for inaccuracies, but I have tried my best to portray everything in the correct fashion, if something doesn\u0027t make sense, feel free to ask for clarification.
