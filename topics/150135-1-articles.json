Wind - Wind plays a big factor when taking off or landing with aircraft. High wind speeds and storms also cause hazard for re-entering spacecraft, and for spacecraft wishing to launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Clouds - Clouds add a layer of uncertainty to approaches, as it is more difficult to judge where your spacecraft will touch down, (especially on a planet like eve where there would be very thick clouds). It\u0027d also add nice aesthetics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Rain - Again, mostly cosmetic, but adding another level of depth to the planets you are visiting. Every day is the same on the moon, but Laythe storms would add a different perspective to the mostly barren moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Storms - Storms would combine all of the above, not freak hurricanes which destroy ground bases (although poorly built ground bases or top-heavy landers might topple) but still a deterrence from landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeather is something which is closely tied to aeronautics and space, and I think I\u0027d be a loss if KSP didn\u0027t implement some form of weather system.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPS: No mod I\u0027ve seen has successfully combined all of the above.
