The game its supposed support 32bits, but i see in all my error logs, always is trying to locate 4Gb!! and then, of course, game crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the most strange... it happens at not specific time... one day i can play for a whole 2 hours! (before first crash ehehehe), but most of the times, around 30 or 40 minutes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last crash... i was just in orbit, no clicks, no changes, nothing... just parked in orbit docked to my KSS hehehehe and then.. Pong... crashed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think, for some reason, the game is not recognizing good the system (32bits or 64bits) and always trying to locate 4Gb RAM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone didnt know... 32bits systems max allowed is 3.5Gb. Doesnt matter if you have 12Gb installed... you will use only 3.5Gb hehehehe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of people telling me \u0022update your PC!\u0022... thats is really easy if you have money for that, not my case \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, i also tryed the TextureReplacer mod, and YAY! it works really good! i have less crashes and game performace increased a lot!, but crashes still there.
