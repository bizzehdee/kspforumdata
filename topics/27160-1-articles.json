Are you saying that, assuming the payload needs to maneuver after a circular LKO insertion, the best spot to do that burn is as low as possible due to the Oberth effect? How significant is the delta-V penalty for burning at, say, 150x150km instead of 70x70km?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree 70x70 is a better starting orbit from a pure efficiency point of view, but I think there are some reasons to break this guideline. For instance, I use a 100km parking orbit for stations and the first launch of multi-launch craft that need to rendez-vouz. I\u0027m rarely bang-on with my launch phase angles, particularly with spaceplanes, so it\u0027s valuable to have a \u0022catch up\u0022 band below the target\u0027s orbit. This way if I\u0027m slightly trailing my 100x100 target in a 70x70, I can complete 2-3 orbits and catch up to the rendezvous instead of needing to burn to ~150x100km and wait 10-20 orbits to fall back to the rendez-vous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t it also take less dV to change orbital inclination at a high apo than a low peri? I know you mentioned mapsat as an exception, did you mean just to get them higher for a wide field of view or because they should be launched into a high elliptlcal before changing to a polar orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T02:29:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you consider the total cost of getting to the parking orbit in the first place plus getting to wherever you\u0027re going, then yes you want your parking orbit to be low. The exact delta-V penalty depends where you\u0027re going, and also how much more delta-V you expended to get to the high orbit vs if you had gone into a low orbit. Since that depends on your rocket and ascent trajectory, that\u0027s hard to predict in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a mostly-fair comparison example, let\u0027s take going to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst burn of Hohmann transfer from 70 km to 11400 km: 864 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHohmann transfer from 70 km to 150 km (I think this should be a lower bound on the increased cost of going straight into the higher orbit): 63.8 m/s burn at 70 km \u002B 62 m/s burn at 150 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst burn of Hohmann transfer from 150 km to 11400 km: 807.2 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the difference is at least 69 m/s. (Your relative velocity when you get to the Mun will be roughly 10 m/s different, but I\u0027m ignoring that here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re doing an orbital rendezvous and want a lower phasing orbit, then I suppose it makes sense to have your station a little higher. I was referring to the wide field of view rather than changing inclination. You are correct about inclination changes being cheaper from high apoapsis, but for a mapsat around Kerbin I would rather just make my gravity turn to the north or south and go straight into a polar orbit from the surface. If you launch a bunch of mapsats simultaneously and only one is for mapping Kerbin, it\u0027s cheapest to use a gravity assist from the Mun to get from equatorial into polar Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-18T02:33:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2013 02:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
