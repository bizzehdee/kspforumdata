I\u0027ve spent the past week devising the biggest craft I ever built. Which probably isn\u0027t all that big by other people\u0027s standards -- I\u0027ve seen single launch Eve missions that were at least just as big.

After twenty minutes, every maneuver node equals one stage; there\u0027s gaps of about one or two minutes between the nodes/stages, and between them I\u0027m adjusting the maneuvers. Adjustments have been very small small, a few m/s for the first few, and after leaving Kerbin I\u0027m doing adjustments of less then 1m/s for maneuvers that last one hour and have several km/s of delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDestination is Laythe. Last year, there was a challenge of \u0022maximum impact velocity\u0022 and it turned out that the soupmosphere will stop nearly anything. I approached Kerbin with ~30km/s and hit the ground at like 4km/s. Plotting the shortest possible path through the atmosphere was important. So this time, I\u0027m plotting a glancing blow and hope that it will allow for a parachute landing. I now realize that I haven\u0027t tried this before launching the mission; as I write this, I\u0027m halfway through my \u0022transfer\u0022 burn.
