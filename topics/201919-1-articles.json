As a workaround, if you accelerate in reverse (S\u00A0instead of W on keyboard\u00A0) it sort of works a bit like that. Depending on the power of wheels, it\u00A0can slow you as well as the brakes do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jack Mcslay","CreatedById":208257,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-25T22:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn easy way to adjust brake bias would be pretty useful indeed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
