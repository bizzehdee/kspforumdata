A single pair of shuttle wings are comfortably enough for crafts up to 100 t take-off weight, and 150 t as long as you don\u0027t plan to land with cargo or lots of fuel left. At least for configurations were you have take-off weight at no more than 22 t per RAPIER.  \n\nBut I would like a set of larger, thicker modular wing panels, so we can build larger wings.

Haven\u0027t needed to, with the parts I use.[/QUOTE]  \n\nWe have different approaches to winged craft :)  \n\nThe current wings are ok for a shuttle type craft (chunky glider), or a Skylon style craft (high TWR), but they are undersized for a large plane imho, and building up large wings, and tweaking angles is both fiddly and ugly.   \n\nBy way of comparison a 100t craft with 4 rapiers and 2 big S wings will only just scrape into the air at the end of the runway (with luck and hard elevator use) - that is roughly similar to Concorde take off speed, runway length, and TWR (at the low speed). More engines helps - but the TWR is very high for an aircraft then. A longer runway would help too.  \n\nBigger wings, and bigger modular panels would both be welcome, assuming procedural parts are never going to be introduced to stock.  \n\n[COLOR=\u0022silver\u0022][SIZE=1]- - - Updated - - -[/SIZE][/COLOR]  \n\n[quote name=\u0027tewpie\u0027]  \n\nTakeoff Mass: 274.17t  \n\nPayload Mass: 153.00t  \n\nPayload Fraction: [B]55.80%[/B]  \n\nSome highlights:  \n\n- Single LV-N and 11x RAPIERs.  \n\n- Uses only 2 shock cone intakes, they are a bit OP.  \n\n- Uses the new mk3 engine mounting plate and tri-adapters for significant drag reduction (see the triforce in the back?).  \n\n- (Unclipped) Rapierspikes for further drag reduction.
