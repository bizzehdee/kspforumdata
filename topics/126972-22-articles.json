I\u0027ll explain.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue turned out to be six flags (over Texas?): Five that use an old (prefix) system of mine involving parenthesis (that causes a pretty severe bug seemingly at random), and a rogue, sixth flag.\u00A0One of the prefix flags was in front of the VAB \u0022(FSK) Bob\u0027s Return\u0022 marking the return of part of my first Duna mission, two were on the island with the abandoned runway:\u00A0\u0022(ILX) East End / (ILX)\u00A0West End\u0022, one more marked the return of the first part of my first Duna mission \u0022(FSK) Dunan-X Landing\u0022. The fifth of these prefix flags was on the far side of the planet, or at least should\u0027ve been, but oddly was marked as having landed at nowhere. Empty string. \u0022(FSK) Munrock Debris.\u0022 I deleted all five of these flags, especially the one that was landed at \u0022\u0022 and orbiting NULL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sixth flag, placed\u00A0behind the VAB, was causing issues for no discernible reason. So I deleted it too. This was the one that took some time to find, as I had to basically delete half the save (breaking at VESSEL nodes, mind you), see if it fixed it, delete half of the bad part, wash, rinse, repeat, until only one entry is causing an issue... which is a slow prospect when you\u0027re talking about a 50MB text file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy these just now became an issue is beyond my comprehension.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that issue now resolved I took a look at KSP v1.1.1. I launched 3 test ships.\u00A0I crashed 3 ships. They each rattled themselves apart before they made it above 30km. Phantom force bug. Violent one at that. Nothing particularly weird in the construction, just a basic stock Saturn V.\u00A0So we\u0027re going to keep trucking with KSP v1.0.5 until KSP v1.1.2 or KSP v1.2.9 or maybe even KSP v2.0.0\u00A0gets released.

Gletrix and Agake were sitting at the conference table, as were a few other department heads and administrators that Macfred mostly recognized. The Boss was standing against the far wall, watching them as they entered. Gene and Wernher were conspicuously absent. They sat down next to their crew mates and The Boss wasted no time getting to the matter at hand.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We don\u0027t usually conduct formal debriefings.\u0022 A long pause as the four of them were looked over. \u0022Unfortunately this special situation has forced our hand.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred knew what this was about, but asked anyway. \u0022Special situation?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You lost a ship, and a rather expensive one at that.\u0022 The Boss paced along the row of windows, watching the floor and oft glancing over to glare at them. \u0022Now we\u0027re scrambling to put together a ship to keep you alive long enough to reach Jool. Thankfully we\u0027d budgeted for a science station, surprise, otherwise you\u0027d be waiting for the next launch window.\u0022 Pacing having worn thin, The Boss sat down opposite Macfred.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Given the circumstances there wasn\u0027t anything you could\u0027ve done differently. It\u0027s entirely out of character for us kerbals to act in such a deceptive manner, so I doubt anyone else would\u0027ve caught on to his ruse either.\u0022 The Boss waved a hand towards one of the department heads \u0022And from what we\u0027ve discussed, we think the perpetrator may have simply cracked. He was in an impossible situation, forced to draw straws with his team mates. His friends. Who knows how we\u0027d act after such a situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And then there\u0027s the matter of finding and recovering the Memory of Tomorrow. This Hallock character could be anywhere, or could still be orbiting the M\u00FCn. So far he\u0027s been smart and hasn\u0027t switched on the radio. We\u0027re scanning for him of course, but with the upgrades to the tracking station incomplete and the large amount of junk out in space it might be some time before we find him. But we will find him. And when we do....\u0022 The Boss took a sip of water before continuing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Otherwise you four had a good trip. Wernher is busy finalizing the plans for a nuclear propulsion drive of some sort, and we\u0027ve started building RTGs as fast as possible. Those you recovered from the M\u00FCn will still be useful of course, but now we can stop depending on scavenging for our survival in deep space. And Gene is making preparations as we speak for launching the LDAV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s not really why we\u0027re here though.\u0022 The Boss motioned towards the door and two kerbals walked in, carrying the equipment Macfred had brought back from the M\u00FCn. Shovel. Rocks. Banana in a sample container. More rocks. Data drive with the transcripts from the Pequoni 1 lander. The two tossed the junk on the table and left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m told you found something. Data from before, whispers from an old piece of hardware.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacfred nodded and patted the top of the data drive. \u0022First time I\u0027ve seen anything like it. Everything else has been dead, no software, no notes, nothing but solid-state electronics. This....\u0022 He looked down at the small grey box. \u0022Well, to be fair this is just one of the spare drives from the Sulphur 4. We left the original orbiting the M\u00FCn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So it worked...\u0022 The Boss looked at the box and then around the room. \u0022We need to send a team up to conduct a detailed examination of the lander and its electronics. Something is different, we need to know what. And we need to do this sooner rather than later. The Jool Mission is still the top priority, but drop everything else.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelrigh Kerman cleared his throat. As one of the newer kerbals from Gene\u0027s Mission Operations directorate he was largely responsible for crew scheduling. \u0022We\u0027ll send Verly to take a look at it, and have Rozor and Elkin tag along to run some experiments. Should probably send one of the pilots along to gain experience too. Any suggestions, Thomlock?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure.\u0022 The elder kerbal folded his hands on the table and leaned forward. \u0022I think you should send The Boss along. Knows more about that lander than any of us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Boss glared at him. \u0022How so?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Simple.\u0022 He patted the data drive. \u0022You\u0027re in these recordings. And as the lander only recorded things from the cabin or its own EVA suits, it\u0027s a good bet you were there. On the M\u00FCn.\u0022 The room was quiet for a few moments until Thomlock offered more. \u0022Come to think of it, a couple of the others in this room might just be a match for these recordings. Hmm?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Boss ignore Thomlock. \u0022We\u0027ll send Mardi then. She\u0027s scheduled for the Dres mission and could use the experience. Meanwhile, Thomlock needs to have his hearing checked.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I agree with him,\u0022 Macfred interjected, motioning towards Thomlock. \u0022What he says about the voices. Your\u0027s sounds remarkably like....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Both of you,\u0022 The Boss waved at Macfred and Thomlock, \u0022need to see the Flight Surgeon for your post-flight physical. Have the doc check your ears first. And that\u0027s the last we\u0027ll hear of it, ok? Anything else? No? Meeting dismissed. Let\u0027s get back to work.\u0022 The Boss, Macfred and Thomlock stayed seated while everyone else filed quickly out of the room. No one seemed to object. Macfred waited until they were alone before continuing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What aren\u0027t you telling us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Quite a few things. Nothing you need to know. Not yet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why the rush to get to Jool? You know what\u0027s there, don\u0027t you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Boss stood and walked over to the window to stare blankly at the sky. \u0022Not with any certainty. That\u0027s why we\u0027re sending a team. A Laythe lander. An aircraft. Extra supplies. Hallock isn\u0027t the only kerbal out there.\u0022 A long moment\u0027s pause until The Boss turned to face them. \u0022I\u0027ve already told you too much. Go see the flight surgeon and get back to training for your mission. You\u0027ll get more information when the time is right.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuilding Anticipation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first piece of the Jool Mission to be launched following the loss of the Memory of Tomorrow was the Sulphur 5 LDAV. Intended to be the primary landing and return craft for the exploration of Laythe, the Laythe Descent / Ascent Vehicle was the single most important part\u00A0of the mission. At 456 tonnes, the LDAV, its descent stage, mounting bracket, and its custom launch vehicle were the most massive things yet launched.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch was executed perfectly by the onboard kOS flight computer. It was placed into a 80km parking orbit and left to await arrival of the rest of its mission stack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160429_ksp0002_ldav.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160429_ksp0002_ldav.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160429_ksp0012_ldav.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160429_ksp0012_ldav.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160429_ksp0015_ldav.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160429_ksp0015_ldav.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo save on payload mass for the Jool mission, the upper stage of the LDAV was modified to include landing legs, as would normally be positioned for the Sulphur landers. The craft which became the Sulphur 4 had originally been intended to serve as the vacuum lander for the Jool mission. Rushing the S-4\u0027s construction to rescue the team from Pioneer Base meant it was unsuitable for the Jool mission and thus forced the compromise of the S-5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the LDAV would be used to land not only on Laythe, but on every body in the Jool system less massive than Tylo. (Provided it had enough fuel.) Of course the crew would need to land on Laythe first before visiting any of the other moons, which might affect the mission schedule a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext up was the Laythe Research Station, officially designated as Silicon 6. This small station features tightly-packed crew quarters for four kerbals, a single-kerbal lab area for conducting experiments, a bevy of science experiments strapped to the outside, power generation in the form of freshly-minted blutonium RTGs, and communications equipment sufficient for contacting Kerbin. Oh, and two \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E trunks full of supplies.

Their ride back, however, was as of yet undecided. In the event of an emergency prior to the next transfer window to Jool (such as running out of cheese dip or corn chips), the crew could use the Sulphur 5 LDAV\u0027s upper stage as the crew return vehicle. It wouldn\u0027t provide much in the way of creature comforts, but it would be enough to keep them alive.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s assuming they could make it out to Jool in the first place. Moving them and their various craft to the jolly green giant would require a large tug with a drive section previously impossible to build or launch. One of the most expensive pieces of equipment ever designed. The most efficient spacecraft ever.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThankfully Wernher had been busy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd such a tug could only ever have one designation. The most kerbal of elements. Potassium. K.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160430_ksp0037_k-1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022586\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160430_ksp0037_k-1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 631.1 tonnes, this beast and its custom launch vehicle displaced the Sulphur 5 LDAV as the \u0022most massive thing yet launched.\u0022 The rocket itself was rather simple - four cores identical to the three that launched the S-5: One Mainsail each with two strap-on boosters of some considerable power. And yet not so simple. Nor was it particularly aerodynamically sound, but they did what they could do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerched helplessly atop the K-1 was a nosecone. Whether it provided any aerodynamic aid was up for some debate, but it was the largest the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E crews could come up with on such short notice. The upper stage of the K-1\u0027s launch vehicle also featured four Mainsails, and had just enough fuel to place the whole mess into its rendezvous orbit with the S-5/Si-6.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160430_ksp0053_k-1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160430_ksp0053_k-1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the Potassium Tug itself, the design is rather simple. Eight NERVA engines burn liquid fuel fed to them from two large, Mk3 liquid fuel tanks. A series of 24 large radiator panels and optional 16 extendable small radiator assemblies dissipate the heat (bogus heat) produced by the NERVAs (heat that should be dissipated by the ejected propellent already, but conservation of heat seems poorly understood by these kerbals). The radiators are installed on the outside of a large radiation shroud, thick enough to protect anything in front of the craft. The \u0022cold\u0022 end is outfitted with a large tug-mount docking port, while the \u0022hot\u0022 end features a standard sized port, to be used by refueling craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA last minute design change saw the upper stage of the K-1\u0027s outfitted with its own flight computers and docking ports, and it would become the Chlorine 4 upon reaching orbit and retained for later reuse.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160430_ksp0058_k-1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160430_ksp0058_k-1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe actual rendezvous was performed by the S-5/Si-6 conglomerate, as the K-1 was completely dry. (The two Mk3 liquid fuel tanks were launched empty\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce both items of the payload and the tug were sharing the same orbit, the Silicon 6 undocked from the LDAV and made its way to the tug. The tug adapter would be mounted facing the tug, and the station itself had to be aligned so the tie-downs on the station were facing those on the tug. (Except not, as the payload will flip 180 degrees prior to departure, as explained below.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce docked, the remote operators at Mission Control had the Si-6\u0027s second stage transfer its remaining fuel into the Chlorine 4. Once empty, the Si-6 upper stage was jettisoned to become a large piece of space debris.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160430_ksp0065_k-1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160430_ksp0065_k-1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160430_ksp0067_k-1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160430_ksp0067_k-1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the station docked, the LDAV itself was moved over. And since half of all the fun things in KSP take place in the dark, so did half of this docking operation. (As is only right and proper.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the crew arrives at the Potassium 1 stack the payload will be rotated so that the LDAV and the control cockpit of the station are facing \u0022forwards\u0022. Following that the crew (likely Macfred) will tie down the payload to the tug, and then everything will be ready to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith the first part of the Jool Expedition launched and assembled in orbit, we\u0027ll next turn our attention to the remaining bits and bobs. Up next will be the Aluminium X-4B 10 (also known as the ALEC, or Aluminium Laythe Exploration Craft), followed by a collection of science, communications, and mapping satellites for the Joolian System (as well as some extra fuel and supplies). [I\u0027m trying to decide right now if I want to install SCANsat for 1.1.2.... I\u0027m thinking yes, which means I need to stick SCANsat components on these satellites too.... Meaning I need to dig out the old 1.0.5 version of its parts before the next launch. Thankfully I downloaded it back in December and just never installed it. I\u0027m also likely to start using Space-Y and related mods as of 1.1.2, though none of that needs to go to Jool.]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis second stack will be moved to Jool using a second Potassium tug, meaning I\u0027ll get to launch another of these beasts. After that will come four launches to fully refuel the two Potassiums, followed by the crew launch directly to the K-1 stack (spare docking ports for the win), and then presumably departure for Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027ll all be next time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNavigation: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126972-forgotten-space-program/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2564179\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ENext Post\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-04T06:51:40Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2016 06:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAL 9000","CreatedById":140704,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T00:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get the feeling the Boss knows a lot more than we know he knows (wait, what?)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T00:23:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBruce Springsteen goes to the Mun! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T00:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222554396\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462148122\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022140704\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KAL 9000\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, KAL 9000 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get the feeling the Boss knows a lot more than we know he knows (wait, what?)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bet he knows why the space program was abandoned...And why does he go nameless like that?
