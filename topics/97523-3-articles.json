No, this is a stock craft intended for such. My solution to solid SRBs has to be a stock solution. I did test a rather novel idea I came up with: craft file editing the SRB fuel amounts... but doing so doesn\u0027t shift the mass with the larger fuselage assembly I made for it, even though the increased mass is accounted for. So until stock can extend SRBs via extra fuel stacks, this idea is on hold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime I am working on incorporating the SSI certified xonight Hercules MMU as part of the STS Operations Module subassembly I\u0027m developing for the shuttle, seen in this picture in use at our space station.
