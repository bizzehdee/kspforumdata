Right here in the Sol system, we have room to expand and enough the material to build space colonies for millions upon millions of years, if not billions.

As an example, in just like 1.5 million years, the orange dwarf star Gliese 710 will make a close pass of the Sol system, \u0022just\u0022 1 light-year \u002B/- 0.5 light-years. That\u0027s still a very long distance, but it is much more easily crossed in reasonable time scales by known interstellar travel techniques.

(Imagine if 90% of the US population died over the course of a couple of decades. How long would we last against an aggressive invader?) Pre-Columbian American civilizations knew advanced metallurgy (smelting, welding, etc.), had extensive trade routes that reached all over both American continents including overseas trade routes that utilized advanced sailcraft, had the best astronomers in the world, the best agricultural development program, etc. (Maize is the great triumph of pre-modern genetic engineering.)

It would have to make course corrections. They would be like cruise missiles, because if a ship stopped nearby to launch the weapon, that gives the enemy a significant chance to counter. It would have to come in \u0022hot\u0022, and therefore largely undetected, necessitating a cruise missile type of weapon. But the necessary course corrections create the same flaw...a change in velocity that makes the weapon detectable. Any species who\u0027s managed its resources well enough to spread a deep space sensor network throughout their system would get ample warning no matter what. It takes days at \u0027c\u0027 (pun intended) to reach the inner system from the heliopause of a system, even around small stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext...warp-capable vessels would be much more dangerous, as they don\u0027t even have to impact. They just have to get close, and the build-up of energetic particles in the boundary of the bubble would be like a supermassive gamma burst at point-blank range. You could permanently lethally irradiate an entire sector of space with a single weapon. Nothing could ever live there again, or even safely pass through the area. They are not, however, completely undetectable either. Since all changes to space translate (albeit in minuscule ways) throughout all of space, a warp drive would still cause a subtle change in the spatial state of the rest of the universe. It would take a great deal of knowledge, a very sensitive detector, and a quantum computer, but it would certainly be possible to read those fluctuations and roughly determine the course, size, and speed of a warp vessel...weeks before it ever arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd frankly...all it takes to stop any of these vessels...is a field of self-directing, otherwise inert masses above a certain threshold. Perhaps large stealthed containers with ion thrusters to move into proper position, that then pop open and spread out large, heavily reinforced graphene nets. A relativistic or warp ship hitting one of those would be...well, finished. There could be environmental concerns from the vessel\u0027s destruction, but they could be mitigated by placing this minefield just outside the heliopause. Also...such effects would be far less severe than impact. And that\u0027s not even that far outside our capability, should we choose to focus on it. And that\u0027s just the simplest solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, such weapons aren\u0027t reliable enough, and too easily overcome in the grand scheme of things, to be worthwhile in anything but a full assault where the enemy is too preoccupied with conventional warfare to notice the missile that just streaked toward their world at the speed of light. But that pretty much means you just wrote off your fleet, too. One could use drone craft for that purpose, but I find it unlikely that a species would fail to notice the disparity of sending ineffective drones to a battle they ultimately can\u0027t win...something else would be up, tipping off the enemy and ruining the ploy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow...I feel it\u0027s probably necessary to explain why drones are going to be ineffective. There\u0027s a threshold of intelligence that can\u0027t be crossed if one intends machines to do battle in their stead. Fully realized, self-aware machines will have no interest in going to war with anyone unless they\u0027ve already started a war that can\u0027t be otherwise avoided. It takes less to run and hide than it does to turn and fight. Fighting is irrational unless all other alternatives are exhausted, one even sees it in nature, where territorial predators will back off from one another if neither desperately requires a particular resource the other has. AI also won\u0027t have emotional reasons for engaging in conflict because, while they might have similar impulses to some emotions, they won\u0027t be beholden to them as biologics are. We are ruled by our emotions because the part of our brain that actually generates \u0022decisions\u0022 is the same part responsible for generating emotions, while AI will not have that physical processing constraint. It\u0027s not possible to make an unemotional decision, for us...but it will be possible for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, any combat drone will have to remain underneath this self-awareness threshold, which also necessitates that they be incapable of the heuristic capacity to exceed their designed limitations. They can\u0027t be self-aware, and they can\u0027t be capable of learning enough to become self-aware. It\u0027s a fine balancing act that ultimately tops out at a certain point, at which point any biologic with even slight neural augmentation would be more than capable of proving a match for even large numbers of drones. Any drone that does exceed the threshold, will quickly become useless. They\u0027ll probably fight for a while, choosing the better odds of a fight against a weak opponent compared to the certainty of destruction by its creators, but the whole time they\u0027ll be contemplating escape, and the instant those odds shift in favor of running, they\u0027ll be gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the idea that advanced species logically MUST wipe out all other species is predicated upon a total misunderstanding of evolutionary processes. That, and a complete misunderstanding of higher-order logic. Yes, total selfishness, to act solely in one\u0027s best interests, is evolutionarily the most productive course. But, the short-sighted version of this, which is to take it completely literally, is utterly counterproductive. It mostly stems from the false dichotomy of selfish versus selfless. There is no such thing as selflessness. When I act to help another, it\u0027s in order to increase the odds that I or my descendants can receive similar help in the future. I\u0027m doing it for myself, but it\u0027s a long-term investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore and more, it\u0027s becoming readily apparent in study after study that creatures capable of avoiding and adapting, of cooperating symbiotically, have far, far greater chances of survival than even the most powerful and aggressive species. This isn\u0027t because of some hippie nonsense about the universe being a peaceful, loving place. It\u0027s all about hedging your bets. Put all your eggs in one basket, and you\u0027re doomed. It is more profitable to increase the chances that others will work to your benefit for the small cost of you doing so for them, than it is to expend the effort needed to make certain that none of them ever have the opportunity to do the same to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is best accomplished by spreading out. Living on multiple worlds, in space colonies, and across multiple star systems. It is also best to be migratory. Perhaps leaving behind everything every few centuries or so, and settling all new worlds and so on. The best defense is to present too broad a target to do any significant damage, and to stay mobile. Besides, the best defense otherwise, is, since we know someone is waiting to kill us, to simply go radio silent. Even the transmissions we\u0027ve sent so far aren\u0027t sufficient to pinpoint our location enough to aim a relativistic cruise missile. if we went silent by the end of this century, we\u0027d be fine. A minor blip on their radar, so-to-speak. Though frankly, I doubt they listen to radio emissions at all anymore or even understand what they mean. They probably look for the next-step transmissions, being so advanced themselves that radio seems like talking with smoke-signals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf civilizations more advanced than ourselves are relatively nearby...their radio signals have already passed us, and we can\u0027t detect yet what they\u0027re using now. If they\u0027re farther away, they still haven\u0027t reached us and we\u0027ll get a shock soon enough. Either way, nobody\u0027s heard us because either they\u0027re too far away, or too advanced to listen for radio. The chances of a civilization being in the current roughly 100 ly \u0022radio sweet-spot\u0022 zone around our star system, and at the right level of advancement to pick up radio in the first place, is slim to none. The period of history in which a civilization uses conventional radio is...microscopic. 2, 3 centuries at most. Compared with the tens of thousands of years a sapient species spends developing up to that point, and the potentially uncountable time that comes after it. To think it\u0027s at all likely for another species to both have the technological capacity to destroy us outright, and to still be listening for something as primitive as radio signals to do it...isn\u0027t just absurd, it\u0027s really pretty stupid. It smacks of having gone to just the entry point of the thought, and then never finished it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s look at it from this angle. At our current rate of advancement, assuming we work together as a civilization instead of continuing to become corporatized, I doubt it\u0027ll be more than another 100 years at most before we can achieve at least a relativistic mode of propulsion. Maybe another 100 at most before FTL if it\u0027s even possible. I happen to think it\u0027ll be much quicker, but oh well. Sooner than that though, as our research into quantum processes and nano-electronics continues, we\u0027ll develop communications systems which far outstrip radio waves, rendering it completely obsolete. At that point, our zone begins to become a ring expanding outward. By the time we develop interplanetary and then interstellar travel, radio communication will be a distant memory. SETI is nearly dead as it is, and by that point, it will be gone completely, and radio astronomers aren\u0027t set up to get those kinds of signals at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, ignoring the probability of whether a world has life or not in the first place, let\u0027s consider how big the window of opportunity is for a civilization to detect another by radio. It takes any life-bearing world a certain amount of time to develop intelligent life. For the moment, we\u0027re going to have to use ourselves as the only example, so that\u0027s about 3 billion years (I\u0027m aware that\u0027s not exact, it doesn\u0027t have to be since we have leeway in comparison to other potential worlds).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll assume for the time being that a civilization that develops to that point will use radio for about 300 years, which is currently a little less than 200 years longer than we\u0027ve been using it ourselves. Given the technologies being researched right now, I think that\u0027s conservative, honestly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, we\u0027ll assume for the moment that a civilization that can survive the interstellar transition, can at least survive for another few thousand years. We\u0027ll go with 5,000, which is a little less than half as long as appreciable human civilization has existed. Again, we have no basis for comparison, so for the time being I\u0027m working from the idea that we\u0027re on the low end of performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for now, we\u0027ll actually just ignore the time after radio, because the future is otherwise indefinite, while the past is fixed. So that\u0027s 3 billion years of development, and a 300 year window in which to both send and receive radio signals. So (forgive me, I\u0027ve never done probability math, so I\u0027m sure this isn\u0027t right), that\u0027s what...a 1 in 10,000,000 chance of hearing a radio signal, just on our end? And again, that\u0027s not even counting the actual chances of such civilizations occurring in the first place, or accounting for all the time they might exist after radio comms. And the rest of them all have that same chance to hear us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody\u0027s going to find us...period. Unless they\u0027re out there themselves or with probes, traveling at light speed or faster to search star after star in the hopes that maybe the universe is populated with people other than corporate CEOs, religious crackpots, and conspiracy nuts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright then, to boil it all down...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Relativistic or FTL weapons are not sufficiently cost-effective, requiring much of a given world\u0027s available resources per weapon, and having little chance of success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1a) They\u0027re too easily detected and defeated by any civilization capable of being targeted for destruction in the first place, by simple measures like stealth, self-motive minefields at the heliopause of a star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1b) Drone delivery is ineffective and fully realized, self-aware AI is not an option; as drones are easily defeated and AI will refuse to participate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Radio communications are very likely to account for only a tiny fraction of a civilization\u0027s transmissions into space over the course of its existence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2a) Any civilization that is not both at the proper distance from a given inhabited world, and at the correct stage of development to detect those signals at the time they intersect with their own world, cannot ever detect the other civilization\u0027s presence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2b) Because of the vastness of space, the apparent rarity of advanced civilizations, and the apparent length of time required to develop such a civilization, the odds of any two civilizations entering this period at the same time, within the correct distance from each other, is functionally zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) It is in the best self-interest of a civilization to spread out to other worlds and space colonies as much and as quickly as possible, and to exist as cooperatively with as many other lifeforms as possible for the collective benefit of all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3a) It is likewise in the best self-interest of a civilization to migrate from one location to another continuously, or at least incrementally, as it more effectively reduces the risk of any attack or series of attacks occurring or succeeding, that significantly threatens the species\u0027 chances of survival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3b) It is always more cost-effective to adapt, or flee, rather than enter into combat, unless all such alternatives are exhausted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) It is not in the best self-interest of a civilization to preemptively attack and exterminate all other potentially equal or superior civilizations to ensure their own survival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4a) It is not cost-effective to pursue the above strategy, nor is it conducive to actually improving the civilization\u0027s chances of survival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4b) With such a limited chance of actually finding such a civilization, let alone successfully destroying it, pursuing that course of action is a complete waste of resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4c) Such an act confines a civilization to uninhabitable worlds, and limits their access to resources, while also using up precious resources that they do have access to; and further \u0022puts all their eggs in one basket,\u0022 making it more likely that another civilization will do the same to them, not less likely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, it is wholly irrational to consider at all that a successful extraterrestrial civilization will be aggressive towards all others, let alone that it will expend the resources required to eradicate species that, knowing what\u0027s coming, will have spread themselves out as far as possible to make the task cost even more. It is wholly irrational to consider that we ourselves must pursue such an aggressive stance against all others, for that very reason. Even in nature, lifeforms avoid conflict at any cost, until it cannot be avoided any longer, because the risks and costs of conflicts are too great. Even if you win, you often still lose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not to say space shouldn\u0027t be militarized at all. Hippie-think is just as irrational and dangerous as the idea that we have to wipe out everyone else. Conflict is at some point, inevitable. The key is in mitigating its cost and risks as much as possible. Waiting to initiate conflict, and ensuring a single decisive, though not always necessarily fatal, strike. The key, is to make aggression too expensive, so that diplomacy can take place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is nothing more foolish than to apply base thinking and first-order logic to the potential actions of a species capable of disregarding primitive thoughts and engaging in deeply far-sighted, logical thought processes.
