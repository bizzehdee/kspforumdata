Most common problem with rockets flipping is that you turn too hard. Usually my rockets have TWR from 1.3 to 1.6. I start my gravity turn early, as soon as my rocket reaches 100 m/s. Then I keep the nose on the edge of prograde vector to about 30 km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd remember, fins are your friends!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T10:38:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd fins on the bottom.

This spinning thing is something we all initially had trouble with in the new 1.0\u002B aero until we learned to engineer and fly new rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpinning out of control essentially comes down to a contest between drag and control. When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase control using engine gimbals, stabilizer wheels, and control fins (like AV-R8).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach one (340 m/s), so you should stay pointed as prograde as possible at speeds around 290-400 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a rocket, any control fins should be as low and outside as possible.
