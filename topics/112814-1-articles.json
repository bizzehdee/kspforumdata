I\u0027ve got only the first liquid engine and fuel tanks.

Most common problem with rockets flipping is that you turn too hard. Usually my rockets have TWR from 1.3 to 1.6. I start my gravity turn early, as soon as my rocket reaches 100 m/s. Then I keep the nose on the edge of prograde vector to about 30 km altitude.\n\nAnd remember, fins are your friends!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T10:38:04Z","Content":"Add fins on the bottom. Seriously. I always struggled with rockets flipping over, then I tried one I\u0027d be able to steer better so I added some controllable fins, and... I was unable to turn it horizontal. Seriously, they hold it so firmly up you need a lot of effort to flip it over."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T10:48:26Z","Content":"If you can\u0027t turn after adding some fins, try smaller ones. Winglets are very efficient for small rockets.\n\nDon\u0027t forget that heavier rockets are easier to fly than lighter ones. Learning curve can be steep, but then you won\u0027t have any problems."},{"CreatedByName":"LordCorwin","CreatedById":114256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T11:31:17Z","Content":"With the latest version I noticed that on first stages of the game it was quite difficult to control de rocket when leaving Kerbin\u0027s surface, between 5k and 20k.\n\nI think it is due to the new aerodynamic model.\n\nI solved this using better wings with more lift ratio, activating SAS, adding the stabilizer unit, maintaining the atmospheric performance quite below 100% (seen with Kerbal Engineer mod)... and not starting the orbit maneuver until 20km height. Even then, your maneuvers and corrections must be gentle.\n\nEdited: also, take care of selecting an engine with Gimbal ability\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T11:39:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 11:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordCorwin**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T12:16:12Z","Content":"You are not alone. This spinning thing is something we all initially had trouble with in the new 1.0\u002B aero until we learned to engineer and fly new rockets.\n\nSpinning out of control essentially comes down to a contest between drag and control. When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase control using engine gimbals, stabilizer wheels, and control fins (like AV-R8).\n\nAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach one (340 m/s), so you should stay pointed as prograde as possible at speeds around 290-400 m/s.\n\nOn a rocket, any control fins should be as low and outside as possible. If you are using control fins on more than one stage, the CoL needs to stay below the CoM at all times, even as the tanks empty."},{"CreatedByName":"Scout61699","CreatedById":146177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T21:53:30Z","Content":"Thanks for all the replies guys!!

Larger rockets are easier to control because all the stacks help keep the rocket stable in the direction of the airflow. If you are using multiple stacked tanks in you LFO rockets, then the top tanks use fuel first. This causes your center of mass to get lower over time. When you CoM goes behind your center of pressure, then your rocket want to flip. However solids use one big tank, so they don\u0027t have the shifting CoM."},{"CreatedByName":"AlextheBodacious","CreatedById":139447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T00:08:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hard to say for sure without pictures.
