How can I determine launch windows from other planets, like Mars and match them to dates in the future? Usually if I look up launch windows to a planet, I can only get Earth launch windows, which makes sense unless you\u0027re writing certain science fiction stories. Also, I usually only find the periods, but not actual dates (even one from which I can calculate the dates myself).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-01T04:06:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2013 04:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbface\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poldarias","CreatedById":58016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T13:56:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell im sure the planet has to be at a certain position, but im not sure how they calculate it. if you want to find out best looking for probes sent to that planet then look at what degree they are relative to earth, use a simulation like NASAS EYES and look to see when it happens again. Im sure there\u0027s a way to find out somewhere on the internet what is a lot easier though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyotor Gagarin","CreatedById":36567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T18:00:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Maths in Kosmo-not\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/16511-Tutorial-Interplanetary-How-To-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInterplanetary How-To Guide\u003C/a\u003E are applicable for orbit to orbit transitions in general. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe masses and orbital radii of the planets should be pretty easy to find on the internets.
