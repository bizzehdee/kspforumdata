This mod aims to fix this by deleting the clamps as soon as you launch the vessel. Nothing much to say, really.\n\n![fM91ig3.gif](http://i.imgur.com/fM91ig3.gif)\n\n[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/iPeer/ClampsBeGone/releases/latest)\n\nAlternatively, [from KerbalStuff](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1037)\n\nAlso available on [CKAN](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067) as **ClampsBeGone**\n\n[Source code](https://github.com/iPeer/ClampsBeGone)!\n\nCheck the [entire release list](https://github.com/iPeer/ClampsBeGone/releases) to help test new versions!\n\nLicensed under [GNU GPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)!\n\n**Dates are dd/mm/yy**\n\n    17/08/15, v1.2:\n        * Added an option to delay removal of launch clamps (default: OFF).

I know EPL uses a custom module, for example. I\u0027ve actually never seen anyone using clamps without the stock module have the issue, though support should be able to be added for them. Your points about the recovery and lights etc. on the clamps are good points. I\u0027ll have a look into this stuff and see what I can come up with.
