The game needs to know where the \u0027bottom\u0027 of the rocket engine is and I must be doing something wrong to make the game think it\\\u0027s somewhere where it shouldn\\\u0027t be. This is all assumption though so I was hoping an experienced mod maker has run across this issue and has determined that magic property that confuses KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
