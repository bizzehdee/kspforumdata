Other people had already asked why they couldn\u0027t use the save button, so maybe a small confirmation or a different colour might be helpful to some people?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T18:25:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t the button greyed out when you don\u0027t have any parts selected, and becomes clickable when you do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr do you mean something else?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T18:27:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think he means that there\u0027s no feedback when a craft gets saved successfully.
