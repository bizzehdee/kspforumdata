I couldn\u0027t think of a more concise way of putting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have just recently finished up a manned mission to Duna and Ike. My landing craft (which did the landings for both Ike and Duna) was the thing that landed back on Kerbin. However, upon reviewing all of the science that I got, I noticed that it only logged the craft for landing on Ike, but not Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, I suggest that the game logs each body a craft lands on so you can get the \u0022returned a vessel from the surface of \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0022 science points for each body instead of just the first one it lands on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T23:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei think data is overwriten unless a kerbal grabs it from the sensor in eva and puts it in a command module. that applies to thermometers, barometers, gravioli, atmospheric scanners, and seismic sensors. the lab and goo however, must be reset at a science lab to get multiple uses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T00:12:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei think data is overwriten unless a kerbal grabs it from the sensor in eva and puts it in a command module. that applies to thermometers, barometers, gravioli, atmospheric scanners, and seismic sensors. the lab and goo however, must be reset at a science lab to get multiple uses.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is how you reset said experiments, but there is no way to reset the science points that are relevant to this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T00:20:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it takes the situation that would yield the most science points, e.g. if you got into Mun orbit, it would give you \u0022returned from Mun orbit\u0022 instead of \u0022returned from flyby of Mun\u0022 even though you did both.
