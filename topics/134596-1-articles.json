Yes, you can! A simulated world has a definite end at the amount of computer hard disk space, which contains all the data of the simulated content! Large hard disks today can contain 1-2 TB on PCs, but they all have an end even when grouped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCaptain Picard in Star Trek the Next Generation often marks the exploration of endless space as significant, so why not simulate the end of the world? A circle is round and does that change far out there in discovery? Space is discovered in colors, sounds and feelings, and they don\u0027t change by travel, the world really ain\u0027t that big! So this (End of World) really is relevant for a realistic space simlator compared to those game simulations like for example \u0022X3\u0022 with alien races.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlien races are simply used as opponents in game content. But history doesn\u0027t really exists!\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example it is history that humans have their own \u0022free will\u0022. So they might as well be similar to pieces in a chess play, because every chess piece also can move freely. Actually humans don\u0027t really decide what to do, they have \u0022needs\u0022 to fulfil; so if any one needs to toilet, they can say no - - 5 seconds later the urge to toilet \u0022asks\u0022 again and so on repeatedly until done; so what kind of \u0022free will\u0022 is it, that just gets to prolong the already decided ??? It\u0027s like chess pieces with bound moves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHistory is about who wins the game. But what do you do after game over? You start another game! So does it really matter who won?? There are plenty of examples of replays; crossword-puzzles in daily magazines etc. It is just something to do for the human mind out of boredom. And it is crazy that humans need problems or have to create some when there are none for occupation, but that\u0027s what wars are all about. And since they have to do it, then it is not \u0022free will\u0022 but entertainment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game is only serious as long as you are playing it! For example according to history native american indians were placed in concentration camps in US many years before jewish people were in Germany. So is a circle still round no matter where you travel? ; Are you oblieged to note your name, when the police ask you about it? \u0022I don\u0027t have a name, nobody knew it, when I was born, so they just invented one; I don\u0027t need it ...\u0022 The name is used as ID in the government game play. But what happens when your opponent cheats and regardless of the pieces on the board declares chessmate? Things have purpose when you are playing a game. The history is important to winning. When you don\u0027t play, things don\u0027t have an explanation; when you discuss something it doesn\u0027t matter, since you\u0027re not playing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuggestions:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. How \u0027bout ability to build kerbals? Humans were created to entertain on Earth; can a worm evolve to fly, or can a bird evolve to make topsoil out of organic waste? Living in space requires a new race to the conditions there. Perhaps without gender and organic food and with the bears\u0027 ability to hibernate. Like faulty space rockets, faulty kerbals could be fun and entertaining, if they by accident got prey tendencies from an animal gene. But what\u0027s realistic? Is it possible to have a kerbal mind that can solve problems and then switch off, when there are no further problems to solve, so it doesn\u0027t get bored? What do real cosmonauts do?\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Simulate the end of the world: Since it doesn\u0027t really matter who win wars as they will just be refought, skip the last 5 percent. Like not seeing the last 4 minutes of a 80 minutes movie entertainment.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n-------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003ENew space coordination and navigation:\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck out a picture of schoolfish (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/18/fish-schools-genes_n_3947303.html) - the bubble form all the single fish create as a whole - looks like a magnetic field.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo how can a single schoolfish in the darkness of the whole coordinate to its position, and how does the whole school navigate?

And since that probably simulates space-flights are being coordinated from Earth, it\u0027s not independent space-navigation!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample: When navigating on a large very straight road in a car alone (at evening/night) and a sign shows a speed limit of 50 km/h and the road is familiar, that speed limit could probably be 30 km/h higher and still in the safety zone, and when driving taxi your customers would probably expect you to go those extra 30 km/h.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFact is that the road is firm, signs and stuff around don\u0027t move, but as soon there are other travelers, it is possible that a traveler in front suddenly hits the break, and that presents unknown factors, why for example a lower speed limit might be appropriate.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA \u0022perfect kerbal\u0022 can only be a robot. Why not try to simulate living creatures with minds?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the very first mind became bored and tried to figure out problems and make rules so to tell others who came later - and who had not figured it out yet - that way the first mind would stand out as champion! And those minds who came later when they got bored they broke the rules ... because that\u0027s what rules are for! And then you\u0027re playing a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould you rather be alone in space with perfect kerbals - though they look human - they are robots? Why not,\u00A0if possible! For example who makes the better judgement: 1) Prolog (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog\u003C/a\u003E) is an attempt to simulate knowledge by rules and IDs - it will just need the rules defined and perhaps that can be done by the usual scientific approach to statistics, test something by which the majority of positive results must be the rules. 2) In the \u0022El Dorado (1966)\u0022 movie John Wayne plays \u0022Cole\u0022 who kills a boy that fires a warning shot, very unfortunately, later a sister to that killed boy mortally wounds \u0022Cole\u0022 - John Wayne - which he entirely forgives. And what other reason to his mind can there be to just ignore the fact that she intentionally put a bullet in his body, which the doctor can\u0027t get out, other than infatuation; others usually just have to put out a wrong word before those bored cowboy gunfighters drew their pistols! They also said about General Patton in the \u0022Patton (1970)\u0022 movie that in order to juice him in aggression, they had headlines of him made in the news papers! Etc etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut if KSP is suppose\u00A0to simulate reality then the kerbals behavior could be more troublesome and entertaining at that, since John Wayne \u0026amp; WWII movies are popular too ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuggestions:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.\u00A0First stage to really do (near-future) space travel is for kerbals to build a kind of Saturn ring around Kerbin for habitat. The purpose of that is not to go any further, it is just tourism! And it doesn\u0027t require a new kind of kerbal space race, because while kerbals live above ground, they still use Kerbin as resource, but while living above ground they live in a cleaner\u00A0environment (or are suppose to)!\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou may not have noticed it - if you have mostly lived\u00A0nearer equator (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator\u003C/a\u003E), but during the last 3 decades the Sky has been more constantly darkened by clouds in Europe. Global warming was much popular, but what about the clouds covering the UV light more than 6 months of the year? There doesn\u0027t seem to be any statistics concerning it on the internet, but it\u0027s a fact that UV light kills germs (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.geeksonhome.com/how-does_5022324_uv-light-kill-germs.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.geeksonhome.com/how-does_5022324_uv-light-kill-germs.html\u003C/a\u003E) and when the Sky gets covered more than half the year, perhaps that causes the majority of flu\u00A0diseases? Or perhaps the smoke doesn\u0027t matter, when you got nose spray.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut living above the clouds in the sun, it\u0027s another place for tourists. And the challenge would be to build a bug-free environment. For example there could be kerbals failing with UV light, while others succeed with alcohol or\u00A0chlorine because ... something funny!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn interstellar travel the Kerbal hibernating like a bear yelling: \u0022Where the heck is my quality of life? Oh yes, there\u0027s no problems while sleeping!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the mind something to turn off with sleep, when there\u0027s no problems, and turn on where there are task to complete, because you only matters, when you work and there\u0027s a need for it? Or is the mind something that requires problems, so if there aren\u0027t any, it goes crazy?\u003Cbr\u003E\nGee look a all the dust, every day adds a new layer, so if you\u0027d like something to do ... There are plenty of people who does that instead of crosswords. But why not build an orbital habitat, where you use liquid and UV light to somehow naturally or automatically clean, while solving the nature of being bored another way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.
