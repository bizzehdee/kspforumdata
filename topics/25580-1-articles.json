You have an industry, companies, people, they have to be working on something or the industry will stagnate. Why don\u0027t they work on an improved version of an already existing plane? Dunno, probably the same reason Microsoft releases new versions of Widows instead of adding stuff and polishing say, Win7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, about the A-10. There are no factories to produce parts for it anymore. The A-10 flying today run on surplus parts.
