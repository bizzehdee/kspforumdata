Warp drives are purely fiction and are also unnecessary for such a small solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are mods that add different types of warp drives, from point to point warp beacons to Star Trek-style hyperdrives and various sub-light interstellar drives too. A DLC just around warp tech wouldn\u2019t sell much and would be considered cheating by quite a lot of people, including me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking History added custom missions and a new size class of rocket parts; Breaking Ground added scannable surface features, robotics and deployable science experiments. I don\u2019t see what else a warp drive DLC could include to make it worth the money and without overlapping with the many mods that already do it, and/or KSP2 which is much more focussed on interstellar travel with futuristic tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspnerd122","CreatedById":199169,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-05T15:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo to my thread on this post it here\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
