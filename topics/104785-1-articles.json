I am not a modder, texturer, or configurer. With KSP being in its current form I don\u0027t think paying modders would work mainly because of abandoned mods and IRL events that cause modders to drop projects and in some cases beloved and very useful projects get completely lost. So paying for a mod only to have it lose support doesn\u0027t work. There needs to a guarantee that work is continued through iterations and support is given if something goes wrong. I know this is 1.0 and supposedly a stable game but come on this is Squad I can\u0027t imagine them stopping here. There will be updates just less often. So my point is, that to pay for a mod and then have it die, that would be unacceptable. Even if the cost incentive is there, things happen and interest gets lost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said when 1.0 comes out it might be a good idea for squad to take a look at some of the best mods out there, Sarbian Mechjeb is certainly one that should get a look, and buy the rights from each perspective modder. Then release them as DLCs and not only pay the modder for the rights to the mod but also give them money for each download. It also could be better for this community because people would release better mods hoping that squad will buy and maintain it so squad will buy it. I don\u0027t have alot of money but I have also had countless hours of fun and enjoyment because of many modders out there. If one day they were to become paid mods I feel that even if its just to support the people who have made this game amazing for me I would buy the DLC. Because the modders have been basically beta testing their mods just like squad has for the last 4 years. So it seems only fair. Would I like having to pay? definitely not. Would I? Hell yes because having been a part of this community for almost two years now, I know the hard work that goes into everything and you guys deserve it. I also think that there are alot of awesome modders out there who have been hiding a lot of their best stuff or have left the community due to loss of interest. So they mod for themselves. If there was a cost incentive we might truly see some amazing mods come out or get revived.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T16:33:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t mind being paid for my mods. If I could devote 8 hours a day on just that and work it for a living I\u0027d be able to make much higher quality mods and still have time to play. Not only that I\u0027d have time to support my mods too. I\u0027d love to work from home selling mods. I\u0027ve always had a knack for finding the things people like to see. One of my first mods was long ago for Dungeon Siege (if you recall that... good for you) where I made weapon packs including some Lord of the Rings weapons. Sadly im not the owner of the Skyrim version of that pack. Hearing that skyrim mods can be sold I may go back to work on my wheel weapon mod. Here in Kerbal Space Program I have Stanford Torus and Civilian Management, both are fairly popular mods. Civilian Management could have been worth $12000 last I checked on its download count assuming it went for $0.99 like most iphone apps. Even if squad takes 60/40 for that I could have had $5000 for it. If I made money like that from a mod I\u0027d have much more incentive to work on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like I have a lack of support for my Civilian Population mod because I don\u0027t get much free time for that. Truth be told on that one I\u0027ve been waiting for 1.0 to do another update. If I can make steady income off mods then I can have time to support them properly. I\u0027ll definitely be updating my mods for 1.0 (I finally made the kraken killer for Stanford Torus) but that will take my free time next week. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI doubt I would have had the popularity in my mods if they were pay to play that I do now. I notice this with most gamers is they\u0027re rather... frugal when it comes to paying for in-game things. I\u0027d agree with that sentiment. I was actually disgusted yesterday while waiting in line at a restaurant. These kids were playing a frogger clone on their iphone. Every time their frog died there was an Ad for $4.99 in-game purchase. If I saw that I\u0027d take the game away. I\u0027d hate to feel that game mods are going the same way but it makes sense from a business standpoint. Make a Madoka Magicka mod for Skyrim... get 100,000 downloads. Bethesda goes \u0022hey.. that could have been $100,000 profit that we didn\u0027t get!\u0022 Modder goes \u0022hey i made the mod I want a cut of that\u0022. Bethesda then goes \u0022sure... we get 50%, steam gets 30% for hosting it, and you get 20%\u0022. All invested parties win, players have no trouble dropping 99c on a mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point it becomes this question: should someone be allowed to live off modding games?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me if a mod is good enough I\u0027d pay for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as KSP goes though... a lot of mods for it wouldn\u0027t exist without certain framework mods. These mods are only useful so long as the remain free and easy to license (Creative Commons makes that easy). My CivPop mod wouldn\u0027t work as well as it does if I had to use my own code for it.. at least not quickly.
