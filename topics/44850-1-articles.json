I wanted to post some ideas from me.. because I translate the text first into English I hope you will excuse some typing errors and hopefully understand what I write her.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.. I have ideas for a lot of things... for example ideas for the tech tree or mining and resources which fit the Kerbal style I think... so I try to arrange them in categories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EThe Kerbals and Aliens\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the more your Kerbal come near the sun the more the helmet disc will get darker...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E =\u0026gt;for example... one the nearest planet to the sun in the system which is the hottest and ____brightes for the Kerbals, the disc will be black and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- when the Kerbals are alone for a while they will go to another Kerbal and start to talk or play football one mun, or jump around as they want. Or they lay down an look to the stars or the sun. O r they shoot at each other with the wapons I discribe below. Or he use a rover and explore environment. or.. or.. or..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I think it is a good idea to control the kerbals from above with the mouse and a point and click system addition to the usual EVE control system. So you can do more things with more Kerbals and you had a better overview... its well suited for planets I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Kerbals can freeze or sweat... or even burn after a while on the hottest planet in the system.. or freeze to death on the coldest\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- individual design for the space suites\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- as more Kerbals you send in the space or let them work for you as more families went near the KSP base and build a little village.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- we can listen to some small talk sometime from our Kerbals in space... something stupid I think. Only with several Kerbs in the near.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbals need food... so that they can not stay as long as the player wants in space without some precautions. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__=\u0026gt; without food they will work a few days. after this they will not die but ignore your ____commands or sabotage your ship until thy get food ( Why they will sabotage your ship in ____the middle of the universe? because they are stupid... some more some less^^)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E____so can the stupidity gain in importance in the selection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__=\u0026gt; with rations they can stay calm in the space for one year (storage module)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__=\u0026gt; and all your expeditions over a year in space and on planets needs an food module or something like that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I would like some extraterrestrial life like flying space sheeps or space whales or a mun mole...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- when kerbals feel sick they become brownish in their faces.. for example in the centrifuges training or rapidly rotate rockets... and they throw themselves up^^ after a short visit in an module the disc is clean again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- physical stress for Kerbals in space at a start or landing and some other things. And they will become unconscious. While this you can not turn to a Kerbal control mode like IVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- psychological stress if they are alone in space... because stupidity is more fun with a gathering of some silly one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__=\u0026gt; one Kerbal alone can\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t stay in space for long as suggestion a few days or weeks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__=\u0026gt; for longer journey you have to take more Kerbals with you as example four for a year up ____to eight for 5 years somehow something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-As more Kerbals die in your expeditions the less Kerbals want to fly whit you or to join your team of idiots^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EKerbal system\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- solar storms.. you have to protect your ships, bases and Kerbals against the storms in the inner Kerbal system (Tech tree required) So that storms and the heat could make it difficult to get the rare resources on the inner planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- planet-specific difficulties like the solar storms or magnetic storm or the cold or the heat... so you have to prepare your mission, your ships and your Kerbals ( better spacesuits) for the planets... here it could be useful to have a research lab and improved technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-micro asteroids that are dangerous for your spaceship they will damage the hull and you need a repair drone or something like that to fix this (Tech Tree) if not... BAM!! (perhaps)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a gas cloud on the edge of this system with a planet inside... the most difficult planet of Kerbal system because you can not see the planet until you reach him... so you have to search... some really rare materials on its surface, perhaps THE rarest recourse in Kerbal system(excluding other star system)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a planet where on side of this planet is every time night ( the planet rotate only one time on his way around the sun)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- some Planets far far away with extraterrestrial life...(the aliens from above) Trading with them perhaps fighting with them but not to death... something like a mud battle in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You need an satellite system for a greater reach in in which you can control you remote guided spaceships. Planets and Moon will slow down your actions so you need a complex system of satellites to send your signal around the planet or moon. behind the moon without deflection satellites your remote guided spaceship is useless for a short time. Really long journeys need Kerbals or perhaps the highest upgrade for your communication center. (and deflector satellites^^) So the satellite could have a sense. They could also scan the planet and its temperature for future missions so you can plan how to make this work...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- you only will know the properties of an planet or moon if you reach them with Kerbals or satellites ( so would have all the science devices an interesting meaning)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- and a resource system with 2 or 3 standard raw materials and some more rare you need for tech research and build better spaceships and so on. So this needs also some mining devices like.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EMining technologies\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EFirst:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E The rare raw materials are distributed throughout the Kerbal system in random principle... so you never know where the Materials are they you need, if you start a new game.

So you can do more things with more Kerbals and you had a better overview... its well suited for planets I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds pretty good to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Kerbals can freeze or sweat... or even burn after a while on the hottest planet in the system.. or freeze to death on the coldest\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat doesnt sound like a good idea to me... space suits have climate automatic in them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- individual design for the space suites\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPolish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- as more Kerbals you send in the space or let them work for you as more families went near the KSP base and build a little village.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf at all: Polish. Furthermore its again a \u0022Sims meets KSP\u0022-Suggestion.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the Kerbals can fall ill with the intelligence disease... so they need help in a certain time. 15 minutes perhaps. Otherwise they will turn in to an alien. (alien ar immune) They will get help in a living part or a hospital part of the base where ever it is. The same for the aliens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-the other way around the Aliens can fell sick with the stupidity decease and will turn into a Kerbal with a other color than green. (Kerbals are immune)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The aliens are the totally contrary to the Kerbals they are intellectually\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I would like some extraterrestrial life like flying space sheeps or space whales or a mun mole...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotally against it. Furthermore i am pretty sure aliens and such is on the \u0022do not suggest list\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- we can listen to some small talk sometime from our Kerbals in space... something stupid I think. Only with several Kerbs in the near.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPolish\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbals need food... so that they can not stay as long as the player wants in space without some precautions. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__=\u0026gt; without food they will work a few days. after this they will not die but ignore your ____commands or sabotage your ship until thy get food ( Why they will sabotage your ship in ____the middle of the universe? because they are stupid... some more some less^^)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E____so can the stupidity gain in importance in the selection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__=\u0026gt; with rations they can stay calm in the space for one year (storage module)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__=\u0026gt; and all your expeditions over a year in space and on planets needs an food module or something like that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell... Life support is a good thing.. but only to some extend: Life support? Yes: Ok, No: Kerbals Dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- when kerbals feel sick they become brownish in their faces.. for example in the centrifuges training or rapidly rotate rockets... and they throw themselves up^^ after a short visit in an module the disc is clean again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPolish... if at all..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- physical stress for Kerbals in space at a start or landing and some other things. And they will become unconscious. While this you can not turn to a Kerbal control mode like IVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- psychological stress if they are alone in space... because stupidity is more fun with a gathering of some silly one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__=\u0026gt; one Kerbal alone can\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t stay in space for long as suggestion a few days or weeks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__=\u0026gt; for longer journey you have to take more Kerbals with you as example four for a year up ____to eight for 5 years somehow something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPolish... if at all.. Maybe Kerbals can easily sustain 30g? Life 100 years and so on and so on..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- solar storms.. you have to protect your ships, bases and Kerbals against the storms in the inner Kerbal system (Tech tree required) So that storms and the heat could make it difficult to get the rare resources on the inner planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell... interestering though.. but i dont think this is going to happen. I smell too much \u0022random\u0022 there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- planet-specific difficulties like the solar storms or magnetic storm or the cold or the heat... so you have to prepare your mission, your ships and your Kerbals ( better spacesuits) for the planets... here it could be useful to have a research lab and improved technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell.. this is a nice idea actually.. better aircondition for eva on moho... and cold insulation for Eeloo... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-micro asteroids that are dangerous for your spaceship they will damage the hull and you need a repair drone or something like that to fix this (Tech Tree) if not... BAM!! (perhaps)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain: I smell too much random annoyance...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a gas cloud on the edge of this system with a planet inside... the most difficult planet of Kerbal system because you can not see the planet until you reach him... so you have to search... some really rare materials on its surface, perhaps THE rarest recourse in Kerbal system(excluding other star system) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfaik such a gas cloud would be impossible in real life as it had to be dense enough to form yet a planet by itself (take jupiter, saturn and uranus as example... do you \u0022see\u0022 them or just a cloud surrounding the core (if there is one))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a planet where on side of this planet is every time night ( the planet rotate only one time on his way around the sun)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA tidally locked planet would be interestering.. at the most. You would have daylight all \u0022day\u0022 one side, night on the opposite.. If i remember correctly Mun was once tidally locked but is now rotating...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- some Planets far far away with extraterrestrial life...(the aliens from above) Trading with them perhaps fighting with them but not to death... something like a mud battle in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope. There wont be any aliens ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You need an satellite system for a greater reach ....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds interestering. Built in RemoteTech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- you only will know the properties of an planet or moon if you reach them with Kerbals or satellites ( so would have all the science devices an interesting meaning)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes. I totally think this is a good idea. Just like BARIS worked (And therefore i would think this is going to happen). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- and a resource system with 2 or 3 standard raw materials and some more rare you need for tech research and build better spaceships and so on. So this needs also some mining devices like.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is already planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMining technologies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... already planned ... But explosives wont happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeapons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis wont ever happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnology for research\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- teleporter to connect some bases on the same planet ( only on one planet ) so that the kerbal visit each other or to support the mining system with kerbal. Requires a social life for Kerbals...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope not.. that would totally be against the main idea of building rockets... also - if you want social life play sims or go out \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- stronger and bigger ion drive (5Kn perhaps) ... this thing that runs with Xenon gas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell.. as the drives are modelled somewhat realistic i wouldnt expect this to ever come...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame technically\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- damage indicator for ships and so on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou already have a damage indicator: if its broken its gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- weight display throughout the creating of ship. If you know how heavy your ship is you can better \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadjust your fuel tanks and engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood idea... and already planned afaik.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- smoke during the launch process from Kerbal if the rocket start the engines I miss the smoke down on the sides from launch pad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPolish\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the possibility to create a bigger surface with the structural panel only with a mouse click and a pull of the mouse. like the mouse in \u0022windows\u0022 if you want to connect several things together\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural surfaces would be good..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- pieces of metal from a broken rocket should not swim on the surface of water, but its Kerbal world... all is possible^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not? This is not exactly impossible...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the maneuver point should stop counting forward after you miss him and start to count again after a short time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo... because maneuvers dont work like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a file system in which you have a better overview over your created spaceships. like create folder under the standard stock folder and then save your ship in them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this will come with subassambles.. but not sure here...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- and bigger and smaller wings, also more variation of peaks but I will thrust you with the variety of parts in future version of this great game... a whole solar-system to explore and play in it. \u0022Great idea\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore parts is on the \u0022Do not suggest list\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026amp;tl;dr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have removed some suggestiosn which are not really discussion worthy (sounds a bit rude, but it is as simple as that). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPLease, i see that you have pretty much no idea of whats going on in KSP development or addon development, have a look at the mods and the discussions on further versions.
