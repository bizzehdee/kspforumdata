Expect my old bases keep disappearing! Along with my flag from my first landing. The tracking station appears to not be able to find them either. If I hit \u0022end mission\u0022 do things disappear? Perhaps they\u0027re still down there but I just can\u0027t find them. Quite a challenge without the tracking station being able to show me where they are. Either that or I\u0027m doing something wrong by hitting end mission? Or something else even!
