It will go up in segments, 12 making up one ring, with the option of adding further rings to the structure later. Each segment is based on one of the big Lack Luster Labs 4x2 habitation modules, which means each segment is roughly 4m by 2m by 5m or so. They\u0027re not excessively heavy, as such. However, I use Ferram\u0027s Aerospace Research, which means that I can\u0027t just strap it to a sufficiently sized rocket and blast off and be done like in stock - I need to loft it with something a bit more aerodynamic! However, no cargo hold or fairing that I\u0027m aware will actually fit around the fairly huge ring segments I ended up with. I want to target it for a 150 km equatorial orbit, but I\u0027d be perfectly happy to just get them up and stable so I could use an orbital tug to boost them up all the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I\u0027m considering if there is a way I could build some sort of fairing for it?

This comes with a selection of fairing parts of 3 different diameters so you can build your own around your payload, as well as some very nice fuel tanks and engines to lift everything with. I think the largest fairing is 3.75m diameter and there\u0027s only so long you can make them, so if your load is really blocky they won\u0027t help you that much. However, they work wonders on things that will fit inside them if you\u0027re using FAR.
