After Hours of Tutorials and Trial \u0026 Error I just can\u0027t get my spaceplane to reach space. I\u0027ve been ajusting and tweaking things to the point that I got into Orbit and landed 1 time. I didn\u0027t change much and now there is no way I will get above 14km. And I seem to experience some bugs? (When I lower the engines just a little I won\u0027t get any thrust when starting). \n\nThe latest configuration is this:\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/3p6otTq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3p6otTq.jpg)\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/B2gKATg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/B2gKATg.jpg)\n\nI goes up to about 100m/s (thats about takeoff velocity usually) and then just veers to the left or the right (yes SAS is always ON) and you know the usual explosions happen.\n\nI just want to save some poor Kerbals from space, i don\u0027t even have a cargohold on this thing, so can someone please tell me what I\u0027m doing wrong?\n\nThank you."},{"CreatedByName":"funk","CreatedById":118840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T02:30:00Z","Content":"It\u0027s hard to say if there are more than one issue, but the first one I see is that your jets thrust is colliding with the swept wings. You can check this with pressing F3 in flight. If it shows something like \u0022wing was damaged by engine exhaust\u0022, this might be the cause for your thrust problems at start and also affecting the true thrust in flight."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T03:34:11Z","Content":"Your engine thrust is hitting your tail, you don\u0027t have any pitch control surfaces, plus the short fuselage and rearwards weight bias are going to totally overwhelm your smallish vertical stabiliser. You\u0027re also probably having wingflex-induced wiggles in your landing gear during takeoff, and all those unnecessary radial intakes are causing masses of drag.\n\nSee the first few posts in the ***Kerbodyne*** thread linked below for design tips."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T14:18:13Z","Content":"Also [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111541-Thinking-about-making-the-switch-to-FAR) might help, it\u0027s still active despite being tagged as answered."},{"CreatedByName":"Has0r van Nad0r","CreatedById":140174,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T02:19:34Z","Content":"Thanks a lot you guys!
