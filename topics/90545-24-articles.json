I\u0027m going to put the \u00221.0\u0022 stamp on it sooner or later, but at this point I might wait for KSP\u0027s Unity 5 conversion, since I\u0027m not sure what that will do to the mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not planning any major changes or overhauls for this mod at this point. I still have a few things written on my list as \u0022maybe\u0022 items, such as extra long ladders, and super heavy landing legs. But what I\u0027m realizing is that some of those things might be better suited to other mod packs. I could see making a leg pack, a ladder pack, a command pod pack, etc. One thing I\u0027ve learned is that it\u0027s easier to get people to like and use your mod when it\u0027s more specific in focus, and doesn\u0027t contain 100\u002B parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m keeping in mind what this mod\u0027s original stated purpose was: To be similar to the KSP 0.23.5 \u0022ARM\u0022 pack, just at the next size up. That is, to provide one larger diameter of rocket parts, but also to flesh out that diameter (and the missing 3.75m corresponding parts), so that it\u0027s useful. That means reaction wheels, probe cores, and docking ports, and larger RCS/OMS pods, and some beefy SRB options too. We\u0027re basically there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, the SRBs are part of what prompted me to make this. I always felt the stock SRBs were a bit anemic. I balanced these against the NASA \u0022kickback\u0022 SRB, in terms of propellant density, ISP, and cost. But made the TWR much more favorable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, this mod is more about getting off the ground with big rocket parts, than anything else. But that doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027ll stop there, since more mod packs can always happen. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JedTech\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JedTech\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe large unmanned Command rings are really big.

Stock KSP gives us two main ways to animate engine glow, \u0022FXModuleAnimateThrottle\u0022 and \u0022ModuleAnimateHeat\u0022. The throttle-based one exists for the ion engine. Since it has a \u0022response speed\u0022 variable in it, it\u0027s possible to use this to get the glow animation to behave more like the pre-1.0 engine glows we were used to. That is, the glow will slowly rise as the engine runs, and slowly taper off when you cut the engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe caveat is that it would no longer be tied to temperature at all, so the maximum glow brightness would always be dependent on throttle and nothing else.
