While the moon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface reaches 130 degrees C in direct sunlight at the equator (266 degrees F), when the sun \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153goes down\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 on the moon, the temperature drops almost immediately, and plunges in several hours down to minus 110 degrees C (-166F).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the moon is virtually the same distance from the sun as we are, it is reasonable to ask why at night the Earth doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get as cold as the moon. The answer is that, unlike the Earth, the moon has no water vapour or other greenhouse gases, because of course it has no atmosphere at all. Without our protective atmosphere and the greenhouse effect, the Earth would be as barren as our lifeless moon; without the heat trapped overnight in the atmosphere (and in the ground and oceans) our nights would be so cold that few plants or animals could survive even a single one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis seems to me to be a flawed argument. One could argue the reason the moon gets so hot during the day and cold during the night is not because it has no greenhouse effect, but because it has no atmosphere. The atmosphere, through convection, dampens temperature swings, and if there is water content in the air, it can rapidly slow cooling if dew point is reached. In dry climates, such as desert, the temperature swings are much larger, since there is no water vapor to slow cooling at night or foliage to absorb the sun\u0027s rays.

Its called dynamic equilibrium and you have to think that carbon dioxide increases the complexity of subvisible radiation absorption and thus changes the equilibrium, simple as that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine you are in a room and there is a door. In this system you can go many directions but as soon as you begin in the direction of the door inevitably you go outside. That is the fate of vibrational energy on the surface of the moon. Once it reaches a IR frequency that directed to space, its gone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow imagine the same room but in the path of the door going out are N circus hoops you need to jump through each time you hesitate a little to jump the next hoop. Once you start heading in the direction of the door you will go out, but stuff will interact, you will slow down, you might have a different direction, momentum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVibrational energy here on the earth can vibrate air, it can induce state change (water to vapor), it can then radiate, and be recaptured (many gases with many absorption lines) and so on. A cyclone for instance, takes vibrational energy in water, the wind and turbulation helps get the energy into vapor, it travels up close to the eye of the cyclone, at the top it releases its radiation into space and thin-air above, the resulting water droplets that form fall back to earth. The latent energy in the water drives the engine. But the energy is trapped in the water because suppressed evaporation and radiation (water being semi-transparent absorbs light more deeply but is neither fluorescent or phosphorescent) rates at the surface, so the cyclone is another very complex way for energy to get out of the system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radiation that comes from the sun is both visible and UV, but once it hits earth and is not reflected it is converted into vibrational energy and eventually converted to microwave and infrared radiation. So any gas added to the air that can absorb radiation, heat up, and release it at a lower frequency filling in a gap that is not already present in N2, O2, H2O and argon, will have the effect of raising air temperature. Eventually the radiation reaches the upper atmosphere with gases at -70\u0027C or so, and alot of radiation occurs but at much lower frequency than the rocks here on earth, and the radiation has to trickle up through a waterfall of obstacles to get out. It keeps the ground warm at night, and gives the ground someplace to send its wobbles to in the morning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t trouble yourself too much with global warming, we learned yesterday that in 100 billion years there will be no radiation left in the Universe for carbon dioxide to trap. Since we will all be dead by then anyway (Run-a-way greenhouse caused by sun going red-giant), not necessary to fret about global warming.

But you\u0027re right, the dampening has nothing to do with the greenhouse effect.\u003Cp\u003EAgain, that article is very poorly worded. What they mean is that when you look at the spectrum of the earth in infrared you don\u0027t see a perfect black body.

There are all sorts of gaps and valleys in the emission. This is where greenhouse gasses come in. These gasses absorb those spectra of light and scatter them. Because the energy keeps getting scattered the radiation only leaks out of the atmosphere very slowly. That\u0027s what\u0027s causing all those gaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what happens is that visible light from the sun comes down through the atmosphere. Hits the surface and gets converted into heat. Then the heat gets radiated as infrared, but because the atmosphere is opaque to infrared the heat can\u0027t escape. The more CO2 and water vapor the more opaque the atmosphere and the slower the heat escapes the atmosphere. And thus the higher the temperature on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes. They detect more CO2 in the air and they see the valleys in the spectra due to CO2 and methane deepening. Water gets out of the atmosphere pretty quickly. All the water we inject by burning fossil fuels rains down pretty quickly.

The overwhelming majority of solar energy is electromagnetic radiation, not charged particles, so the heat hitting earth from the sun is pretty much uniform over the entire disc of the earth. The poles heat up less because of the angle the energy hits at, it has to pass through more atmosphere to reach the surface, and then when it hits the surface, one square metre of disc is projected over a larger area of surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is compounded by the fact that frozen water has a high albedo, reflecting more of the energy back into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are right in that the earth has a higher albedo than the moon.

Its called dynamic equilibrium and you have to think that carbon dioxide increases the complexity of subvisible radiation absorption and thus changes the equilibrium, simple as that.\u003Cp\u003EImagine you are in a room and there is a door. In this system you can go many directions but as soon as you begin in the direction of the door inevitably you go outside. That is the fate of vibrational energy on the surface of the moon. Once it reaches a IR frequency that directed to space, its gone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow imagine the same room but in the path of the door going out are N circus hoops you need to jump through each time you hesitate a little to jump the next hoop. Once you start heading in the direction of the door you will go out, but stuff will interact, you will slow down, you might have a different direction, momentum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVibrational energy here on the earth can vibrate air, it can induce state change (water to vapor), it can then radiate, and be recaptured (many gases with many absorption lines) and so on. A cyclone for instance, takes vibrational energy in water, the wind and turbulation helps get the energy into vapor, it travels up close to the eye of the cyclone, at the top it releases its radiation into space and thin-air above, the resulting water droplets that form fall back to earth. The latent energy in the water drives the engine. But the energy is trapped in the water because suppressed evaporation and radiation (water being semi-transparent absorbs light more deeply but is neither fluorescent or phosphorescent) rates at the surface, so the cyclone is another very complex way for energy to get out of the system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radiation that comes from the sun is both visible and UV, but once it hits earth and is not reflected it is converted into vibrational energy and eventually converted to microwave and infrared radiation. So any gas added to the air that can absorb radiation, heat up, and release it at a lower frequency filling in a gap that is not already present in N2, O2, H2O and argon, will have the effect of raising air temperature. Eventually the radiation reaches the upper atmosphere with gases at -70\u0027C or so, and alot of radiation occurs but at much lower frequency than the rocks here on earth, and the radiation has to trickle up through a waterfall of obstacles to get out. It keeps the ground warm at night, and gives the ground someplace to send its wobbles to in the morning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t trouble yourself too much with global warming, we learned yesterday that in 100 billion years there will be no radiation left in the Universe for carbon dioxide to trap.

There are all sorts of gaps and valleys in the emission. This is where greenhouse gasses come in. These gasses absorb those spectra of light and scatter them. Because the energy keeps getting scattered the radiation only leaks out of the atmosphere very slowly. That\u0027s what\u0027s causing all those gaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what happens is that visible light from the sun comes down through the atmosphere. Hits the surface and gets converted into heat. Then the heat gets radiated as infrared, but because the atmosphere is opaque to infrared the heat can\u0027t escape. The more CO2 and water vapor the more opaque the atmosphere and the slower the heat escapes the atmosphere. And thus the higher the temperature on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes. They detect more CO2 in the air and they see the valleys in the spectra due to CO2 and methane deepening. Water gets out of the atmosphere pretty quickly.

One could argue the reason the moon gets so hot during the day and cold during the night is not because it has no greenhouse effect, but because it has no atmosphere. The atmosphere, through convection, dampens temperature swings, and if there is water content in the air, it can rapidly slow cooling if dew point is reached. In dry climates, such as desert, the temperature swings are much larger, since there is no water vapor to slow cooling at night or foliage to absorb the sun\u0027s rays.

Changes in particular gas concetntration do not affect wavelengths outside these bands\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The most change of the actual transmittance with change of particular gas mount is along the edges of the absorption bands, when the radiation gets partially absorbed.

Gases mostly emit at the wavelengths they absorb (and the intensity is proportional to the absorbtion coefficient)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) So, the atmosphere radiates into space.

Half of that is emitted downwards, and with the radiation emitted at low altitudes it\u0027s much higher chance to reach the surface than to reach space.
