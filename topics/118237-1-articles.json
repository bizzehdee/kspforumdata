While the moon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface reaches 130 degrees C in direct sunlight at the equator (266 degrees F), when the sun \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153goes down\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 on the moon, the temperature drops almost immediately, and plunges in several hours down to minus 110 degrees C (-166F).\n\u003E \n\u003E Since the moon is virtually the same distance from the sun as we are, it is reasonable to ask why at night the Earth doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get as cold as the moon. The answer is that, unlike the Earth, the moon has no water vapour or other greenhouse gases, because of course it has no atmosphere at all. Without our protective atmosphere and the greenhouse effect, the Earth would be as barren as our lifeless moon; without the heat trapped overnight in the atmosphere (and in the ground and oceans) our nights would be so cold that few plants or animals could survive even a single one.\n\nThis seems to me to be a flawed argument. One could argue the reason the moon gets so hot during the day and cold during the night is not because it has no greenhouse effect, but because it has no atmosphere. The atmosphere, through convection, dampens temperature swings, and if there is water content in the air, it can rapidly slow cooling if dew point is reached. In dry climates, such as desert, the temperature swings are much larger, since there is no water vapor to slow cooling at night or foliage to absorb the sun\u0027s rays. It doesnt necessarily have anything to do with a greenhouse effect i.e. preventing IR radiation from reaching space, but rather, in dampening temperature swings.\n\nThe fact that earth is 33C warmer than it would be (on average) without an atmosphere IS evidence of the greenhouse effect.\n\n\u003E The most conclusive evidence for the greenhouse effect \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and the role CO2 plays \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 can be seen in data from the surface and from satellites. By comparing the Sun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s heat reaching the Earth with the heat leaving it, we can see that less long-wave radiation (heat) is leaving than arriving\n\nWhy shouldnt this be the case? It is actually a requirement of the Planck distribution that at higher temperatures, the intensity at **every** wavelength is higher (not just the that the peak intensity is higher)\n\n![bbrc1b.gif](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/imgmod/bbrc1b.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E (and since the 1970s, that less and less radiation is leaving the Earth, as CO2 and equivalents build up). Since all radiation is measured by its wavelength, we can also see that the frequencies being trapped in the atmosphere are the same frequencies absorbed by greenhouse gases.\n\nTo me, this seems more important than the first part (not sure why it is in parentheses)?\n\nAre they saying that they observed the wavelengths emitted in 1970 and now, and can see noticeable attenuation in the wavelengths absorbed by greenhouse gasses (presumably CO2, methane etc... but **not** water)?"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T22:39:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This seems to me to be a flawed argument.

What they mean is that when you look at the spectrum of the earth in infrared you don\u0027t see a perfect black body. You see this:\n\n![PettyFig8-2.jpg](http://i165.photobucket.com/albums/u43/gplracerx/PettyFig8-2.jpg)\n\nAs you can see the spectrum doesn\u0027t follow the perfect black body radiator. There are all sorts of gaps and valleys in the emission. This is where greenhouse gasses come in. These gasses absorb those spectra of light and scatter them. Because the energy keeps getting scattered the radiation only leaks out of the atmosphere very slowly. That\u0027s what\u0027s causing all those gaps.\n\nSo what happens is that visible light from the sun comes down through the atmosphere. Hits the surface and gets converted into heat. Then the heat gets radiated as infrared, but because the atmosphere is opaque to infrared the heat can\u0027t escape.

In fact the moon temperatures are also wrong.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Not sure what you mean here. Add 1 bar to current atmosphere (i.e. with O2, N2, CO2 etc... in current proportions?) Then, yes, adding more mass of non-greenhosue gasses wont raise average temperature, but will dampen temperature swings in a given location.\n\nLets make an exercise, imagine that the moon has the same material than earth in all its surface.\n\nThis mean the same albedo and thermal mass.\n\nIf they rotate at the same speed then both would have the same average temperatures.\n\nBy average I mean in each location of the whole sphere over the whole day.\n\nNow.. lets add an atmosphere to one of them (I guess the pressure does not matter if they have not greenhouse gases, which is hard because all gases trap a little bit of IR always), then in theory they should have the same average temperature even if now one has an atmosphere. \n\nIn fact [the moon](http://www.space.com/18175-moon-temperature.html) has 123 C on the day side and minus 153 C at the night side. Which is close to those -33 degree (earth average temperature= 16c) that the earth should have without greenhouse gases.\n\nAnd if we add the albedo of the moon, then it has more sense.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T23:31:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 11:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AngelLestat**"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T23:48:46Z","Content":"I\u0027m going to take a different approach... our poles are like magnets, it produces the van Allen radiation belt.\n\nThis means that most of the heat will be getting in through the poles, there is ice there, which reflects the heat back into space... the oceans, get hot, but cool down when the water is at the poles...\n\nThey call the poles the refrigerator of the Earth..

Its called dynamic equilibrium and you have to think that carbon dioxide increases the complexity of subvisible radiation absorption and thus changes the equilibrium, simple as that.\n\nImagine you are in a room and there is a door. In this system you can go many directions but as soon as you begin in the direction of the door inevitably you go outside. That is the fate of vibrational energy on the surface of the moon. Once it reaches a IR frequency that directed to space, its gone. \n\nNow imagine the same room but in the path of the door going out are N circus hoops you need to jump through each time you hesitate a little to jump the next hoop. Once you start heading in the direction of the door you will go out, but stuff will interact, you will slow down, you might have a different direction, momentum. \n\nVibrational energy here on the earth can vibrate air, it can induce state change (water to vapor), it can then radiate, and be recaptured (many gases with many absorption lines) and so on. A cyclone for instance, takes vibrational energy in water, the wind and turbulation helps get the energy into vapor, it travels up close to the eye of the cyclone, at the top it releases its radiation into space and thin-air above, the resulting water droplets that form fall back to earth. The latent energy in the water drives the engine. But the energy is trapped in the water because suppressed evaporation and radiation (water being semi-transparent absorbs light more deeply but is neither fluorescent or phosphorescent) rates at the surface, so the cyclone is another very complex way for energy to get out of the system. \n\nThe radiation that comes from the sun is both visible and UV, but once it hits earth and is not reflected it is converted into vibrational energy and eventually converted to microwave and infrared radiation. So any gas added to the air that can absorb radiation, heat up, and release it at a lower frequency filling in a gap that is not already present in N2, O2, H2O and argon, will have the effect of raising air temperature. Eventually the radiation reaches the upper atmosphere with gases at -70\u0027C or so, and alot of radiation occurs but at much lower frequency than the rocks here on earth, and the radiation has to trickle up through a waterfall of obstacles to get out. It keeps the ground warm at night, and gives the ground someplace to send its wobbles to in the morning. \n\nDon\u0027t trouble yourself too much with global warming, we learned yesterday that in 100 billion years there will be no radiation left in the Universe for carbon dioxide to trap. Since we will all be dead by then anyway (Run-a-way greenhouse caused by sun going red-giant), not necessary to fret about global warming.

The overwhelming majority of solar energy is electromagnetic radiation, not charged particles, so the heat hitting earth from the sun is pretty much uniform over the entire disc of the earth. The poles heat up less because of the angle the energy hits at, it has to pass through more atmosphere to reach the surface, and then when it hits the surface, one square metre of disc is projected over a larger area of surface.\n\nThis is compounded by the fact that frozen water has a high albedo, reflecting more of the energy back into space.\n\nYou are right in that the earth has a higher albedo than the moon.

Ask via PM for more explanation on these.\n\n1. Blackbody radiation spectrum profile is governed by Planck\u0027s equation, which he have gracefully derived out of a lot of things.\n\n2. No object in this Universe is a perfect black body.\n\n3. Albedo (or, in reverse, transmittance, or if you prefer, optical depth), varies over the whole EM spectrum.\n\n----------\n\nNow, let\u0027s get started.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Effect (my preferred naming for it), or as most people like to name it [Greenhouse Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect), is a term that is used to explain these phenomena :\n\n- Gas(es) are [available on top of Earth\u0027s surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth).\n\n- Any atoms will absorb some EM radiation (resulting in [these things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_spectroscopy#Absorption_spectrum)), that differs at most by difference in electron configuration and at longer wavelength by molecular arrangement, that results in increased albedo (in revere, reduced transmittance) of that particular EM spectrum. Even larger than a molecule particles causes scattering and dispersion, which contributes to that. In the interest of explaining Greenhouse Gas Effect, some gas are absorbing [heat rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared).\n\n- Absorption of heat rays, will induce increased emitance of said heat rays of that particle, or organization of matter; this results in a lengthened \u0027stay time\u0027 of said heat rays, creating increased temperature of both elements, for a time.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Effect DO have good effects (I\u0027ll just quote previous posters) :\n\nThe problem, now, is these facts :\n\n- The Sun is still shining at Earth.\n\n- These \u0027Greenhouse Gases\u0027 are present on Earth, mostly in the form of CO2, CH4, or H2O. ([proof for slight neutrality of O2 \u0026 O3](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z0099m2A1dI/Un9NrLLKIZI/AAAAAAAAAtU/oYmZOjynqPk/s1600/spectra.png), [proof of CH4, CO2 and H2O contribution](http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/kiang_01/ExtrasolarFig2.gif), proof of N2 neutrality isn\u0027t available, sorry for that)\n\n- These \u0027Greenhouse Gases\u0027 [does not leave the Earth, least to space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Dominant_atmospheric_escape_and_loss_processes_on_Earth).

Its called dynamic equilibrium and you have to think that carbon dioxide increases the complexity of subvisible radiation absorption and thus changes the equilibrium, simple as that.\n\u003E Imagine you are in a room and there is a door. In this system you can go many directions but as soon as you begin in the direction of the door inevitably you go outside. That is the fate of vibrational energy on the surface of the moon. Once it reaches a IR frequency that directed to space, its gone. \n\u003E \n\u003E Now imagine the same room but in the path of the door going out are N circus hoops you need to jump through each time you hesitate a little to jump the next hoop. Once you start heading in the direction of the door you will go out, but stuff will interact, you will slow down, you might have a different direction, momentum. \n\u003E \n\u003E Vibrational energy here on the earth can vibrate air, it can induce state change (water to vapor), it can then radiate, and be recaptured (many gases with many absorption lines) and so on. A cyclone for instance, takes vibrational energy in water, the wind and turbulation helps get the energy into vapor, it travels up close to the eye of the cyclone, at the top it releases its radiation into space and thin-air above, the resulting water droplets that form fall back to earth. The latent energy in the water drives the engine. But the energy is trapped in the water because suppressed evaporation and radiation (water being semi-transparent absorbs light more deeply but is neither fluorescent or phosphorescent) rates at the surface, so the cyclone is another very complex way for energy to get out of the system. \n\u003E \n\u003E The radiation that comes from the sun is both visible and UV, but once it hits earth and is not reflected it is converted into vibrational energy and eventually converted to microwave and infrared radiation. So any gas added to the air that can absorb radiation, heat up, and release it at a lower frequency filling in a gap that is not already present in N2, O2, H2O and argon, will have the effect of raising air temperature. Eventually the radiation reaches the upper atmosphere with gases at -70\u0027C or so, and alot of radiation occurs but at much lower frequency than the rocks here on earth, and the radiation has to trickle up through a waterfall of obstacles to get out. It keeps the ground warm at night, and gives the ground someplace to send its wobbles to in the morning. \n\u003E \n\u003E Don\u0027t trouble yourself too much with global warming, we learned yesterday that in 100 billion years there will be no radiation left in the Universe for carbon dioxide to trap. Since we will all be dead by then anyway (Run-a-way greenhouse caused by sun going red-giant), not necessary to fret about global warming. Have I caught the intent of your post wrong?\n\nI dont see how this example is any simpler than just directly explaining what is actually happening...\n\nI also dont see what question you are answering. It seems like you read the thread title and are trying to explain greenhouse gas effect in general, not having read the OP...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s just a normal site, its not managed by any organization, you may find it first in your searchs because that site is ready to deal with keyword usually made by people who try to find counter arguments against climate change. (is a clever idea, but they need better data and arguments)\n\u003E \n\u003E But it does not mean is the best site to look for real data.. In fact the moon temperatures are also wrong.\n\nGood to know... what is a better site to use? \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Lets make an exercise, imagine that the moon has the same material than earth in all its surface.\n\u003E \n\u003E This mean the same albedo and thermal mass.\n\u003E \n\u003E If they rotate at the same speed then both would have the same average temperatures.\n\u003E \n\u003E By average I mean in each location of the whole sphere over the whole day.\n\n\u003E Now.. lets add an atmosphere to one of them (I guess the pressure does not matter if they have not greenhouse gases, which is hard because all gases trap a little bit of IR always), then in theory they should have the same average temperature even if now one has an atmosphere.\n\nWhy? I would argue the atmosphere would give the surface more thermal mass and convective cooling, and would dampen temperature swings somewhat...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Again, that article is very poorly worded. What they mean is that when you look at the spectrum of the earth in infrared you don\u0027t see a perfect black body. You see this:\n\u003E [http://i165.photobucket.com/albums/u43/gplracerx/PettyFig8-2.jpg](http://i165.photobucket.com/albums/u43/gplracerx/PettyFig8-2.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E As you can see the spectrum doesn\u0027t follow the perfect black body radiator. There are all sorts of gaps and valleys in the emission. This is where greenhouse gasses come in. These gasses absorb those spectra of light and scatter them. Because the energy keeps getting scattered the radiation only leaks out of the atmosphere very slowly. That\u0027s what\u0027s causing all those gaps.\n\u003E \n\u003E So what happens is that visible light from the sun comes down through the atmosphere. Hits the surface and gets converted into heat. Then the heat gets radiated as infrared, but because the atmosphere is opaque to infrared the heat can\u0027t escape. The more CO2 and water vapor the more opaque the atmosphere and the slower the heat escapes the atmosphere. And thus the higher the temperature on the surface.\n\u003E \n\u003E Yes. They detect more CO2 in the air and they see the valleys in the spectra due to CO2 and methane deepening. Water gets out of the atmosphere pretty quickly. All the water we inject by burning fossil fuels rains down pretty quickly. So we don\u0027t see any increase in the greenhouse effect due to water.\n\nThanks for the graphs. \n\nDo these graphs show the valleys and spectra deepening? Do you have other graphs that do?\n\nAlso, I assume, that:\n\n(1) when looking up at the atmosphere, we are looking at the intersection of the IR frequencies from the surface and what is absorbed, reflected, and/or scattered by the atmosphere and what is emitted by the atmosphere (since nothing is coming from space)?\n\n(2) when looking down at the land, we see what is emitted from the surface and transmitted through the atmosphere, a fraction of what is emitted from surface and absorbed and then re-emited by the atmosphere, and what is emitted by the atmosphere on its own?"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T13:03:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not sure what question in the OP you are answering? \n\u003E The post isnt about greenhouse effect in general; it was to clarify the arguments made by the source in the OP.\n\nWhoops, thought it\u0027s meant for some extension of your previous thread. But i hope you have the same viewpoint as I do.\n\nNow, I\u0027ll point things out :\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This seems to me to be a flawed argument. One could argue the reason the moon gets so hot during the day and cold during the night is not because it has no greenhouse effect, but because it has no atmosphere. The atmosphere, through convection, dampens temperature swings, and if there is water content in the air, it can rapidly slow cooling if dew point is reached. In dry climates, such as desert, the temperature swings are much larger, since there is no water vapor to slow cooling at night or foliage to absorb the sun\u0027s rays. It doesnt necessarily have anything to do with a greenhouse effect i.e. preventing IR radiation from reaching space, but rather, in dampening temperature swings.\n\nActually, it have more to do with rotation. Ever tried to roast something without ever turning it over ? Compare with a constantly rolling roasted stuff - pretty much the same.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The fact that earth is 33C warmer than it would be (on average) without an atmosphere IS evidence of the greenhouse effect.\n\nHmm... correct AFAIK. It is there wherever an atmosphere exist.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why shouldnt this be the case? It is actually a requirement of the Planck distribution that at higher temperatures, the intensity at every wavelength is higher (not just the that the peak intensity is higher)\n\nMost likely they\u0027re talking of absorption, which is another yes. Though, on total, it got to be the same without any absorption.\n\nThink of\n\nE = (\u00C3\u00C6\u2019((T^4)(R^2)/(d^2)))\\*(r^2) (d = Earth distance to Sun, R= Sun\u0027s radius, r = Earth\u0027s radius, T = sun\u0027s temperature) -\u003E Total received flux from Sun\n\nvs\n\nL = 4\u00C3\u00C6\u2019\u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00AC(t^4)(r^2) (t = Earth\u0027s surface temperature) -\u003E Total emitted flux of Earth\n\n\u003E \n\u003E To me, this seems more important than the first part (not sure why it is in parentheses)?\n\u003E Are they saying that they observed the wavelengths emitted in 1970 and now, and can see noticeable attenuation in the wavelengths absorbed by greenhouse gasses (presumably CO2, methane etc... but not water)?\n\nThis one is covered in my linked graphs.

Gases mostly emit at the wavelengths they absorb (and the intensity is proportional to the absorbtion coefficient)\n\n4) So, the atmosphere radiates into space.

There\u0027s some concentration-dependent shift in the ratio between what gets returned to the surface and what gets emitted to space, but it\u0027s not linear.

As the pressure of the gas is increased, the image of the Kerbal will slowly disappear; however, the image will not be dark. It will change from a picture of a Kerbal to a uniform bright light, since the gas absorbs and emits the light. Thus, while the light from the Kerbal will not reach the other side of the detector, plenty of light will reach the IR camera (it will just be diffuse). \n\nThus, there appears to be a limit on the maximum opacity, since the outer-most layer will always radiate to space (even if the original light waves were absorbed and re-emitted). \n\nHowever, i suppose what causes greenhouse effect is when the outermost layer is very cold (i.e. when the outer most layer is thermally insulated from the surface), such that the amount of radiation leaving the planet is less than would leave if the surface could radiate to space directly.\n\nDoes that sound about right?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Of course on earth the temperature increase is not severe by a small change on co2, but it triggers a chain event releasing more greenhouse gases plus more water.\n\nSee response below regarding positive feedback loops involving water.\n\nAlso, positive feedback is a very dangerous thing. Even small positive feedback, in the absence of any negative ones, can result in exponential growth until saturation. What doesnt make sense to me is how this positive feedback can be strong enough to raise the earth temperature by only a few degrees but not skyrocket the planet towards Venus conditions. \n\nAnd the fact that more heat is radiated at elevated temperatures doesnt help, since the heat is still trapped by the CO2 (it would only help if the temperature increases enough to change the outgoing wavelengths significantly such that CO2 no longer absorbs them). \n\nIn addition, how does one explain this positive feedback, given that millions of years ago, the CO2 concentration in the planet was ~3000 ppm, but the temperature was only ~10 C warmer (i.e. not Venus)? \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Not sure what would be the reflective (albedo) effect on clouds due more water on the atmosphere.\n\nThe water vapor cycle is very stable and has many negative feedbacks to take water out of atmosphere (residence time of water molecule of short).

Plus add the sulfur oxides that should have rather good IR absorption, too.\n\nAs for how to threat very high absorbance cases - here\u0027s my thought:\n\nThere are basically 3 processes of radiative heat exchange. Two of them (surface-atmosphere and atmosphere-space) can be characterized by maximal and minimal effective altitudes, respectively (and direct or low step-count surface-space radiation is significant only if for given wavelength they intersect). Everything inbetween just can be treated as another path of heat-conductance in the atmosphere (besides, since absorption coefficient affects both the intensity and transmission distance for the given wavelength, this conductivity may be similar for all the absorbed wavelengths).\n\nSo, after correction for the direct radiation (such wavelengths would be practically excluded from atmospheric heat exchange) you could integrate these effects and get energy exchange altitude distribution for surface-atmosphere and atmosphere-space radiative exchange (that again can be put in terms of effective altitudes) and the heat conductivity of the atmosphere in-between.\n\nWhat would increase of the greenhouse gas amount do? Besides slightly widening absorbance bands, it\u0027ll change efficient edge altitudes (lower altitude is inversely proportional to it, same with atmosphere amount between higher altitude and space), but effect on the conductivity will be relatively small (again, it works both ways; slight increase due to wider bands, but not compensating for the loss of direct emission path).\n\nFor full model add other heat conductance paths and... \n\nsurface - atmosphere as insulator - radiative outer edge"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T00:17:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The fact that the radiation emitted from the surface is longer wavelength than solar radiation gives one particular effect - most absorption by greenhouse gases happens at these longer wavelengths - that is thermal radiation from the surface is trapped in the atmosphere much stronger tan solar radiation.\n\u003E As for the temperature without greenhouse effect, the recipe is simple: take the average solar radiation received per unit of surface, multiply it by what fraction gets absorbed, then find the temperature at which the same surface material will emit the same power. And even if it\u0027s not blackbody it often gets rather close to blackbody temperature in the same conditions, if there\u0027s no strong specific absorption bands (which are not so strong for most common solid materials, but are in effect for quite a few common atmospheric gases).\n\u003E \n\u003E BTW, found an absorption spectrum of the atmosphere\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://s015.radikal.ru/i333/1508/58/3f2af6214db7.jpg](http://s015.radikal.ru/i333/1508/58/3f2af6214db7.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Now let me explain a bit about the radiation absorption by gases:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1) There are specific absorbtion bands for each gas (which are rather wide for CO2 and H2O), and only these wavelengths are absorbed - therefore you can see some wavelengths for which the atmosphere almost fully transparent and some which are totally absorbed. Changes in particular gas concetntration do not affect wavelengths outside these bands\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) The most change of the actual transmittance with change of particular gas mount is along the edges of the absorption bands, when the radiation gets partially absorbed. Increase in the gas concentration obviously lower the amount of radiation passing through the atmosphere at these wavelengths.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) What happens to the absorbed radiation? The atmosphere heats up. What does it do with this heat? It emits it. At what wavelengths? Gases mostly emit at the wavelengths they absorb (and the intensity is proportional to the absorbtion coefficient)\n\u003E \n\u003E 4) So, the atmosphere radiates into space. But only small fraction of this radiation (at the partially absorbed wavelengths where emission is not wery strong) gets directly into space. the rest will be reabsorbed on the way up. And reemitted...\n\u003E \n\u003E 5) But it doesn\u0027t only emit up! Half of that is emitted downwards, and with the radiation emitted at low altitudes it\u0027s much higher chance to reach the surface than to reach space. And here\u0027s the real greenhouse effect - most of the thermal radiation from the surface is absorbed by the atmosphere and emmited back down to the surface!\n\u003E \n\u003E I once compiled this picture from multiple sources:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://s020.radikal.ru/i701/1508/5d/983b6390ef4a.jpg](http://s020.radikal.ru/i701/1508/5d/983b6390ef4a.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Now... what\u0027s the real effect of change in a particular gas concentration?\n\u003E \n\u003E There are parts of the spectrum that are almost not absorbed no matter the amount of greenhouse gases, and there are parts of the spectrum that will get 100% absorbed near the surface and emitted back even if the amount of CO2 and H2o in the atmosphere gets multiple times lower. There\u0027s some concentration-dependent shift in the ratio between what gets returned to the surface and what gets emitted to space, but it\u0027s not linear. (In fact, for CO2 and H2O it may be logarithmic dependance). \n\u003E \n\u003E On the other hand, appearance of strong absorbtion band in the area not covered by CO2 and H2O (technogenic gases and to some extent NO and CH4) may give a relatively significant effect on the greenhouse effect).\n\u003E \n\u003E However, note that this is the effect of absorbing this large portion of emmitted radiation and it gives just about 30 degrees over what would happen without the greenhouse effect. It seems extremely unlikely that it would change the equilibrium temperature by more than a few degrees by just increasing amounts of CO2 and H2O in the atmosphere several times.\n\u003E \n\u003E On the other hand, its difficult to predict how such a global change would affect local climates...\n\nThanks, it was much as I imagined it had to be, also explains well why deserts are so cold during the night. \n\nCO2 probably has more impact than it looks like because of the upper atmosphere, here its little water vapor and the low pressure make the absorption less than 100% so an increase will increase the absorption."},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T01:56:36Z","Content":"Me again. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E One could argue the reason the moon gets so hot during the day and cold during the night is not because it has no greenhouse effect, but because it has no atmosphere.\n\nBingo. But not for the reasons people expect:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The atmosphere, through convection, dampens temperature swings, and if there is water content in the air, it can rapidly slow cooling if dew point is reached. In dry climates, such as desert, the temperature swings are much larger, since there is no water vapor to slow cooling at night or foliage to absorb the sun\u0027s rays.\n\nThere\u0027s more to it than that. By way of experiment? Step outside on a sunny day and put your hand on the sidewalk. In a non-desert climate such as the one I live in, the **white** sidewalk is uncomfortably hot to the touch--and the asphalt in the street will give you a burn if you put your hand on it for more than a few seconds. But these surfaces are still significantly cooler than the ground in a desert. The surface temperature in a desert is blistering hot during the day, proving that convection alone doesn\u0027t cut it.\n\nThe only thing that keeps the Earth\u0027s surface from reaching the boiling point of water (convection or not!) is the fact that greenhouse gases reflect a fairly large percentage of the Sun\u0027s energy **before** it reaches the surface.

As the pressure of the gas is increased, the image of the Kerbal will slowly disappear; however, the image will not be dark. It will change from a picture of a Kerbal to a uniform bright light, since the gas absorbs and emits the light. Thus, while the light from the Kerbal will not reach the other side of the detector, plenty of light will reach the IR camera (it will just be diffuse).\n\nYeah, that will be correct. Of course co2 does not block all the IR wavelenght, and if it does, it will be at big concentrations or big distances.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thus, there appears to be a limit on the maximum opacity, since the outer-most layer will always radiate to space (even if the original light waves were absorbed and re-emitted).\n\nYeah, not sure if called a limit, but yes.. So the second factor here would be the height and density of the atmosphere.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E However, i suppose what causes greenhouse effect is when the outermost layer is very cold (i.e. when the outer most layer is thermally insulated from the surface), such that the amount of radiation leaving the planet is less than would leave if the surface could radiate to space directly.\n\u003E Does that sound about right?\n\nmmm, is late so not sure if my brain works fine, but if the greenhouse effect already reach an equilibrium between the energy received and the energy released, then it means those radiations are equal.\n\nBut they are equal because the atmosphere heat up a lot more until reach its equilibrium.\n\nAnd that would happen when the last atmosphere layer; atmosphere from certain height to top, which average temperature is equal to the average surface temperature it will need to emit the same radiation back to space.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, positive feedback is a very dangerous thing. Even small positive feedback, in the absence of any negative ones, can result in exponential growth until saturation.

I never search that in deep.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And the fact that more heat is radiated at elevated temperatures doesnt help, since the heat is still trapped by the CO2 (it would only help if the temperature increases enough to change the outgoing wavelengths significantly such that CO2 no longer absorbs them). \n\u003E In addition, how does one explain this positive feedback, given that millions of years ago, the CO2 concentration in the planet was ~3000 ppm, but the temperature was only ~10 C warmer (i.e. not Venus)?\n\nWe dont know what might be the co2 trigger in those times, co2 only last 30 years, maybe something trigger but before the temperature rise enoght, the amount of co2 decay. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E The water vapor cycle is very stable and has many negative feedbacks to take water out of atmosphere (residence time of water molecule of short).

Atmosphere might not be a significant thermal mass compared to the oceans or the whole mass of the earth, but on the time scale of a day, the heat from the sun does not have a change to penetrate through the whole ocean or the earth. With wind and natural convection, the thermal mass of the atmosphere is the one that is mostly used.\n\nIf you have a planet with sea and you dont have atmosphere (lets pretend the water remains liquid XD), if you place a thermometer 1 to 10 meters above the sea even in the night side, then it will have the same temperature than the sea, because it receives heat by radiation.\n\nSo I imagine that you imagine the atmosphere helps in keep us warm when the sun will stop bright.\n\nThat is true with real atmospheres, but with this hypotetical atmosphere it will not help much.\n\n\u003E CO2 probably has more impact than it looks like because of the upper atmosphere, here its little water vapor and the low pressure make the absorption less than 100% so an increase will increase the absorption.\n\nSand is a thermal insulator, animal dig in the sand during day to escape from the heat, because heat only reach few centimeters. That is the opposite to water, which is a good thermal conductor and sun light can reach several meters.\n\nSo when the night fall, the little heat trapped in sand is released in a short time, that is the first or second main effect of why deserts are cold on night.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Comparing Venus to Earth is a bit difficult.
