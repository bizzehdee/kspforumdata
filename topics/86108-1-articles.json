I wish to keep the current version 24.2, as I have gotten further in science mode then I ever have before (made my first mun base! will probably post pics soon), and do not want to restart (I am using quite a few mods and am guessing .25 will break some of them. It took me a good couple of hours to get them all working together and I would rather not have to redo that) Not wishing to restart, is there a way to force my computer to not update KSP or its mods? I am using it on Steam, which I know is very update happy and I am not sure if there is a way to play a game without updating if one is available? (never tried it before, and I don\u0027t want to risk my save) and have modulemanager installed to check for mod updates, but I was thinking of removing it so it does not try to update some mods to .25 (when I do upgrade it will be all or nothing). Any suggestions on how to keep playing 24.2 once .25 is out? Should I copy my gamedata folder and paste it over the update? (I don\u0027t think that will work, as it would probably try to update again.) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be really appreciated, as I was really looking forward to developing my mun base (so much science...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T02:43:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne method is to copy your entire KSP folder somewhere else.
