I bought the game from the old website (I guess it was the squad page I can\u0027t remember, it\u0027s been a while) anyway, I have a steam code to DL the game but I can\u0027t figure out how to use it to get the game on my new computer. Full disclosure however, I got the code to upgrade the game on steam.
