It was determined for sure that Laythe would not be suitable for long term Kerbal habitation due to radiation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo. The world\u0027s leaders had dragged their feet and avoided the warnings for far too long. Too many greenhouse gases had been released into the atmosphere. Once the effects became noticeable, there was a flurry of panic. Trillions were sunk into carbon capture technologies, reforestation, and other, more exotic solutions, but the global temperature continued to rise. Barring a miracle, Kerbin was doomed the fate of Eve. Climate change was now irreversible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPart I - The Launch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany believed that Kerbin could still be saved given a technological breakthrough. All of the trillions there were were sunk into this. Some progress was made, buying Kerbin a few more years, but nothing more than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome wanted to launch probes to far off stars, filled with Kerbal embryos in hopes that they would be able to autonomously seek out life supporting worlds and restart the population worlds away. Such a journey would take centuries if not millennia\u00A0with current technology, and there was no guarantee it would work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna would not work for more than an outpost. Terraforming would be extremely risky. Laythe had the radiation problem. Cloud cities on Eve, or even on Kerbin would eventually break down and fall. It seemed that there were no solutions among\u00A0the stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil one day, a climate researcher accidentally stumbled upon the secret to faster than light travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was by no means an immediate life saver. The material required to make it work, dubbed \u0022Cantonium,\u0022 was in very short supply, and hard to extract, but Kerbalkind was able to scrounge up enough of it for a test vehicle and a medium sized warp drive. The test vehicle, launched on a small rocket, performed nearly flawlessly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA plan was drawn up. An interstellar scouting mission would be launched, manned, packed with landers designed for every world one could reasonably expect.

The only two limiting resources fuel wise were fusion pellets and hydrogen. The fusion pellets on board could provide more Delta-V than anyone could ever expect to need, especially since much of the maneuvering could be done with the warp drive. The hydrogen supply would last several years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EStar Sky\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0carries four landers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nA light lander, powered by radioisotope rockets, with ~1.4km/s of Delta-V, for the lightest moons.

Much longer and Kerbin would not be able to build colony ships in time, much shorter and the crew risked not finding what they were looking for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship would be far out. While FTL travel had been invented, FTL communications hadn\u0027t. There would be no constant link between the ship and Kerbin. Some amount of data could be sent using the warp drive to shoot off bubbles of spacetime, but this was very energy intensive. This maneuver was planned to be limited to once every ninety days barring a significant discovery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe discovery of intelligent life was a real possibility. Orders for scenarios like this were sealed in special envelopes, stowed on board the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EStar Sky\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was incredibly ambitious, potentially the single most complicated machine Kerbalkind had made. Design and construction ran into several problems. The image above was of the first rollout. In the days before launch, however, many, many problems were discovered. Upon closer inspection, problems ran rampant in the ship. The final nail in the coffin was the fact that the lifter had a shelf life much shorter than anticipated. The solid fuel began cracking, and many bits began rusting. The entire vehicle was rolled back to the assembly building and underwent a complete overhaul. The final version was similar to the original, but definitely not exact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNearly a year of precious time had passed, but the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EStar Sky\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was finally ready for launch on its brand new launch vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WSOj2o5.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WSOj2o5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew: Steve, Dia, Jacob, Emille, Katherine, Martin, Jebediah, Bill, and Bob Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of Kerbin watched and held their breath as the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EStar Sky\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0lit its engines. The cloud of smoke grew... And then...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EE79Ux9.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EE79Ux9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLiftoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EStar Sky\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0had no launch escape system. Any failure meant a probable detonation of the antimatter holding tanks, which were needed to provide the energy to start the quantum singularity reactor. If those blew, the entire vehicle, and anything for kilometers around, was done for. There was no practical escape system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221ExXd5h.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1ExXd5h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mYCNi3X.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/mYCNi3X.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first stage, one of the largest ever built, detached and fell away. The Daedalus engine would perform the rest of the circularization burn, albeit at a high angle due to the low acceleration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KKN4qR0.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KKN4qR0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, several minutes later, the engine cut off. The six massive radiators were unfurled, and the quantum singularity reactor was brought to life, managing to avoid destroying Kerbin in the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few orbits later, all of the systems were checked out. A star had been pre-selected as the first target - Cercani.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew said what could\u00A0be their final live goodbyes for five years, or possibly forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll around Kerbin, people looked upwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EStar Sky\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0warped into the great unknown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223nSxyIX.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3nSxyIX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FdxO18o.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/FdxO18o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022niLgqZf.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/niLgqZf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, first off, don\u0027t expect everything to be that dramatic. I certainly got carried away with the intro! Expect short-ish updates detailing the worlds I land on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, as with my other projects, expect long periods of inactivity as my interests jump around really rapidly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, my goal with this mission is to land on as many worlds as possible with the ship I designed. I don\u0027t know what will give out first, the fuel supply, or my motivation. I expect that the fuel will last for at least 100 landings depending on the average size and type of the body that will be landed on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not done completely legitimately. During warp jumps I need to turn on unbreakable joints and ignore crash damage or else the entire ship will rip itself apart. In addition, the tanks that hold the hydrogen that powers the reactor have ridiculously low heat tolerances. When maneuvering near stars, ignore max temperature is on just for these tanks. If anything else overheats then I am definitely too close and will back off. Lastly, convenience over integrity in some cases. If I have to do a boring monotonous task that will decrease my enthusiasm for the project, then I will most likely cheat it. However I will not cheat for the smallest things. This installation doesn\u0027t even have HyperEdit installed, something that rarely happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game version is 1.6.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will be going through the various stars supported by Interstellar Consortium. I am unsure if I will even get past the first planet pack, Other Worlds, as it has I think six star systems with many bodies. If I do, I will be taking votes as to which star to do next. Maybe even within Other Worlds... My computer is not beefy enough to handle all of even just Other Worlds at once. Each star will be installed and uninstalled as I need it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestions are welcome. This is actually supposed to be more of a technical mission report than a dramatic story, but again, I got carried away writing the intro.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Part 2, a few worlds are landed on, and I may explain what I have learned about warp maneuvering. In addition, some of the landers will be introduced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod list and world list maybe coming soon. Not now, I need my sleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnjoy!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-10T03:02:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2019 03:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Ultimate Steve\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-09T15:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/161505-ultimate-steve/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022161505\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/161505-ultimate-steve/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Ultimate Steve\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Nice dramatic intro!

The onboard scanners were turned on in order to find planets. One of the first identified was one fairly close to Cercani. The ship carried an extensive list of names submitted by all of the Kerbals on Kerbin. Rather hastily, without even seeing the planet as more than a dot in a telescope, the world was named Vassa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, to get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWarp maneuvering is a bit daunting at first, but not that difficult once you get the hang of it. The main thing is that the warp drive isn\u0027t just a really big rocket engine. When you drop out of warp, you still have the same velocity in the same direction as you had when you entered warp. So, for example, if the warp drive was activated at 2km/s in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and was right beneath the Mun (the Mun travelling in the same direction as the ship), once the ship dropped out of warp around the Mun it would be travelling far too fast to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to warp directly into orbit of a body, your pre-warp velocity RELATIVE TO THE\u00A0TARGET BODY must be less than that body\u0027s escape velocity but greater than orbital velocity. This means that the velocity window scales highly with the mass of the body you want to orbit. Fortunately, for minor adjustments, the Star Sky carries a fusion engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want to lower your relative velocity to your target. In some cases, all that is required for this is time. If you are already orbiting a body, or low around a star, your relative velocity will change a lot during one orbit because you reverse directions twice. However, this isn\u0027t always enough. Sometimes you need to slow down or speed up in a particular direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA good technique to use for this is something that probably has a technical name, but I like to call it gravity bleeding. Warp into a place where you are travelling straight up (with the right sideways component - this is hard to judge) and low above a massive object. You will be slowed down fairly rapidly by gravity, and you can warp away when you are satisfied with your new relative velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravity bleeding, actually gravobraking may be a better word, can also be used if you are going too fast when you get to a body. If yo are going to fly past Jool at 13km/s, use gravobraking. You can keep jumping back to near Jool, so repeat until your velocity is low enough to orbit. Then warp to the altitude (and position around the planet) where your velocity and direction would give you a circular orbit, or a non circular one if you desire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorrecting inclination to near zero can be done fairly simply too. wait until you are directly between your ascending and descending nodes, so you are not drifting \u0022up or down\u0022 and warp \u0022downwards or upwards\u0022 to the correct plane. You will still be travelling \u0022sideways\u0022 but if you stayed at the same altitude your relative inclination to your target will be near zero if you dropped out of warp at the correct time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, the degree of warp precision isn\u0027t great simply because you are moving too fast. With these warp drives, it takes the least power to go exactly one C. More or less than that, and it takes more power. This limits your maximum and minimum warp speed to the available power supply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the main positron and quantum singularity reactors engaged, power supply on board fluctuates between about 0.9 and 1.5 gigawatts based on something, probably heat. I haven\u0027t figured out that bit yet. This means that sometimes we have the necessary 1.21 gigawatts necessary to go back to the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forget what the minimum speed that Star Sky can warp at is, but I believe it\u0027s less than 0.01c. On smaller worlds, this is too fast to get into perfect orbits, and in most cases I just said \u0022good enough\u0022 if it was an alright orbit that didn\u0027t intersect the orbits of other bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhew, that\u0027s a mouthful, but now it\u0027s out of the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rmT7cGV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rmT7cGV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is an example of gravobraking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ja2FABf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ja2FABf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew warped into view of Vassa.
