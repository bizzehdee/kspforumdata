I don\u0027t mean a highly adapted bio-changed something or other, and I don\u0027t mean a tree, but could I plant a rose on Mars?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would meet the requirements of carbon dioxide (definitely) and sunlight (for the most part) for plant growth, and if one could set up a watering device I think that might work? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if an Antarctic fern or some plant used to very cold climates might do well. Maybe it could survive the cold temperatures better and could utilize the water ice for its own sort of water like some plants found down there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I\u0027m not considering magnetic radiation or soil types, but what do you think about this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T22:24:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERose bushes are too highly developed plants... they\u0027re too dependant on exactly the right environment. It would die within the hour, unless you happened to catch a martian summer noon a little north of the equator, where it can have temperatures above 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C. In that environment, it probably can get enough CO2 even in the low-pressure environment to live if you gave it Earth soil. Without it? Unlikely, again, due to the highly developed nature of the rose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, lower order plants are a possibility. Mosses and lichen, for instance. The things that stubbornly grow against all odds in the poorest environments we have on Earth, those might grow in a similarly stubborn fashion if placed on Mars. Some form of irrigation would be required, as it\u0027s too dry otherwise. But it wouldn\u0027t need very much of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeding the planet with large amounts of such (potentially gene-manipulated) lower order plants is expected to be part of a hypothetical terraforming process. A later step, after you increase the temperature and atmospheric pressure. They woud be the way that oxygen is introduced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T22:43:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not a botonist or biologist, but right off the top of my head, I can say no with high confidence. For one, the atmospheric pressure is far too low, and only in extremely low elevations on Mars can liquid water exist- and only then in a very narrow temperature range. The plant will dry out and die quickly. You could mix in antifreezes I suppose and extend that range, but I doubt the plant can live off of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the ultraviolet light and surface radiation environment would probably kill it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat other things might kill it? I\u0027m not sure. The Martian soil is probably toxic for it too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderground, things might be different, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if there are some Earth microbes that could survive there, especially if the recurring slope lineae we see coming down some crater walls are in fact flowing water streaks bubbling up from underground. But plants? Plants need sunlight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, supposedly, if we could melt the ice caps, composed of carbon dioxide, we could increase the surface pressure to like 0.3 bar. But I donno how plants would take that. That\u0027s a VERY high partial pressure of CO2, for all I know, they could get CO2 poisoning- sorta like drowning them in water.
