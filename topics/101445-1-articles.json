These can be attached anywhere a Kerbal can reach, or put in a container somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Get the crane to the module you want to move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* EVA a Kerbal, get them to one of your radial docking connectors, right click and tell them to grab it.

Again, the winch connector will now be attached to your Kerbal\u0027s back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Walk over to your radial docking connector, right-click and select on of the Plug options. Docked will link the two vessels together as if they\u0027re docked. Undocked will treat them as separate but attached by the connector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Board your vessel again, and you can right-click the winch to get a bunch of options for controlling it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother good option is to use the electromagnet. The easiest way to do that is to attach the electromagnet to the end of the winch in the VAB. Then you should be able to either manually move the magnet to the target vessel and attach it, or position your crane over the target and just extend the winch and let the magnet drop down. Right-click the magnet to turn it on or off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key to this stuff is to practice it on the launch pad to get a feel for how the different KAS parts work. Build a simple vessel like this one, with a crew pod and RTG, KAS ground pylon, two horizontal winches, an electromagnet and a radial connector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/28484282743095639/4C8BC63B8F5EA2F81DD29CF33C4BFF483299BB4E/\u0022 alt=\u00224C8BC63B8F5EA2F81DD29CF33C4BFF483299BB4E\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Kerbal on EVA will be able to grab the ground pylon. Attach it to the ground a few metres away from the ship, then play around attaching different things to it until you figure out the best way for your crane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: This is my mun crane, the Colonial Spider, carting an MKS module from its landing site to join with my in-progress base. You can\u0027t see the radial docking connector, but it\u0027s there on the top of the module. Amongst other supplies I jammed in those containers were a handful of pipe connectors. Turns out anchoring the module in place with a pipe is a great way to help keep everything stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/txUCjAc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022txUCjAc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T09:23:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 09:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stibbons\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"funkcanna","CreatedById":138944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T01:21:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!
