So here\u0027s what i would like to know. When i run eve or basically any other visual enhancements mod together i get constant 60 fps (which i capped it at), and\u00A0when i run scatterer by itself i get 60 the problem is when i run eve and scatterer together my fps drops down to 45\u00A0even when i just have a cockpit places on the launch pad. I\u0027ve tried turning off the water shaders and the terrain shadows, even turned all my graphics to the lowest but i always get around 45 fps. One thing to note is at night time my fps will go up to around 50.\u00A0I\u0027ve heard of people running eve and scatterer together on gtx 1060 3gb\u0027s without any fps drop. So why would it be happening to me\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy specs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRX 480 4gb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni7 7700\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16gb ram\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll my drivers are up to date\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried over multiple versions of the game and they all seem to have the same results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help will be much appreciated \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
