This includes:\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCivilian - populating Kerbin would change everything. There would be cities, roads, cars, commercial aircraft, and boats. It would absolutely transform Kerbin from a desolate rock in space into a thriving planet like our Earth. It would give a sense of purpose to the space program (for Kerbalkind?). It would also hamper you in that you have to be mindful of where you\u0027re dropping hardware. You can\u0027t launch from the Kerbin equivalent of Vandenberg AFB and say \u0022eh, there\u0027s nothing in Kansas anyways, can\u0027t hurt to ditch a massive lower rocket stage randomly into some area that may or may not be populated.\u0022 You\u0027ll have to place your space center somewhere (as discussed earlier) where this won\u0027t be a problem (or will, if you want to go maximum Kerbal and ditch your rockets into cities). Also, don\u0027t accidentally hit any commercial airliners. We don\u0027t want to be accused of terrorism now, do we? This also applies to de-orbiting or landing any spacecraft that were already in orbit or returning from elsewhere in space.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOther space industry - Having some competition could really drive things, and this could even be a prime source for some multiplayer integration. Another space program may try to beat you to certain goals, come to your aid in an emergency (The Martian, anyone?), or even sabotage/attack you (I wouldn\u0027t have this stock,but those with a BD Armory equivalent would definitely mod this in. I think building ASAT missiles could be really cool tbh). In addition, you could give them contracts to repair or refuel your hardware or space stations in orbit, and they in turn could hire you to do the same to their own equipment.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nExtra-terrestrial:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nVastly more detailed planetary surfaces. The current system of having several massive biomes that are roughly the same everywhere is, let\u0027s face it, pretty boring. We need much more detail on the surface that can actually warrant rovers and such. This includes opportunities for science, there should be many more surface sampling options available, including perhaps randomly generated chances of various rarity of finding anomalous features, including life. This would require taking core samples of rocks, seeking out valleys that might have once held water, etc. I realize this is difficult development-wise. Procedural generation for small details could be an option I suppose, while keeping the major features the same?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVastly more detailed orbital structures, such as planetary rings and asteroid belts. Procedural generation is definitely the way to go on this one. I want to be able to fly into the ring of a planet and see glorious volumetric lighting and crepuscular rays from all the dust and rocks. I also want to be able to explore an asteroid belt like the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDawn\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0mission did.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneral:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLife support should probably be at least available as an option for stock since it plays such a huge role in real-life space travel.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPotentially improved Kessler Syndrome if such a thing could be implemented without killing performance\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEven more realistic aero. A voxel-based aerodynamics model is definitely in order. This could be adjusted as desired, but definitely needs to be more realistic than it currently is.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOrbital decay, potentially. If such a thing could be implemented (requiring calculations when the vessel was not being focused on), then automated station-keeping (i.e. orbit re-boosting) could definitely be as well. This would also open up the door for more resupply requirements in addition to life support.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScanSat, we need better interaction between orbital spacecraft and the surface.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSomething like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/99043-105-testflight-v154-28-mar-2016-bring-flight-testing-to-ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ETestFlight\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0to encourage test-bed experiments and making for overall\u00A0more realistic hardware\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nImproved graphics would definitely be amazing, especially using something like\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://unigine.com/en/industries/simulation/space\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUNIENGINE\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0like \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/118557-starstreak2109/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022118557\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/118557-starstreak2109/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@StarStreak2109\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0said above. hnnnnnngggg\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMore discovery. I was dismayed to find that as soon as I start a new career, I can jump into the tracking station and see all the planetary bodies as if I was orbiting them. If this wasn\u0027t an option, there would be much more interesting options in terms of discovering the solar system. Maybe you can choose to start at a time when nobody knew anything about the solar system, and when you go to the tracking station all you\u0027d see is the sun, moon, and any other extremely obvious bodies. Maybe you\u0027d begin with some simple coordinates in the sky and you\u0027d have to somehow derive the existence and orbits of the other planets before you can even see that they exist. \u00A0This would be especially cool in a procedurally generated solar system.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOverhauled science. Some aspects of the current science system are fine (such as receiving science from data gathered from locations), but is that science really something that can be used to develop better rocket engines? Maybe an atmospheric pressure scan would, but in general, not really. Now I know that it would be boring to obtain all R\u0026amp;D-spendable science by playing \u0022test bed simulator 2017\u0022 so some sort of compromise would have to be made. Something like TestFlight (which I mentioned above) would definitely add a lot. Perhaps linking certain experiments to certain nodes of the tech tree for a non-linear tech unlock system?
