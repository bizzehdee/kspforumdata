I mean, rocket science? Something called aerobraking? Whatever man.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELucky for me, one of my friends got into it and recommended it to me. My finances aren\u0027t in the best shape, so I downloaded the demo and made myself a deal: I would buy the game if I could put a man on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal Apollo program had far more failures than the real one. My first rocket was just the Mk1 pod attached directly to an SRB. I didn\u0027t expect much out of it, but I had no way to calculate dV (and only the barest notion of the *concept* of dV) and I didn\u0027t know about the parachute parts yet. About ten dead Kerbals later, I discovered staging and parachutes and decided that a good practice run would be to send a Kerbal on a Kerbolar escape trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was fun. So was figuring out how much dV I needed to get off Kerbin. I can\u0027t remember how many of my rockets tipped over and ditched in the ocean before I discovered how to make the ASAS work. But finally, I pulled it off, and with my new knowledge of very basic rocket design, I set off for the Mun, mostly by guesswork.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually never crash landed on the Mun, which was miraculous, considering that I still hadn\u0027t been to the forums or anything. I did, however, run out of fuel on the way down. I had to use RCS translation controls to land the rest of the way. But it was a good landing, and Jeb walked away from it. I read the Apollo disaster speech and bought the full game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I discovered how to make REAL rockets, and discovered how much of a Whackjob my designs had been. No offense, Whackjob. You can actually *pull that off*. I cannot. I\u0027ll stick to asparagus. Eventually I got around to posting this. I\u0027ve been lurking for months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really need to find more time to play.

When I started I had no idea how to use SAS, no idea how to work the throttle, no idea I could \u003Cem\u003Emanually steer.\u003C/em\u003E Nevertheless my first really successful rocket had a final stage basically like yours - a capsule on a small SRB - but it pointed toward the pad; the SRB\u0027s nozzle was covered with a fairing that had three more SRBs bolted onto it at slight angles to induce a spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the craft took off backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it took off its center of gravity was too far aft, but since the ship would spin it was stable in the manner of a rifle bullet. As the top SRBs drained, the center of gravity went further and further aft, until finally the craft began to porpoise violently... and the moment it flipped over was calibrated to be the moment it ran out of gas. Once the capsule\u0027s nose was pointed skyward, I\u0027d jettison the fairing and light the second SRB stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot me to space, at least.
