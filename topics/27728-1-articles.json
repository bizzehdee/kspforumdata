I have done programming before, but not much in the way of building programs or add-on. My background is more in scientific computing and MATLAB/python type stuff, so this is a whole new world for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the theory behind what I want to do, but don\u0027t know how to make a mod and get it implemented into KSP. To start I just want to be able to just replicate something like a mechjeb function where you burn automatically or something. Just a simple thing like a GUI button which burns for 10 seconds holding a direction. Maybe something like how to make a maneuver node too, but that\u0027s secondary. I think if I could get that far I could do the rest. This first step though is a bit daunting for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked at some mod source code like MechJeb and I\u0027m still a bit overwhelmed trying to figure out how to start something simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould anyone help me figure out a few questions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- what language should I be using? (C#?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- how do I go about making an add on that could interface with KSP while running (how to go from a source file script to a button in the KSP window)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry if this is asked a lot, and if there is a tutorial please let me know. It seems that most I find either requires more background than I know, or is directed to part making.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T17:44:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1- Anything that compiled to an CIL dll runnable by mono (i.e. no MS specific classes) should work, C# is your best bet though as virtually everyone else uses it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Compile it to a library (dll) and stick it in the plugins folder. KSP will load the code automatically. To actually get it to be invoked depends on your aim, but the most common way it to extend the PartModule class and then attach a MODULE{ } section to a part naming your class, that is how mechjeb functions for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would generally add Assembly-CSharp.dll and UnityEngine.dll are references to your project (or specify than at compile time if you\u0027re doing it the long way). PartModule is contained in the former so it is essential for that approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
