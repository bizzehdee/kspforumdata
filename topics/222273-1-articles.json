about not following the rules?\u00A0 This is by far the biggest design issue (in my opinion) of the game so far: a single-minded, rigid approach which the devs think is the best is the only way of doing so many things, from the topic of this post, to not being able to even plan a maneuver past your max deltaV (also susceptible to calculation errors), to the timewarp limitations, is hard built into the mechanisms of the game.\u00A0 Hopefully, though, these artificial restrictions that stifle the spirit of KSP are seen as what they are -- restrictions to creativity and fun -- and are removed so that this game can reach to and beyond the heights of KSP1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n(I\u0027m sorry if this seemed negative, I really do like so much of the game and have been really impressed playing it so far.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-29T05:33:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2023 05:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 29\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by OPERATOR571\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI thought that ctrl\u002BEnter was how you made a new line, not shift\u002BEnter.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-29T05:29:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t noticed that, even on long burns like one-shot interplanetary burns that use most of the stage\u0027s fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I do notice is that they don\u0027t recognize engine changes, like if you plan it with a nearly empty stage, and then stage it away the maneuver node assumes the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of the prior stage until you start to burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also noticed very occasionally when a burn is a small fraction of a second, the game tells me some large number like 45 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, sometimes the line is yellow, sometimes its red, and sometimes it\u0027s nonexistent and I have no idea what causes which to occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OPERATOR571","CreatedById":212340,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-29T05:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224353413\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222273\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221703827775\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Superfluous J\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, Superfluous J said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t noticed that, even on long burns like one-shot interplanetary burns that use most of the stage\u0027s fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I do notice is that they don\u0027t recognize engine changes, like if you plan it with a nearly empty stage, and then stage it away the maneuver node assumes the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of the prior stage until you start to burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also noticed very occasionally when a burn is a small fraction of a second, the game tells me some large number like 45 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, sometimes the line is yellow, sometimes its red, and sometimes it\u0027s nonexistent and I have no idea what causes which to occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally?\u00A0 I\u0027ve had it overestimate the burn time by like half a minute before.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, I completely concur with the line not making much sense.\u00A0 I\u0027ve had it go down, go up, go down then up, literally just ping-pong across both while I have been accelerating and not accelerating, and I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve seen it be more colors than this game turns my mouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-29T07:46:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t watch the line or the timer, watch the trajectory in map view.

For example if you\u0027re doing a gilly landing or something where you want your max thrust to be very low so you actually have some throttle control, then you plan a maneuver, it\u0027ll assume you\u0027re thrusting at whatever your current max it. If you then update the max thrust, it won\u0027t modify the burn calculation until you do something with the node or start burning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current maneuver planner is actually incredible and a huge improvement on KSP 1 when it works as intended. It takes into account staging events and everything. The only minor issue is that with staging events it assumes they happen exactly on time and the thrust from the next stage is immediately available. Usually the player is gonna be a second or two off on that and if you\u0027re using an engine like the tuba, that takes a second or two to extend which delays the thrust. That makes a very minor difference in projected outcome in a single planetary system, it\u0027s a bit higher at interplanetary, and at interstellar there likely needs to be some solve for it unless the solve is \u0022*shrug* do a mid course adjustment for a couple m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have noticed some minor bugs where it doesn\u0027t seem to start the progress bar going down when I start burning, but if I follow the timer it still works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s as example showing the staging system working.
