Or use solar powered Propellers to fly in Eve\u2018s atmosphere, because i want to land on Eve. But my Idea was to make a solar plane that flys up and take the Rocket with it so i can save fuel. And the Rocket will stage when it\u2018s in the higher Atmosphere and do there the Orbit burn. I see some thing that jet engines are blowing on parts and then the parts are rotating, but this uses fuel i need a electric propeller (i want to have a mod, or when there is no mod can i build a propeller with reaction wheels)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-27T08:51:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck out Firespitter.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-27T08:59:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirespitter is my favorite, but it has some small issues with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E and some other mods (the guy\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eproperly\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0modeled a propeller engine - pun intended - and so mods relying on stock, mass reaction engines, gasps).
