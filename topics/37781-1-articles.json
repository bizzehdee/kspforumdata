I tried playing around with the config file to no avail. I especially tried editing the line in part.cfg with \u0022node_attach = 1.25, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1\u0022 but no change to any parameter seems to do anything upon reloading. I have surface attachments enabled, and the problem seems to be the game thinks the fuel tank has a smaller radius than it does. Am I doing anything wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T16:05:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe node_attach line only applies to attaching your part to other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the problem is with attaching other parts to your part then it\u0027s likely a problem with your collider - if they\u0027re going inside then it sounds like it\u0027s too small.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheebsta","CreatedById":74167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T16:16:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EndlessWaves\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EndlessWaves\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe node_attach line only applies to attaching your part to other parts.\u003Cp\u003EIf the problem is with attaching other parts to your part then it\u0027s likely a problem with your collider - if they\u0027re going inside then it sounds like it\u0027s too small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcur. Almost has to be the collider, either too small, or not convex. The game will load a non-convex collider just fine most of the time, but all sorts of screwy unpredictable behaviors start cropping up if you use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, just clarification, like EndlessWaves said node_attach applies to your part attaching to others, specifically, it is the point on your model that sticks to others when mounted radially. If your part is not radial mount only, node_attach and node_stack_bottom will usually be the same value.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
