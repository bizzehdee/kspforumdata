far.\u00A0 Perhaps starting with one or two \u0027fly by\u0027 and \u0027explore\u0027 types, then offering more contracts once those are done\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that people keep forgetting when they ask for a coherent contract system is that KSP is, at it\u0027s heart, a sandbox game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you had exactly the same game, but the contract system was a linear set of contracts that never varied, you would have greatly reduced replayability, and anyone who had come to the end of the pre-planned contract list would have reason to consider their game \u0027finished\u0027 and would be more inclined to move to other games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want coherent contracts, you have the \u0027World Firsts\u0027, if you want \u0027I run my program my way\u0027 then you have the world firsts and any contracts that happen to fit into your pre-planned mission for your funding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want a game with incredible replayability, you need significant random elements in the game.\u00A0 There is nothing random about the rocket science or flying a well designed rocket.\u00A0 It would be incredibly difficult to have a balanced random science system(either a random science tree or random science acquisition).\u00A0 That leaves Funds as something significant to which they can add an element of randomness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the starting funding as well as significant mile-stones can and are rewarded(see World Firsts), everything else is random, but in a more or less believable way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think tourist contracts are very realistic, including the ones where they make unreasonable demands for what they are willing to pay.\u00A0 It would be nice if we could make counter-offers(I\u0027ll take you to Minmus, Duna and Lathe, but not landed at Eve), or offer to only take part of a group of tourists(I\u0027d be happy to take the 5 of you to the Mun, Minmus, and Kerbol orbit, but I\u0027m not taking that other guy to Tylo), but I would not expect them to be accepted 100% of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think the Explore contracts are a nice supplement to the World firsts(not to mention good hints for what to do next for newer players).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals needing rescues at any body here you have already sent manned missions seems perfectly reasonable as well(even if the \u0027craft\u0027 are a little silly, at least they have a low part-count and are believably \u0027stranded\u0027).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the more involved methods mentioned above(setting up preferred contract types, preferred destinations, etc) are adding a lot of complexity to a game that already has a steep learning curve.\u00A0 Raising the bar for new players is against the best interests of both Squad and the community, so if you want such added complexity, use mods as it would be a bad idea to add it to stock unless it was behind a switch that defaulted to off (at which point it is almost a mod anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the current plan to \u0027lean towards the types that the player is already accepting\u0027 is a good idea to reduce the number of waiting contracts that the player does not care about without adding more complexity to the player\u0027s side of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething that I found helped greatly, especially later in the game when I was looking to expand my operations, was to go into the persistence file and increase the max number of contracts being offered.\u00A0 I actually think it would be a very good idea for squad to start with perhaps a slightly more limited number of contracts available at first (sort of like you only have 2 to choose from at the beginning, but obviously more than that) and then increase the number available as you upgrade Mission control(ending with 20\u002B at the highest tier) to support launching multiple interplanetary missions while still having things to do around Kerbin while they transit.\u00A0 This way you start out simple, but you end up with lots of choices when you have the capability to handle several complicated missions at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T15:29:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

Once you sucessfully launched your first satellite, arguably the best move is not to play. Sit tight and do nothing until all the unlocked tech is researched, and all the already paid for buildings are constructed.

techs to unlock, building up cash for upgrades and ensuring I could always afford mission hardware, sending out probes to other planets as soon as they were even barely feasible,\u00A0that sort of thing. \u00A0But that\u0027s what makes a sandbox game so good, everyone can find their own best way to play it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

into a \u0022race-themed career\u0022 either, I prefer to sit back and just play at whatever pace I want to. \u00A0RP-0 is just as much a sandbox as KSP, there\u0027s no racing involved. \u00A0The thing is that it makes time more of a consideration than KSP\u0027s current meta of completing the tech tree before year 1 is over. \u00A0I\u0027m, what, five or six\u00A0years into my RP-0 campaign and I\u0027m maybe starting\u00A0on tier 3~4 tech, got a few building upgrades, tons of satellites around the moon, some geosynchronous, and I\u0027ve also sent probes on their way to Mars and Venus. \u00A0Just started doing crewed flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the statement should have been that KSP should borrow the general idea from RP-0 rather than ape it because that\u0027s pretty much what I meant. \u00A0RP-0 changes the tech tree in dramatic ways, providing many more parts at the beginning to get you going. \u00A0It also has proper scale, which means a lot of the ways it does things may not work for stock/vanilla. \u00A0And that\u0027s okay, but the contract layout and the ways in which time becomes important are what should be looked at. \u00A0We shouldn\u0027t really be looking at time as a resource anyway, but it should be a consideration beyond \u0022transfer window now\u0022. \u00A0For instance, if you had to deal with a yearly budget\u00A0you\u0027d be a lot more careful about how you spent your funds with an upcoming transfer window. \u00A0That\u0027s the kind of thinking and planning that I feel is missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan
