Generally this is the Twin-Boar - it has both a \u0022thrust cost ratio\u0022 and \u0022thrust weight ratio\u0022 significantly superior than other liquid fuel engines, other than Reliant which closely matches it (but the Reliant is very limited). Using low-cost thrust like from Twin-Boar rather than high-cost like from Vector doesn\u0027t matter that much if you\u0027re recovering, but it does mean that any losses from distance etc aren\u0027t as significant and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E isn\u0027t such a blow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than being cheap the Twin-Boar has a host of other recovery benefits. First one is it produces a ludicrous amount of drag in reverse due to the flared base, this means it slows down really well and you never have to worry about overheating during reentry and it\u0027ll also typically get down to safe drogue chute speeds without additional drag enhancers, also its fatness acts as a heat shield for the rest of the rocket further reducing heat load on the rocket. Secondly it has a 20m/s impact tolerance so you only need 2 or 3 chutes to safely land it on chutes alone. Thirdly you can drop it in the ocean and its long length and high buoyancy will protect everything higher up the stack (just quickly ninja recover before it tips over). Basically the Twin-Boar comes pretty close to being idiot-proof for recovery and barely any bells and whistles are required for recovery. Again if you\u0027re planning on quickloading until you nail the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E having extra bells and whistles isn\u0027t such a big deal because you\u0027ll recover the cost, but if you don\u0027t want to spend your play time quickloading and just go for a 80%\u002B recovery for somewhere vaugely near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0then it doesn\u0027t hurt to keep the rocket on the cheap side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext: Fuel. As a general rule a RAPIER spaceplane can put a payload into orbit at about 1/3rd the fuel cost of a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E Rocket bcause it uses jet engines to build up most of the orbital velocity\u00A0- the cost of using a spaceplane is greatly increased mission times. With rockets you can use a lot more prograde hold and 4x physics warp, with a Spaceplane you definitely want to aim for a high recovery %age. Also spaceplanes scale extremely poorly for hauling bulky\u00A0payloads, payloads almost have to be designed for the spaceplane, whereas with rockets you just size the rocket and fairing to the payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSSTOs (whether rocket or plane) tend to use less fuel if they have a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E because they spend less fuel fighting gravity. There are limits to this, but I\u0027d probably go with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.6 for a Rocket \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E which is going to be recovered, whereas for non-recovery I\u0027d normally use a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.2,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be noted if you\u0027re an incorrigible cheapskate ALL fuel costs can be eliminated by building an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E crawler and launching planes and rockets empty and fueling them up using mined ore\u00A0(assuming you have ore at shores biome). Also if you\u0027re not into cheese but still want to slash launch costs, instead of recovering your launch stage, you can instead reuse it by refueling it in space using ore mined from Minmus. Even better, a\u00A0Mammoth rocket can quite easily make it to Minmus if you empty out the upper stage tanks or enable crossfeed so it can consume all the fuel, by refueling a Mammoth rocket on the flats of Minmus using a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E crawler you save the bother of hauling fuel/ore from Minmus to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E (also non-Mammoth rockets can make it to Minmus with a little help from SRBs). I tend to believe that this is the optimal way of launching large payloads cheaply to distant destinations (like Moho or Jool),\u00A0instead of like a 5x Mammoth you just use a single Mammoth and refuel it, because of the greatly reduced fuel costs this probably will be cheaper than recovery on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-05T10:10:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2018 10:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by blakemw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-05T13:03:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:funds:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/Funds.png\u0022 title=\u0022:funds:\u0022\u003E0.02 :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re honest about how you play the game, and own you occasional crashes, then reusable launch systems aren\u0027t really worth the effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s start with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket it has to have enough fuel to take itself all the way to orbit, it\u0027ll need a probe core, parachutes, batteries, landing gear etc. all that adds about 20,000 to the cost of the rocket and significantly reduces it\u0027s payload capacity.

The way I play, I pile on a lot of the delta-v on the first stage, carrying it to about 1,200 m/s and above the atmosphere. Usually if you can do that, then you can detach the first stage, fire up the second stage and reach orbit. Then switch over to the first stage and land and recover that for about 40,000 out of 50,000. So with that I save 40,000 out of a 125,000 credit rocket which can get a lander to Minmus, or in more standard terms, probably about 70 to 80 tons to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Secondly it has a 20m/s impact tolerance so you only need 2 or 3 chutes to safely land it on chutes alone.
