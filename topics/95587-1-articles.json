These help you change a plane\u0027s aerodynamics in midair. When flaps are deployed, they extend the width of a plane\u0027s wings, generating more lift and drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlaps raised:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rlWPHlM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rlWPHlM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IkC2wfi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IkC2wfi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlaps deployed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zimcQfD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zimcQfD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bThYQ1r.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bThYQ1r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight testing showed that deploying flaps helps on takeoff and landing.

And the mass of wings and control surfaces is very low -- so this isn\u0027t going to be adding much drag.

In KSP, the extra drag of the flap mechanism is way, way more than the extra drag of that wing, so you\u0027d be better off just having your flap extended all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I love the ingenuity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-05T03:55:40Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2015 03:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by numerobis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T20:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zarakon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zarakon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrom the pictures it looks like it changes the angle of the flaps, not just the position, so I would expect it to work in stock too\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh yes, that.
