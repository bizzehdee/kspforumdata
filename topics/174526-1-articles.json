Whether you like flying planes around or sending interplanetary probes or setting up bases on the Mun you can slap some experiments on there and make progress. You aren\u0027t being proscribed to do any specific type of mission to unlock a specific part, so players can play as they will. As a player you\u0027re not sitting there thinking \u0022Man I\u0027d like to go to the Mun but instead I have to do 6 unlock missions to get the parts I need.\u0022 You just go to the Mun and that provides its own reward. Its probably the reason Squad settled on that system, because it accommodates such a wide range of playstyles. The downside, however, is that\u00A0science ends up being unstructured and\u00A0bland and the collection process is repetitive. I tend to think those drawbacks\u00A0can be attacked directly without throwing the flexibility out with bathwater, but thats me.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I would love to see though is a clearer structure for the milestone contracts. I think given the broad diversity of play styles\u00A0it really shouldn\u0027t be even as linear as it is now. Mission control should just have tabs for each planet and the milestones should be listed at the top with any other procedural contracts listed below. Right now you can of course just go to Duna or Minmus or wherever and when you get there you get paid, but you would never know that looking at Mission control.
