In space, you get \u003Ci\u003ESCIENCE!!!\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0for certain different situations, but it only displays **IN VACUUM!** While it is technically impossible to measure the temperature of nothing, the solar radiation should heat up the thermometer by a certain amount. This might require the thermometer to recognize when it is in shadow, but that shouldn\u0027t be too hard as the solar panels already do this.\u00A0I agree that it would be much more realistic to have different temperatures based on time of day and latitude. In real life, the temperature on the Moon can be upwards of 100 degrees during the day, and below -170 degrees at night due to the lack of atmosphere to regulate temperatures globally. On Mars I expect it has a similar effect because there\u0027s not much atmosphere to transfer heat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wissx","CreatedById":152559,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-18T00:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think it would be cool if you got science earned no matter where and what as long as it is different.Like Every 1 cubed KM you get a different result. and every 10 in game minutes you get a different result per cube\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-18T01:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Support of the Spaceplane Freak is given to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-18T05:21:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is indeed a must. even Kerbals wouldn\u0027t build a thermometer that can tell the temperature.
