It\u0027s still hard to land, but that\u0027s mainly because of lack of air brakes. I did managed to land it on the ground, although not the runway ones. My speed was too high though, the engines fell off, but the rest made it. Then it wouldn\u0027t stop, I tried to apply down force, but that resulted in a crash. Gonna try adding a parachute.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess this plane probably has a large amount of Thrust to weight ratio, meaning that even small amount of throttle would send your plane zooming in whatever direction it\u0027s pointed. Because of the drag at low altitudes, it can be hard to notice just how powerful the engines are until you get a lot higher. Some kind of brake dampening would be extra nice sometimes, but I wonder if adding more wheels helps the braking force, like I would expect it to. Someone mentioned that using airbrakes on real planes can be difficult. I kind of like that FAR does this too. Something I really like about Taverio\u0027s smaller engines and nacelles that you might find useful is that they can make this kind of plane easier to land and fly, because the nacelles or small structural fuselage are easier to put under wings, or over them or anywhere because they are physically smaller, and are much less massive. So the smaller parts are less likely to hit the ground on landings for a plane like this. That reduces weight shift instability too, especially if the plane has normal gyro torque and no extra struts. It adjusts mass of other common aerodynamic parts too to make them more useful especially for planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit hmm..I feel like I\u0027ve been quizzed and I learned something. I rebuilt your plane mostly, but with probably less mass, I don\u0027t think it helped the landings though. I think what helped the most was just staying close to an 85 m/s landing speed or less, since my plane would takeoff around 60 m/s. Hopefully this will help you too. I also experimented with flaps, which I have never done before and didn\u0027t really understand. On this particular plane they helped with takeoff a lot. I just read , quoting wiki : \u0022Flaps are devices used to improve the lift characteristics of a wing and are mounted on the trailing edges of the wings of a fixed-wing aircraft to reduce the speed at which the aircraft can be safely flown and to increase the angle of descent for landing. They shorten takeoff and landing distances. Flaps do this by lowering the stall speed and increasing the drag.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat writing is concise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut pictures of flapventure : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/WBk8T\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/WBk8T\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T01:52:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by localSol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u017ElveKatt","CreatedById":96602,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T13:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you can make flaps in KSP yet.
