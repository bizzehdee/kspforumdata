So the vessel can wobble, bend, rotate, accelerate, and so forth, but at up to 4x speed. To get this higher speed, it uses a larger timestep, which can be dangerous because it magnifies the unavoidable, but normally small, imprecisions in the relative positions and velocities of parts, which can lead to more dramatic wobbling, uncontrolled spins, rapid unplanned disassembly and rapid, violent expansion of parts one might prefer to keep intact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith non-physical time warp, your craft is put \u0022on rails\u0022, meaning rotation stops, engines can\u0027t be used, and the parts of your ship don\u0027t interact with each other, they just stay fixed in place like they would in the VAB. The vessel just keeps going on its trajectory, with gravity being the only physics that remains relevant. Time warp of this type isn\u0027t allowed when you\u0027re in atmosphere, since drag is constantly altering your trajectory. This is the time warp that can go to very high multiples of the speed of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T19:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeyond interplanetary burns and while parachuting I quite often use physical timewarp for rover driving or running kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T19:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022UH60guy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022UH60guy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuick question- I understand the basic thought of the differences between the physical and non-physical time warp.\u003Cp\u003EAs a newbie to KSP, I was just wondering how and when people typically apply the different versions.
