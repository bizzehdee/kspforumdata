Even when standing still it jumps around everywhere and explosive structural failures are commonplace.\n\nNow, I have next to no experience with big rovers, so I don\u0027t know if this is a bug or my poor design. Either way, could you help me find a way to make the truck stay in one non-bouncy piece, whether by design changes or whatever?\n\nThis is the remains of the craft after one such incident: (also, I don\u0027t suppose anyone knows how to make trucks that look a little less dumb whilst keeping part count sane? Other than all the exploding, the actual truck is the real weak link in my design, I\u0027m really happy with the habitation module (not visible here) and the rest is coming on well, but that truck is just a big, laggy potato.)\n\n![crnh3BM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/crnh3BM.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T23:16:38Z","Content":"Two Three things. \n\nOne, use struts and attach to the tops of the wheels. \n\nTwo, using big and small wheels together cause problems because they run at different speeds, so try disabling the motors for the big rear wheels if you\u0027re going to tow it around like a trailer.

If that tank was full, then four wheels is too few. I could carefully drive that type of tank on eight wheels, and only very carefully mounting slopes. It is REALLY heavy. Plus this type of wheels is really bad with heavy loads, as they extend far sideways from the mount point, exerting a huge momentum.\n\n![iZjgnnI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iZjgnnI.jpg)\n\nCheck my twelve-wheeler with even bigger tanks. All it did was driving very slowly and carefully off the runway... then it exploded. With the tanks empty it handles like a nice buggy."}]}
