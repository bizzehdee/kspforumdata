Fuel reserves have been drained to dangerous levels and without more KSC will come to a grinding halt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI came up with a rough idea for a new game mode that could offer a scenario driven experience outside of the Career mode and career mode lite (science mode). I also wanted something that would make the new resources really come into play. While I originally came up with this as a mod idea I think this could be a fun stock game mode along side the other 3 and wouldn\u0027t require any major features to be added into the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDown to the meat and potatoes. This game mode would be much closer to Sandbox than Career as you would start off with all the science researched and there would be no funds limiting you. What you would have is a limited volume of fuel to start the game off with and more fuel cannot be purchased. This would require players to setup mining colonies and refueling stations in order to keep their ships fueled. While there would still be Ore on Kerbin there should be options to remove Ore from the KSC with a slider to adjust how far out from the KSC you wont find any ore. Any leftover fuel or ore on a recovered ship gets added into your stockpile of fuel but still falls under the same recovery rules where the further away from KSC you recover the smaller percentage you get back.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T17:32:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 05:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by roguelycan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadows2b","CreatedById":137562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T17:16:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGrindfest for fuel, could be interesting as a late game event in career mode, but there is to few parts about ore to be viable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T17:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis could probably be scripted real easily.

As much as I like the idea of mining and refueling stations I find that they are not that insanely useful 90% of the time. In career the fuel itself is so cheap compared to the cost of actual parts that setting up a refueling station would provide very little benefit. In Sandbox they are practically useless because it is almost always easier to just send another flight into LKO for a refuel. By limiting the fuel you start with plus no option to purchase more fuel would not only make mining actually useful, it would be mandatory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"roguelycan","CreatedById":64979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T21:05:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am curious how difficult something like this would be to create a mod for.
