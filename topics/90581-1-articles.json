Maybe that heat could be used in secondary conversion cycles, but for the moment, let\u0027s stick to the core specification. The Ad Astra VF-200 consumes 200 kW of power, so we need two reactors, some power management hardware, the engine itself, and ~700 kW worth of radiator area (the engine also produces significant waste heat). I have no idea how much that would weigh, but let\u0027s assume a final drive section weight of 1.5 tons. It would have an Isp of 4500s and output 5 N of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you have to add propellant, and then payload. The rocket equation says that a vessel massing 9 tons - carrying the drive section mentioned above, plus 5 tons of argon propellant, half a ton of tankage and structure and systems, and finally 2 tons worth of payload would yield 35,800 m/s of dV. Not shabby at all! Maybe you can\u0027t make 30 days with that kind of dV, but perhaps 40 or 45 might be realistic, and that\u0027s already a big improvement over the kind of travel time we can expect from chemical engines today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question of how the acceleration profile would look like for a 9 ton vessel with 5 N of thrust, I leave to those who are better with math than I am \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put things into perspective, a 2-ton payload would IIRC be enough to carry Curiosity and its descent system, for example. Not that that one had a particular reason to hurry, but hey, it\u0027s a SUV-sized rover! And considering a Falcon Heavy can lift over 50 tons to LEO, you could quintuple this hypothetical craft and get a 45-ton variant with five VASIMR engines delivering 25 N of thrust, carrying 10 tons of payload with the same 35.8 km/s dV.
