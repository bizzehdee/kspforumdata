Great. Now just wait, a comet is bound to show up. Space objects pop up, and if you don\u0027t track them, they will disappear after a while, making room for new objects to turn up. Over a timespan of years, you can expect to have a comet on the radar more often than not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy default, you will at most see one comet. Setting up Sentinels anywhere for object tracking will increase the number of objects that can be seen at the same time, but the number of comets doesn\u0027t scale linearly. You get ten objects from the tracking station, and another ten for every Sentinel. With eight sentinels you can see 90 objects at a time, but at most three of them will be comets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
