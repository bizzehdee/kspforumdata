However, after a good amount of time trying to figure out how to get a model into the game I\u0027ve come up empty handed. I was able to take a look at some of the other mod packages and deduce that my problem is purely in export of the model. After adding the part the game proceeds to load infinitely. I haven\u0027t seen anyone post about this problem, and boy, I\u0027ve looked. So any help would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I have to make a folder with the textures (in it\u0027s own folder) the model in an obj or dae format, and a part text document outlining what the part uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve exported a test object, to take the place of a solid booster, to demonstrate my dilemma.
