Blast your foes for hours with 2-round bursts or spew all 64 rounds of pure annihilation in one go. (default shown in video is 32 round bursts, allowing for two \u0027shots\u0027) When used with the gunner\u0027s sights, this weapon becomes extremely deadly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 2 x Mk IV Sunburst missiles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Standard stock missiles. Nothing too fancy here. Use probe cores and RCS to track straight when fired. For use when you need a slightly bigger boom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 4 x AIR-3 medium-range anti-personel rockets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Fired from a port on top of the ship, these high-arcing rockets will sow mayhem up to 1km in front of you. Alternatively, flip upside-down and blast the SOBs directly underneath of you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Advanced gunner targeting system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E These gunner sights are deadly accurate when used with the KPL-5 cannons, and fairly accurate with Sunburst missiles at close range. Warranty void if used to try to aim AIR-3 rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Emergency/Hot insert landing system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Ok, so this is really just a lot of parachutes. But it looks really cool and is fun as hell. Useful if you don\u0027t have the patience (skill) to land conventionally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Extreme agility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E LOTS of reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis aircraft is 100% stock, and flown using no cheats or hacks.
