Their primary use at a low tech level is either powering thermal turbojets or generating a large amount of electricity. The 2.5m and 3.75m unupgraded reactors have superior T/W with LFO over stock LV-Ns, although they are larger and heavier and have a lower ISP.

One of small 1x6 panels was giving me over 4,000 EC at one point in low kerbol orbit. Offhand and using that as a point of reference, I would say each gigantor would generate around 35-40MW in low kerbal orbit. You\u0027ll need around 130 to 135 gigantors (plus more to account for transmission losses the farther out you are beaming this power) to generate the 5 gigawatts required for max antimatter production in a lab. Remember that you can easily collect antimatter. A few days in optimal orbit aroun Jool with a couple dozen collectors will give you enough antimatter for dozens of missions. Send a freighter out there once every few years and you\u0027ll be drowning in antimatter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also get decent amounts of antimatter in kerbin\u0027s orbit and any I the planets/moons that are similar in size to Kerbin.
