I made a ship to do a 5,000,000km flyby of the sun then re-enter kerbin atmosphere. All went well, but as i was planning a heavy, steep and fast reentry i used the next size up heat shield (2.5m for a\u00A0 16 ton 1.25m re-entry package) with the default amount of ablative material (all of it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs i crossed 70km coming home, i noticed that half my ablator had disapeared before i hit atmosphere. I flew the mission again and watched the ablator levels. I didnt loose any on ascent, but it did slowly drain away while i was outside kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003Esoi\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a hefty heat source on the ship in the form of an NFE reactor, i believe its adequetly cooled (radiator dont exceed 50%).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould it be the reactor heat causing this, or heat from the sun, or maybe the game models solar wind ablation now?

I was running Nervas continuously for like 60 minutes. While the vessel itself was never at risk of blowing up, I did notice that the heat would start nibbling at my ablator, beginning at a temperature of ~480-500K. Really really slow at first, but over the course of an hour it adds up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess that something similar happened to you. Both your power source and close proximity to the sun are possible reasons. Timewarp may also have played into this, heat acts a little strange at 10x and 100x warp levels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my case, it turned out that no amount of radiators would suffice to keep the ablator safe.

Ill have to experiment a bit. Maybe the mechanic, like so many others, is disabled when shielded? Ill put an inline fairing over that part and see if that does anything on the next run.
