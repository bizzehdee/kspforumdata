Think its high time I at least try my hand at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m thinking since I\u0027m a little bit decent with doing meshes in blender that I\u0027d see if I could add some buildings to the Kerbin surface. Mainly, I think I\u0027d like to add some air ports at various places around the world where folks could land and see the sights. I have some ideas for other functionalities, but for now I just want to start small. So, here\u0027s the question, how difficult would these be for someone with very little coding experience (read: I wrote basic programs on my TI-83 in highschool), what tools will I need, and are there tutorials out there I can start with?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BrutalRIP","CreatedById":59065,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T12:11:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei will just leave you this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40374-WIP-KerbTown-v0-13-Beta-Place-static-buildings-cities-launch-sites-more\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40374-WIP-KerbTown-v0-13-Beta-Place-static-buildings-cities-launch-sites-more\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T14:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, based on Kerbtown:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46643-Kerbin-City-Community-Project\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46643-Kerbin-City-Community-Project\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a warm welcome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T15:16:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbin-Side.
