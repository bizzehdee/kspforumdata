You guys will get release soon after I get spacedock and CKAN hosting. However, my drive for this mod is abismal. I\u0027m lucky I managed to get around to compiling it. I have other things I want to spend my time on, and as such, I\u0027m putting the mod up for adoption. If there is a modder who wants to take care of the mod and keep it updated, then we can talk.\n\nMind you, I haven\u0027t fully tested the mod, and if there are parts that are broken, then they\u0027re broken and that sucks.
