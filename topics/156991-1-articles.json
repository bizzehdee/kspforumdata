Everything went according to plan, but the last mission required mining ore on Pol. The probe landed, but the excavators said theres nothing to mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe probe has just Ore tanks, 2 Big Excavators and solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont know whats wrong. Do I need to scan for ore? Becouse as far as I can remember, you could mine everywhere, scaning would just find a location where you can mine faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-26T09:44:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot of the time (possibly all of the time) there will be one biome on a Planet or Moon with zero ore concentration. If you don\u0027t have any ore scanning equipment try moving to a different biome and try again. If that doesn\u0027t work it may be that your drills aren\u0027t going deep enough into the surface to hit ore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cratercracker","CreatedById":171449,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-26T09:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it says that you can\u0027t mine somewhere it simply ,means that you need to land in different place. If it still says so, try to look at Pol\u0027s ore consentration. It might be very low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cubfan","CreatedById":174195,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-26T13:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222968124\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156991\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488097059\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164415\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SirLumbo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, SirLumbo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong.

You only get those contracts after you do an orbital survey, so I\u0027ll assume you\u0027ve done that (you already know you can\u0027t mine any planet/moon without a survey first).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a refueling station on Pol, and the most difficult part was finding a flat place to land and set up operations. The ore concentration is fine, but you have to be in the right spot, as cratercracker said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe drill should tell you the problem. If it says the ore concentration is too low, you\u0027ll have to land somewhere else. If it says no surface contact, your drills might be too low and aren\u0027t extending fully (small drills can have that problem). Hopefully, it\u0027s not the drills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck. Pol is a great place to watch Jool\u0027s moons zoom around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-26T14:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends on your difficulty level.
