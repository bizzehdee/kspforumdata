For example: a consumer Windows version is set up out of the box for a consumer direct usage scenario, i.e. it expects a person in front of the keyboard running interactive single-user software with fancy GUIs, and is configured accordingly. If you just want your computer to sit in the corner without a monitor connected and run some sort of server for 30 concurrent users, then there are indeed ways to tweak a consumer Windows to act more suitable to that purpose. A Windows Server release, on the other hand, will be configured the other way around out of the box.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust keep in mind that every gain is offset by a loss somewhere else, and unless you have an extremely specific scenario with an extremely specific optimization, the gains might maybe show up in benchmarks but certainly won\u0027t be noticable to the average human being.
