A few months ago, after many many emails, pm\u0027s and random requests I decided to go back and actually watch the TV show Serenity, as I sort of watched a few episodes and never ended up finishing it. Seeing it is only 1 season and a movie I figured I would give it another shot, and now admittedly I have to crumble and make this ship for KSP. For me, it fits the game well, while it looks space worthy and futuristic, it also looks like it is held together with tape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI lost alot of inspiration for mods I was working on, mainly due to them just not being all that great to put in the game, great in theory but when actually used.. some of them just seemed like way too much effort and would also be too resource consuming (You really need some high res textures for the Sulaco or it looks horrible) but the Firefly, this ship should fly fairly well once I am done with it. As I mentioned in my other thread, I am starting this with the pod and IVA and then will work backwards down the ship. I want to put a fair amount of effort into this one so I will do all the small and annoying things first to get them out of the way so I don\u0027t get lazy later on - if I do the IVA first I am sort of compelling myself to do the rest of the craft \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I might have made a few mods, but I\u0027ve also started about 50 projects and canned them, so I would like to see this one through that\u0027s for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know fair well there are plenty of Serenity fans out there, so please if you think my model is not right, or is incorrect please tell me, I want this to be spot on. I am trying to of course do it as low poly as possible,but still keep reasonable detail. I figure if there are 12 parts in total, at 1k per part thats only 12k for the entire ship which should be quite resource friendly. The half cockpit before mirror is 700 poly\u0027s, a tad high (it needs to be 500 before mirroring) but I\u0027m still cleaning it up. I am using obviously the TV show as a reference as that\u0027s possibly the best. To keep it neat, i\u0027ll finally get my butt into gear and use an imgur album, and will post the progress briefly below it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/1zsG3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
