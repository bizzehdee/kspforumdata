I such systems a single planet can go its entire \u0022life\u0022 without ever moving on the same path twice. There is no approximation in binary star systems. Unless You approximate to a couple of billion kilometres. Even so-called \u0022stable\u0022 orbits are just shortly prolonging the destruction. Binary systems can change in a time scale of 10 years - way to fast for game cycle. Again - we would need planets with \u003Cstrong\u003Echanging\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Enon-elliptic orbits\u003C/strong\u003E, and an \u003Cstrong\u003En-body physics\u003C/strong\u003E.

He then proceeded to explain in length how he made it, what problems did he encounter (kraken!) and how he managed to work around them.\u003Cp\u003EBasically warp drive in KSP will be nothing more than game creating a \u0022bubble\u0022 of space around the ship. The ship will be completely stationary in reference to the bubble, which will be the one being moved around the universe. It was done that way because in pre-kraken-dead times, accelerating to ftl speed would crash the ship. But this way the ship actually remains stationary - it\u0027s the bubble that\u0027s moving, and since from game engine perspective it\u0027s a solid object with no collision mesh and durability, kraken couldn\u0027t destroy it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the short version as I remember it.

The separation between Proxima Centauri and Alpha Centauri AB (itself a binary star) is 0.2 ly, and their orbital period is on the scale of hundreds of thousands of years, but they are still in orbit. In my (admittedly under-informed) opinion, two stars that are 300 AU apart (10x the distance between Neptune and the sun) could plausibly have planets with stable orbits around them (at least in the scale of millions of years). In Kerbal distances, that would be approximately 30 AU, a distance that Voyager traveled in about 10 years using only chemical rockets.

But let\u0027s say that we ignore physics such as fallout, radiation, deadly acceleration, heat ect. and implement this type of drive into the game. In what way are such means of travelling more realistic than warp drive? Because from where I\u0027m standing it\u0027s pretty clear that warp drive is just as impossible as Orion drive, in current day and age. The difference is that Orion has been attempted and failed - proven to be useless, and warp drive hasn\u0027t been attempted yet. Does the failure of Orion concept somehow gives it credibility over untested warp hypothesis? By that logic we should all start building bird-like wings out of wood and paper like ppl in renaissance. After all they failed in spectacular ways too. Well, I don\u0027t think so. With FTL warp drive there\u0027s at least possibility and SOME support in current physics. With Orion there\u0027s engineering, medical and economical proof of complete and utter failure. Perhaps If someone quickly built and tested a warp drive (and then fail to get any results) ppl wouldn\u0027t be so against it in the game? Because I\u0027m starting to think that\u0027s the problem. If FTL was something attempted in the past, it wouldn\u0027t raise an eyebrow.

But let\u0027s say that we ignore physics such as fallout, radiation, deadly acceleration, heat ect. and implement this type of drive into the game. In what way are such means of travelling more realistic than warp drive? Because from where I\u0027m standing it\u0027s pretty clear that warp drive is just as impossible as Orion drive, in current day and age. The difference is that Orion has been attempted and failed - proven to be useless, and warp drive hasn\u0027t been attempted yet. Does the failure of Orion concept somehow gives it credibility over untested warp hypothesis? By that logic we should all start building bird-like wings out of wood and paper like ppl in renaissance. After all they failed in spectacular ways too. Well, I don\u0027t think so. With FTL warp drive there\u0027s at least possibility and SOME support in current physics. With Orion there\u0027s engineering, medical and economical proof of complete and utter failure. Perhaps If someone quickly built and tested a warp drive (and then fail to get any results) ppl wouldn\u0027t be so against it in the game? Because I\u0027m starting to think that\u0027s the problem. If FTL was something attempted in the past, it wouldn\u0027t raise an eyebrow. That\u0027s because everyone assumes that if it\u0027s in the future - it\u0027s sci-fy (a very dirty word apparently), but if it\u0027s in the past - it\u0027s alternative history OR conspiracy theory (which makes it all better cause it\u0027s totally not sci-fy right?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait WHAT?
