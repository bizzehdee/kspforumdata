I have a vivid memory of playing with these handful of Legos and intuitively thinking: Spaceship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat passion for Lego eventually evolved into much larger SHIPs (Ex: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/kxNrM4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E#1\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/p6a9Tp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E#2\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/MH8TjE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E#3\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/kpN59e\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E#4\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/z1PkHD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E#5\u003C/a\u003E). But at that same time, I would pore\u00A0over the many versions of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Star_Fleet_Technical_Manual#/media/File:Star_Trek_Star_Fleet_Technical_Manual_cover.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStar Trek technical manuals\u003C/a\u003E, marvel\u00A0at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://technicalillustrators.org/files/2016/05/hans-jenssen-millenium-falcon.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eblueprints of the Millenium Falcon\u003C/a\u003E, and stand in fascinated awe at\u00A0the Space Shuttle in the early 80s. Add to that, basically 30\u002B years of\u00A0pop-culture spacecraft awareness, a dash of actual space history, a whole of of imagination, channelled into a digital medium that allows me to build \u0026amp; fly these things. Watching\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EStar Wars\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0movies literally more times than I can count, continuously consuming\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EStar Trek\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0for over 30 years, loving late-70s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EBuck Rogers \u003C/em\u003E(unaware of the monumental cheesiness)\u003Cem\u003E, \u003C/em\u003Ehyperactive over\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EBattlestar Galactica\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E(the 70s original, but then much more importantly, the 2004 reboot); really just about anything in the Sci-fi genre that might include\u00A0a vehicle maneuvering through the vacuum of space, or on alien planets, or heck even our own planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Kerbal Space Program, I\u0027ve found one of the best tools to express the combination of creative and analytical thinking that is spacecraft design. It\u0027s a pseudo-practical approach that, for me, makes this game endlessly playable and allows that expression. So even though it\u0027s a game, the fact that you engineer things in this game to actually fly adds an entire level of realism (or not... depending on your KSP playstyle) to the process. And while KSP \u0026amp; Lego are aspects of the same thing, i.e. working with a specific set of parts, creating something unique but not overbuilt; KSP allows me to take this newly created vessel for a spin around the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, you ask, what do I mean by \u0022pseudo-practical\u0022? A personal philosophy, I guess, that imposes a set of realistic parameters on an inherently unrealistic creation. Designing in a way that balances in-game mechanics with a broader use case for a spacecraft. Working with symmetry and aesthetics, while balancing the inherent asymmetricality of space technologies melding together into a ship. Maintaining the internal logic of specific part choices used in specific ways within an overall visual context, that hopefully comes across as both \u0022realistic\u0022 and creatively interesting at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find myself constantly evaluating the aesthetic choice of a set of parts in trying to meet a certain need, then reviewing whether those parts meet the game\u0027s technical needs, then going back to adjust how they mesh visually, then back to the parts specs... until many iterations later, an actual spacecraft evolves. Then I keep looking at it, noodling with it; taking away anything that strikes me as \u0022off\u0022 and in some cases completely re-working the craft. When I do orbital test runs, if anything jumps out at me visually, I usually re-work it. If the ship isn\u0027t meeting the technical needs of the mission, I re-work it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis goes on until I think I can\u0027t possibly make any more changes (then I usually find 1 or 2 more...) until FINALLY, I can\u0027t stop looking at it. There\u0027s nothing that my brain says, \u0022Wait. Change that.\u0022 It\u0027s odd to use the word \u0027perfect\u0027, but in a sense that\u0027s what it is. My brain has gone through just about every iteration until it just seems \u0027right\u0027 on all facets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a creative pride that comes from this iteration process. There\u0027s a sense of childlike whimsy when the thing can actually make orbit, or I can actually dock it, or the antennas extend, or the light and shadow catches it just the right way. The same feeling as when I was 6 years old making Lego ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I made a ship that flies through space.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-10T03:37:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2019 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by scottadges\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMore comments with pics to come (once the forum stops merging my comments....)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
