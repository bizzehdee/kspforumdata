That\u0027s a tall order, but theoretically doable. What if, instead of landing the astronauts, you leave them in orbit and land one rover per astronaut. Each one with certain specialized equipment. Each astronaut then spends 18 months working long hours driving them around, no need to tie up the DSN. You have one or more land close to a rocket capable of docking with your orbiting station in LMO so at the end of the mission you can bring back some samples.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, we don\u0027t get that sexy shot of humans standing on another world, but in terms of science we would have three curiosities running around, probably something more sophisticated. The real utility of this project comes from that 14 minute delay no longer being a problem. Any possible benefit of having humans on Mars with less risk, and without having to go all the way down to the surface. Which means it will be easier to bring them home. Which gets to the title of this thread, what is that 14 minutes (and a free DSN for other missions) worth? And, this tech can possibly be applied to longer missions to Jupiter or Saturn, where the delay time is more severe so you get a bigger benefit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-23T04:40:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts not an entirely new idea, you could add exploring the moons of Mars to the mix so the astronauts can plant the flag for expereince.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMain issue is however that the current rovers are under powered and slow as they have to cope with the signal delay anyway.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you want no signal delay you want an faster rover this require an nuclear reactor driving up weight.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-23T05:45:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTeleoperation from orbit has been talked about for quite a while.

First mission would mainly orbit for a some time and take pictures, burn towards home and tether their spent stage to give some sense of gravity. They\u0027d also bring station hub there. Other missions could bring more supplies than they need and more HABs\u00A0and so Mars station would get stocked up with all goodies necessary and with more room. Since other missions wouldn\u0027t need to carry heavy hub part they could carry rovers or more fuel for interesting stuff like Mars moon landings and eventually Mars landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ImmaStegosaurus!","CreatedById":160589,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-25T00:01:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222770265\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148425\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474605643\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257801\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 23/09/2016 at 7:40 AM, magnemoe said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want no signal delay you want an faster rover this require an nuclear reactor driving up weight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222770325\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148425\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474609514\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00227272\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 23/09/2016 at 8:45 AM, Nibb31 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason rovers are slow is because of size, power, and weight constraints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould power problems be solved by parking larger \u0022mothership/station\u0022 on synchronous orbit?
