This gives an input power of about 3.5 terawatts, giving the engine an efficiency of about 57%. ProjectRho didn\u0027t provide a value for the efficiency of this type of engine, but 60% is about what a beam-core engine gets, so that\u0027s probably about right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an added bonus, running the magnetic nozzle to contain all that uses power roughly equal to the maximum output of an upgraded 3.75-meter fusion reactor driving a direct-conversion generator in helium-3 mode. You could also use an antimatter reactor if you like, which would probably be easier anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis config file rescales the magnetic nozzle model for this part so that it now fits 3.75-meter parts, so don\u0027t worry about adding a module for it to that fix config someone posted a bunch of pages back if you\u0027re using that for the normal magnetic nozzles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used the standard rocket visual and sound effects for this part instead of the particles used by the magnetic nozzles. You can switch it back if you like, but I thought an engine this powerful needed some rumble and bright light. Instead of overheating like a normal engine, I supposed that this engine would be hooked into the ship\u0027s cooling system, so it now generates 50000 units of wasteheat per second when fully active that must be dissipated through radiators. I have tried this out in-game, and it works well - 50000 per second is significant enough to necessitate bigger radiators, and if the radiators reach maximum temperature, the reactor will shut down and cause the engine to flame out - a similar mechanic to engine overheats, but more forgiving. I\u0027m assuming 50000 heat/second is about 50 gigawatts of wasteheat, which is far lower than the other 43% of the 3.5-terawatt input power, but I think most of the lost energy is escaping in the form of gamma rays from the exhaust. I don\u0027t know how to add the radiation-death mechanic from the DT-Vista, but it would apply here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I did the math all wrong. The numbers should be fixed now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT AGAIN: Nope, I\u0027m just really bad at this. Now they\u0027re fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT EDIT EDIT: Just kidding! NOW the numbers MIGHT be right, but I have no clue because I was wrong about that three times already. Right now the antimatter usage is, according to my calculations, much too high for the power I said, but I have yet to see a single unit get used in-game (it should take about 5 minutes of full burn to use a milligram, which I guess I haven\u0027t done yet), so I\u0027m leaving it alone for game balance reasons. Why does the 405-GW antimatter reactor use the stuff so fast anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, some photographic evidence:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5r46khL.png\u0022 alt=\u00225r46khL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is on 2x physics warp, so the exhaust effect is further from the nozzle than usual.

You could also use an antimatter reactor if you like, which would probably be easier anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis config file rescales the magnetic nozzle model for this part so that it now fits 3.75-meter parts, so don\u0027t worry about adding a module for it to that fix config someone posted a bunch of pages back if you\u0027re using that for the normal magnetic nozzles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used the standard rocket visual and sound effects for this part instead of the particles used by the magnetic nozzles. You can switch it back if you like, but I thought an engine this powerful needed some rumble and bright light. Instead of overheating like a normal engine, I supposed that this engine would be hooked into the ship\u0027s cooling system, so it now generates 50000 units of wasteheat per second when fully active that must be dissipated through radiators. I have tried this out in-game, and it works well - 50000 per second is significant enough to necessitate bigger radiators, and if the radiators reach maximum temperature, the reactor will shut down and cause the engine to flame out - a similar mechanic to engine overheats, but more forgiving. I\u0027m assuming 50000 heat/second is about 50 gigawatts of wasteheat, which is far lower than the other 43% of the 3.5-terawatt input power, but I think most of the lost energy is escaping in the form of gamma rays from the exhaust.
