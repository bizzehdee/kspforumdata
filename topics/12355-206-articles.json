To be honest, the old way that MechJeb controls the plane will also give its own roll commands during attitude adjustment, especially when the attitude change is big, and that spoils player\u0027s roll channel control as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. With proper design, the roll damper can gradually decrease the strength when getting close to the target orientation, so that it won\u0027t bother you adjusting roll when the direction is almost correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Normally i don\u0027t think attitude change will be very big when you are in an atmosphere, a 45 degree of orientation change is really huge in atmosphere, especially when it\u0027s on yaw direction. Such sideslip angle will almost always induce the plane to roll due to aerodynamic forces given by wings, fuselage, vertical tail and rudder. A roll damper to slow down the roll at that moment should be beneficial instead IMHO. Besides, when the orientation change is not that big, e.g. 5 to 10 degrees, the roll damper won\u0027t give too much input to slow down the roll.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T09:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost likely a KSP issue.

What happens is it does the circularization burn, overshoots the node a little then points the engine at Eve with a low throttle setting and will not stop until I manually disengage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame thing with maneuver planner\u0027s circularization. Whether I have it do it right now or at apoapsis, same thing, does the burn then aims the engine down and idles. And it does it when I try raising the periapsis. Does the burn correctly, then aims down and idle instead of quitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all those cases the periapsis raises to where it\u0027s supposed to be, then drops. Build 168 does this with just about everything I\u0027ve flown with it. I\u0027ve worked around it by monitoring in map view then manually disengaging autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
