I\u0027m now wondering how to build the truck shown at the beginning. I\u0027m trying to connect structural parts together but since the connection points are only on the ends, it seems like it\u0027s impossible to even make a simple square or 90 degree angle. Can someone post a screen shot on how to connect structural pieces with 90 degree angles and such. Or just how to start building something like the truck in the video by starting the base framework he used?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSMjEMwbPHk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loppnessmonsta","CreatedById":58525,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T21:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDisable Angle Snap (press C) and the girders should attach nicely to each other.
