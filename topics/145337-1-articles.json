It makes no sense what so ever for Squad to spend dev cycles on something that is 100% frivolous and fluff. You like VR thats fine, thats cool, but, please understand its just not something we need for this game. Also, please understand that it could potentially require a major rework of the code either just in KSP or just in UNITY or BOTH and thats a quagmire no one wants to wade into. Squad has enough issues on hand with things like cargobays silently rendering things like solar panels and landing gear inoperable after the cargo doors move. Or landing legs exploding when a kerbal walks into them, or any number of other things we as end users are unaware of. Also, think about how many mods this game has, would you deign to ask the makers and maintainers of those mods to put time into making their mods work with VR? \u00A0I respect your enthusiasm, I really do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerrM\u00FC","CreatedById":78387,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-04T05:41:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few weeks ago I was given the oportunity to test the Vive for a few hours.
