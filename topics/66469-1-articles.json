This engine has been announced by SpaceX to power the biggest rocket ever built for their eventual MCT (Mars Colonial Transporter). Using the most recent figures that have been released, it will be a 10m core setup with 9 2.4m engines in the octaweb arrangement, each engine capable of 4500kN with a vac Isp of 363. The single core variant will be able to put ~150t into LEO, and the inevitable tri-core Heavy will be able to put a whopping ~500t into orbit, though with the intended re-usability factored in, these numbers will be significantly lower. The stated goal is to send 100t to Mars, which combined with ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization) capability, will allow the MCT to manufacture propellant on Mars for the return trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am in the process of creating some ISRU part configs, which can essentially be thought of as a realism overhaul of Kethane.
