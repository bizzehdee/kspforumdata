So I have two questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any parts that you can\u0027t put a docking clamp on and have it function? I have one part on a fuel tank, and one on the bottom of a fuselage.

The side that looks like a painted ring should be facing outwards. Since parts can be rotated around, it is possible to attach it the wrong way. If this happens, the two ports cannot get close enough to dock, and only bounce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, you say this craft has docked successfully once before. So maybe this is not the problem. More likely, it is due to a protruding part from another part of the ship. Maybe two wings are bumping into each other, or the landing gear, etc. If so, it can dock successfully when rotated a certain way, but bounces if rotated another way. Move the camera around and this becomes obvious if it is happening.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-09T20:54:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2013 08:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Zephram Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cuel","CreatedById":67851,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T21:23:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry turning off your ASAS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T3rran","CreatedById":67609,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T21:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThese two specifics did not dock together, a tutorial docking ship did, so I managed that.
