I had a post started, then my night became unfreed. I came back to it way later and got about half of it done, but when I went to post it, the forum logged me out and erased my post. I knew it would happen and I did ctrl\u002Bc my post, but for whatever reason it didn\u0027t actually copy so I lost it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s not really important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo. My probe idea came about while I was messing around in Blender. I added the cylinder mesh and thought to myself it\u0027d be pretty fun to try to make a brain in a jar probe core. I thought about it a bit and decided that modeling the brain would be tough and textures would be tough. I scrapped the idea and started working on a giant Kerbal head probe core, but the brain idea kept coming back and I couldn\u0027t shake it so\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i59.tinypic.com/34zn0vc.png\u0022 alt=\u002234zn0vc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make the brain mesh, I added a UV sphere and used the sculpt tools with symmetry around either X or Y until I had a shape I thought was reasonably identifiable. To make the texture map, I manually selected the polygons in the \u0022stem\u0022 and moved them to one corner of the UV map. I then exported the image and started making a placeholder texture in GIMP. All I did was lasso the corner with the stem, make solid noise, and colorize until I got that look. I then inverted my selection and did the same thing for the rest of the brain. It was originally supposed to be placeholder, but I actually kind of like how it turned out so I think I might keep it. There\u0027s only a few polygons that seem out of place on the model, which wouldn\u0027t take too long to fix in Blender, but I\u0027m more focused on finishing it rather than it looking perfect for the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i62.tinypic.com/359g3nt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022359g3nt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a few issues with texturing the jar at first. This isn\u0027t the exact problem I had, but it was pretty similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/2a8rfr9.png\u0022 alt=\u00222a8rfr9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically because the textures are one sided, I could see the outer shell of the jar, but looking through the \u0022glass\u0022 I couldn\u0027t see anything on the inside. My solution for this was just duplicating the cylinder and mapping the inside cylinder to a slightly modified texture. With one cylinder pointing outward and one pointing inward, the problem was fixed and I didn\u0027t need to figure out how to add depth to the model and further complicate the texture maps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i57.tinypic.com/33js87d.png\u0022 alt=\u002233js87d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the resized texture maps for the jar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/111sd28.png\u0022 alt=\u0022111sd28.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i59.tinypic.com/2vvpfuw.png\u0022 alt=\u00222vvpfuw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with all the modeling done, I exported and loaded up Unity for the first time.

I added the attachment nodes in blender and reoriented them in Unity, so that shouldn\u0027t be an issue. For the .cfg file, I just copied the OKTO\u0027s file and edited it. I removed the reaction wheels module because there\u0027s no space in the jar for reaction wheels to go, but I left the level 0 stability control I think. I also bumped up the power consumption a bit. One thing I really wanted from this probe was the ability to crew report with a transmission penalty, because I figured the brain could observe and record data about it\u0027s surroundings, but since it was \u003Cem\u003Eprobably\u003C/em\u003E pulled from a dead Kerbal, the ability to relay that information would be hindered. So if you wanted 100% value from the crew report, the probe would have to be recovered, and no more crew reports could be taken. At least in theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if a brain in a jar has been done before, but I\u0027ve never come across one. I was thinking that if I could find time, I\u0027d like to make variants of this design, like a dome/fishbowl design for aerodynamic purposes.

My classes finally started kicking into gear and it\u0027s been busy, so I haven\u0027t had a bunch of time to work on this (and the time that was available to work, I usually chose to relax instead).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI redid the textures for the casing like it was suggested so it\u0027s not a solid color anymore. The probe has also been resized to 0.625 m, so it\u0027s a little more believably-sized now. I also decided that I wanted to add at least one variant model. I ended up using the same textures for it, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s entirely necessary to have separate textures for these. With all that out of the way, here\u0027s the variant model:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i59.tinypic.com/2uhbbc0.png\u0022 alt=\u00222uhbbc0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s practically the same as the original model I designed, but it\u0027s a little more aerodynamic-looking (haven\u0027t tested in FAR to make sure it is), and it only has the bottom connection. I have dubbed it the Thinkin\u0027 Kap since it\u0027s probably going to \u0022cap\u0022 off your probe and yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i57.tinypic.com/1pclr5.png\u0022 alt=\u00221pclr5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe partial science transmission is still a thing, along with basic stability control but no reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original inline design is also an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i59.tinypic.com/20maz4.png\u0022 alt=\u002220maz4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=40078482561992679501\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI exported everything into a Unity Package, and hopefully it works?\u003C/a\u003E I didn\u0027t seem to have any problems with it exporting, but your results may vary I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeedback is welcome, all that jazz.
