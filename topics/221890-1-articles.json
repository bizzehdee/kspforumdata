How do I intercept another spacecraft?","CreatedByName":"ApexAZ","CreatedById":226124,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-23T18:39:13Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"ApexAZ","CreatedById":226124,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-23T18:39:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my previous experience with KSP1 is very limited and I\u0027m basically new to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI managed to land Jebediah on Mun with a make-shift lander that I cobbled together, collected the science, and launched him back to Kerbin.\u00A0 The problem is each design I built lacked enough fuel to slow the craft down for a safe re-entry.\u00A0 I probably spent 2-3 hours just trying different things, different ships, and different angles to minimize my fuel consumption and just couldn\u0027\u0027t get it.\u00A0 So long story short, Jeb is stuck in orbit and needs rescue!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of going back to the drawing board for the umpteenth time to try and find a more fuel efficient design, I decided to spend my science points on medium parts and a 3 person pod.\u00A0 I\u0027m thinking no biggie, I could just EVA Jeb to the new module.\u00A0Except, it\u0027s not so easy in practice.\u00A0 Once I got into orbit and saw Jeb\u0027s craft whizzing around Kerbin, I realized intercepting him is going to take some work.\u00A0 So the first thing I did was just create a maneuver to get my spacecraft on the same plane as his.\u00A0 This wasn\u0027t so bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, I set the target to Jeb\u0027s craft and attempted to create a maneuver that would intersect his orbit, which is super easy to do except for the fact I have no idea how to factor in the speed and timing so that we each reach the same point at the same time.\u00A0 So I spent about an hour on various game speeds to see if I was even closing the gap to where a window of opportunity to intercept his craft would open up.\u00A0 That didn\u0027t work out all that well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I adjusted my orbit so that it matched his as much as possible, but with a slightly smaller radius so that I could \u0022catch up\u0022 with him, and that actually worked out alright.\u00A0 I eventually started getting close to pacing him.\u00A0 The problems from there really stemmed from lack of fine movement control and I have some questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The navigation in map is really clunky and slow.\u00A0 For some reason it slows down and eventually reaches a point where I can hardly pan or rotate with middle and right mouse, because it barely moves.\u00A0 I also wish zoom had more steps, or finer control.\u00A0 I looked around in settings and didn\u0027t see any sensitivity or speed settings regarding map controls.\u00A0 Mouse movement speed seems to be random, but I always end up having to reset camera after a bit, else it becomes too unresponsive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 The pro/retro grade movements were too course when trying to line up my orbit with the other after getting them fairly close.\u00A0 The shift/ctrl default (I think 10%) was too much and I\u0027d easily overshoot the line overlap.\u00A0 Trying to use the throttle slide\u00A0 control with mouse is even worse and nearly impossible to get an exact throttle %.\u00A0 Is there a way to start the engine at only 1-2%?\u00A0 Or perhaps I need a smaller engine with less thrust that may help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0 Is there a standard procedure for doing this, and if so, does anyone have a guide they can share?\u00A0 Is there an interface tool similar to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E orbital transfer that I should be using instead that I haven\u0027t seen?\u00A0 I did some google searching, but didn\u0027t have a lot of luck.\u00A0 Found a couple videos of people struggling in similar ways lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like I had the right idea, but the UI and lack of fine control (or too much fine control at the wrong times) made me frustrated.\u00A0 But maybe there\u0027s a better way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance for any help to rescue Jebediah!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-23T18:45:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe
