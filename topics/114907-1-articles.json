However, KSP still relies heavily on the users to find and report bugs. If you find a bug, please check and see if it\u0027s already known. This thread contains bugs that generally affect all operating systems, and are specific to KSP. If your bug is not known, then check the bug reporting guidelines to give us the most useful information possible.\n\n[Known Issues and Self Help](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92228-Known-Issues-Self-Help)\n\n[Bug Reporting Guidelines](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide)\n\nThis thread contains questions that have come up several times, so hopefully this will help people out (many have fixes). This thread has information that is cross compatible between operating systems, but there might still be a few that are windows specific.\n\nPlease, always make backup copies of save files (or any files) before you edit them or update KSP.\n\nUPDATE KSP!\n\nFirst, make sure you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve updated to the most recent patch (refer to the title for the most recent version). You can tell which version you have by looking in the bottom right corner of the main menu screen or by checking the \u0022buildID.txt\u0022 file in your KSP installation directory.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ChangeLog:\n\u003E \n\u003E =================================== v1.0.4 ============================================================\n\u003E \n\u003E Bug Fixes:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Hot-Fixed an issue where loading vessels equipped with heatshields from pre-1.0.3 saves would cause the game to crash.\n\u003E \n\u003E =================================== v1.0.3 ============================================================\n\u003E \n\u003E New:\n\u003E \n\u003E Parts:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Added five new Radiator parts, three of which are deployable.\n\u003E \n\u003E Bug Fixes and Tweaks:\n\u003E \n\u003E Misc:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fixed a bug where using the reset button with an Asteroid loaded would break the Mun tutorial.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Made part\u0027s internal highlighter much more efficient.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Disabled flashing highlighter in temperature gauges.

That corrects so steep reentries are in fact deadlier than shallow ones.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Added conduction-changer module to Mk1 and Mk1-2 pods (necessary to not kill chutes), buffed heat shields for new heat loads. Changed burn/rip numbers for drogue chutes.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Parachute module updated to use the new convection code.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Skin temperature variables are controllable on per-part basis.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Sped up Flight Integrator slightly by minimizing repeated loops through parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Better compute various vessel values This should lower phantom orbit changing and wobble!\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Remove thermal mass as a factor in conduction rate: what matters is area.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Add conduction between parts\u0027 skins (as well as between the internals of parts, between a part\u0027s internals and its skin, and between the exposed and unexposed skin of a part, all of which were already in.)\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fix some small issues in conduction (better clamping), sped it up slightly.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fixed issue with radiation (no longer have to use dirty hack to prevent parts blowing up).\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Lowered skin thickness slightly globally, made magic number sane (part.skinMassPerArea is now in kg/m^2).\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Added Hsp (resource thermal mass value) to Ore resource.\n\u003E \n\u003E Parts:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Updated Mk1 Inline Cockpit model.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Further decrease in LV-N heat production.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Rebalance of SRB for the new drag changes.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* KR-2L description updated, mass to 9t, SL Isp to 255.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Jet thrusts rebalanced for new drag (thrusts lowered, BJE curves altered). Jet Isp halved due to increased fuel quantity and lower drag.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Lowered LV-N heat a bit, still a bit hot.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Edited KS-25x4 \u0022Mammoth\u0022 engine description.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Update description of radial-mount engines to recommend use for extra attitude control.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Mk1 fuel tank: uses same dry mass fraction and resource filling compared to its LFO counterpart as Mk2 parts do.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Radial attachment point cost lowered.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Shielded docking port radial attach node fixed.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Aerospike mass lowered as a buff (it needed a buff to compete with late-tier engines) and tangents fixed.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Heat shield thermal mass modifier increased to 0.05 to deal with increased heating. Max temp lowered to 3000 to avoid totally overpowered radiation heatloss.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Mk3 cargo bays have override cubes (they got missed when cargo bays got custom cubes) - should now have expected drag.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* New large landing gear have override cubes (cubes were reversed).\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Mk3 parts have breaking forces/torques specified and should no longer break on landing.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Mk2 cockpits have same breaking force/torque as other Mk2 parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Ablator resource heat capacity increased.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Rebalanced LV-1 to have Sea Level ISP of 80.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Rebalanced Poodle to have Sea Level ISP of 90.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* To fix spaceplane vs pod reentry and better allow hot reentries, temp is separated between part internal temperature and part skin temperature.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fixed some occlusion issues. Occlusion is now over-generous rather than under-generous.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Buffed heat resistance of spaceplane parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Added in CoL and CoP offsets for wing parts, no longer at the attach node.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fix for ablator and configs not taking skin temp into account.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fixed Radian vs Lat/Lon bug in Overlay and made displays more consistent.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fixed potential exploits with sci lab.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Removed transparency and added direct-attach node to heat shields.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Balanced heat shields for skin temps. A Mk1-2 straight-in reentry to Eve starting at 6.5km/sec surface (more orbital) is just barely survivable (ablator fully depletes), and regular Eve and Kerbin Munar reentries deplete about 1/6 to 1/4 the shield.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Added a tuning factor to conduction between parts with different shielded states, so a cargo/service bay won\u0027t conduct much to parts within it. Since radiation is disabled for parts within bays, they\u0027d just increase in temperature with no way to cool during reentry, and parts in bays would be the first to blow up on reentry.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Upped non-drogue chute default full-deploy altitude since pods were crashing before the chute fully opened.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Upped non-drogue chutes\u0027 stress/thermal limits for deployment (safe speed is now around 290m/s at sea level rather than 250). Increased the time to fully deploy slightly so less of a G shock.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Increased max temp of linear RCS, slightly decreased max temp of RCS quad.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Tweaks to fairings to change the skin:internal thermal mass distribution, and better protect parts inside fairings and cargo bays.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Not-Rockomax Micronode side stack nodes corrected.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Parachutes now have deployment warnings in the Part Action menu, when it\u0027s safe to deploy etc.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Halved intakeAir requirements for jets. Slightly raises service ceiling, mainly helps mitigate flameouts due to resource transfer issues.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Balanced thermal mass of drogue chutes to correct max opening velocities.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Attach node refinements on Wing Connector Type A and Structural Wing Type A.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Removed drag from Intake context UI.\n\u003E \n\u003E Modding API:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* flow multiplier curves can multiply thrust rather than flow.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Added method to convert string to ConfigNode.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Un-hardcoded altitude for navball velocity indicator to change modes.\n\u003E \n\u003E FX:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Heat animations for engine nacelles and 1.25m intakes.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* SR-71 style exhaust flame for TurboRamjet.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Nose and tail cones heat animation.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fixed incorrect transparency on the letter P on the UKSA flag.\n\u003E \n\u003E =================================== v1.0.2 ============================================================\n\u003E \n\u003E Bug Fixes and Tweaks:\n\u003E \n\u003E Thermal:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fixed ships potentially overheating when splashed down.\n\u003E \n\u003E Parts:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Small tweak to Mk16 parachute drag.\n\u003E \n\u003E =================================== v1.0.1 ============================================================\n\u003E \n\u003E Bug Fixes and Tweaks:\n\u003E \n\u003E Thermal:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Temperature gauge system.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Vessels which are splashed will now have much higher convective coefficients making them cool to ambient temperature faster.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Removed node size from being taken into account for stack occlusion. Added custom drag cubes for remaining hollow parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Parachute heating/burning.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fix for bug in FI dealing with unpacking vessels at analytic warp (\u003E=1000) rates.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fixed conduction on service bays. Added Module Conduction Modifier to help service bays not incinerate their contents \u0026 configs updated\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Updated emissivity for spaceplane configs.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Lowered heat production on LV-N.\n\u003E \n\u003E Resources:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Replaced overheat mechanic of the ISRU and drills with a skill-based mechanic.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Removed Overheat Throttle mechanic.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Increased mass of Ore tanks to match wet/dry ratio of stock tanks.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Aerodynamics\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* New values for physics global drag and lift multipliers.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Added a CoP offset calculation to procedural fairings\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fix for the aero debug drag arrows switching directions. Added body lift arrows (cyan)\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fixed occlusion on mk2 docking port.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fix for Laythe\u0027s atmosphere.\n\u003E \n\u003E Solar Panels:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Solar panels now use the proper inv square from FI\u0027s solar flux.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Removed obsolete power curves from solar panels.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Rebalanced solar panels against each other.\n\u003E \n\u003E Career:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Doing science at the flagPOLe, the north POLe, or the south POLe, will no longer mark Pol as visited with the progress tracker.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Science contracts and science World Firsts can no longer be triggered with science gained by reverse engineering recovered vessels.

I have a non-modded fresh install and experience both of these issues immediately. For example, with just a capsule with a parachute attached, if I turn SAS on and align my trajectory perfectly retrograde, then tell a 5-star Jeb to \u0022hold retrograde\u0022, he moves the position of the ship so that on the Navball it\u0027s about 3/8 of an inch away from the retrograde marker. This happens even in space, with no atmosphere to give him problems. When I switch to \u0022assist\u0022 it works fine, and there\u0027s also no jitter. So the \u0022hold (whatever)\u0022 is currently useless. And FWIW, before deleting/reinstalling clean (again), I tried the \u0022Claw fix\u0022 addon and it didn\u0027t help.\n\nEdit: If needed I can make a short video tomorrow and post it on Youtube, and link it here. What\u0027s weird is that I could have sworn last week Jeb had no problems holding positions. Now he can\u0027t even get within a 1/4 of a Navball\u0027s distance from the marker... And I reiterate, I uninstalled, deleted everything that was left over (logs, etc), and just downloaded a fresh install from Steam and played it with no mods.\n\nEdit 2: Here it is.

With fuel tanks and engines attached, they have no problems keeping the correct vector heading.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T13:11:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Targa**"},{"CreatedByName":"dimitriy","CreatedById":148178,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T16:07:51Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know is this a bug, but parts overheating and explosion from the engine exhaust is no longer occurs or it is very hard to achieve."},{"CreatedByName":"Kedwin Hubble","CreatedById":124939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T19:49:30Z","Content":"In the forums, on Reddit, and on the bug tracker, there are various phantom/runaway/unexplained overheating bug reports.

A good add-on fix is to install Tweakable Everything, it lets you set the amount of torque in every axis in the VAB/SPH (from zero kN to twice the stock value) and adds a force percent slider available in flight.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In the forums, on Reddit, and on the bug tracker, there are various phantom/runaway/unexplained overheating bug reports.

It happens both with very low mass parts (notably making octogonal struts very dangerous to use) and clipped parts. It can be triggered by physical and on-rail timewarp, ship loading, docking, etc. It caused major issues for me when I was building a very large space station because I clipped RCS tanks inside a structural parts on my RCS tugs, lots of stuff would randomly explode when docking modules or even loading the station. KIS/KAS doesn\u0027t like this bug either, parts attached with it seem to be very susceptible to these overheating issues. With all the frustration this bug caused for me I\u0027ve been trying to find a fix but there doesn\u0027t seem to be aything other than not using cubic octogonal struts and never clipping stuff inside other parts."},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T15:32:40Z","Content":"Can we add this to the list ?\n\nCannot place manoeuver nodes between ship and next AP/PE or AN/DN.
