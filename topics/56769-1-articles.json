(dont ask me how many kerbals I\u0027ve stranded on the mun, from lack of having fuel to get them home, but a solid mun lander design is not what I\u0027m after here). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer, looks interesting. I\u0027ve built up a fair bit, and managed to get some research points... somehow. I\u0027ve got the goo container, etc, but thats about it (stage 1 research). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you build up research to unlock all the extra toys. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso far I\u0027ve done EVA at ground, and orbit, soil samples of water and the landing base, goo samples during ground, acelleration and orbit. But short of breaking my trend and managing a safe landing on the mun WITH Return, I dont see how could get more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the various area\u0027s have different EVA stuff? so, if I do an eva say, on a polar ice cap, and get soil samples there, would that help me get more points?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dedjal","CreatedById":57220,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T23:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.

Even if I\u0027m not on top of my game with them, I still manage to get to orbit with around 90/110 or so fuel left, which is enough for a low Minmus flyby followed by a quick Mun flyby on the way home (even a low one if I have enough fuel and time it right). Thanks to the addition of Minmus\u0027 biomes, this is even more profitable than before, especially since it\u0027s very easy to get EVA reports on at least 3 Minmus biomes during a low-pass flyby with a periapsis of ~10KM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaelin","CreatedById":74901,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T23:37:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm. Now I think I remember you could use just one, say, bio thing for multiple places.

Putting a small tank and one LV-909 on top of enough T-30\u0027s to get into orbit is enough to do a Mun flyby. It\u0027s enough to land actually.. but you\u0027re asking about avoiding that.

Recover the pod, and unlock Basic Rocketry and Stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd launch--put goo containers and the chute on the pod. If you design well you can get into a polar orbit where you can suck up EVA reports on all the biomes.

You may need another flight to get all 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd \u0026amp; 4th launches--you now have enough bits to put together a craft that will do a flyby of Mun and Minmus (separate trips!). Take goo and the materials bay with you. You will make a hefty amount of science from these trips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom here on, I recommend exploring Minmus first until you get the Poodle and Skipper engines unlocked as you need far less delta-v compared to Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helped!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
