Because it is about the same procedure I follow on my SSTOs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think perhaps when you are pitching up you are pitching up to much on the burn stage. It is causing the airflow to become to strong at the front of the craft, moving the CoL forward and thus pitching you end over end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf B is happening the issue is your CoL is moving back as you go faster, mach tuck. This issue is pretty common in SSTO space planes expecially ones with canards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is happening you are losing lift on your canards they are stalling out at those speeds and at the AoA you are attempting to get them to pitch to.

I try to keep from using canards for this reason. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can fix most of this by reducing the amount of pitch authority this control surfaces have.

It\u0027s not compulsory; so long as you maintain any climb rate at all, an increase in speed will eventually lift your apoapsis into space. Particularly with low-thrust high-efficiency rocketry (e.g. Poodles or nukes, rather than RAPIERs or Aerospikes), a shallow ascent is often best; let your wings do the lifting while the thrust is concentrated on increasing speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Challenges/Akademy%20Awards/Kerbodyne%20Invasion/screenshot180_zps75ad6a47.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot180_zps75ad6a47.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Increasing your AoA by too much is going to cause your plane to want to go out of control. If you\u0027re getting stall warnings, you\u0027re increasing AoA too much and too fast. You need to lead the plane rather than force it; increase AoA by a bit, then wait for your prograde vector to catch up, then increase a bit more, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* In the upper atmosphere, the thin air limits the grip available to your aerodynamic surfaces, reducing their ability to maintain stability. For a sufficiently well-built plane this isn\u0027t a problem, but for when it is: Vernors. Stick a few around the plane in relevant places (e.g. above, below and to either side of the nose and/or tail) and keep them turned off until you need them. Vectored thrust can compensate for a lot of aerodynamic flaws.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Sorting out these issues is what the FAR analysis screens are for. It would help us help you if you could post some screenshots of the analyses. What would be relevant is an AoA sweep at the speed at which you tend to lose control (that will tell us how much AoA your plane can take while retaining stability) and a stability derivatives analysis at the same speed with the atmospheric density set to match the altitude at which it happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not sure how to do these, have a look at post #3 in the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKerbodyne\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E thread linked below.

This will increase your CoM/dCoM offset a bit, but you can balance that out by shifting the lateral tanks backwards.

This design is proving to be a lot harder to take off. It does take off, but way late into the runway, with me pulling the stick all the way up.

(My AoA at this point is near 3-4 degrees)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Immediately, I start experiencing the plane wanting to destabilize. Usually, this happens with a sudden change in pitch. Sometimes, it also changes roll or yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. SAS tries to correct this, minor wobbling happens. I\u0027m either losing altitude, or going into a large AoA/stall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. Loss of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, first up, you\u0027re switching from jets to rocketry much too early. You want to run the jets on their own for as much of the flight as you possibly can. So, don\u0027t switch to rocketry as soon as the jets start losing power; save the rocketry for when the jets are completely incapable of producing thrust at all (i.e. flameout). At the time the rockets come on, you want to be doing at least 1,500m/s at an altitude of at least 30,000m. Have a read through the piloting guide in post #2 of the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKerbodyne\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E thread or listen to my piloting tutorial on the latest episode of the Kerbal Podcast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe loss of control immediately post rocketry is most likely the plane reacting to the sudden change in thrust and the alteration of gimballing ability. Use the right-click tweakables to turn the thrust limiter to zero on the jets, then use RCS build aid to check your engine-induced torque from the rockets. Then turn the jets back to 100% and the rockets down to zero and do the same for the jets. Just because all of the engines together are balanced doesn\u0027t mean that the jets or rockets are balanced on their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zeenobit\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zeenobit\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre you referring to this mod?\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96654-PID-Tune-%28No-Longer-Available%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96654-PID-Tune-%28No-Longer-Available%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like it\u0027s no longer available. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E It sound very useful even for rockets.
