Remember how tough it was to learn to get to orbit when you first started playing KSP? This is even easier because only a few things have changed, plus there are dozens of tutorials and videos to help you out.\n\nYou have a couple options. You can politely ask on the forums for advice, maybe posting pictures of your rocket designs, and folks will be happy to help. Or if you truly think it isn\u0027t worth the effort, then you could just stop playing KSP and do something else with your time that you enjoy more.

Let\u0027s say, nosecones. Increased the mass and the drag of a craft with no upside other than looking better/right.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E To both I would say maybe try a fresh download and install, and see if anything behaves differently.

I find that a TWR of 1.8 will push a craft transsonic, but one of 1.7 won\u0027t, for reasonably aerodynamic craft. Mind you this isn\u0027t just the at-launch TWR, so SRBs would have to be throttled well below a starting TWR of 1.7 and liquid fuel engines will usually have to be adjusted in flight.\n\nPiloting comes down to two rules. The faster you go, the stronger the aerodynamic forces on the craft get, so if aerodynamics is trying to flip it, going fast is bad. The farther from prograde you aim the craft, the stronger the lateral aerodynamic forces on the craft get, so again, if aerodynamics is trying to flip the craft, steering too far from prograde will flip the craft.

I like the new stock aero better than old, the trick is to look at where your rockets center of mass will be *WITH EMPTY TANKS*. Full tanks are heavy. Empty tanks are light. If you have a rocket with a long stage on it you end up with most of the weight at the back, which makes your rocket flip. Look at how bottle rockets work, heavy nose, light tail. That\u0027s what makes for stability.\n\nThe other tricks are: Don\u0027t go too fast. Don\u0027t turn too quickly. If you are going a reasonable speed (especially in the transonic region), have a sanely designed rocket, and aren\u0027t turning outside the prograde marker, add fins.\n\nAll that said, I like nuFAR better than the new stock, as it has IMO a saner drag model."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T19:24:43Z","Content":"It just takes practice.
