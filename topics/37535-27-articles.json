Some very simple changes on their end to make it behave like engines on the resource usage would be brilliant, but unlikely to happen in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than going as far as a dummy transform I\u0027d just rotating the Transform \u0022Wheel\u0022 by the ammount you think is missing on the axis. Pull appart multiwheels source if you like for a look at that, but I\u0027d say that\u0027s a much better solution less likely to break things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bouncyness I believe is down to the ModuleLandingGear\u0027s graphical behavior being driven off of a physics raycast, rather than the WheelHit location. I can tell why they\u0027d do it - physics raycast is accurate inside the same frame. WheelHit is a frame slow on position output (but just add on your vessel velocity * dtime and its fine) The problem is that physics raycast seems to hit a collider on some layer that vessels can\u0027t when going down the runway (but the physics raycast will hit them). Its probably something to do with how the runway clear check works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, if you want to solve the bouncy graphics on the runway problem, don\u0027t use ModuleLandingGear. You\u0027re welcome to base your gear off my Modules if you like instead, but I can understand why you\u0027d rather not since you\u0027re trying to stick to augmenting stock games here. You could use Stock Wheel Module with an animation module on top. Again check my source code if you like for doing your own animation module for the gear, if you want to do it that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M.Wolfy","CreatedById":76904,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T05:06:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emy response to the bird thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbals found this on a probe that came from deep space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.astrobio.net/articles/images/sounds.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sounds.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand now they play its recording during they\u0027re free time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Marscommander","CreatedById":46705,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T03:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022M.Wolfy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022M.Wolfy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Emy response to the bird thing:\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbals found this on a probe that came from deep space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.astrobio.net/articles/images/sounds.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sounds.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand now they play its recording during they\u0027re free time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s probably where they got the nuclear generator idea from \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BobbyD55","CreatedById":80993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T07:31:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow this looks amazing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qnistNAMEERF","CreatedById":80995,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T15:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI stumbled on this thread earlier and have spent the last several hours reading the entire thing.
