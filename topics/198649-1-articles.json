Blender is a steep learning curve but there are lots of online tutorials. Another route is to use Wings - I\u0027m not sure how much easier that is as I don\u0027t use that myself - there are some tutorials for that and I think Beale(?) made some specifically for KSP parts - sorry but I don\u0027t have the links - shouldn\u0027t be too hard to Google. Once you get a model made by whatever means, you need to get it in game. You can do this by running it through Unity (Should be online tutorials - event the old ones should still be good) or, if you\u0027re using Blender, there\u0027s a direct \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/40056-12-17-blender-283-mu-importexport-addon/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EBlender to KSP .mu format converter\u003C/a\u003E that some people use.
