Leave enough room for liquid fuel only. Set \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E to atmospheric mode and altitude about 15 km up or so. You want to be going faster than 1 km/s surface speed and at this altitude before going closed cycle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, switch the Rapiers back to air-breathing mode, and design the air-breathing part to get to that altitude and speed on air-breathing mode only, so that when you get to over 1 km/s you can cut over to closed cycle and climb the rest of the way up. Add liquid fuel only tanks such that you don\u0027t use any liquid fuel from your rocket fuel tanks. Ideally you want to have an exact match of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and OX when you cut over to closed cycle, or maybe have a slight excess of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E so you can fly around a bit after re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea is to fly up as high and fast as you can on air breathing mode, then you\u0027re already 1 km/s or even more speed-wise when you cut over to closed cycle. By having enough closed cycle delta-v at that altitude and speed, you actually only need to speed up by an additional 1300 m/s but you will be fighting atmospheric drag while doing that. By having a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E slightly more than one, you can overcome that drag and just point prograde until you get to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose Mk2 parts are very draggy when your angle of attack (angle away from Prograde) is more than a couple of degrees, so you\u0027re going to find yourself cruising at low altitude while you pick up speed, before you try to start climbing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have designed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E heavy lifters with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of only 0.5 or so, but those were designed for Ferram Aerospace\u0027s drag model and I relied a lot on hypersonic lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Do you have a craft file we can inspect?

I suspect that real problem, in your case, is the ascent profile. Or, on second glance, maybe you\u0027re really not carrying enough fuel. The last picture shows you running out after four minutes of flight time, which *is* early.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor starters, I\u0027d suggest you try it with a smaller and simpler vessel that can only make orbit and come back, without carrying any payload or fulfilling any kind of mission. This makes for short test cycles; any lessons learned can then easily be applied to bigger craft that are actually good for something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-26T16:29:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the above posts have\u00A0missed the main point. To get where you are with the fuel you have left -- you have to have gone the entire way in \u0022closed cycle\u0022 mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRapier engines have two modes, as mentioned above. \u0022Closed cycle\u0022 mode turns your engines into rather poor quality rocket engines. \u0022Airbreathing\u0022 mode turns your engines into jet engines. In airbreathing mode, your engines use only liquid fuel -- and use it moderately\u00A0efficiently. You can switch between modes by clicking a button in the context menu, but the smarter way is by using an action group, because that will switch all four engines at the same time. The engines will also automatically switch from airbreathing to closed cycle mode at somewhere around 29km altitude, but that is probably later than you want for this design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaie\u0027s point about drag is also valid. To be truly functional, a spaceplane needs to be very carefully optimized for drag -- and your design needs some drag reduction work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut back to the engines: what\u0027s the point of having the two modes? To get to space, you can\u0027t go the whole way with jet engines. They run out of air halfway up. So you need rocket engines too. Rapier engines give you both kinds of engines in one package. But that\u0027s how you have to use them. Put them in airbreathing mode to start with, as said above. Fly halfway to space and build up a lot of speed using your liquid fuel. Then switch to rocket mode, burn your oxidizer and most of the rest of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E, and get the rest of the way to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
