I had previous launches with the same mod setup without issues so I\u0027m wondering what is wrong.\n\nMy first stage engine just shuts off for no apparent reason, just after SRB burnout. They burn normally until that point, but suddenly shuts down with an indication of Very Unstable fuel flow in the engine states.\n\nI looked in the output\\_log file and found this line.\n\n    (Filename: C:/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/StandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 56)FuelFlowPotential = 0.00 Failed: True\n\nI saw my fuel flow of the engine suddenly drop from Very Stable to Very Unstable when it shutoff, so I think this is the line in question. Although I will post the full output\\_log file for reference.\n\nEngine ignitor is old and was patched to work in 1.0 so there might be a problem there, but I\u0027m not certain.\n\noutput\\_log:\n\n[https://kie.nu/2BMM](https://kie.nu/2BMM)\n\nIf anyone can take a look at the log and figure out what is wrong, I\u0027d be very grateful.\n\nEDIT: I\u0027ve tried removing Engine Ignitor from the game and the rocket flew nominally.
