Both craft need to be loaded and running a program though, ships on rails will not run kOS programs. You can have one vessel write to a file, while another polls/listens for changes. kOS does not like a file being accessed by two instances at the same time though, so you might have to invent some mechanism to prevent simultanuously reading and writing a file. This could for instance be achieved by reading on even times (1:30:24, 1:30:26 et cetera) while the other craft writes on odd times (1:30:25, 1:30:27 et cetera).
