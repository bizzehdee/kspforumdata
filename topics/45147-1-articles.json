The LADEE satellite is being launched in to orbit tonight from Wallops. Supposing clear skies, and it looks like it, it should be visible for about 500-600 miles North-South and about 200-300 miles west. Granted, if you are really far away it is going to be a pinprick darned low on the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really have to go and see a launch in person one of these days. I am about 130 miles away, but my in-laws live about 20 miles away, so I can always go and visit them for a couple of days around a launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScheduled for 11:27pm EST.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"roosterr","CreatedById":61317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T21:13:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, here is at least one source to watch the launch.

I used to watch as many Shuttle Launches/Landings as possible and almost never miss a SpaceX launch. The experience is even better now than before because of all that I have learned from playing KSP and related research of the subject of rocket science. In the old days I did not really pay attention to what flight ops was saying over their comm\u0027s. Now I understand most of it and it adds a ton to the launch and even is a learning experience. If there is something spoken that I dont understand, I look it up. Term\u0027s like MECO or MAX Q, I heard many times, but never bothered to understand it until I started playing KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WillHop","CreatedById":67486,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T22:29:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E i will certainly give it a try with this one\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T00:03:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd if u can one day try and see one in person.
