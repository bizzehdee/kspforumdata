I am CERTAIN that I am using them right!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that I\u0027m using them right because they DO get pushed away from the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is not how \u0022hard\u0022 they get pushed away, the problem is that they get pushed FORWARDS, not SIDEWAYS as is required to get them out of the way of the rest of the rocket! I\u0027ve lost count of how many time\u0027s I\u0027ve ended up having my rocket run right into the just-ejected fairings, tearing off solar panels, antennas, sensors, landing legs, rover wheels, and even entire radially-attached miniature communications satellites on a few occasions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can solve it using \u0022The Jebediah Kerman Method\u0022 aka More Boosters (in the form of sepratrons attached to the fairing parts), but it would be quite useful to be able to have the fairing parts get pushed away sideways instead of to the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Had a brainstorm right after I posted. I think I figured out how to fix the issue, and the best part is that it should only require a .cfg edit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, the fairing nosecone parts work as standard decouplers, and the fairing connection nodes on the fairing bases are oriented so that a stock fuel tank (ex. a FL-T800 long 1.25m tank) connected to one of those fairing nodes will be oriented parallel to a fuel tank attached to the payload nodes or the node to connect the rest of the booster to. That\u0027s why they get ejected forwards! All that needs to be done is to change the orientation axis of those nodes to point out to the side instead of forwards, and it should fix the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest fairing base and fairing nosecones to fix this for will be the 1.25m and 2.5m fairing parts, because there\u0027s only the 2 clam-shell halves and they line up with one of the coordinate axes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll use a line from the \u0022KW1mExpandedFairingBase\u0022 part\u0027s config file as an example to explain what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s one of the fairing attach nodes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enode_stack_connect1 = 2.4, 2.051, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose numbers stand for \u0022PosX, PosY, PosZ, AngX AngY, AngZ, Size\u0022 respectively. The \u0022AngX, AngY, AngZ\u0022 values are what are going to need to be tweaked. Since \u0022AngY\u0022 is already at 1.0, that\u0027s the one that points forward/back. Set it to 0.0, then set either the \u0022AngX\u0022 or \u0022AngZ\u0022 to 1.0 or to -1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe remaining 4 possible combinations (2 axes * 2 directions) will result in the fairings being ejected in one of 4 remaining directions (left,right,up,or down {in no particular order}). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll you need to find is the one that results in the fairing nosecone sections getting pushed directly away from the center of the fairing base part, and then set the rest of the fairing nodes on that side to that combination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the fairing nodes on the opposite side, you already have the answer you need, just invert the sign of the same number you figured out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if the left nodes ended up \u0022xpos,ypos,zpos,1,0,0,size\u0022, the right nodes will be \u0022xpos,ypos,zpos,-1,0,0,size\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should cover the 1.25m and 2.5m fairing parts.

You would attach one side at a time, grab the nose to see if it fits, if not then return it and grab another side and so on. With the nose added first you can place it to the first/best place and then fill in the sides. Since the anchor points are spaced correctly this always works out and makes constructing the noses just a whole lot faster.
