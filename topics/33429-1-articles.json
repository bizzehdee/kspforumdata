A simple station in orbit to learn the basics of rendezvous, then move on with multi-modular ones. Oh, and BTW, for the part count, don\u0027t strut your station.The thing is that the struts, once decoupled and properly separated still count as a part. So, avoid if you can strutting your payload. Also, try to make something to learn. And then, make something cool. But first, as I said , make something useful. Then you\u0027ll get the hang of it in no time.

If a station module is too heavy to launch without struts, you can use a pair of docking ports to create a cowling to reinforce it instead, though its mass will eat into your dV and you will want to make sure the parts connect properly. You can also setup an action group to eject the cowling once you no longer need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/G75N2rs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G75N2rss.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022G75N2rss.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/t5EKFNn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t5EKFNns.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022t5EKFNns.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/cAF03pB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cAF03pBs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cAF03pBs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for docking, it can be much less frustrating to do in steps (zero relative velocity at ~200m, align ports, move to ~100m, zero velocity, align ports, etc.) especially when your RCS ports aren\u0027t balanced around your ships CoM.

If you\u0027re not using FAR, nosecones are worse than useless. Ditto antennas without remotetech or telemachus.

If your electrical needs don\u0027t include rover wheels or ion engines, then solar panels and batteries aren\u0027t really necessary.
