I\u0027m building a base on Minmus, and so far, every one of my landings (except the robotic lander, it started 70KM away) did not land in the same place practically, and my last two rovers (second pictured below, Fuel Transporter) had to drive the rest of the way. The one below landed at 6.7km away (I\u0027m halfway there), the other one landed maybe 2-3KM away, don\u0027t remember.

To account for rotation you\u0027ll need to aim slightly to the East of your target so that by the time you\u0027ve reached the ground the surface will have rotated underneath you. A stop and drop, almost vertical approach is generally easier to get close to a target than a shallow entry angle (although it will burn more fuel) and a higher thrust to weight ratio will help to minimise burn time allowing you to stop dead when you\u0027re over the target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T22:34:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb.
