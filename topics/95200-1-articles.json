But there are some problems that can make it almost impossible to get the contracts. When the triggers for making the contract show up are unclear, unintuitive, and easy to break, you have a situation in which players who don\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing will try going to a body they haven\u0027t been to, hoping to make some great discovery. The last thing you want to do is make that discovery be that they jinxed their contracts and prevented themselves from getting the explore for the place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T02:22:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat specifically do you think is wrong with these contracts?
