The other day, I saw a guy on KSPTV Get frustrated at landing in the mun\u0027s highlands again. With new biomes coming, return trips to bodies could be described as \u0022cool, I found a new biome. How lucky!\u0022. There are biome maps available, and mapping mods such as scansat, but sometimes a 2d map can be hard to visualize in a 3d way. Therefore I propose an integration of biome mapping to the R\u0026amp;D center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe archive section of the R\u0026amp;D center already lists biomes and bodies. An easy(ish) way to visualize collected data would be to present a 3d model of the body with visited biomes highlighted. This could help prevent repeat visits while keeping the discovery of new biomes unknown and exciting. Another useful device would be to mark landing sites from this map that can be seen in map mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t really a problem solving idea, just something that would be nice to have. Biome maps already exist elsewhere. However, I believe this would only add to the experience of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
