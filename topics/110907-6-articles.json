I think my main point was yah this game is more fun for me with mods, so I was kind of curious what reasons people had for playing stock. Not to refute anyone or tell them that\u0027s stupid, just to know why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty much this. It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t know how to calculate the dV or maneuver modes, it is just not fun for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is why KSP is one of my top ten best games of all time. It\u0027s highly mob-able and there are tons of great mods available. Stock is fully enjoyable without needing mods, but people looking for certain quality of life improvements or different challenges can find plenty!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T06:15:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI play stock mainly because.
