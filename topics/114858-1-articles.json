If the Kerbal dies within a certain time of EVAing (say 1.5 seconds) while under that set speed then respawn him in the command seat he occupied just moments ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If the game engine has a way of knowing if an object is above or below the surface, then you could teleport the kerbal a few coordinate points away from his craft, and above the surface when it detects the Kerbal going underground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really have no idea how to solve it or if it can even be solved, but I occasionally lose a pilot like this and its always frustrating.
