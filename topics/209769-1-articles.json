Like say you are doing a mun mission, and you have like 4 different quests where 1 is test some part in escape trajectory then another one is take science data from higher space, another one is rescue a kerbal from mun surface, to plan all these sub missions a ingame planning tool could be pretty useful and immersive like a sticky note or whiteboard that you can bring up on click on which you can write or draw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I know there is supposed to be an ingame trip planner based on what parts you are using and the destination but I dont think you can like jot down your goals and sub missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically what I am saying is a tool for visual design and algorithm tool for reference of what future missions you plan on doing would be helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf nothing else just make the game awesome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-17T16:58:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a great idea. Since folks will probably be into even more complex mission profiles it would be amazing if the route players laid out in the mission planner was attached to vessels or even subassemblies so you could go back and see and edit it after it was launched to keep track of where everything is going. A notes section would be a great addition.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ember12","CreatedById":217583,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-17T17:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree.\u00A0 I\u0027ve flown many missions where I forget to run science at some point, and this would be a great way to solve that issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-14T13:40:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also agree, if I come back 2 weeks later to the game I completely forget what I should do and at what stage each mission is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReminder alarms would also be useful and help us follow the mission plan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-10-14T13:43:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2022 01:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Vl3d\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
