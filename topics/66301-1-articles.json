This is the first and only forum I have ever met which forgets that there are threads or posts which I have not seen yet and it sometimes gets rather uncomfortable as I am missing on replies and updates which I don\u0027t want to miss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes when I come here, \u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E is marked as unread. And in general, things older than a few hours get unmarked even though I have not seen them. Some other times my own posts are marked as new updates. I don\u0027t get it. And I don\u0027t like it. I went all through options and settings and did not find anything that looks like it\u0027s related to that.

But problems appear all the time, not just when I switch between the two. I might try to copy the cookie between the two but if the forum keeps all my sessions still open it might be problem because I have changed the PC both in work and at home recently and I may have sessions to those old PCs still open, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-20T11:28:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2014 11:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
