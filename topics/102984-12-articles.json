Then I boarded a spaceship into a city on an asteroid that looked a lot like the Soho neighborhood in London with many strange, colorful (and perverted)\u00A0shops. I chilled there until a voice said the meteor was going 2 crash into the sun. Many people left but I wanted to enjoy until the last moment, so I wandered the streets, a steppe in the edge of the city,\u00A0and a part of the city that looked like a balnearium while the sun grew large in the sky\u00A0until I hitched a ride in a ship and left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, back on Earth a giant Chinese Space Fire Dragon grabbed the asteroid in the middle of its orbit and strapped it on its back, took a dive in the corona of the sun and threw the rock at the planet. The news said that the spacerock\u00A0was going to turn all\u00A0Asia into a new ocean in 24 hours, so I went to India and Japan in the same day before they were destroyed.\u00A0I saw the meteor coming down in Tokyo with no one there, feeling like Arthur Dent from the Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy (I think I even had a towel) and I woke up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI swear I don\u0027t want to nuke a continent nor suicide in the explosion \u0026lt;:[\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-31T22:29:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2018 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Nailed it!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-04T00:47:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo about two weeks ago I had this dream inside CS:GO, I was playing on a map that looked a lot like Cache, except it was basically two warehouses (each team\u0027s spawn) facing each other. Each team had I\u0027d say about 10 or 12 players, many of the people I used to play with were on mine (we were playing as the counter terrorists), and we were wrecking the other team. About 6-7 rounds in, when we spawned a friend of mine shot me (friendly fire), and I said something along the lines of \u003Cem\u003E\u0022who dared to shoot me\u0022\u003C/em\u003E, the attacker said \u003Cem\u003E\u0022I did\u0022\u003C/em\u003E, to which I replied \u003Cem\u003E\u0022oh, ok\u0022\u003C/em\u003E.

When we spawned, a sad piano music was playing. We were heading out of our spawn when someone said \u0022this must be the saddest cs:go match I\u0027ve ever seen\u0022. I then looked forward, and for some reason there were card game tables arranged between our spawns. The terrorists were sitting down, waiting for us, except for one guy, who was in front of me. When my teammates saw this, they immediately went to join them to play, except for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI stood there for a good 15 seconds, me and the other guy who didn\u0027t sit down to play.
