I have been working all day on this and I can\u0027t get it to work. So here is the setup...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to have a plane that can drop a probe/rover from a cargo bay and let the probe/rover land via parachutes while the plane flies on. I have been able to attach my rover to an unmanned rocket and retrieve both and I have been able to drop the rover on the landing strip from a cargo plane. But for some reason i can not deploy the rover from a flying aircraft. I switch over to it and see the chutes are deployed but when I switch back to my plane and land it the rover is nowhere to be found! Below are some pictures of my plane and rover. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jwT8ZFp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jwT8ZFp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ThRdnSc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ThRdnSc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uPgmd11.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uPgmd11.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/abTYHRC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022abTYHRC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-03T00:36:27Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2015 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketScientistsSon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghpstage","CreatedById":129622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T00:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnything that isn\u0027t controlled and gets more than 2.5km away from \u0027you\u0027 gets deleted after going below a certain altitude.

In the latter case you can usually just land nearby and then taxi over. You might need to add more wings to your plane though if it can\u0027t stay in the air below, say, 60 m/s (to be safe).
