Why? Is it realistic?\n\nYes, it is. For instance, assume a sub-assembly is a folding rover. A KIS container would store the entire rover. Upon landing, the kerbal would remove and deploy it.\n\nThis is the exact same scenario as the Apollo Lunar Excursion Module. The rover was folded into a container under the LEM and removed by the astronauts.\n\nI realize that sub-assemblies are a different ball of wax vice just simple parts. So, if you could look at that for vers. 1.2 or so, that would be super.\n\nSidebar: KIS is a game-changer. For instance, upon landing on the Mun, one of the legs of the lander was damaged (stuck half-retracted), and the Engineer could not repair it. Upon returning to the Mun orbiting station, the Engineer retrieved a replacement leg from a KIS container on a vessel that arrived earlier. The Engineer w/Screwdriver removed the broken leg and installed the new one. Secondly, to make a part KAS-compatible, you had to add a KAS module to the part.cfg or MM. With KIS, EVERY part is KIS compatible and may be stored, if there is room in the container.\n\nUnder the old KAS system, the leg part would have to include KAS attachment functionality. Easy enough to do, I know, but it would require a stop-restart of the game. KIS alleviated the situation.\n\nFor me, I am more excited about KIS and its future than any recent mod.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T01:37:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 01:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Apollo13**"}]}
