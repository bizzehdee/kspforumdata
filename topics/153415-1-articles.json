Do various things to give controls for testing of craft on the runway etc. I run into lots of weird problems and it would be great to have. If I could control it and watch it more carefully it would help alot. Basically allow it to freeze in mid air and press a button to eaze it in. Also allow slow motion potentialy and other things to help control it and watch stuff. Could be useful in other areas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-13T11:37:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAttach your craft to a launch clamp, hanging it about 1m above the surface.

It can be loaded with no cargo but adding the 100 tons makes it tend to have things fall apart when it lands. I think some is struts and some is the annoyance of the easing and placement. It needs to place it intelligently on a natural alignment with the wheels. Or we need a way to dictate this. I could tilt the craft in the vehicle bay but I could never untilt it correctly afterwords to do modifications. And even if I save it on a separate save I will accidentally eventually save over it the wrong way...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLarger planes seem to get touchy fast...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve noticed one problem is from how wheels can force the plane to slam the rear into the ground if the front(or any other side) is to far down compared to the rest. the problem is if you tilt the whole craft and save it you can never retilt it to perfectly flat afterwords... So you can\u0027t adjust the planes gradient to solve it easily. The above is the closest I could think of to a solution. Possibly slowing down the gravity temporarily... Although maybe if I simply turned off gravity for the drop. That would go with the idea though. you could pause it to turn on cheats and stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Solved the problem by hack gravity or unbreakable joints cheat.
