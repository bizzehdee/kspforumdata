I\u0027ve used [photobucket](http://photobucket.com) quite happily for many years. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n1. Save your artwork to a file on your computer. There are many image file formats: [JPG](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jpg) is a useful one. Remember where you\u0027ve saved it so you can find it again! ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)\n\n2. Upload your image file to your image hosting service. This will either be easy, or somewhat less so, depending upon your familiarity with computer systems. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) Identify and copy the image\u0027s [URL](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/URL). \n\n3. When creating a message on this forum, click on the \u0027Insert Image\u0027 icon and paste in the image\u0027s URL:\n\n![BB%20insert%20image%20icon_zpsujferukb.jpg](http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u128/snafubucket/misc/BB%20insert%20image%20icon_zpsujferukb.jpg)\n\n4. If you\u0027re planning on doing a lot of image work, you\u0027ll want to become familiar with some sort of image manipulation software, if only to be able to compress your images to a reasonable size (cf folk who email you 6MB bitmap images of their latest newborn). As many (most?) image hosting services will offer you a certain amount of space for free and then want to start charging you when you exceed that limit, the sooner you learn how to optimise your files, the better for your pocket. \n\n5. If you\u0027re planning on doing a lot of stuff on the Internet, you will **definitely** want to look into using a password management system of some sort. I **strongly recommend** you [start here](http://www.filterjoe.com/2010/05/14/which-password-manager/). ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)\n\n6. **Go to 5**. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n7. Warning! Warning! Danger, Will Robinson! Once you start down this path, forever will it dominate your destiny... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
