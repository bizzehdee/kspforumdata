The matter which formed Jupiter, falling together under mutual gravitation, was heated by friction and collisions, and the planet has not had anywhere near enough time to radiate all that heat away. The result is that it actually gives off more heat that in receives from the sun. And that means that no, Jupiter would not freeze for a long time, even if had already been ejected from the solar system. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T09:45:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERogue planets intrigue the help out of me.
