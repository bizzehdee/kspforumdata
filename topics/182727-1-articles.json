When i grabing them from part list there are inflating and stay inflated all the time in hangar and also missing a button to deflate/inflate (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E, Contares) or just missing any buttons in right-click menu and do nothing. At the same time some other mods (Notantares inflatable parts, Comfortable landing) work just fine. I have a heavily modded install (~\u0026gt;90\u00A0mods, mostly for parts) and not very good computer, so i just cannot unistal one mod at a time and look if issue is fixed - it would be PAINFULLY long process (of course, if i won\u0027t be able to figure answer i will do it, but...). So what can cause that\u00A0issue and how can i get rid of it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.
