Just what the Kerbal ordered, little problem here...no texture on the electric prop unit and the airship wont deploy i.e. there is no right click option to deploy the gas bag in either the SPH or when loaded on the runway.\n\u003E I am running stock KSP with only kerbal engineer,module manager(2.65) and on-screen protractor installed. Any thoughts anyone?\n\nI might have forgotten to mention that HooliganLabs airship plugin is dependant on the toobars plugin. That one totally slipped my mind.\n\nAs for the lack of texture, that one is beyond me but I\u0027ll look into it."},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T20:47:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Do you use any other mods?
