Spacecraft are physics objects. So one single rocket will still run on one single core. The difference is that under Unity 5, other physics objects (discarded stages, the space station you are approaching to dock etc) get to be shunted away to other cores instead of all sitting on the same core. Additionally, there are claims that the physics engine itself is faster and more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don\u0027t be so sure that DX12 will make a tangible difference. DX12 improves CPU overhead of handling large numbers of graphics objects on the screen at once (\u0022draw calls\u0022). KSP doesn\u0027t draw much on the screen at once. In fact, apart from the spacecraft, KSP doesn\u0027t draw much at all; the game is 99% empty space and flat surfaces with simple textures. The draw call bottleneck only manifests itself at very high numbers (\u0026gt;10,000 calls per second), and thus optimizing that may not benefit KSP in any measurable way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGraphics bombs like ARK, those are the games that benefit from DX12 in a major way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T12:51:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh?
