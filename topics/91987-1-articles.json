This is nothing unusual, we see it every once in a while when a mod developer leaves or wants to move on to other things. What was unfortunate about this particular incident is that the developer that forked the original mod was harrassed by other community members and \u003Cem\u003Eeven other fellow mod developers\u003C/em\u003E for choosing to fork and maintain the mod. This ultimately resulted in moderator intervention in the thread, the forked mod being dropped, the forking developer leaving the aftermath in disgust, the original mod still being left in a state of stagnation, and leaving the community with a very negative, destructive atmosphere and precedent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully what happened this time was an isolated incident, but as a player of KSP and someone who appreciates the work of mod developers and their work, this entire incident was just painful to watch and I see nothing that will prevent this from occuring again. As members of this community, I feel that this sort of behavior should not be tolerated. It is counterproductive and destructive to the entire modding scene and harbors an air of animosity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo us players and mod developers, I ask: What can we do to police ourselves and work to prevent behavior like this?

It\u0027s a tough topic. I DO think we, as a community, could have been more diplomatic about how we handled it. I ALSO think the OP could have done things differently to protect themselves from that kind of response. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start with, it\u0027s just not a good idea for someone with zero mod-making experience to decide they\u0027re taking over a mature mod... especially when their goals are somewhat different than the original mod. (The original mod is a parts pack... the new developer seemed most interested in making it a key piece in a tech-tree overhaul.) Nothing in our permissive licenses prevents this sort of thing... but when you\u0027re taking over for something pre-existing... you\u0027re going to get some backlash if you\u0027re not true to the original spirit of it. Now... there\u0027s nothing wrong with deciding you\u0027re going to shrug off that backlash and do something awesome anyway... and if it really does turn out great, people might come around. But it\u0027s a little rude to pick up someone else\u0027s work and risk giving it a bad reputation. Different choices that would have been better - 1, developing his own work until he was good enough to do the old mod justice, 2, doing maintenance updates only on the mod until he was good enough to really contribute to it, or 3, differentiating his work on the mod from the original with an unambiguous name change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis issue was also run into recently with FAR... FAR doesn\u0027t work well with 64 bit, but someone started releasing a 64 bit version anyway. Ferram, from my understanding, didn\u0027t want it out there because he didn\u0027t want the inevitable support requests and complaints and the negative hits on his mod\u0027s reputation. But it was technically okay under the license. It\u0027s like the penny tray by the cash register. The sign doesn\u0027t SAY you can\u0027t take all the pennies. But you\u0027re kinda awful if you do. Just because a license lets you do something, doesn\u0027t mean you really should. You should think about how what you\u0027re doing affects the original creator. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, we as a community could have done better too. I think it\u0027s in all of our interests to help new modders grow and learn. We should have politely suggested name changes, or offered to co-develop on the new parts. We also probably should have waited to see what, if anything, he actually did with the mod. It may never have come to release... and if it did it might have been great, because he may have taken the time to learn as he went and not released it before it was ready. We should have articulated more clearly and politely our concerns and offered solutions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo prevent it in the future... the most important thing I took from it is that I\u0027m going be more restrictive on licensing my work. I\u0027ve always used the MIT license in the past, because I really do believe that open is awesome. But I\u0027m going to switch to a license that protects my \u0027brand\u0027 while hopefully still encouraging derivative work. I\u0027m thinking a license that requires differentiation in a clear way... maybe disallowing my title to appear in the the title of new work without permission, or required derivative work producers to add their name to the title... so you\u0027d have to name your mod \u0022Art\u0027s Mod - Bob\u0027s awesome edition.\u0022 Or maybe a closed license that then puts my work in the public domain if I don\u0027t update it in over a year. I\u0027m giving it thought. And I think it will, unfortunately, lead others to licenses that DON\u0027T encourage sharing and building on each other\u0027s work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... that\u0027s a long way of saying that everybody needs to be more polite, on both sides of the issue. If we\u0027re not polite to established mod makers... they\u0027re going to stop making mods... or stop allowing others to learn from and build on their work at least. And if we\u0027re not polite to new potential mod makers... well... we\u0027ll eventually run out of mod makers as the old ones wander off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArt\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-05T03:56:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2014 03:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by artwhaley\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T04:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI read through the thread.

And as noted, the only reason I am doing a fork (actually, a continuation project) is because I *strongly* disagree with the direction _Augustus_ was taking it. Everything from changing the directory to be his own name (which is flat out insulting) to his complete disregard for maintaining the quality of this mod (\u0027it\u0027s cardboard not FASA\u0027).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow.

This is nothing unusual, we see it every once in a while when a mod developer leaves or wants to move on to other things. What was unfortunate about this particular incident is that the developer that forked the original mod was harrassed by other community members and \u003Cem\u003Eeven other fellow mod developers\u003C/em\u003E for choosing to fork and maintain the mod. This ultimately resulted in moderator intervention in the thread, the forked mod being dropped, the forking developer leaving the aftermath in disgust, the original mod still being left in a state of stagnation, and leaving the community with a very negative, destructive atmosphere and precedent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee Irony above. First. He was not harassed. If anything, his resorting to threats because I suggested doing exactly what he did (\u0027you wont like it when I\u0027m angry\u0027) was the only harassment I saw in that thread. What I saw was a kid over his head about to butcher a respected part pack. You are painting a very different picture than what actually happened in that thread, and I invite the reader (as many already have done) to look for themselves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it fractally ironic that you have an issue with someone forking a mod because they had issue with how someone forked a mod while defending their right to fork a mod, and challenging others to show the right way to fork a mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHim dropping it was his choice, but in my estimation the right one. Hell, at this point I doubt a fork is even necessary - what is necessary is simply a statement in the OP (which I will add after I finish my testing) that all people need to do is update MM. I\u0027ll likely start a new thread just so I can update the version number (especially with 0.90 coming), but there\u0027s no need to mess with something that still works. So I view it more as a curation than a fork to be honest, and mostly because the one \u0027fork\u0027 that was tried was very poorly done, and incredibly disrespectful to the original author\u0027s work, which is not cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022King Arthur\u0022 data-cite=\u0022King Arthur\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully what happened this time was an isolated incident, but as a player of KSP and someone who appreciates the work of mod developers and their work, this entire incident was just painful to watch and I see nothing that will prevent this from occuring again.

In another, he first offered to take over a mod because the OP might not understand licensing... and when that failed, offered to take it over because the OP was not a native english speaker (which is spectacularly insulting).

I still finding deliciously ironic that it\u0027s ok for one person to utilize a mod\u0027s license, but if someone else does, it is now bullying. And much like debates in the past it comes down to a combination of licensing and what the community will tolerate. From my seat, it looks like the community was not very tolerant of a kid with no experience, a history of aggressively taking over mods and getting in over his head, taking over yet another one. Gentle suggestions that he might want to rack up some experience first were met with flat out hostility. And he DID prove himself with the mod in question - his patch (again, now gone because of creative editing) was to break saves, move the mod to a folder named for him (which is a slap in the face and added no value), and rather than spend five minutes in troubleshooting, borked the tech tree by slapping in a new \u0027WIP\u0027 one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Greys noted, I could not have imagined a worse possible outcome for that mod other than maybe deleting all of the textures or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022King Arthur\u0022 data-cite=\u0022King Arthur\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe terms of the license state, in a nutshell, that deriative works can be made with the requirement that the original creator(s) be credited and deriative works share the same license. What _Augustus_ did was fully within his rights and cannot be construed as destructive to the mod since the license specifically allows for it. The act of forking an otherwise unsupported mod is also not counterproductive or destructive to the modding community, and if his fork does in fact prove to be of inferior worksmanship then the forked mod will naturally die out without the need for any fussing about.\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, the act of pestering and harrassing _Augustus_ even though he did nothing wrong as far as creating his own fork of the mod is in fact counterproductive and destructive. The arguments made there was that he lacked experience and dissatisfaction in the direction of the forked mod, but stating that concern to him once is enough, any further like how things went and it becomes harrassment without any chance of producing anything constructive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe act of forking a mod and immediately borking it up and naming it for yourself is destructive.

And it is, again, incredibly ironic that for all of your talk of how people should not be harassed... that you create an entire thread with the perceived hope of rallying people to bully and harass me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-05T14:47:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2014 02:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RoverDude\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T14:03:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xEvilReeperx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xEvilReeperx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlright, one more.\u003Cp\u003ENobody\u0027s villifying you for forking a project.

Nobody starts out a magnificent coder. It\u0027s a learned skill, just like reading and writing are. In this particular incident, the conduct of everyone involved was, quite frankly, unacceptable. It is not uncommon -- in fact, it is very nearly the \u003Cem\u003Enorm\u003C/em\u003E -- for newbies to start out by looking through and fiddling with someone else\u0027s existing code.

However, in both this case and the others discussed here, the animosity is entirely avoidable. Even so, enacting new rules will most likely only increase the tension already brewing; further restrictions tend to be irksome for everyone involved, when what is really needed is simply a modicum of understanding between the experienced coders and those just starting.
