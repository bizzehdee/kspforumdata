It *is* true that we are amazingly good at throwing compared to other species, but I\u0027m not sure if that may be more attributable to brains than physical body traits. The amount of the brain that is highly active during physical coordinated actions is big and we don\u0027t even consciously notice all the lightning fast activity that has to occur beneath our surface thoughts for things like bipedal walking, and rock throwing, to work right. Throwing a rock accurately over a good distance requires quickly resolving objects in your vision into a mental map of the area, using that information to judge the distance and elevation to the target, feeding that into a subconscious guesser that determines how high above the target to aim depending on how fast we are throwing, updating that information in a loop as we feel our muscles carrying out the throw (to correct the aim it if the throw isn\u0027t at the anticipated velocity), and the parallax vision correction given that the eyeballs are not directly behind the rock. This is NOT trivial. People have tried programming robots to throw based on vision and it takes a LOT of computing power to pull it off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T13:07:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt *is* true that we are amazingly good at throwing compared to other species, but I\u0027m not sure if that may be more attributable to brains than physical body traits.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s both. Not only is the software involved in throwing things amazingly complex, the hardware is quite specialized as well. For hunting purposes (which is the reason why these abilities evolved), you have to be able to throw something with both power and finesse. The mechanics behind generating power can be seen in the design of our shoulders, hips, elbows and musculature (just think of how much of the body goes into making a long distance throw), while the finesse comes from having a highly flexible wrist and an opposable thumb. These features are entirely lacking in the other higher apes, and at some point I saw a study suggesting that not even Homo Neanderthalensis could match us at throwing (due to a body built more for brute force, and hence a less articulate shoulder).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, again I should note that I\u0027m just speculating here on the basis of things I\u0027ve read in the past.
