Just thought id check here before reporting a bug. It seems my old nemesis none controlled yawing is back. I encountered this in 1.11 with the wheel\u00A0update when squad introduced friction and dampeners and such. Managed to find a work around at the time and then in 1.2 the issue wasn\u0027t there. Just updated to 1.3.0.1804 and it seems to be back. it might be because the craft was saved in 1.2 but thats something I still have to check.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems though the issue has come back. With my craft is on the runway and no control inputs the nose slides from left to right at random seemingly. I\u0027ve tried my old fix and this doesnt seem to alleviate the problem. Ive tried all wheels on auto friction and full brakes. All wheels on friction override with max friction and max brakes. same again with standard braking force. At this point the only thing I can think to try is a full rebuild in 1.3. if you want to look at my craft you can find it here\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Angelus2141/Kedillac-SSTA-Mk-II\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Angelus2141/Kedillac-SSTA-Mk-II\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks for your input in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-14T11:46:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2017 11:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Angelus2141\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ethanks\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-14T14:54:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-14T15:54:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo fix the yawing problem using friction controls, you have to understand that passive stability comes from having lots of drag behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and very low drag in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.
