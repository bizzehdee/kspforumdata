Actually, the game hasn\u0027t crashed AT ALL since I stopped precision X. Maybe it\u0027s not running out of memory, that is to say, maybe Precision X isn\u0027t using too much memory, maybe Precision X just somehow interferes with KSP\u0027s ability to get resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever the case, it\u0027s fixed!
