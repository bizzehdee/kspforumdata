Energy usage per transmission would be the same for both antennae, however, the DTS-M1 transmits slower than the 16 - 2.8 seconds per packet (DTS) versus 1.7 seconds per packet (16).\n\nHowever, that difference in transmission speed might have an advantage. For the same transmission size, the DTS-M1 can drain your batteries slower than the Communotron 16. \n\nTake, for example, a temperature reading: each temperature transmission takes 8 Mits, or 4 packets. The Communotron 16 would take 6.7 seconds to transmit the data, while the DTS-M1 would take 11.4 seconds. But both transmissions would consume 48 electric charge. The drain rates per second become: \n\nCommunotron 16: 7.2 electric charge per second,\n\nDTS-M1: 4.2 electric charge per second.\n\nThis gives you an idea how much power you need to have flowing into your batteries per second to keep them topped up. Since the DTS-M1 uses less power per second, you can use fewer solar panels, or pack fewer batteries, thus saving mass on your spacecraft or probe. Saved mass = extra delta-v.\n\nThat\u0027s how I see it, at any rate."},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T01:59:28Z","Content":"From my understanding, it would take the same electrical charge, since the packet size and ec per packet are the same.

Also, they look the coolest.\n\nThe DTS-M1 would be better (technically) than the C16 because of its slower power consumption - useful on low-mass ships as you don\u0027t need as many solar panels / fuel cells / RTGs / batteries to keep your ship or probe fully functional: plus for larger transmissions (such as the science jr), you\u0027d run less of a risk of draining your batteries BEFORE you complete the transmission.

The antenna will have a minimum realtime delay between transmissions (about 1/2 second), while the batteries will recharge faster due to the time warp. The faster you warp, effectively the slower the antenna transmits, allowing you to obtain equilibrium and keep transmitting continuously even with only a few solar panels."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T15:32:38Z","Content":"So in stock, is there no range difference among the three antennas?

I gather the AntennaRange mod does indeed focus on antenna power; beyond a certain range, power needs for each antenna ramp up dramatically, and as a practical matter, this means that each antenna has a different effective range. I haven\u0027t tried it yet, though, so I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s exactly how it works.\n\nAlso, range certainly does affect signal delay, yes? That\u0027s something modeled by RemoteTech.

I don\u0027t think AntennaRange models delay.\n\nYes radio/microwaves/lasers/visible-light are just different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and travel at the speed of, well, light. Distance delays signals of any power exactly the same amount because it\u0027s just the time it takes for the signal to physically travel between the transmitter and receiver. In a similar\\* way, shouting may be easier to hear but it\u0027s still restricted to the local speed of sound. As far as I know RT is the only mod that implements this in KSP and realistically on every ship you\u0027d want a pilot or computer/autopilot on-board (so not subject to delay) controlling any but the grossest manoeuvres. \\*Grin\\* to see what it\u0027s like trying to remote-control a probe that is light-seconds away (never mind out at distant planets) simply play your favourite online action-game with the worst lag and weakest wifi you can manage. Ping times under 1s are too cushy for this 8-p\n\n[\\* Only \u0027similar\u0027 because sound propogates through some medium, usually the air. In space no-one can hear you scream (because there\u0027s no atmosphere for the sound to pass to them through) but they can watch you doing it (because light doesn\u0027t need one)]"},{"CreatedByName":"Kermunist","CreatedById":63745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T18:42:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Range is not an issue in space.

[...]\n\nTo be fair though, Voyager uses a massive dish to make that 20W into a very narrow beam. As a result it is 46dB stronger than it would be if it came from a simple dipole antenna. So if voyager was equipped with a simple dipole (which is what KSP\u0027s basic antenna looks like) then it would need 750kW or thereabouts to yield the same signal strength at earth - obviously impractical. So I think it is realistic to give the simple anteanna a range limit. The other two antennae look more directional, so it\u0027s reasonable to have them work at longer ranges with more moderate power requirements."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T19:16:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, range certainly does affect signal delay, yes?

Thus, I\u0027ve always assumed that when I\u0027ve taken control of a probe, it\u0027s merely executing it\u0027s internal program, not receiving detailed, direct commands from ground control."}]}
