Most of the spacecraft I landed on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn without using landing legs were either in 0.13 where they did not exist, or were landing on an upper stage thanks to excess fuel or curiosity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides stability, a major difference between landing on an engine or tank and landing on proper legs or angled beams or girders is you need to keep your landing speed to below 6m/s, rather than 10-12 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1D-1()T","CreatedById":75340,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T05:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ghost13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ghost13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELandng legs are prety much useless on Ike (maybe the new ones in 0.22 is better but still).
