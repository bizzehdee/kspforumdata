Then, ones succeded, grow bigger and build smarter, as needed to get to the next objective.

For instance, a new player might not know what a radial decoupler is and what it\u0027s used for. So instead of giving them a new rocket with boosters (which granted would show them) have a little diagram, like a cartoony style blueprint storyboard, showing where they can go, what you can put on them and what happens when they\u0027re activated.\u003Cp\u003EI have an image in my head of some miniature silhouetted Kerbals with question marks above their heads looking at the decouplers on a fuel tank, then lightbulbs when boosters are attached to them and then exclamation marks as they run away in terror from the decoupled booster that is flying towards them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s just a fun thought I had, it might require more to process that than to simply experiment with a working example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly builds of KSP had a getting started blueprint as their loading screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck it out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyxhremiaD1qk0cbw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_lyxhremiaD1qk0cbw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThese ships don\u0027t have to be complete. Actually I think they should be incomplete in a way, such as leave it up to the player to attach science instruments. Or they can be without boosters or engines, leaving it up to the player to finish them up. So they still can leave some room for the challenge. The higher up the tech tree, the more challenging (incomplete) these designs can be.\u003Cp\u003ESeeing how well the BSC challenge series went, I believe the player community would be happy to prepare and offer some designs for that purpose, even if they were only used as placeholders till the game is more complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat actually sounds interesting as a separate gamemode or minigame too: Rocket debugging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re given a series of increasingly complex rockets that look fine (or not at early levels) and have to pinpoint what\u0027s wrong with them.
