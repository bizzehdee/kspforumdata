The information crackled through Jeb\u0027s radio who was busy preparing his EVA to the surface Duna. After spending a whole lot of days there together with Bill and Bob due to budgetary cuts and the plain lazy mission director who refused to launch a return mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb thought it was a great idea but it really didn\u0027t matter how much he wanted to go there, it wouldn\u0027t make any changes to his situation. So he just replied to KSC that it was wonderfull news. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome more months passes and Jeb Bill and Bob spent even more time on the Dunan surface boring themselves and waiting for a rover that was supposed to arrive a long time ago but missed the target by 120km and was roving ever since. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut meanwhile at the Space center back on kerbin the atmosphere was tense! T-minus ten, nine, eight, ..., three two one ignition! And we have a liftoff the launch director yelled out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA recon unit with on board Haddos and Seery Kerman had just left with as mission: find a suitable place for setting up a munar base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s cool that we\u0027re going to the mun isn\u0027t it Seery, screamed Haddos trying to get his voice louder than the roaring of the powerfull mainsail engines. Yeah replied Seery, although i can\u0027t wait to get rid of some of those engines, because this sound isn\u0027t bearable! Just a few moments later the first stage decoupled, reducing the sound level to a more tolerable level. Some time later both kerbals were in orbit enjoying both the view and silence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen do we have to get ready for our trans-munar-burn asked Seery. Haddos replied that the had a few more minutes of peace before they would have to get back to work. Haddos started reading his comics and Seery was dreaming away by the amazing view of kerbin. Haddos had brought a whole pile of KinKin comics, he was a big fan of captain Haddock! A small alarm sounded alarming the crew to get ready for there burn. This is Haddos Kerman, ready for burning. This is Seery, Same here! Mission control awnsered that everything looked good and the burn could soon begin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood day Crew you have about twenty seconds before your burn, those words sounded through the radio and both kermans were in position and Haddos\u0027 hand was ready to push the throttle. Okay, three two one fire engines! The two small LV-909 engines fired and started pushing them away from kerbin. Excited Seery? Asked Haddos. You have no idea Haddos, I don\u0027t really get why they chose us though, we were hired one day and the next we are fired to the mun! Haddos nodded and said thank god every kerbal has an astronaut built in!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinutes later there burn was complete and they were on route to the Mun! Seery took a quick Eva to check the rovers hanging by the side of the craft. Looking good he said, oh man even by night kerbin still looks beatifull doesn\u0027t she! She sure does Haddos said. But you better get back in because we don\u0027t want to lose you in outer space, or even worse, get killed by the kraken! How so the kraken? Asked Seery. Well although many of us thought he is dead we have lost nearly a dozen ships ahead of us trying to reach Kerblab said Haddos. Are you sure it wasn\u0027t just faulty engineering Haddos? Well maybe but the engineer told me it was the kraken replied Haddos. So the guy who designs our rockets blaims the kraken (who is obviously dead), I don\u0027t know but that sounds like an excuse to me Seery quickly awsered. Well it would make more sense than the kraken Haddos awnsered with a small doubt in his voice. I really don\u0027t get why that guy isn\u0027t fired yet he must have caused hundreds of faulty missions by now! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell he is the only guy on Kerbin who can actually design rockets! Seery awnsered. Yeah that\u0027s right but still! Remember that mission to laythe, only when landing they discovered that the landing gear was placed to high resulting in the fact that those kerbals are still stuck there, said Haddos. Yeah the engine that broke off and the lander that flipped over was really a failed end to the mission that would change history replied Seery, but anyway i\u0027m getting kind of tired here. Yeah me too said Haddos, time to take a nap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat will happen next time?
