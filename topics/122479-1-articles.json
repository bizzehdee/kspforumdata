I want to know if there is an incompatibility between this two mods. I made the mistake of installing both USI and TAC Life support mods and trashed my career game. It took me several weeks of game to get there, so I would like to know this before hand \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not certain how this mods work, so forgive my ignorance if this is a stupid question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreetings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZeke\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T00:00:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis question about mods has been moved to the modding subforum.

While the parts will function without a life support mod, the design is centered around providing an appropriate challenge where players will weigh the costs, risks, and rewards of supplying missions exclusively with carried life support supplies, or in making the investment in a permanent colony. That being said, this is not just a single greenhouse part (although food production is part of the mod). Rather, it brings an entire colonization end-game to KSP in a fun and challenging way.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
