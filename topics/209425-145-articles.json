You added creature comforts, but not performance to the build, and traded off performance. I said the same thing about an SSD by the way, I had to upgrade to 256 GB a month ago, and I only have KSP and Elite Dangerous there. And, I have a 1 TB rotating drive.\u00A0A wireless adapter is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edisadvantageous\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0if you have wired connections. If you could get by shaving the RAM, then do so on the main build and get a 1060 if you need the performance. But don\u0027t buy a 1060 or 480 after the fact. Used 960 value is already dropping.

If you look at both and spend money to do both, you will have a flexible system that is also prepared for other renderers you might want to use later on. Flexibility, on the other hand, costs money.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- If gaming is your main concern, the focus of the discussion on rendering seems a bit trivial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI referred to that before, but that might have gotten buried between the configuration posts. It will take more of an investment, aye. If money is tight already, that might be a problem. An air cooler is upgraded easily later on, but a motherboard is not easy to replace. Considering we are already stretching the budget, dropping overclocking seems to be a logical choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou seem to have a strong bias against AMD. Please let that not get in the way of proper advice. The point of this discussion is to get Endersmens the most bang for his buck. I will comment point by point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- An RX480 does not kill your motherboard. The story about the GPU not adhering to ATX specifications is blown out of proportions, mostly by people that do not understand how things are properly measured. No examples of an RX480 actually causing any problems whatsoever exist, which means the actual problem is non-existent.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- We should note rendering is not the primary concern, but gaming is.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- When it comes to gaming, the RX480 appear to be much more value for money than Nvidia\u0027s competition.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- With a modern processor (which both the i5-6500 and the Xeon are), the GPU will pretty much always be the limiting factor. A faster card means more frames.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- There seems to be few direct comparisons between OpenCL and CUDA rendering. It mostly is people saying the same things without proving them. It does seem that OpenCL has been under development longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe RX480 is an very interesting choice at the moment. Nothing Nvidia has to offer for the same money comes close to it and it is not that fast that the performance is wasted. If you look at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/231134-amd-radeon-rx-480-review-the-best-200-gpu-you-can-buy-today\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea random review\u003C/a\u003E, you will see it generally makes a big difference at 1080P in games where the framerate is not already over 60-80 fps. The difference between 30 and 50 fps is very noticeable and most games show similar performance improvements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMind you, I am not saying the GTX960 is not a viable option. I am just saying that the RX480, if you have the money to spend, seems to be a better option when it comes to gaming at 1080P. If the money is not there, sure, buy a slightly less nimble card that will still provide an good experience. If needs be, a GPU can be replaced with ease later on, so punching below your weight on the GPU is not a disaster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of AMD\u0027s cards.(R9 Nano is great when they update it for Polaris)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1894349\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://forums.adobe.com/thread/1894349\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Endersmens listed off the games he would be playing beforehand...

A wireless card could easily be added later, even though you want a cable if at all possible. Wired performance remains far superior to that of a wireless connection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving just 128 GB for an SDD is a bit sparse and it will be much more costly to upgrade later. Besides, game start to rely on SSD performance more and more. Fallout 4 is a game with huge loading times on a traditional HDD and developers are more and more heading that way. That being said, even without taking games into consideration, a 128 GB SSD really is not the best choice any more. It just does not make sense to save money there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen it comes to memory, starting out with 8 GB could be feasible, as long as you start out with one stick and are totally sure you can get exactly the same memory later on. Mixed memory can cause issues that would be easily prevented. It is also worth pointing out memory prices are at an all time low. Last time they were this low, manufacturers cut production, causing the prices to double or even triple.
