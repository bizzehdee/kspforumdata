There are threads talking about Take Two putting spiders and/or probes into 1.4 to spy on you for whatever reason. Personally, I hate the new EULA. But I don\u0027t think it will impact my gameplay to a serious extent. I don\u0027t live in the US, and I have never been there, so I don\u0027t abide by US law. No one will stop me keeping good \u0027ol 1.3.1 on my computer as well as 1.4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis. Setting aside most of the legal technicalities (apart from one specific one - more on that in a minute), the problem I have with this whole mess is the attitude that\u0027s gone with it. We\u0027ve heard nothing from Take Two since they bought the rights to KSP and then suddenly they\u0027re marching in with size 10 Lawyer Boots. New EULA. New terms and conditions that we have to agree to before getting access to the forum, or the wiki. Opt-in dialogue boxes confirming that you want to send information back to Squad, disappearing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese may indeed be standard terms and procedures - but standard to a big name AAA title. They don\u0027t sit as well with a game like KSP which owes a lot to player created content of various kinds. Think of the mods that have either been incorporated directly into KSP or inspired Squad to incorporate their own version of them. Think of the number of modders that have worked for Squad at one time or another. It\u0027s kind of fallen by the wayside recently but think about \u003Cem\u003EThe Daily Kerbal\u003C/em\u003E and it\u0027s showcasing of various videos, fan-art and other player generated content.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, whilst I can\u0027t speak for anyone else, I didn\u0027t like\u00A0Take Two\u0027s \u0027we own everything\u0027 style of EULA. Whether they intend to enforce, or can enforce, most of it is largely irrelevant. It\u0027s the fact they thought it was a good idea in the first place that grates. It smacks of disregard for and disrespect of, the KSP community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn to that specific point I mentioned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a long-running fan-fiction thread on these forums, so I was naturally curious to see what the new forum T\u0026amp;C\u0027s say about such things.

Let me get this straight. We\u0027re talking about any content created through the software. Doesn\u0027t matter where you host it - if it was created through the software it falls under this EULA. For example, any Missions created through the new expansion (which is pretty much\u00A0the signature feature of the expansion) are caught. Also - this is an explicit waiver of rights. It\u0027s not a case of Take Two choosing whether or not to enforce this - it just happens. So - if you create a Mission, under this EULA you waive your rights to be acknowledged as the creator of that Mission. You also waive the right to object to derogatory treatment of it, or to object to anyone doing anything with it that would reflect badly on your own reputation. And, in a final rotten touch, that waiver survives termination of the Agreement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell that fills me with warm fuzzies. To be clear, \u0027moral rights\u0027 are completely separate to so-called economic rights conferred by copyright law. Pick up any book you choose and take a look at the copyright page.

Having a license means they can use item X, but not that they own it.

Fanworks such as stories, screenshots, videos, etc, are a slightly more complicated issue due to the implicit license the EULA grants them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: None of the changed language applies to mods. The language about \u0022not modifying game files\u0022 probably means \u0022don\u0027t touch stuff Squad wrote or try code injection: mods must simply be layered on top\u0022. I\u0027m under the impression \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, for example, has to let KSP calculate the stock aerodynamic forces, and then applies a force countering the stock aerodynamic force before applying its own aerodynamic force. The stuff about \u0022content generated by using this software\u0022 also clearly does not apply to the external programs modders use: Blender, Visual Studio, Mono, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause mods are generated outside the confines of Squad software, they\u0027re largely untouchable by this EULA: Take Two does not have an implicit license to them. An ARR-licensed mod is untouchable without your explicit permission, and something under GPL would force KSP to become GPL-license, which means KSP becomes open-source.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3: The very release post for 1.4 stated \u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe modding community is very important to the Kerbal Space Program team, and we continue to encourage and enable mods for KSP moving forward.\u0022.

The legal ground for that remains exactly as shaky as it\u0027s ever been. While the changed terms of the EULA do grant them a license to such, see 1: licenses aren\u0027t ownership. I\u0027m also pretty confident it\u0027s just in case they decide to make a central repository for distributing Mission Builder missions: to re-distribute your missions to other players, they kind of need a license to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sole moustache-twirling thing they can do now is re-distribute stuff like fanfiction, fanart, screenshots, etc. without attribution to the original author or his/her preferred license and without his/her permission, and that would be such an unpleasant move even I\u0027d get upset if they didn\u0027t immediately apologize. The safe thing for them would be to ask, and somehow, I suspect the vast majority of fan content creators would be very happy to have their stuff featured by Squad/Take Two.
