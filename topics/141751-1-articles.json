Things have been going fine, but I\u0027m getting into trying to put satellites in orbit and I\u0027ve run into a problem. I have at my disposal the AJ10 Upper Stage Engine. It is a pressure-fed engine that runs on UDMH and IWFNA. Problem is, per realfuels I put the tanks on the craft and then attach the engine, and then a button pops up on the engine UI thing which switches it to that fuel combo, w/o effort. But, despite the fact that the description says those\u00A0fuel types are\u00A0highly pressurized in the tank, it will not be so. Highly pressurized remains a solid false no matter what I do, and in fact this is the case for every variety of fuel I\u0027ve tried in the tank though it is supposed to be pressurized pretty much across the board. It is the only tank option I currently have which will offer that fuel type pressurized which is also\u00A0small enough to be usable in the final stage.. It\u0027s the FL-R10 RCS fuel tank. I think its actually a stock part that gets altered by a couple mods.. So basically what I\u0027m asking is have I encountered a bug? Or is there something my mediocre knowledge on the subject that didn\u0027t clue me in on something I need to do in order to pressurize this tank?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T20:28:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the tank UI there should be a slider to select tank type. I forget off the top of my head which types are pressurized, but there should be a line that says \u0027Highly pressurized\u0027 which you want to read \u0027true\u0027 or \u0027yes\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkippydaHippie","CreatedById":147118,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T20:38:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe slider that lets you do \u0022Fuselage, Structural, etc.\u0022 or whatever the options are is not present in this tank. Though I realized I have other tank options which is a huge relief.. I think this part may well be bugged though.
