Many behaviors FAR allowed for now exist in stock, albeit to a more forgiving degree. I played with AJE \u002B DRE \u002B FAR before 1.0, but stock emulates those behaviors on it\u0027s own and has many of the same results. I can no longer fly up to 20km with a simple turbojet engine, the forces of drag can flip my rocket. While I\u0027m not the only one waiting on a 1.0.3 patch to fix some additional stock goofiness, for the time being I\u0027ll stick with stock. I\u0027ll probably dabble with these mods when they all update one day, but KSP isn\u0027t a hardcore simulator and trying to inject that into it is a large undertaking. Right now I\u0027m far more interested in Scatterer than nuFAR because, for me at least, whether or not my ailerons stall 100% correctly isn\u0027t as interesting as having an atmosphere to fly in."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T02:55:17Z","Content":"To answer the question, as of 1.0 I think of FAR more as a mod for RSS/Realism Overhaul rather than stock; ferram\u0027s current work deserves much better than some rinky-dink solar system.

That\u0027s just what stock aero does now. So everybody had to step up their game and build better rockets. That\u0027s a good thing. \n\nStill, I think FAR is more fun. The reasonis, that while it is more complex and sophisticated unter the hood, it is actually more predictable to me than stock. With the new voxel thingy that nuFAR does, you actually get the aerodynamic behaviour you would expect from the shape of your craft.\n\nStock aero on the other hand does magic stability assists in the background even without SAS enabled. This way you do not know if your design is actually stable, or if KSP makes it stable. That kinda annoys me from a scientific standpoint. It makes sense from a gamplay standpoint though, because not everyone wants to focus on aerodynamics.\n\nI\u0027ve tried the new FAR yesterday and I really love it.\n\nStock aero will be great aswell, when they rebalance the drag. Don\u0027t believe the anti-hype. It\u0027s not crap. It\u0027s just not balanced well at the moment.

I\u0027ve been a FAR user since slightly after it became available, but the reason it was so mandatory is because the stock aerodynamics were so far departed from any semblence of reality they weren\u0027t fun at all. I respect FAR, and honestly I\u0027ll probably dabble with it again, but with the accuracy of the system it creates new problems in KSP. Suddenly I need all these highly aerodynamic parts, I need these procedural wings, because stack building just isn\u0027t the best way to design a plane. I think Ferram has included some wiggle room for this reason and I might be wrong, I might really enjoy nuFAR when I pick it up, but since stock does for me now what FAR did for me previously, it deserves at least spending time with it to try it out and it\u0027s most certainly nowhere near as terrible as many people want to describe it."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T12:58:20Z","Content":"I just... *Really* like it when my vehicles disintegrate when I loose control with FAR."}]}
