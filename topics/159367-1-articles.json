However i got a new computer so i was left to re-download my mods. However when i got konsturcts and kerbinside. Something was missing. I remeber there being a runway and launch site at jebs retreat but they are gone. I remember there being another runway that used areas 110011s runway model. Its not there. There were also aircraft carrier runways and naval\u00A0launch sites. They are\u00A0gone.\u00A0And i have noticed there are less launch sites. (Also\u00A0theirs pictures of launch sites on the official page that are not there.) Because konstructs was not operable with the new ver of KSP i got a fan made updated version. Sooooo? Were those launch sites only included in the official version? Also why was konstructs not updated?
