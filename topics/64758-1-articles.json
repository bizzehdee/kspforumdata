They are meant to be used as a starting object to build a whole, attachable, vehicle as a single subassembly. This basically just started as a personal frustration I have with creating things like probes, balancing their rcs, but then saving them as a subassembly that is properly attachable to a docking port, or even a radial decoupler. Right now if I was to create a vertically symmetrical probe with a single set of rcs ports, balancing them would be guesswork, and trial and error, even using the stock plates since they have mass. Creating that probe with 2 sets of rcs would involve saving the rcs tank wth the rcs (and whatever else) on it, then reconstructing the docking ports, tank assembly and probe body separately on the main vehicle I wanted it on. Saving the docking port with the subassembly isn\u0027t an option, since the attach point of the assembly is either JUST on the tank, or I\u0027ve used the port as a parent object to the tank, and whatever the port is attached to has probably affected the rcs balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I copied, and edited the stock plates to have no mass, so that I can use them to create a WHOLE, complete vehicle that I can attach in one step, the way i want, and have it\u0027s rcs balanced. It\u0027s kindof a time saver (and a little easier) when you want to attach multiple of the same thing to a launcher for example. Just drag 1 subassembly over each time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I also changed, is I made it so they are as weak as anything can get in this game, so they can\u0027t be used to make a massless monster of a ship. More of a balance thing I guess, but useful for creating fireworks at vehicle unpack:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/aTXwFjzvwQQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t changed anything for the career mode placement yet, since I don\u0027t play that mode, but I might do that later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, file: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/x17hyizexb5q5sf/INSULINt%27s\u002BSubassembly\u002BStarter\u002BPlate.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/x17hyizexb5q5sf/INSULINt%27s\u002BSubassembly\u002BStarter\u002BPlate.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImgur gallery: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/m9Wb3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
