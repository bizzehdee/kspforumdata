You will have to mine and process a multitude of different resources in different locations in the solar system.

But to speculate on speculations... I think the first valuable\u00A0resource should be money and as colonization starts and space program funds inflate money should slowly be less and less valuable (new tech parts costs increase exponentially) and its place be filled with direct\u00A0 rare resource gathering. Rare resources being those that cannot be purchased with money but must be gathered off world or have ludicrous prices that make bulk purchases of the material economically very painful (real world costs of He-3 are about $1.3billion/1,000 Kg \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.lpi.usra.edu/decadal/leag/DecadalHelium3.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.lpi.usra.edu/decadal/leag/DecadalHelium3.pdf\u003C/a\u003E)\u00A0.
