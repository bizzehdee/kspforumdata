I don\u0027t have one, but I am looking for one for Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) and\u00A0KSP (If it will actually work with KSP).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022download628.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002276.95\u0022 height=\u0022197\u0022 width=\u0022256\u0022 src=\u0022https://u.cubeupload.com/Bjh223/download628.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-01T20:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E do (you might not have all the functions of the yoke but the basics \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E work) as regardless of the shape, it\u2019s really just sending a signal which means \u201Cturn left\u201D or \u201Cdive\u201D. It\u2019s whether that signal is interpreted correctly is the issue of course. And as a caveat, apparently KSP doesn\u2019t always play nicely\u00A0with some joysticks but I\u2019ve used an Xbox controller on both ksp and fsx without issues. I suppose even if it doesn\u2019t work, you can still use it for fsx so not all lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ben J.
