Do I orient the sail so I am looking from the backside (anti-pro grade) of the sail directly at the Sun and have it centered (on all axis) and then set cone to 0 degrees, set then time and lock attitude? This is a point of maximum force on he sail and acceleration. I see that in the numbers.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Secondly, when you say \u0022command\u0022, is the sail supposed to orient in real time as I adjust the cone \u002B- 90 or the clock \u002B- 90? If this so, I am not seeing any kind of sail reorientation occur, even if I time forward. I do see that acceleration persists so that is kewl, it\u0027s that I can\u0027t seem to get the control GUI to orient the sail real time or planned. I also cannot preview on the map. I can\u0027t see a predicted orbit (just flashing on occasion from my icon in whatever the select orbit color is), but I do get final element results. They don\u0027t seem to matched or at least they are showing the persistent calculation.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m running KSP 1.0.5 in two different test installs, one 32 bit the other 64. I\u0027ve done every version combination of solarsailnavigator and persistent-thrust to no avail. Both of these installs are the bare minimum to try and figure this out....  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E My base playground in both 32/64 is the following:  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E KSP 1.0.5  \n\u003E \n\u003E Module Manager 2.6.13  \n\u003E \n\u003E Mechjeb 2.5.4.0  \n\u003E \n\u003E Haystack 0.4.1.0 (Haystack isn\u0027t supposed to have any relationships, but I can\u0027t a button without toolbar 1.7.10  \n\u003E \n\u003E Hyperedit 1.4.1  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Ultimately I want to use Interstellar Extended most importantly, followed closely by Near Future. Of course I dived right installing until I ran into this issue.. tried going backwards and stuff. Then finally started clean with the two above playgrounds... still the same issues.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, I hope this helps some. I\u0027ve never been able to play with solar sailing type sims other than GMAT and that is too antiseptic among other issues.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E ~K  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the feedback. Do your controls have a \u0022Lock Attitude\u0022 toggle button? If this is active, the sail should follow the controls. You also want to click \u0022Set to Now\u0022 button when starting a new command sequence, to reset the start time to the current KSP time.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E A positive \u0022Cone\u0022 angle will tilt the sail so the sunlight bounces off of the sail to the left, if you\u0027re looking through the sail at the sun. The reflected sunlight will act like rocket exhaust to boost the orbit. A negative cone angle will reflect the light to the right, pushing against the orbit and shrinking it. Hope this makes sense. Once you get the hang of the controls, you can switch to \u0022Map\u0022 view and see how different sail angles for different durations affect the future trajectory (check the \u0022Show preview\u0022 toggle button).\n\u003E \n\nI have the exact same problem.
