The manufacturing cost of the first stage is actually only a small part of the total cost of launching a rocket, maybe only 30% (optimistically). The rest of the cost is mainly the workforce, planning, infrastructure, logistics, R\u0026amp;D, transport, administrative overhead, etc... And there\u0027s transport,\u00A0integration, launch services, and a lot of stuff that isn\u0027t recoverable (upper stage, fairing...).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe payroll of the workforce is the biggest part of the launch cost, and reusability doesn\u0027t magically reduce the workforce. SpaceX is just about as lean as a launch provider can be and has already slashed prices as much as they could. \u00A0Even with reusability, they will\u00A0still need a factory and lots of engineers. Even if you need a few\u00A0less people on the production lines to build less boosters, you need people to refurbish, prepare,\u00A0and transport the recovered stage, which wasn\u0027t needed before.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this assumes that the first stage is actually free, which it isn\u0027t. It\u0027s designed to fly maybe 20 times, but not indefinitely. You could assume that by spreading the manufacturing cost over 20 flights reduces the cost per flight by 95% of the above-mentioned 30% figure, but it isn\u0027t even that simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisposable rockets (especially the Falcon 9)\u00A0are actually designed to be (relatively)\u00A0cheap, partly because they are produced in numbers. Manufacturing costs diminish\u00A0with volume, meaning that as launch volume increases, the unit cost of each booster decreases.If you have 50 launches per year, with a disposable model, you need to mass produce 500 Merlin engines and 50 first\u00A0stages. With 100% first stage reusability, the same factory has to build only 2.5 first stages and 72.5 engines. The result is that due to lower procurement volumes and higher\u00A0fixed costs,\u00A0those reusable stages are going to cost a lot more than the disposable ones. Enough to seriously cut into the reduction induced by reusing the stages in the first place. Instead of saving 95% on the manufacturing cost of the first stage, for the same amount of flights, the real cost reduction might\u00A0only be 50%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in the end, what sounded like a 95% (of 30%) reduction of launch cost might only turn out to be a 15% reduction, which\u00A0has the potential to bring the cost of a Falcon 9 launch from $60 million down to $45 million. It\u0027s a nice perk to pass on to your customers, but it\u0027s not a game changer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow,\u00A0from the customer\u0027s point of view,\u00A0the actual launch is only a small part of the total cost of a typical project. Maybe, again, 20%. The rest is the satellite itself (the biggest part of the budget), the ground stations, the insurance, and the actual operations. This means that in the grand scheme of things, the total saving\u00A0that a customer can expect when they put a satellite in service is 15%\u00A0of 20%, which is only 3%. On a $200 million comsat project, that\u0027s a whopping $6 million saving on their total expenses.\u00A0Again, it\u0027s a nice saving, but it\u0027s not a revolution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: The above figures are educated guesses, but I believe the orders of magnitude are pretty close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-23T10:49:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2015 10:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T10:55:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way the people in the control room were cheering, you would think they had just won the lottery, not just a mere 4%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also think that the barriers to faster internet have more to do with greedy communications companies, controlling governments, and copyright law than lowering the cost of a satellite launch.

The reason this doesnt happen is that its better for companys to keep you on a slow connection.

Sure, it\u0027s not comparable to the volumes for cars or cell phones, but compared to the production levels of other rocket engines or even jet engines,\u00A0SpaceX benefits immensely from economies of scale\u00A0on two main levels: sharing the fixed costs over more units and discounts from procuring larger volumes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose benefits have been the major factor in allowing SpaceX to cut costs so much. Engine commonality in particular was a genius idea, because it is much cheaper to a have a production line build 10 identical engines for each rocket\u00A0than to have two production lines for\u00A0first and upper stage engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you start reusing boosters on a large scale, your production volumes decrease significantly, and with that decrease you lose most of those scaling benefits.
