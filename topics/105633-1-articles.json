It will take practice to figure out how much you really need and if you consistently land your own craft with 50% ablator remaining, then you could certainly remove some to save on mass. I\u0027m inclined to be conservative though and keep it all on just in case something bad happens. Also, you may have a situation where you need to use the shield more than once (aerobrake to gain orbit, and then re-entry to land).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T15:07:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETook a heat shield down a couple of notches last night - by which I mean I had 198 out of 200 left at the end.
