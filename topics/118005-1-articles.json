It very well just be my lack of understanding of how these things work, so Gameplay seemed like the place to start looking for solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve built this big old interplanetary monster, mostly by bringing up modules in a shuttle and docking them together. It has three Nerv engines which were each individually docked to a small fuel tank and four fuel tank modules connected radially to the body. These four are not directly connected to the engine, but I figured I could just manually pump fuel from them when I needed it. However, I assumed that docking the three engines to a fuel tank would allow them to crossfeed and fire. They are each connected via docking ports to a tri-coupler, which is attached to the fuel tank. I thought this configuration would allow flow from the tank to the engines, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I go any further, here\u0027s a picture of the thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/odrzo69c8eb5afc/Interplanetary%20Ship.GIF?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/odrzo69c8eb5afc/Interplanetary%20Ship.GIF?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, there is fuel in the tank, all engines are staged and the throttle is at 100%, but no engine flames and Kerbal Engineer reports I have 0 dV. Am I missing something or was this just not a feasible idea to begin with? Could this be a crossfeed bug or something? Any way to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I had an issue with the last shuttle docking where I had to edit the save file to get around the \u0022Won\u0027t Dock / Undock\u0022 bug thing, but I can\u0027t find any threads dealing with this issue specifically. I spent SO long and so many flights to build this thing, I\u0027d be so sad if I had to just scrap it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T09:14:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 09:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NFunky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlanP","CreatedById":148656,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T03:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can think of is crossfeed enabled on the docking port?

So either you\u0027ve found a corner case in the fuel flow code, you accidentally turned off fuel flow somewhere, or I failed to recreate the issue properly. Did you dock the engines in the VAB, or after launch (and if in the VAB, why have them, out of curiosity?).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RandomRyan","CreatedById":142844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T05:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etry right clicking on the docking port and is the crossfeed enabled?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFunky","CreatedById":128066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T05:39:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did make sure all three ports have crossfeed enabled.

If it IS there though, presumably you\u0027ve clipped it inside the tank itself and, possibly, to a different node inside the tank.
