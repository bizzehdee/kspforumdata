Below is a list of the aircraft that I have recreated in KSP, as well as their year of introduction and a short sentence or two about each. A download link of the crafts is also provided below.\n\nThe crafts utilize the Kerbal Aircraft Expansion mod by the user keptin because stock 0.90 does not have propellers or large landing gear, (and a large cockpit at the time some of these replicas were made). I tried to keep these crafts as stock as possible; I wanted to be as creative as possible. All crafts are flyable, and most are easy to do so.\n\nSadly, I have lost a few crafts (due to updates through both KSP and KAX, and thus have lost some excellent crafts: Caproni Ca.4, B-17 Flying Fortress, Concorde (supersonic passenger jet), A-10 Thunderbolt, Boeing 747, B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, and Solar Impulse solar powered aircraft). \n\n* * *\n\n**Download Link for All Crafts (188 kB):** [**http://www./download/6skg9kk74k3bz54/SpenSpaceCorp%27s\u002BKSP\u002BKAX\u002BReplicas.rar#39;s\\_KSP\\_KAX\\_Replicas.rar**](http://www./download/6skg9kk74k3bz54/SpenSpaceCorp%27s\u002BKSP\u002BKAX\u002BReplicas.rar#39;s_KSP_KAX_Replicas.rar)\n\n* * *\n\n**1. Wright Glider (1900)**\n\nThis was really nothing more than a manned kite. This craft was one of the Wright Brother\u0027s gliders that preceded the first powered flight in 1903.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/q9WcR)\n\n**2.

Douglas DC-3 (1936)**\n\nOne of the most significant transport aircraft ever made, the DC-3 revolutionized the way people and cargo was transported, both commercially and militaristically.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Arado E.340 (1943)**\n\nThis German twin engine dive bomber was designed so that the pilot had an unrestricted view and the gunners had a large range. This project was ultimately cancelled. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/nLYQt)\n\n**11. Messerschmitt Me 262 (1944)**\n\nThis was the world\u0027s first operational jet powered aircraft.

Sr-71 Blackbird (1966)**\n\nThis US mach 3\u002B reconnaissance aircraft was able to simply outrun its enemies rather than engage in combat.

Boeing 737 (1968)**\n\nThe 737 series is the best selling jet airliner in history.
