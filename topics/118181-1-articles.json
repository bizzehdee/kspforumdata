He would not be so excited about advanced scientific experiments and communications, soil samples and other boring activities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goverment and the public are fundementally different actors. The Goverment are burocrasts that want you to be efficient and effective. The public want to be entertained and inspired. The trick is doing both well. NASA is an example of a Space Agency that currently mainly pleases the burocrats. Only during the Apolo mission, they got a lot of intrest from the public. But the public is where the Big money comes from so although the goverment is a relatively reliable source of income you can\u0027t do anything spectacular unless the public wants it. The problem with the public is that they get bored fast, for example you can\u0027t repeat the same mission to the moon, instead you should quickly build a permanent base and regulary switch kerbals. Everybody want to go to space. Although it will have little science value, the public just loves stories about astronauts on the mun. So the more kerbals go to the mun and return safely, the more you will be appreciated by the public and therefore rewarded.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T12:22:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 12:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T06:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t this kind of redundant with the existing Reputation system?

This wouls give insentive to create a real space economy instead of only achieving some quick mission objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the goverment and public have different intrest and motivations. The public is like a 8 year old that wants to see cool stuf happening in space so perhaps that one day he too will be there. Goverment are mostly intrestied in control , which means they need to know what is out and if they can benefit from it. Goverments are more likely to send probes and droids which can perform research cheaply and efficient.

This would allow smaller increments to assist all along the way of your program enhancing what you earn from contracts without giving you a bankroll that gets used up while at the same time rewarding long term mission goals with bigger rewards for a nice boost without going over the top. Almost a combination of the two ideas basically. The public rewards you immediately while you\u0027re in mission doing things and keeping them entertained. The bureaucrats on the other hand are wanting you the get your stuff done and look at total progress - satellites, stations, total # of missions, total research outputs etc. Kind of like most space programs are treated right now with regular reviews and awarded budgets. You could even tie both together by having a well entertained public push your bureaucrat reward higher through \u0022public pressure\u0022 type bonuses or a bored public create penalties by not \u0022speaking out\u0022 to defend you against the penny pinchers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on how far you\u0027re willing to go to push this mod as well as how far KSP will allow you to push it, this could turn into a very fun career enhancement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T12:59:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, goverment look at the cold hard facts, what did you achieve and how long did it require for you to achieve it?
