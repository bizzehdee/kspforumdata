Yes this is my first post, so let me say I love this game so far. This is just the techno geeky thing I like to do as I am a part time astronomer at home. So I have a question and I want to get it right the first time, so I am hoping for some good input from you all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently I tried downloading a skin for Minecraft and ended up with a virus. Adding skins to Minecraft is not exactly easy to do. That being said I am a bit gunshy about adding mods to KSP, but I want too. I know many people on here have successfully done it, and it is second nature to them. However can someone step me through adding a mod (and dont assume I know the little things)? I would greatly appreciate someones direction on this. Let\u0027s assume I want to add Deadly Re-entry...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso are all mods found on the Spaceport? (I ask because I cant find Interstellar) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly can I still play vanilla after adding the mods? or will I need to have 2 copies of the game on my PC, one vanilla and one modded?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a list of mods I want to add...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EB9 Aerospace\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKW Rocketry\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EInterstellar\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFerram Aerospace\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKethane\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me thank you in advance, I really do appreciate it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS my PC can play Eve Online at max graphics so I am pretty sure I can handle any mod...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-05T07:58:29Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2014 07:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Space Hillbilly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T08:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome mods are not on Spaceport, but have a forum thread with download links here instead. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you download a mod, you will usually get a .zip file. Inside this file you will find one or more folders. There is usually a \u0027source\u0027 folder or a file with a .cs extension somewhere in there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do not need this file or folder for the mod to work. It is the source file for the plugin used in the mod. This must be included in the download so that other members of the community can have a look at the source and make sure that the plugin does not do anything it is supposed to (like hiding a virus or something like that). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the source, you will probably find either a folder named after the mod or it\u0027s creator OR a folder called GameData.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, if you see the \u0027GameData\u0027 folder, you can just copy it into your KSP folder and you are done. (There is already a GameData folder in there and you will be asked if you want to overwrite it. Just do so, it is all right). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you see a differently named folder, or some combination of folders and files, than you need to copy all of them INTO the GameData folder in the KSP installation folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods should load up automatically the next time you run KSP. No further action is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can have multiple instalations of KSP. Just copy the entire KSP folder somewhere else and that\u0027s it, should work with no problems. Placing the KSP folder in certain places (desktop, root of C drive, etc.) can cause problems because the game might not have the permission to access those places fully. Placing the installation folder into (for example) C:\\games or something like that eliminates the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-05T08:23:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2014 08:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Awaras\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Hillbilly","CreatedById":102704,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T08:21:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!

It sits at around 3.5 GB, even if you have 32 GB RAM installed. It\u0027s a limitation of the Unity engine, which KSP is built on. Mods with a lot of parts (such as B9 Aerospace and KW Rocketry) will consume tons of memory due to the part textures. On their own, it usually doesn\u0027t matter much, but when you have a bunch of mods (I have around 45 different ones installed at least in part) you\u0027ll need to pay attention. There is a mod called Texture Reduction Mod that will compress and/or resize these for you, which helps. Also there is a setting to run half-res textures in the game settings. Either of these will reduce your RAM footprint and help out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to KSP, and happy launching (or crashing)! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T18:41:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll you really need to do to have vanilla and modded installs is keep two copies of the GameData folder and switch between them, but copying the entire KSP directory will also work (and then you launch it with the KSP.exe or the Launcher.exe in the respective folders.) If you have the Steam version of KSP and you want to run it through Steam, you cannot move the folder and still launch it through Steam (although, you can copy the folder and launch it with KSP.exe, thank you for DRM free games! But only the one in the SteamApps/common/Kerbal Space Program folder will be launched by Steam).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve written a tool which lets you have multiple instances of the GameData folder but only one install folder (especially useful for Steam). It\u0027s called DataSwitcher and there\u0027s a link in my sig. You would just create a new instance called Stock or Vanilla and import the GameData folder, then create another instance called Modded or whatever you want and import the GameData folder again (to get the stock stuff). Then you\u0027d just install your mods in the DataSwitcher/{Instance Name}/GameData folder and then Activate the instance in the DataSwitcher program. It\u0027s still in development, and the new version I\u0027ve been working on has some improvements that make it a little more usable but isn\u0027t ready for release yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively there\u0027s a couple other programs available in the Tools and Applications subforum of the Addon Releases section of the forum which make installing mods and having multiple game types easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 works in 0.23 but only with some extra fixes.
