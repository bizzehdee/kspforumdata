And while I don\u0027t automatically write off the possibility of extra-terrestrial visitors, even when I was hardcore about UFO\u0027s, I always tried to debunk them, including my own sightings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... this \u0022UFO\u0022 has appeared on the ISS HD video feed four times now. The first two or three times, the signal allegedly got lost within moments of the object appearing on the horizon. This, of course, got the more paranoid UFO folks buzzing about a cover-up. I personally don\u0027t think this is an alien craft, and I don\u0027t think NASA is trying to hide anything. If they are, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a UFO. Especially since with this fourth sighting (all 4 of these have occurred pretty recently within the past month or so), the video wasn\u0027t cut. But the general consensus is that there is indeed something there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most popular skeptic argument is that it\u0027s the moon. But based on how over-saturated the Earth is in these videos, my gut tells me it isn\u0027t bright enough to be the moon. That doesn\u0027t mean it isn\u0027t though. Even the relative size of the moon is nearly impossible for us to gauge with our eyes, because there\u0027s a known optical illusion that makes us see it differently based on how close it is to the horizon. But the lack of brightness of the object has me doubting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone here bothered to look into this at all? My interest is peaked enough to want to try investigating it, but not before I\u0027m certain that nobody else has successfully debunked this with facts instead of assumptions. If this is just the moon, it should be easy enough to determine if the moon should even be visible at that point in the ISS\u0027s orbit. I would hope that serious UFO researchers already accounted for this, but the details are so sketchy and scattered that I\u0027ve had a hard time finding solid info. And for a UFO sighting like this, that\u0027s kind of unusual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost recent article, the one that finally got me thinking, \u0022Alright, what the heck is going on?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.inquisitr.com/1781592/ufo-space-station/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.inquisitr.com/1781592/ufo-space-station/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Here\u0027s a better clip of the thing from a previous sighting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mloo3kxQfFM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-24T00:06:58Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2015 12:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T23:56:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks to me like a reflection on the window.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N_las","CreatedById":31280,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T23:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat?
