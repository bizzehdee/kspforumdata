In terms of actually getting to the Mun and back, the numbers you require are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~4000-4500m/s dV - to Kerbin Orbit (speed up)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~850m/s dV - Kerbin to Mun escape velocity (speed up)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~250m/s dV - Mun orbital capture (slow down)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~500-700m/s dV - Mun landing (slow down) *this stage is the one you want the most leeway on, as it\u0027s very dependant on how efficient your landing is*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~500m/s dV - Mun take-off to Orbit (speed up)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~250m/s dV - Mun escape velocity (speed up)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERough Total: 6550m/s dV\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B10% leeway = 7205m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBear in mind that as your craft gets smaller, the mass also shrinks, and so you need less thrust to push the craft, so you can use more efficient engines (hint: look at an engine\u0027s Isp (\u003Cem\u003Especific impulse\u003C/em\u003E) as well as its thrust. The Isp is a measure of how efficiently an engine burns fuel. In space you don\u0027t need high thrust, you need high efficiency, so look at the small engines and nuclear engines, for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use a maneuver node well for the escape velocity you can use an \u0027aerobrake\u0027 maneuver which means that Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere will slow you down (ie: you have a Periapsis under, say, 40km), so you don\u0027t need to spend any more fuel. Otherwise, in theory, you would need to use another wedge of dV to slow down one on a munar escape orbit to get yourself into a stable Kerbin orbit which you can then de-orbit from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps! All those figures are rough estimates based on my memory and vague estimates, but I hope it explains the idea of building a rocket for a purpose, rather than just winging it (Although winging it is the Kerbal way!).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-16T10:45:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2013 10:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmappedout\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T13:25:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt may be that you\u0027re using too much fuel for landing. Can you talk us through how you perform a landing sequence typically?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find that with the basic little Scott Manley Minmus rocket lander (i.e. a 4 tonne module consisting of a Mk1 Command Pod with one chute, a stack decoupler, an FL-T400 tank, LV-909 engine, four lander legs and a ladder), you\u0027ll make it back to Kerbin without problems if you\u0027ve got ninety units of fuel left in the tank when you\u0027re done. Eighty is bingo fuel - hit the deck or hit space. You can make it back on 75 but you\u0027re going to have to use good piloting. Seventy or less and you might as well land, because you\u0027re definitely not making it back. If you\u0027re still not used to Mun landings, begin killing your horizontal velocity about 8000 - 5500 if you\u0027re more experienced. Once your vertical, kill your burn, switch to IVA, watch your radar altimeter and do not fire up that engine again until you\u0027re down to 1000m above the deck (incidentally, the radar altimeter can give you an idea of where the deck is, and let you estimate how far you still have to go). Then it\u0027s just a matter of watching what you\u0027re doing. Note that this is not the most efficient method fuelwise, but if you\u0027re not an expert in Mun landings this oughta give you enough play to make it to the surface with between 80-90 units of fuel remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T02:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne way I got around the limitations of the \u0022direct ascent\u0022 method was to instead go for a Kerbin Orbit Rendezvous (KOR), as per \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/39551-Sumghai-attempts-a-Munshot\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emy first and successful Munshot\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Design a lander to have just enough fuel to land on the Mun and launch itself into a stable orbit around the Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Launch the lander with no crew into Kerbin orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Design a Crew Return Vehicle (CRV) and a Munar Transfer stage with enough fuel to push both the CRV and the Lander to the Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Launch the CRV and transfer stage into Kerbin orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Dock the Lander to the CRV/transfer stage combo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Transfer to the Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Move crew from the CRV to the lander (Kerbal Crew Manifest mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Land the lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - AfterMunar EVA, fly the lander back up to meet the CRV\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Transfer the crew back to the CRV\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Use CRV to get back to Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - ????\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - PROFIT\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T03:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Nevermind, was responding to the wrong person. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-17T03:03:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2013 03:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cashen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T11:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMK59D Moon Visitor is a lander available from this forum that can easily land and return from Mun with fuel to spare.
