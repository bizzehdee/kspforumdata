Don\u0027t get me wrong, it does the basics fairly well... but there\u0027s way more that I feel needs to be available for staging... like... everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a mod available that A: makes everything that can be assign to action groups available for staging, B: even more (such as throttle control, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E control, etc...)? As an example, I recently wanted to put a pair of backwards facing twitches on my orbital stage such that when I reached orbit I could stage that section and have it automatically deactivate the main engine, point prograde, activate the twitches, decouple, throttle up the decoupled craft, and make sure that the decoupled craft had \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E set to hold prograde. This kind of thing is a fairly regular occurrence for me. I can often make due with action groups, but even action groups can\u0027t do things like setting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E or throttle\u00A0(let alone setting them on decoupling stages).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chakat Firepaw","CreatedById":150121,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-10T01:27:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like what you need to do is install, and learn, kOS.\u00A0 What you want is more than staging, but rather full up control scripting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-10T03:22:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr KRPC.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI enjoy writing software for my rockets as much as I enjoy building them!\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darinth","CreatedById":186781,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-10T17:46:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wasn\u0027t awere of kRPC. Thank you for pointing me towards it, if only for informational purposes. While both of these would technically work, I was hoping for something that involved writing less script. It\u0027s not that I can\u0027t (it\u0027s actually my job) , it\u0027s more that I was hoping to avoid the need for writing scripts when it really felt like an \u0027advanced staging\u0027 system could easily fit the bill.
