Far too great. In fact, it managed to result in an explosion of human population due to increased lifespan. The environment, which is already unstable, crumble under the increased population, and Earth slowly die. Governments of the worlds began to conflict over what little resources is left, oppressive autocratic policies began to replace democratic voices, and those who oppose the regimes are crushed with impunity. Finally, humanity committed suicide with an all out war where nothing is left behind but a desolate, empty planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second future shows what happens if the band of terrorists live: While their era of terror was horrific, it was short lived. The governments of the world unite as one to fight against such evil, and together, they managed to get rid of them after a few years of war. Many people die, but that helps reduce the human population to a more sustainable level. The result of the horrific war also scars the hearts of many people, and they vow to keep such a tragedy from happening ever again. A great number of influential people began to create reform all around the world, bringing true free education to all humanity for the first time, eliminating poverty through social effort, shifting focus away from petty conflict and toward science and the advancement of the human\u0027s mind.

Say, if the wizard never show you the final stage of the future, would choosing to save the doctor still be considered \u0022good\u0022 even though it ultimately leads to the demise of humanity? Is ignorance an acceptable excuse to doom one\u0027s own species? Such a goal post move constantly. I believe that morality is not a universal, constant thing, and instead it is a very human thing, or at least a thing bound to decision-making intelligences. Morality is to make the best decision possible from all available information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter exploring this thought experiment though, some people told me they feel like they doesn\u0027t matter anymore, because no matter what they choose, something worse may happen. \u0022What is the point of being the decision maker?\u0022 They asked. There is none, I answered. You can always choose to relieve yourself from making choices and accept your death in the hand of the wizard (which is a choice no one chose yet. Curious.) However, by making a decision, you unlocked a new future, by your own hand. Think of life as the crazy wizard without the magic future reading power. Everyday it provides you with choices, and you gotta make them to live. Life then take every single of those choices and make it into a much greater whole future, something that can be either good or bad. But you don\u0027t know that. You just gotta make the best you can right at the moment you decide. And yet those choices may result in the end of the world as we know it, or the beginning of a new golden age. The future is in your hand, you don\u0027t need to know if it is good or bad, you just make it happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally think it is very empowering. Just like Sean Mirrsen said, it is quite empowering to have an all-powerful being listen to you and do what you choose. Life is like that being. It follows through after your every choices, and it makes a future happens out of infinite other possibilities because of what you choose.
