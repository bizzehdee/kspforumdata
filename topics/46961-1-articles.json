Engines generally operate best above a given temperature, and fail above another, and the first one doesn\u0027t apply to rocket engines at all. Solar panels are significantly impacted by heat but all but one stock panels are animated so we can\u0027t really do anything about temperature, it has to be accounted for by the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne catch to what you\u0027re asking is that velocityCurve, atmosphereCurve, and powerCurve don\u0027t just exist, you can\u0027t use them anywhere. Vcurve and Acurve only exist in ModuleEngine, and Pcurve only exists in whatever module makes solar panels work. None of those curves mean a dang thing to ModuleGenerator, which is the only stock partModule which can be used to make a greenhouse work. If you\u0027re looking at writing your own partModule then they still don\u0027t exist but more importantly, you can make whatever dang curves you want and have them do whatever you want. Temperature is pretty easy to get a hold of, so making a curve that accounts for it is no more complicated than making a curve that attenuates output by light intensity/distancefromsource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would caution you; the stock heating model is not very good, you\u0027ll probably find that having a heatCurve to consider adds a new layer of unfun to the mix.
