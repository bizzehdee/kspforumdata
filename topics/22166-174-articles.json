The first one is because a few versions ago, the name of the DLL was changed. Sadly, the only way to \u0022remove\u0022 the old-named dll when most people just unpack over the top of their existing install is to replace it with a zero-sized file. This causes the error that you are seeing, which is just KSP warning you that it was unable to load the (old) dll file, which is the required behaviour, since it is empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second one is caused partly by some deprecated parts. They part definitions still exist, to allow old craft that used them to be loaded and the parts replaced, but the models and textures have been removed from the release to avoid needlessly wasting system resources. And partly by someone misunderstanding the texture= line in a MODEL{} block. They are using it to list the textures used, while it is only necessary to use it to \u003Cem\u003Ereplace\u003C/em\u003E the textures specified in a model with different ones. The errors can be ignored, since the game defaults to using the acutally correct textures in both these cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is quite safe to delete\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EGamedata\\Kethane\\Plugins\\MMI_Kethane.dll\u003Cbr\u003EGamedata\\Kethane\\Parts\\kethane_radialDrill\\\u003Cbr\u003EGamedata\\Kethane\\Parts\\kethane_tank1mLarge\\\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich will reduce the warning count a little if you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FailBro777\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FailBro777\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey ive had an issue with the drilling units...\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think this has been posted before but if i am wrong then I stand corrected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts in question are, as stated above, the drilling units.
