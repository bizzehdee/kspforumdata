I think this mod is good in theory, but terrible in reality. Stop that annoying compatibility window the hundredth time you\u0027ve started ksp? Good. Increase almost every modder\u0027s support problems by disabling a safety feature they put in specifically so that users know that it probably won\u0027t work? Bad. As was stated earlier, it\u0027s like shutting off a warning light on an air plane. Take Treeloader, for example - I ignored the warning message and tried it regardless, to see if I could play around any broken features. Not a chance - it screwed up too much. If someone\u0027s compatibility window is disabled before that mod is added, they won\u0027t know - and the problem is that many people are too lazy to remove this plugin and check what\u0027s incompatible. Instead, they immediately start begging for help, and take away time for helping people with legitimate issues, and who have followed even the most basic of troubleshooting instructions. There are a heck of a lot of stupid people out there. Take, for example, my sister\u0027s coworker - she took the entire months birth control pill\u0027s in one day.
