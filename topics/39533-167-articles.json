Think of an IRL battleship, and a replica built in KSP. the armor on the sides of the KSP battleship is attached at one point to the main structure. Now let\u0027s remove an armor plate on the side of that battleship. All armor attached to that piece breaks off. On the real battlehsip, that armor is also attached to the keel and the deck, which is attached to the armor on the other side, so if the same area of armor vanishes as on the KSP battleship, the rest of the armor stays attached.
