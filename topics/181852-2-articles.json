I just lost a mission that was doing a simple flyby of the Mun. Granted, this was prior to upgrading the tracking station.. so I\u0027m eyeballing everything and it\u0027s not perfect. My trajectory upon leaving the Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E took me a bit farther out than I\u0027d have liked, but still well within my ability to correct with available delta-v.. but the trip took a couple extra days and my kerbal went tourist on me.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere needs to be some way to pack extra rations in the early game.. 3\u00A0days just isn\u0027t enough.

Fertilizer is converted to snacks at a 1 to 1 ratio. Fertilizer is not produced on a vessel (no waste recycling or the like), so you have to take it from home if you\u0027re building a station (though the mod says you shouldn\u0027t?). The only real benefit to bringing fertilizer instead of just snacks is that fertilizer is more dense.. you can pack 1900 into a small container as opposed to like 95 snacks. I guess that\u0027s not an issue, though it does create some odd mass fluctuations as resources are converted.\u00A0All that said - it\u0027s extremely expensive in career mode. A small container of fertilizer is a whopping 28,500 credits \u002B 380 for the container. That\u0027s more than the entire station I\u0027m launching, and more than the rocket that\u0027s launching it. Also, why are there 5\u00A0different types of fertilizer and snacks? Wouldn\u0027t it be better if progressing in research simply increased the efficiency of your modules? As is, I have to have numerous different types of storage for various types of resources. I don\u0027t really like having to launch my station with T0 fertilizer storage, T1 fertilizer storage, T2 fertilizer storage, T0 snack storage, T1 snack storage, T2 snack storage, T4 snack storage..\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s necessary if you want to have any \u0022room to grow\u0022 in your station as you unlock higher tiers, and it\u0027s not exactly ideal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the unfortunate Kerbal - well, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027d call that by design.\u00A0 A Mun voyage is supposed to be a 1-day affair, and this one appears to have strung out past 9 (the 2 or 3 days on-board and the 7 days of foraging).\u00A0 Sorry about that!\u00A0 But this is a life-support mod, and it does add a new way to screw things up, and, given it\u0027s your first go at it, well, that\u0027s how it often happens.\u00A0 Or at least it does for me.\u00A0 I suggest you watch a few ShadowZone videos (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkKhZJXIx7YkHnpLXxUjYsQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkKhZJXIx7YkHnpLXxUjYsQ\u003C/a\u003E).\u00A0 And after you get the claw-part unlocked, you can go mount a rescue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with you that there needs to be a tank earlier in the tech tree.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t notice it before, but the smallest configurable B9 tank is all the way up at \u0022Fuel Systems\u0022.\u00A0 I\u0027ll see about starting a pull request in the B9 mod\u00A0to get the smallest tank bumped up from \u0027Fuel Systems\u0027 to \u0027General Rocketry\u0027.\u00A0 I\u0027d also like to find the time to learn enough about creating the art to create a simple cylindrical tank that could be used for early missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFertilizer takes a *long* time to go through at the early tiers.\u00A0 100 units of fertilizer will last for quite a while.\u00A0 500 is (as I recall) enough to progress you to Tier-1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that all the different tiers of stuff makes the UI for changing tank types pretty awful.\u00A0 My plan is that once I get the thing to basically function in all ways, I\u0027ll get after some stuff like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, you might not have noticed that the B9-tank types are configurable in-flight.\u00A0 Also, it\u0027s intended that you might do something like create a Tier-2 base on the surface of a body, and then truck the snacks up to a station in orbit, so your kerbals will consume a mix of agroponics, Tier2 farmed snacks from the surface, and Tier-4 snacks from Kerban.\u00A0 So having different working tiers on a station at once is within the realm of reality.\u00A0 And you really don\u0027t need a huge variety of tanks.\u00A0 The bases and such in my playthroughs generally have around 4 tanks, for fertilizer, snacks, and shinies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, it\u0027s assumed in this that a Tier-1 base is effectively made obsolete by the advent of tier-2 equipment.\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t have to be so, if you don\u0027t want it, but I think most players are happy to send up new ships.\u00A0 Particularly given that advancing to a new tier is usually a long-term affair.\u00A0 My own playthrough is sitting at T3 on Minmus, T2 on the Mun, T1 on Duna (waiting for T2 parts) and T1 on Gilly (with a much-anticipated launch to Dres in the offing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI appreciate the candid feedback!\u00A0 I hope you\u0027ll keep persevering!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drhay53","CreatedById":150399,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-20T13:14:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure I have the time to do this, but with module manager you (or someone) could:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- take one of the small 1.25m stock tanks.

Others typically allow for some small radial supply tanks early on too, allowing a mk1 pod to go to Minmus easily enough.

title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going for a couple things with Hydroponics:\u00A0 The first is to avoid what ended up happening in MKS - where hydroponics became just better than agriculture in every way.\u00A0 The second is that I wanted a concept that bundled food-consumption and \u0022recycling\u0022 into one concept that\u0027s easier to do math on than, say, where MKS ended up with its recycling\u002Bconsumption\u002Bcolony-supplies model.\u00A0 So the arbitrary \u0022you can\u0027t store it\u0022 thing reflects both the recycliness of hydroponics and the desire to have a clean break between the landed and en-route/orbital parts of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a mission-planning perspective, I think it simplifies matters quite a bit - because what happens in orbit stays in orbit.\u00A0 In my own playthroughs, I see a couple things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFor there-and-back missions (e.g. your T0 mission), it\u0027s best to just calculate how much top-tier snacks you\u0027ll need in each phase, and bring that many.\u00A0 Yes, the landed base\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0produce snacks that are useful for both the orbital base and the return journey, but I find it best to ignore that and use the extra food as a buffer against crappy maneuver node planning.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOnce you get T2\u002B, you\u0027ll find there\u0027s really no reason for your kerbals to return.\u00A0 So, once you get to this \u0022permanent\u0022 stage, you can pretty much quit doing hydroponics for your orbital base and supply it from local agriculture.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor brief junkets (e.g. you want to take some kerbals from Duna to Ike so they can get their stars), yes, you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0bring snacks and yes, you haven\u0027t much alternative but to bring T4 snacks because hydroponic modules are too ungainly for short junkets like this.\u00A0 I find that these missions are so short that it doesn\u0027t really impact your planning.\u00A0 Further, if it\u0027s just a flag-collecting journey or some other such thing lasting less than a week, you can skip the snacks and it\u0027ll all work out because of the grace-period built into snack consumption.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo anyway, play the mod a while, and you\u0027ll see that you don\u0027t have much need for stored hydroponic snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could be that I\u0027ve nerfed hydroponics a bit too much.\u00A0 Now it\u0027s primarily an en-route aide, and not a great one at that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the roadmap, I feel like I\u0027m pretty much done.\u00A0 Right now I\u0027m in the final phases of testing a couple of capabilities that I\u0027ve already mentioned before - particularly being able to upgrade modules on-site if you have Extraplanetary Launchpads.\u00A0 I felt like making the requirement for EPL made sense because if a player doesn\u0027t have EPL, then it must mean they don\u0027t want the ability to build outside of the KSP.\u00A0 Maybe they feel like it nerfs the game too much, or maybe it\u0027s just too complicated.\u00A0 If that\u0027s so, then upgrading probably won\u0027t be their cup of tea either.\u00A0 If you do have EPL, there are all kinds of wacky things you can do in order to get the effect of upgrade-on-site, and I feel like once you get going with the mod, you\u0027re just going to do that, and the consequence of doing that are some wonky-looking bases and a bit of \u0022will-the-kraken-strike\u0022 drama that nobody needs.\u00A0 So yeah, that\u0027s a thing now.\u00A0 I\u0027m happy with that.\u00A0 The other change that still needs validation in my playthrough is to make it so that once you\u0027ve unlocked enough T3 techs that you can skip Tier-1 and go right to Tier-2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce that\u0027s done, there\u0027ll be no alternative but to face the peril of designing some parts.\u00A0 I\u0027ve been cribbing off of a number of other mods and stock parts, but there are a large number of parts that suck:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThere\u0027s no small snack storage.\u00A0 Particularly none that looks good on early Minmus missions.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe orbital scanner\u00A0doesn\u0027t look the part.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe factories are identical, and identical to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E parts, and that\u0027s highly unfun.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027d love to have a larger farm part.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I find the whole process of part design really daunting - I\u0027ve gotta learn my way around modeling tools (when even picking the modeling tool is a perilous choice, it seems)\u00A0and nobody is worse at photoshop than I am.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the most important thing to do is to hear what people think.\u00A0 I haven\u0027t heard a lot of feedback; certainly none from people who had extended experience with it.\u00A0 That\u0027s disappointing, but I suppose pretty much normal.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t provide Roverdude a whole lot of feedback even though I played MKS to death.\u00A0 But trust me, I\u0027m listening.\u00A0 Right now the best piece of feedback is from the few folks who complained about the early game experience and suggested that a dedicated food-container with a proper early-game form-factor would be good.\u00A0 At first I didn\u0027t agree, but after a bit of soul-searching, I fully see their point now.\u00A0 One other piece of feedback I got really early and I\u0027m really glad I listened was that I had a \u0022colony supplies\u0022 analog, and (sorry, I forget who), told me to skip it and see how you get on.\u00A0 I now feel that he was more than correct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I\u0027m disappointed in with my playthroughs is the role of the manned orbital station.\u00A0 The scanner, right now, seems a force-fit.\u00A0 But I\u0027m low on ideas of how to make that better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drhay53","CreatedById":150399,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-29T13:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust wanted to chime in and say that I still
