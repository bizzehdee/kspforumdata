Recently I have been really in to all the DMP battle servers going up, but am repeatedly dissapointed when each and every one has some combination of pointless military mods full of pew pew shot guns and rocket launchers. I view this as a waste of the ingenuity of the KSP core design, and while I won\u0027t get in the way of people making such mods, I don\u0027t like them. KSP is about creativity, ingenuity, design, engineering, piloting, and conceptualization. Slapping a pair of machine guns on the Ravenspeare mk IV and flying in circles attempting to gun down your fellow is sad. So, as the kind of person who rather seek new answers than just declare other\u0027s answers are wrong, I have begun the development of a list of mods for DMP combat. There will be no guns or other specifically military features, instead just a wide variety of versatile parts that one can shape into varied ways to smash the opposition. Rather than hand you all guns, I would rather give you screwdrivers, and see what people can use the screwdriver to make. In the ideal server, every hostile encounter would be like a boss battle, like walking into the last room of a dungeon and having no clue what the spectrum of violence the enemy will deploy is. So to gather some ideas as to what I should add, remove, tweak or otherwise alter, I will post a list of currently employed mods.
