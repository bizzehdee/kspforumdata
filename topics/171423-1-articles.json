They have comms (RA-15 dish plus tracking station is fully upgraded), but if I leave them and go back to the space centre I can never go back to them. They are not listed as available ships. If I move the map around, I can see them and see their comms network, but I can\u0027t fly them any more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just tested it again with a probe to Duna, after completing a circularisation maneuver I went back to the tracking station only to see that the probe was immediately not available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone seen this before? Is quite annoying as I have several contracts to complete and I have to keep sending a new probe every time I start the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaz\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tazbertair","CreatedById":12692,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-26T14:24:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGaaah! much derpitude was had by all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are listed under \u0027relays\u0027 not \u0027probes\u0027 as they have RA-15 dishes.
