However the Add Maneuver menu has all three 3d axes. Personally I find myself having to keep checking the Add Maneuver menu, and then looking at where Maneuver Prograde is, or going into Ship Mode to look at where my ship is facing. The numbers are just too small and square.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would make orbiting much easier if all of the Add Maneuver markers, like Normal and Antinormal, and Radial In and Radial Out, were visible on the Navball in Orbit mode. This would be a toggle in the options menu, so somebody could use prograde and retrograde only if they wanted. New players might have all the icons enabled by default, the tutorial introducing them one by one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, Target Prograde and Target Retrograde should have their color changed to be different from Normal and Antinormal. I suggest that the color is the color of the body you\u0027re targeting (Kerbin is teal, Mun is grey, Eve is purple--all the default colors). If not, just whatever color works to distinguish it from the other ones on the Navball.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T02:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the target marker should always be the same color.
