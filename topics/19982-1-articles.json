I do have a few questions though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any particular place to report bugs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo offer suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also was curious about how other people play the game. When you go from Kerbin to Eve, for example, do you actually calculate when and where to burn, or do you just eyeball it and adjust as you go? I\u0027ve seen lots of people complaining about the difficulty of matching orbital inclinations, and that confused me. It seems fairly easy to do, so much so that I\u0027m wondering if I\u0027m doing it wrong. The orbits match in the end though, so I guess I can\u0027t be too far off the mark. Perhaps the difference is that I\u0027m not particularly constrained by time in the way I play it - I don\u0027t mind letting a few orbits go by before something happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T10:42:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make bug reports in the Bug Reports sub forum, where the test team will take a look at them (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/forumdisplay.php/42-Bug-Reports\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/forumdisplay.php/42-Bug-Reports\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions can be placed in the Suggestions sub forum (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/forumdisplay.php/41-Suggestions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/forumdisplay.php/41-Suggestions\u003C/a\u003E), though make sure to read the \u0022What not to suggest\u0022 sticky as there are certain topics which come up repeatedly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I play the game pretty backwards, I follow the instructions of those more knowledgeable, then when I can do the mission routinely I dig lightly into the maths so I can understand where these come from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Engineering!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T20:40:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Jason Patterson, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play KSP totally by eye and feel, I\u0027m not one fore maths these days, once you realize how craft move when in orbit the rest becomes easy, but as it is so different to what we are used to on the ground it can be very confusing to new pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
