First half of the mission was to Orbit, second half was to attempt a landing on Mun. However it didn\u0027t have enough fuel for that, it had enough to reach mun, had enough to get back to Kerbin but land?

I decided to send up some living accomodation consisting of a lander can atop a hitchhiker can with a docking port at each end. On top of that, a one-man capsule with an equipment bay with a battery and monoprop in it, heatshield, and a docking port attached to the heatshield. Whole lot lofted by three orange tanks and a couple of mainsails. All went well, got the accomodation into a near-perfect 100km orbit, thanks to MechJeb. Deployed solar panels on the beginnnings of my space station, then Jeb undocked and landed within 6km of KSC (again thanks to MechJeb). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, a three-man capsule atop the OKS core unit, same launcher, initial 95km orbit, then a Hoihmann transfer to get within 2km of the target. Took a bit of faffing to get the dock, but learnt a bit more about Navyfish\u0027s docking indicator in the process (I\u0027d thoroughly reccomend that mod to anyone, btw). Now, when I got the initial bit of the station into orbit, I left the top stage attached as it still had a fair bit of fuel left, and I thought that might come in useful eventually, and indeed, having seen that the top stage of the second launch came a little closer to the station than I was comfortable with, I decided to move the station a little. I got MechJeb to compute a node, and then..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and then I forgot that in order to dock, I;d had to switch the point at which the capsule/OKS module combination was commanded from to the rear of the OKS module. Cue a wild few seconds of the station whirling around crazily, threatening to break up before I recovered from the shock and cut the engine. Oh, darn - instead of raising the orbit by 5km, the station was now starting to de-orbit. Ok, check fuel, should be enough to recover the situation. Line up and - yes, I\u0027d forgotten again that the navball would be pointing me the wrong way, and by the time I realised my second mistake, the station wasn;t only deorbiting, it was doing so rather rapidly. All I could do was detach the 3-man capsule and get out of the way of the fallingstation, so that Jeb, Bill and Bob could land safely, which they did. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy beautiful baby space station!
