I am restricted to Blender and all (btw superb) free software around there because of my age. (Broken completely, i\u0027m 11... my dad made the account... damn VBulletin...). I show you here something i made only with Gimp (Making it rendered by Blender should improve greatly the result). I think you were talking about the effect of \u0022fading\u0022 from light to dark in order to get an \u0022atmosphere-like\u0022 effect. Please give me your opinion.

If I were you, I\u0027d tone down the atmosphere a little bit on the dark half of the planet. You\u0027ve got the spherical dropoff going good, it just needs to be a bit more pronounced. Also, maybe work on a better sun texture, as the current one is basically a lens flare effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
