You wouldn\u0027t happen to consider adding Near Future Technologies and/or Interstellar(Lite or otherwise) to your supported configs, would you?

Those configs are currently bundled with RF. I did submit a pull request with NFT Structural tanks taken care of. Honestly the best way to take care of that is to either submit a pull request in the RF/MFT repository, or get the mod authors to include a copy of the tank config (with :NEEDS[RealFuels] attached to each call to ensure it doesn\u0027t load unless it needs to). The tanks are easy to set up to, just multiply the total of LF \u002B Ox by 5. That\u0027s your volume, and just set up an appropriate tank type. Usually that\u0027s enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Tweakscale and RF are having some issues together, but Nathan mentioned elsewhere that they\u0027ll be looked into for the next release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDamDog","CreatedById":110766,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T01:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGratse!

This has the double benefit of providing hydrogen for the sabatier process. If a liquid state is absolutely necessary, a phase converter can be used. I know gas-\u0026gt;liquid is power intensive, but I plan to use this on an ion propulsion craft, where I have plenty of renewable power generation.
