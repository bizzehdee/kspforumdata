It\u0027s already in space, and I\u0027ve tried removing and reattaching the port the other way around, but it won\u0027t attach to structure once I\u0027ve turned it around.

When you dismount them try placing them somewhere else if you can and then move them again to the desired location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sardia","CreatedById":149922,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T16:30:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes it does. The problem is that you\u0027re probably using the wrench instead of the screwdriver. The wrench only keys your disassemble parts or attach radial parts. The screwdriver does everything.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
