Using the cfg file settings from 2.5b did not give me the behaviour from 0.23.5 so I have to assume that one of the 0.24 changes is what caused this new behaviour. If you want the decoupler to stay attached to the spent stage, you would need 2 variants of the decoupler - one with the explosiveNodeID set to top and one with it set to bottom2 to cover everything. Seeing as I don\u0027t care if it does not stay attached I am using isOmniDecoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
