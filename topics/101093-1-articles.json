We\u0027ve seen all the components for the idea of this mod before in various mods before, but this particular amalgamation is something I came up with last night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a stanford torus mod, but it\u0027s, well, actually too big to fit in-game without work. We\u0027ve got Porkjet\u0027s centrifuge inflatable habitat, but it\u0027s old, and, well, kind of wimpy. We\u0027re got the MKS/OKS systems, but they\u0027re small, and not that suited for monolithic structures. We\u0027ve got the universal storage system, with wedges of purpose-built modules that allow for multiple purposes and vast flexibility within the same area of space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s combine the ideas. A central axis/wedge holding system, designed to fit wedges around it to produce a diameter of 5 or 10 meters (depending on the design) with zero-g environment end-caps for purposes needing them. A series of purpose-built wedges designed for various needs (life support wedge, snack high security chamber, crew quarters, SCIENCE!, workshop, power generator, rec room, observation deck, etc) which can be fitted into this system, albeit permanently welded in due to their size (2 meters from inner attachment point to outer hull for the small size, 3.5 meters for the 10 meter size). All of this with all the optional modules for various life support mods and colony mods, with a zero-g 5 \u0026amp; 10 meter super-lab for helping to close one end or another, or a super-workshop for Extraplanetary Launchpads, or a super-command module, and a plate built for welding 4-5 3.75 meter drive systems in case you don\u0027t have something like old \u0027boom-boom to loft the assembly into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have negative modeling skills, but I might be able to help with the programming of said modules and chribbing the good stuff off to make it all work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CptRichardson","CreatedById":269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T06:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGeneral Part Objectives:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximum Habitat, Utility, \u0026amp; Station Size without unrealistically massive part counts/unrealistically massive rockets (like, say, anything more than a 5-cluster of 3.75 meter ascent rockets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAimed for sizes: 5 Meter diameter, 7.5 meter diameter, 10 meter diameter in 2.5 meter height, 3.75 meter height, and 5 meter height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypes: Centrifugal \u0026amp; Fixed sections respectively for varying needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECentrifugal types: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESingular drum mounted between fixed ends, wedge system for multi-purpose sections (in half-wedges and quarter wedges).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESnack/Life Support Storage \u0026amp; Processing Center\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEPL Workshop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience Lab\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand Post/Communications center\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReactor system/Utility Section\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDual Paired Reaction wheel system/Utility section\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife Support Generation Section (Farm center?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObservation Deck\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed types: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWedges around central Axis (possibly reusing Centerfugal sections)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween-size adaptors with use?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESingular Drum\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4-Way retracting/extending shielded arms for creating Hub section, minimum of 3.75 meters tall for allowing users to connect up to modded 3.75 meter berthing docking collars.
