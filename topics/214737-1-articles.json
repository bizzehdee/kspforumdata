Clicking login resulted in an error message, see screenshot below. Once the server got over itself, clicking login resulted in yet another login via my web browser.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of the promise relating to using the launch screen and requesting a PD login to participate was that login would be one time only.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is not functioning as promised / intended, therefore this is a bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpected behaviour would be that no further login would be requested if the servers are not working, since it would be futile to request a manual login attempt at such a time QED and the only viable option is to skip it, so under these circumstances the launcher should automatically skip login.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther to this...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs this must be the actual behaviour to comply with the one login promise and simple userfriendly logic, later in development the game will need to be able to relog in game if there is a log failure at startup due to temporary server glitches, in order to enable multiplayer server access without having to restart the game. This makes the pregame launcher and login redundant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why the login procedure should be part of a single click game launch, not a separate launcher requiring redundant clicks and waiting to get the game running which is a bad way to do it not simply because of the above experience when it goes wrong but also because of the poor user experience and gratuitous obstruction it creates even when it works right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223gqwkc3.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002274.75\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3gqwkc3.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
