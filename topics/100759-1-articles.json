After setting my tablet to relative mode, I still have the same problem, I right click, and movement of the pen doesn\u0027t register as mouse movement. I wonder that maybe unity detects mouse movement, while my pad sets the mouse position, instead of move the mouse to the position.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T14:11:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis may be something that is only addressable by changing the code that handles input, I found these on the Unity site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/144539/using-wacom-pen-as-input-device.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUsing a wacom for input.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ConventionalGameInput.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUnity input docs.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Unity won\u0027t use the pen in either mode there may be nothing we can do, sorry :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
