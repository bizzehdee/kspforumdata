It\u0027s use will be twofold\n\n1. Providing an extensive and easy to follow means searching through the part catalog for end users.\n2. Providing an in game UI for creating subcategories to be used with Filter Extensions.\n\nThe initial focus will be in creating a UI that isn\u0027t prone to breakages / a complete mess and exposes the full functionality provided by FE in a manner that is easily used. For the time being, permanent additions will have to be achieved by copying the generated nodes out of the logs and into somewhere more appropriate.\n\n[**Download**](https://github.com/Crzyrndm/FE-Part-Search/blob/master/GameData/PartSearch/PartSearch.dll?raw=true) - Requires Filter Extensions v2.2.1\u002B\n\nLicense is GPLv3\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T05:26:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 05:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T03:59:12Z","Content":"Download is in two parts for a while as I built this against the dev version of Filter Extensions\n\nPlace in GameData (location doesn\u0027t matter): [Part Search .dll](https://github.com/Crzyrndm/FE-Part-Search/blob/master/GameData/PartSearch/PartSearch.dll?raw=true) and [Filter Extensions .dll](https://github.com/Crzyrndm/FilterExtension/blob/master/GameData/000_FilterExtensions/FilterExtensions.dll?raw=true) (note, if you are already using Filter Extensions, remember to overwrite/remove the old one)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T23:11:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 11:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T05:08:05Z","Content":"Since this works with Filter Extensions, how about \u0022Filter Creator\u0022 for the name?\n\nEDIT: And you found the question mark!
