On parts with multi-axis tracking, it locks -all- axis and uses the same rotation for all, which is not quite ideal.

They are also intended to be near-fully used up by the time you land, and should have minimal/no ablator left by the time you leave the danger zone (below ~1500m/s @ ~20-30km).  I felt that the stock heat shields were far too much of a \u0027throw one on and ignore re-entry\u0027 type setup, and far too powerful, and also mostly overkill (most re-entries landed with 3/4 ablator left on stock heat shields, which is just so much wasted mass...).\n\nHowever it sounds like I might need to increase their efficiency slightly.  ~1t does not sound like too big of a probe for that shield, it should probably be able to handle up to ~1.5t.

Honestly, it should burn up even faster when doing a re-entry like that (due to too high of \u0027peak\u0027 heat).... so obviously something is amiss on the code/tuning for those.

(Though for 2.5m I consider the stock mk1-2 pod to be grossly overweight, and not a good case for testing)\n\nIf you would really like to \u0027play\u0027 with the balance on them, there are a couple values in the config files that determine how the heat shield reacts to various heat loads.\n\nIn the SC-GEN-MHS.cfg file, if you find the MHS module, the following line determines how fast ablator is used:\n\n    ablationEfficiency = 8000\n\nIt is essentially how much \u0027flux\u0027 each unit of ablator can absorb before being consumed/blown off/whatever happens to ablator.  Higher values = more resilient heat shield that will last longer at any given heat load.\n\nSecondly, there are the heat-response curves, found in GameData/SSTU/Data/HeatShieldTypes.cfg.  These are specified as standard KSP float curves (key = \u003Cinput value=\u0022\u0022\u003E  \u003Coutput value=\u0022\u0022 for=\u0022\u0022 given=\u0022\u0022 input=\u0022\u0022\u003E), which in this case is \u0027key = \u003Cpart temp=\u0022\u0022\u003E \u003Cflux to=\u0022\u0022 remove=\u0022\u0022 per=\u0022\u0022 second=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u0027.  It is the second values that you would want to adjust/play with (the flux-to-remove-per-second).  In theory these curves were supposed to allow for the part to heat up to a given point before the ablation kicked in, increase ablation as heat increased to a point, but still allow for the re-entry to \u0027overpower\u0027 the ablation rate (resulting in higher part temps, and eventual explosions/loss of the heat shield part). \n\u003C/flux\u003E\u003C/part\u003E\u003C/output\u003E\n\nIt was working during testing when I developed the modules for the integrated heat-shields in pods, but that was several releases ago, and I\u0027m not sure that I did much testing on the stand-alone heat-shields (they likely react quite differently due to different mass ratios, and the very inaccurate thermodynamics model KSP uses by simulating one part at a time; might need more tuning, or possibly even custom curves defined for the stand-alone versions).\n\nOn that note -- how are the \u0027integrated\u0027 heat shields in the SC-pods working out?  Are they performing as intended in regards to capabilities (light = \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, medium = mun/minmus, heavy = \u0027low speed\u0027 interplanetary, ex-heavy = \u0027high speed\u0027 interplanetary)?\n\n(If I\u0027m going to do a tuning pass on them, might as well make sure they are -all- working as intended)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 27 minutes ago, Mike\u0060 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, i just noticed that the difference between the SC-V CM reentry module and the version without shield is 220kg, while the 2.5m medium shield is 711kg - those numbers should be balanced about the same, right?\n\u003E \n\nNot necessarily (also not addressing that those are prototype parts with placeholder stats, zero effort was given to balance those parts);  the stand-alone heat shield includes extra dry mass for \u0027structure\u0027 (which is itself mostly a hack to cope with KSPs previously mentioned poor thermo simulation; super-light parts really don\u0027t work well for heat-shields, the lighter it is the worse it works).\n\nWith the pods the difference between the CM and CMX is less than the heat shield mass, as the CMX versions should have more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel and higher dry mass to simulate the additional \u0027supplies\u0027 on board (with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS, etc, that mass is actually in the supplies rather than simulated, and the parts dry mass should be adjusted accordingly).
