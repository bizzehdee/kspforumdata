Edit Kethane/Resources/Kethane.cfg, and in the RESOURCE_DEFINITION, just add \u0022isTweakable = true\u0022. From that point forward, all kethane tanks work as normal, start empty as normal, but you can right-click and put some kethane in while building things in the VAB (and why not? You have limitless resources in the VAB normally, no reason why kethane should be any more limited than liquid fuel or monopropellant in this respect).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice I did that, but when using the kethane jet engine going out of the atmosphere it flames out and never recovers, the kintake air never moves until this happens goes from full to 0 flame out. any ideas on how to fix?
