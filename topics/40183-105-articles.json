I decide to change the RepairParts resource with the Community Resource Packs \u0022SparParts\u0022 resource. This is the same resource used in DangIt and other awsome mods like Kerbanite, OKS, and MKS. So now if your using DangIt you can use the same SpareParts that the mod uses to do Mission Controller Repair Missions (hence the plural). Thats correct I plan on expanding the Repair Contracts in 1.09 a lot more then whats in this release. More types of repairs.. Think ISS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe catch was... and is.. that SpareParts is not a transferable resource like the old RepairParts was! Thats an issue, because I have no existing code in Mission Controller to overcome this fact. So instead of Writing about 2000 more lines of code. I looked around and found out that community already has EVA resource managment done. Kerbal Attachment system is a prime example and is now needed to carry around the Repair Can (yes its now KAS Enabled) and for the transfers of Non Transferable Resources I decided to use KERT (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93627-0-25-Kerbal-EVA-Resource-Transfer-v1-1-2-08-10-2014\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal EVA Resource Transfer\u003C/a\u003E).

Came out pretty good. And in that case repair missions are connected to a satellite and its Vessel ID. If you dock with that satellite its vessel ID totally changes to one of the two vessel IDs. When you undock 1 vessel keeps the original ID that was choosen when the initial dock happened, and the other one gets a whole new ID thats brand new.
