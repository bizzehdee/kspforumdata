If they do not, begin re-adding your mods one at a time testing after each one;  when the problems re-manifest, the most recently added mod is likely the culprit.

Will be available with the next update (possibly later tonight if I can work a couple things out).\n\nEdit: Working on sorting out the \u0027destroyed on splashdown\u0027 problem with the CM\u0027s.  Apparently it is the parachute module; I\u0027m thinking that the center of buoyency is calculated via render bounds, and that the parachutes are being calculated into these bounds;  when the parachutes are auto-cut, the **massive** change in COB causes the vessel to be flung at relativistic speeds, which results in either A: flung into space at random high velocity, B: destroyed by overheating, due to being in the atmo at an insane velocity, or C: gets flung into the terrain and destroyed.  Same thing causes all 3 depending on... well.. its KSP, so who knows.\n\n2nd Edit:  Nope, that wasn\u0027t it; it gets destroyed before the auto-cut even kicks in.  But, pretty sure it is something I can solve, as splashdowns -were- working earlier in the dev of the parachute; so it is likely something changed later in the dev cycle.  Now that I know where to look, I can go back through source-diff logs and find out what potential changes could be the culprit.\n\n3rd Edit:  Tracked it down to something to do with drag-cubes and the buoyancy model.  If I cut the chute ~2m above splashdown, all is fine; but if I let it touch down with chute deployed, everything goes bonkers.\n\n4th Edit:  Located a buoyancy-drag-cube-override that I can specify, that -appears- to solve the problem.  Will do a bit more testing, and then wrap this up for a release here shortly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-05T01:28:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2016 01:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T01:58:44Z","Content":"Updated testing release is available:\n\n[https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.3.25-pre6](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.3.25-pre6)\n\nA few bugfixes, and adds a second variant of the fuel tanks.
