While all seems well from afar, one of the missions seems to suffer from some mysterious bit rot (maybe I shouldn\u0027t have used nuclear engines?), and switching from Tracking to that mission will scramble reality: As a first indication that something\u0027s wrong, there will be no sign of the spacecraft, the flight indicators will fail to display properly (e.g. altitude and thrust displays will be blank), the map view will show nothing at all, and when I switch back to the space center... even that is gone! Where once was the KSC, now there\u0027s only the vast emptiness of space!
