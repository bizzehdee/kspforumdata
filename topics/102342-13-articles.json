The game was too unfinished and unpolished to go into beta testing. But you guys called it \u0022beta\u0022 so okay, we customers got ready to start seeing fixes for the literally hundreds of major gameplay-ruining bugs that we lived with all through the alpha period. Because that\u0027s what \u0022beta\u0022 means: It means bug fixes, and lots of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the three months since, you guys have fixed exactly zero bugs. Not a single one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we customers were already feeling kind of crapped on. It\u0027s a beta, huh? So where are the bug fixes? Three solid months without a single bug fix? That\u0027s not a beta. That\u0027s abandonware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then you guys started in with the girl kerbal thing. Okay, whatever I guess. Literally every player who wanted girl kerbals has had them through Texture Replacer, so you were pimping a solution in search of a problem, but hey, it\u0027s your game, you do what you want. If you want to make a big stink about girl kerbals instead of fixing bugs during the beta period, I guess that\u0027s your business. Meanwhile we customers will just sit here and become increasingly frustrated with your game because it keeps crashing and our ships keep exploding for no reason and our kerbals keep getting jettisoned off ladders for no reason while you guys waste a ton of time doing non-gameplay-related renderings of a new character who will have exactly no impact on the actual game itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then it was oh, we\u0027re rewriting the entire aerodynamics system. Why didn\u0027t you just write Ferram a check and buy FAR? No idea, you decided to write your own. Instead of fixing bugs. During the beta. Three months after the beta started, in fact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then it was oh, we\u0027re doing payload fairings. We\u0027ve already GOT payload fairings, guys, and we love how they work. Yours aren\u0027t going to be as good as Procedural Fairings? Then why are you wasting your time? Instead of fixing bugs? Cause the Mac version still can\u0027t run with full-res textures, you know. Because your memory leaks crash the game. Constantly. And you haven\u0027t fixed any of them. Despite promising to when you called it \u0022beta.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAND THEN just a few days ago all of a sudden it was \u0022Oh, geez, we bit off more than we can chew, and now we have to cut some of these AWESOME NEW FEATURES so we can spend a little time fixing a few bugs.\u0022 Why are you spending \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E time on new features? \u003Cstrong\u003EThe game is in beta.

Why haven\u0027t you released 0.91, 0.92 and 0.93 already so your customers can beta test them for you?\u003C/strong\u003E And then you guys were all \u0022Gee, what do you think, customers? You have to choose between new features and having a game that you don\u0027t hate for all its bugs.
