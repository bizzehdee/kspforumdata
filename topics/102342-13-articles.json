The game was too unfinished and unpolished to go into beta testing. But you guys called it \u0022beta\u0022 so okay, we customers got ready to start seeing fixes for the literally hundreds of major gameplay-ruining bugs that we lived with all through the alpha period. Because that\u0027s what \u0022beta\u0022 means: It means bug fixes, and lots of them.\n\nIn the three months since, you guys have fixed exactly zero bugs. Not a single one.\n\nSo we customers were already feeling kind of crapped on. It\u0027s a beta, huh? So where are the bug fixes? Three solid months without a single bug fix? That\u0027s not a beta. That\u0027s abandonware.\n\nAnd then you guys started in with the girl kerbal thing. Okay, whatever I guess. Literally every player who wanted girl kerbals has had them through Texture Replacer, so you were pimping a solution in search of a problem, but hey, it\u0027s your game, you do what you want. If you want to make a big stink about girl kerbals instead of fixing bugs during the beta period, I guess that\u0027s your business. Meanwhile we customers will just sit here and become increasingly frustrated with your game because it keeps crashing and our ships keep exploding for no reason and our kerbals keep getting jettisoned off ladders for no reason while you guys waste a ton of time doing non-gameplay-related renderings of a new character who will have exactly no impact on the actual game itself.\n\nAnd then it was oh, we\u0027re rewriting the entire aerodynamics system. Why didn\u0027t you just write Ferram a check and buy FAR? No idea, you decided to write your own. Instead of fixing bugs. During the beta. Three months after the beta started, in fact.\n\nAnd then it was oh, we\u0027re doing payload fairings. We\u0027ve already GOT payload fairings, guys, and we love how they work. Yours aren\u0027t going to be as good as Procedural Fairings? Then why are you wasting your time? Instead of fixing bugs? Cause the Mac version still can\u0027t run with full-res textures, you know. Because your memory leaks crash the game. Constantly. And you haven\u0027t fixed any of them. Despite promising to when you called it \u0022beta.\u0022\n\nAND THEN just a few days ago all of a sudden it was \u0022Oh, geez, we bit off more than we can chew, and now we have to cut some of these AWESOME NEW FEATURES so we can spend a little time fixing a few bugs.\u0022 Why are you spending *any* time on new features? **The game is in beta. It\u0027s been in beta for three months. Why haven\u0027t you fixed all the bugs already? Why haven\u0027t you released 0.91, 0.92 and 0.93 already so your customers can beta test them for you?** And then you guys were all \u0022Gee, what do you think, customers? You have to choose between new features and having a game that you don\u0027t hate for all its bugs. Which would you prefer?\u0022\n\nTalk about your all-time award-winning stupid questions.\n\nSo when you posted your ha-ha-so-funny-little-joke, you know how we all reacted? **With complete credulity.** Because there was nothing in it, not a single thing in it, that sounded out of character for Squad. Every single word of it sounded *exactly* like something the Squad of the past three months would try to pull. It wasn\u0027t outlandish or ridiculous, man. It was just par for the course.\n\nThis should chill you guys to the bone. You guys should have a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach right now. **Because we believed it.** Because it sounded exactly like something you guys would pull on us.\n\nStop being like this, Squad. Please. You guys used to be pretty okay, as indie game developers went. Your quality control was terrible and you had a bad reputation for excessive employee turnover, but your customers in general were willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThat\u0027s over now. You guys have squandered your customers\u0027 good will.\n\nEarn it back. Please."},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T02:06:30Z","Content":"in 2020 the April Fools will be in December..."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T02:15:31Z","Content":"I didn\u0027t really have any reaction to this.

This means that if they let any major bugs slip to the release (as they have done so in the past), they\u0027ll face immense criticism by, well...critics. However, if they release it as a beta update, the community will be able to find the major bugs of the game for Squad to (hopefully) fix. Also, this might be personal opinion, but I think Jeffery\u0027s \u0022rant\u0022 about the game is succinct and articulate and perfectly describes some issues in relation to Squad and their practices.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T02:58:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mythbusters844**\n  \nChanged wording"},{"CreatedByName":"jefferyharrell","CreatedById":27205,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T02:55:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are you happy to know that 1.0 will be spending more time in the bugfixing cycle than any update has before?\n\nNo. \u0022The bug fixing cycle\u0022 is a myth, as far as I can tell.
