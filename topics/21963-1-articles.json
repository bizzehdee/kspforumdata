I suck at building rockets, but I\u0027m ready to head to another planet. I did borrow a .craft and made it to Duna, but I touched down at a brisk 500m/s. M question is, which planet is easiest to get to? I\u0027m not dead set on a round trip, just want to make it there and land safely. So I guess a planet that\u0027s easy to land on and requires the least Delta-V would be ideal.

When landing, forget about the atmosphere, because it\u0027s too thin to use parachutes for more than a little bonus. Go for a powered landing like on the Mun, but with higher gravity. You can train by doing powered landings on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA is slightly harder to get to than Duna, but once you\u0027re there, landing is a breeze with the thick atmosphere. You can parachute yourself all the way down.

I\u0027ve done powered landings on Kerbin though, so it shouldn\u0027t be too much trouble.

Just remember to start your capture burn (the one that turns your fly-by into an orbit) well ahead of your Duna periapsis - take ten minutes as a ballpark number. A decent 100km parking orbit gives you a lot of room to consider your final landing. Go for a shallow descent so you maximize the effect of Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere slowing you down.

Remember that when landing on duna the parachutes can only suppliment and the thin atmosphere makes it a bit more challenging to decelerate. Primary thing when landing at Dune is never plan your line up for an actual touchdown. Focus on atmospheric braking and let the air slowly bring you down. If you can aim it for a crater landing, that will give yourself more atmo. You also need to combine the parachutes with engine braking.
