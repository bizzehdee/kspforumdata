This marks the end of a personal goal to take Jeb, Bob, and Bill to all of the planets and moons in the Kerbol system and bring them back home safe and sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome notes about the experience:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I am playing career mode with a custom variation of normal difficulty (checkboxes match moderate, but sliders match normal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* All three of these Kerbals: Jeb, Bob and Bill were together for each of these missions, and oftentimes I also had several others along too. None of these missions were done separately for the Kerbals, the three were always together. I did not even attempt a trip to the Mun or Minmus until I was capable of sending all 3 of these guys together. This was one of my main goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* All of these planets and moons were reached on separate trips, so this wasn\u0027t a grand tour with a mothership or anything like that. This was done gradually. I wish I had taken more screenshots along the way, but this little mission of mine kind of developed over time so I didn\u0027t document it much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Almost all of these planet and moon trips were combined with \u0022build a surface outpost\u0022 contracts, the early missions are the main exception as I did not have the reputation for the good station contracts until I was further along. This provided the funds necessary (and lots extra too) and it added a nice bit of challenge too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I\u0027m not sure why Jool isn\u0027t counting as an orbit, I\u0027ve orbited it countless times on this career, but it only shows \u0022flight\u0022. I have also planted flags on Kerbin, but that isn\u0027t much of an achievement and you don\u0027t get any XP for that so it doesn\u0027t show.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* My Eve Rocks challenge submission was a part of the overall work (see my signature).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I will admit to cheating on one very specific occasion. I sent 9 kerbals all the way to Moho for a surface station contract (my 3 orange-suits and a few trainees). This made for a VERY hard trip due to the massive amount of DV needed just to make orbit at Moho. But I planned it all out well, or so I thought, and landed on Moho, planted 9 flags (tedious), and then left for home. My fuel ran out with about 200 m/s DV remaining on my transfer burn back to Kerbin. I did not have a good quicksave spot that I could use to maybe attempt more efficient maneuvers, and I also forgot that I could probably get a few DV from my monopropellant. So I used hyperedit to add in a tiny amount of fuel and I continued on and flew out the rest of the mission. The way I see it, I sent a whopping NINE kerbals to Moho, I should be spotted the 200m/s DV for trying a harder mission. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I also chose to fly the remaining part of the mission instead of just using hyperedit to send me home. Anyway, all the rest of my missions were done by the books, so I don\u0027t feel too bad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Eve was the hardest body for me, followed by Moho and then Tylo. For Tylo, I had been doing my powered descents wrong and was able to correct that a bit with help today on the forum. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Most of these were done without refueling, but I did need to do it a couple times. Having foreseen the need for extra fuel, I had setup a fuel station at Jool before I bothered with any of Jool\u0027s moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I have learned a TON doing all of these trips, but there\u0027s still a lot more left for me to learn and master. If I ever try for this again (probably in 1.0), then I will likely try to combine more of these trips together, like hitting Duna and Ike in one trip, or trying for a Jool-5 challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T04:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell done!
