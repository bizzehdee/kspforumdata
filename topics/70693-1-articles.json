I\u0027ve done some Googling, and it appears nobody has really completed (or at least posted pictures or craft files) functional X71\u0027s or Armadillo\u0027s. So as a personal project, I\u0027m going to try and create both craft, as a total noob, using entirely stock parts. So these should be my first major form project; and thought it\u0027d be cool to share the WIP as I go along, and this thread so others can follow along as this newb tries a project that\u0027s probably totally out of his league.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went and picked up the movie, and forced my way through the whole thing, clicking my VLC\u0027s snapshot button with wild abandon gathering as many screengrab\u0027s of every angle I could possibly require to build both an X-71 and an Armadillo rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal count for screens (imgur albums of each can be made available if there is demand)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX71: 35 (down from 39 due to some unusable shots that had image corruption in the shuttle vicinity)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArmadillo: 45 (down from 46, due to a duplicate shot, picked up when I accidently shut the VLC down and had to scroll back to where I was)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we don\u0027t have nukes, let alone drills; to be classed as operational I\u0027m aiming to meet a few goals. If any others have some suggestions for making these craft be classified fully operational, I\u0027d be glad to hear them. Not guaranteeing I\u0027ll accept all, but some for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArmadillo creation posts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX71 creation posts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArmadillo functionality requirements:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Jumpjets have to operate.

I may come back in a few months (years) and try again, but I\u0027m going for realistic goals here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 1: First piece of work was going back through my screengrabs, and checking for duplicates and any unusable images. A few were found, but not as many as I expected given the amount of time I was pausing, doing the screenshot, and advancing. I also had to go back to specific timepoints frequently to slow the movie down alot to get the exact camera angle before it would get blocked by something/someone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eboth image packs have been uploaded for viewing by anyone else interested in trying their hand in this little project, and as a backup in case of HDD failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 2: Within 3 hours of starting this project, and posting it, I\u0027ve come to realise this is horribly out of my league. Zero experience with rovers, or planes (SSTO or other) makes this an insane project to start. However, I plan to stick with the general concept, under the probably mistaken belief that aiming high simply accelerates learning. After all, if I could stick with the utter horror that was the early years of EVE Online, I should be able to handle accelerated learning in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETabling the X71 for now, due to lack of appropriately shaped parts, and lack of understanding general spaceplane mechanics. Thoughts of a small Armadillo are also tabled, both due to wheel bases to be used, and lack of general experience in rovers.
