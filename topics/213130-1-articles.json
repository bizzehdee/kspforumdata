There\u0027s a bigger difference between \u0022sleek and pointy\u0022 and \u0022blunt and flat\u0022 than before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExhibit A: I am consistently reaching low Kerbin orbit with 3200 m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E now, where I needed 3400-3500 in KSP1. Sometimes even a bit less than 3200. The rockets I was testing this with are super simple: mk1 pod with a parachute, fuel tanks, and engine. Nothing attached to the outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExhibit B: I tried launching an uncrewed probe. I knew my launch vehicle was passively unstable, as it had no second stage to keep the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E forward (it is \u003Cem\u003Eso easy\u003C/em\u003E to get into Kerbin orbit single-stage), and a fairing larger than the stack, but I stubbornly tried anyway. After flipping over three times, I gave in to common sense and went back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, planning to add a second stage. But on a hunch, the first thing I tried was tucking the solar panels just a bit more snugly against the probe, and rebuilding the fairing just a bit more snugly around it. I also made the tip of the fairing more pointy. Fairings currently appear to be massless, so there\u0027s no reason to be stingy. Lo and behold - the thing flew without flipping! Just by changing the aerodynamics of the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExhibit C: In KSP1, I would typically hold on to my fairings until about 45 km. By common wisdom, this was already considered fairly high, and most players would ditch their fairings lower than that. This time in KSP2, I had troubles with fairing separation under thrust (in KSP1 I used to turn \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E the separation force of fairings to get a smooth detach, here in KSP2 it seems I need to turn it \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E instead), and so I hung on to my fairing until I had my AP where I wanted and shut down the engine. That was at 55 km altitude. Just coasting like that, my apoapsis altitude changed by maybe one meter per second, dropping due to drag on the vehicle. As soon as I popped the fairings, though? The apoapsis altitude started changing rapidly, maybe as much as 10 meters per second. Not a problem, obviously, as I was rapidly leaving the atmosphere behind, but that is a huge amount of drag for 55km. An order of magnitude drag increase just from popping the fairing around a XS size probe. KSP2 definitely encourages us to encapsulate our payloads, and hang on to our fairings for longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: apologies for how this post became a wall of text; I was trying to split it into two posts, but the forum force-merges them every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second difference? There were a lot of rocket engine buffs. A few nerfs too, though far fewer and smaller. Overall, engines have gotten better, which probably contributes to how it feels easier to launch now than in KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Reliant lost 5s of Isp (260s-305s instead of 265s-310s), but got uprated from 240 to 260 kN. Doesn\u0027t seem like much, but where a 16 ton vehicle would have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.307 on the pad in KSP1, the same vehicle will have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.412 in KSP2. That\u0027s a difference you\u0027ll notice in flight. In a sense, the Reliant became the Kodiak from Making History, and that was a no-brainer upgrade.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Swivel got a major buff - and fairly so, I\u0027d say, considering how the Reliant overshadowed it in KSP1. Vacuum Isp and thrust stayed the same, but sea level Isp went from 250s to 280s, and as a result, sea level thrust went from 168 kN to 188 kN. At the same time, its mass dropped from 1.5 tons to 1.4 tons. It\u0027s a much better engine now.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Terrier actually received a mild nerf! Only 335s vacuum Isp instead of 345s. This will definitely impact the way we build Mun landers. However, its role as a second stage engine for launches from Kerbin wasn\u0027t much affected, because its sea-level Isp went from 85s to 170s. The Terrier will now be more efficient and have better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E just after stage separation.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Dart got a big swing with the nerfbat. 300s-320s Isp instead of 290s-340s, and maximum thrust dropped from 180 kN to 170 kN. But fear not... even after all that, it still remains one of the best launch engines for S-size stacks in the game. Just shows how \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er).

Yeah, it\u0027s strictly worse now. Yeah, it\u0027s still a silly engine for its form factor, and you should have no issues building shuttle replicas.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHey, remember the Thud?

Now it went from 120 kN max thrust to 140 kN, hopefully helping it find more use.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLooking at the XS-sized engines, the allmighty Ant got its vacuum Isp increased from 315s to 330s, though sadly it lost its non-blocky second variant, which I loved... \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003EThe spider got 25% more thrust with no other changes (2.0 kN -\u0026gt; 2.5 kN), while the Twitch got a little heavier (80kg -\u0026gt; 100kg) and had its Isp changed from 275s-290s to 265s-298s. The Spark lost 5s vacuum Isp but gained 5s sea level Isp (now 270s-315s).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGoing up in size instead, the Skipper got... nerfed? A little? Max thrust went from 650 kN to 600 kN. But Isp went up... strictly speaking... theoretically... by exactly 2s \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBut hey, at least the Mainsail, which already had too much thrust in KSP1, now has even more thrust! 1600 kN instead of 1500. It lost a lot of Isp though, going from 285s-301s to 265s-307s. Prepare to dump a lot of fuel into this hungry maw. But when you do, \u003Cem\u003Eit\u0027ll go\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Poodle unsurprisingly got the same treatment as the Terrier, meaning: less vacuum Isp (350s -\u0026gt; 340s) but more sea level Isp (90s -\u0026gt; 175s). But unlike the Terrier, it also went down in max thrust significantly, from 250 kN to 215 kN. Fair enough, it used to be on the awkwardly-too-strong side for most landers. This might actually make it easier to use.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnother size class up, the Rhino went on a diet: 8 tons instead of 9. In return its maximum thrust dropped from 2000 kN to 1750. The redesign away from orbital use to a sustainer type is felt in the Isp, which changed from 205s-340s to 285s-325s. For orbital work we now have the Labradoodle, which is completely new.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Mammoth is now the Mammoth-II, and looks the part of its namesake with its ginormous \u003Cs\u003Etrunk\u003C/s\u003E errr I mean turbopump exhaust. It got a mild thrust uprating from 4000 kN to 4250 kN, and like the mainsail, lost a good chunk of Isp: 270s-310s instead of 295s-315s.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll of the SRBs stayed the same, and I didn\u0027t look at the jet engines, as I\u0027m just not a plane type of person.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHere is where it gets really interesting though: the high-impulse, alternative-fuel engines. All of them got \u003Cem\u003Eso much stronger\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nJust look at the Nerv. Maximum thrust went from 60 kN to 75 kN. Isp went from 185s-800s to 250s-900s. Those are two massive buffs, but it\u0027s not the end just yet: in KSP2, all fuel tanks - including hydrogen - got normed to a mass ratio of 9, whereas in KSP1, the plane parts that were so often used with the Nerv due to a lack of dedicated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-only rocket tanks were more around 8. So not only did the engine get a lot better, the tanks for the engine got better too!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThen there\u0027s the new nuclear engine, the Swerv. And it\u0027s absurd.

It is overtuned to such a monstrous degree next to all other engines, there\u0027s just no comparison. I reckon this is our preview for what higher tech levels are going to be offering, at a game stage where the Kerbals have colonies all over the system and interstellar technology is close at hand.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLet\u0027s not forget the Dawn ion drive, either. On the surface, it received a small nerf, in the sense that it needs a bit more energy to run now (10 EC/s instead of 8.74 EC/s). But just like the Nerv is benefitting from better tankage, so is the Dawn. Xenon tanks used to have a mass fraction of 4. Now, just like all other tanks, they\u0027re at 9. That means they contain \u003Cem\u003Emore than two and a half times\u003C/em\u003E the amount of xenon for the same dry mass. You might not notice it that much when attaching only a single tank and getting a small few thousand m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E; but it\u0027s gonna scale so much higher so much more easily.

I can literally mount a smaller tank than in KSP1 and get into orbit anyways - with an engine that has the same or slightly less Isp (the Reliant).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have, however, noticed some weirdness with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E math in more complex designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, I just tried to do a Mun mission. First stage with a Skipper, second stage with a Poodle, third stage was a lander can with some small tanks and eight Ant engines. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E certified me 6650 m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, which would be enough to land on the Mun and return to Kerbin. In practical application, I couldn\u0027t even land that without running out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat went wrong? Well, for starters, the calculator doesn\u0027t like more than one engine on a stage. If I attached a single Ant to my lander can, the calculated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E figure was noticeably \u003Cem\u003Esmaller\u003C/em\u003E than with all eight attached, despite this being less mass! Another problem lies in the fuel crossfeed logic being broken. When I launch this rocket, the first stage will drain its own tanks, and the tanks of the lander, but (curiously enough) not the tanks of the second stage. This not only leads to fuel being consumed by a lower Isp engine, reducing available \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E below what the calculator said, but additionally, the calculator actually factors in that it can errorneously access tanks it shouldn\u0027t be able to. So it gave me a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E figure for the first stage. The second stage did not drain any tanks it shouldn\u0027t, but I can\u0027t disprove the suspicion that it, too, calculated with the wrong amount of fuel. All in all, this rocket probably displayed at least 1000m/s more than it actually had.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I had none of these issues with my test rockets likely lies in the fact that they were a single stage with a single engine, thus neatly sidestepping all of the mentioned problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T14:30:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 02:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T16:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224244072\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213130\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677419645\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s your launch profile?

But on a hunch, the first thing I tried was tucking the solar panels just a bit more snugly against the probe, and rebuilding the fairing just a bit more snugly around it. I also made the tip of the fairing more pointy. Fairings currently appear to be massless, so there\u0027s no reason to be stingy. Lo and behold - the thing flew without flipping! Just by changing the aerodynamics of the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExhibit C: In KSP1, I would typically hold on to my fairings until about 45 km. By common wisdom, this was already considered fairly high, and most players would ditch their fairings lower than that. This time in KSP2, I had troubles with fairing separation under thrust (in KSP1 I used to turn \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E the separation force of fairings to get a smooth detach, here in KSP2 it seems I need to turn it \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E instead), and so I hung on to my fairing until I had my AP where I wanted and shut down the engine. That was at 55 km altitude. Just coasting like that, my apoapsis altitude changed by maybe one meter per second, dropping due to drag on the vehicle. As soon as I popped the fairings, though? The apoapsis altitude started changing rapidly, maybe as much as 10 meters per second. Not a problem, obviously, as I was rapidly leaving the atmosphere behind, but that is a huge amount of drag for 55km. An order of magnitude drag increase just from popping the fairing around a XS size probe. KSP2 definitely encourages us to encapsulate our payloads, and hang on to our fairings for longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: apologies for how this post became a wall of text; I was trying to split it into two posts, but the forum force-merges them every time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second difference? There were a lot of rocket engine buffs. A few nerfs too, though far fewer and smaller. Overall, engines have gotten better, which probably contributes to how it feels easier to launch now than in KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Reliant lost 5s of Isp (260s-305s instead of 265s-310s), but got uprated from 240 to 260 kN. Doesn\u0027t seem like much, but where a 16 ton vehicle would have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.307 on the pad in KSP1, the same vehicle will have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.412 in KSP2. That\u0027s a difference you\u0027ll notice in flight. In a sense, the Reliant became the Kodiak from Making History, and that was a no-brainer upgrade.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Swivel got a major buff - and fairly so, I\u0027d say, considering how the Reliant overshadowed it in KSP1. Vacuum Isp and thrust stayed the same, but sea level Isp went from 250s to 280s, and as a result, sea level thrust went from 168 kN to 188 kN. At the same time, its mass dropped from 1.5 tons to 1.4 tons. It\u0027s a much better engine now.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Terrier actually received a mild nerf! Only 335s vacuum Isp instead of 345s. This will definitely impact the way we build Mun landers. However, its role as a second stage engine for launches from Kerbin wasn\u0027t much affected, because its sea-level Isp went from 85s to 170s. The Terrier will now be more efficient and have better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E just after stage separation.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Dart got a big swing with the nerfbat. 300s-320s Isp instead of 290s-340s, and maximum thrust dropped from 180 kN to 170 kN. But fear not... even after all that, it still remains one of the best launch engines for S-size stacks in the game. Just shows how \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er).

Yeah, it\u0027s strictly worse now. Yeah, it\u0027s still a silly engine for its form factor, and you should have no issues building shuttle replicas.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHey, remember the Thud?

Now it went from 120 kN max thrust to 140 kN, hopefully helping it find more use.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLooking at the XS-sized engines, the allmighty Ant got its vacuum Isp increased from 315s to 330s, though sadly it lost its non-blocky second variant, which I loved... \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003EThe spider got 25% more thrust with no other changes (2.0 kN -\u0026gt; 2.5 kN), while the Twitch got a little heavier (80kg -\u0026gt; 100kg) and had its Isp changed from 275s-290s to 265s-298s. The Spark lost 5s vacuum Isp but gained 5s sea level Isp (now 270s-315s).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGoing up in size instead, the Skipper got... nerfed? A little? Max thrust went from 650 kN to 600 kN. But Isp went up... strictly speaking... theoretically... by exactly 2s \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBut hey, at least the Mainsail, which already had too much thrust in KSP1, now has even more thrust! 1600 kN instead of 1500. It lost a lot of Isp though, going from 285s-301s to 265s-307s. Prepare to dump a lot of fuel into this hungry maw. But when you do, \u003Cem\u003Eit\u0027ll go\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Poodle unsurprisingly got the same treatment as the Terrier, meaning: less vacuum Isp (350s -\u0026gt; 340s) but more sea level Isp (90s -\u0026gt; 175s). But unlike the Terrier, it also went down in max thrust significantly, from 250 kN to 215 kN. Fair enough, it used to be on the awkwardly-too-strong side for most landers. This might actually make it easier to use.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnother size class up, the Rhino went on a diet: 8 tons instead of 9. In return its maximum thrust dropped from 2000 kN to 1750. The redesign away from orbital use to a sustainer type is felt in the Isp, which changed from 205s-340s to 285s-325s. For orbital work we now have the Labradoodle, which is completely new.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Mammoth is now the Mammoth-II, and looks the part of its namesake with its ginormous \u003Cs\u003Etrunk\u003C/s\u003E errr I mean turbopump exhaust. It got a mild thrust uprating from 4000 kN to 4250 kN, and like the mainsail, lost a good chunk of Isp: 270s-310s instead of 295s-315s.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll of the SRBs stayed the same, and I didn\u0027t look at the jet engines, as I\u0027m just not a plane type of person.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHere is where it gets really interesting though: the high-impulse, alternative-fuel engines. All of them got \u003Cem\u003Eso much stronger\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nJust look at the Nerv. Maximum thrust went from 60 kN to 75 kN. Isp went from 185s-800s to 250s-900s. Those are two massive buffs, but it\u0027s not the end just yet: in KSP2, all fuel tanks - including hydrogen - got normed to a mass ratio of 9, whereas in KSP1, the plane parts that were so often used with the Nerv due to a lack of dedicated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-only rocket tanks were more around 8.

On the surface, it received a small nerf, in the sense that it needs a bit more energy to run now (10 EC/s instead of 8.74 EC/s). But just like the Nerv is benefitting from better tankage, so is the Dawn. Xenon tanks used to have a mass fraction of 4. Now, just like all other tanks, they\u0027re at 9. That means they contain \u003Cem\u003Emore than two and a half times\u003C/em\u003E the amount of xenon for the same dry mass.
