After they share their found article, people can discuss about it below. I think it\u0027s a pretty good idea. I don\u0027t think if a thread like this has been done before or in the recent past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just read this article, and it was pretty interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/science-enabling-technology/digging-deeper-to-find-life-on-ocean-worlds/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://science.nasa.gov/science-research/science-enabling-technology/digging-deeper-to-find-life-on-ocean-worlds/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe article talks about a study NASA researchers did for a potential lander that could be sent to Europa. The lander itself would be more of a communication platform, while the actual scientific vessel would be a drill that uses heat to dig below the surface. Once in the subsurface ocean, it will start searching for microbes that pass by the probe. This article does get me excited for future exploration of the Solar System, as well as give me hope that we\u0027ll finally answer the most fundamental question in Human History: are we alone?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-07T21:27:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the science news thread probably cover this, but I can see the appeal of a dedicated thread for space related news.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe system they talked about looks promising enough, aside from the risk of using fiber optics and having the cable snapping. My question is how much range they can give the bot. It already needs a cable up to 19/25 km long (maybe shorter if probes like Europa Clipper show thinner ice), which if this figure is anything close to what a cryobot would need (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.thefoa.org/tech/ref/cable/HighFiberCountCables.html#:~:text=Of%20course%20the%20cable%20is,1%2F2%20pound%20per%20foot.\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.thefoa.org/tech/ref/cable/HighFiberCountCables.html#:~:text=Of course the cable is,1%2F2 pound per foot.\u003C/a\u003E), would mass out at 14-19 tonnes on its own. SLS can apparently do 16 tonnes to Jupiter, but even being optimstic only leaves 2 metric tonnes for everything else.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/spacexs-starship-and-nasas-sls-could-supercharge-space-science/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/spacexs-starship-and-nasas-sls-could-supercharge-space-science/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0This would be a mission for a refueled Starship.
