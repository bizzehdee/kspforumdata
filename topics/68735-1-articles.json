In KSP, once you\u0027re above 70KM you are completely free of the atmosphere\u0027s influence, which means any orbit above that altitude will stay in orbit indefinitely as long as something doesn\u0027t alter it\u0027s trajectory bellow that. The ISS on the other hand must periodically raise it\u0027s altitude to maintain orbit. This suggests that the station is in fact very high up in the atmosphere and not actually in outer space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to \u0022official\u0022 accounts made by the governments, the karman line which is at 100km represents the boundary of outer space, however this is still within the thermosphere, which extends up to roughly 690km, and then beyond that is the exosphere which is estimated to reach up to about 10,000km, or half the distance between the earth and the moon. If atmospheric drag doesn\u0027t completely go away until after you exit the exosphere, wouldn\u0027t that mean that with an apogee of 423km and a perigee of 420km that the ISS is in fact a high altitude construct within the upper atmosphere as apposed to something that is truly in space?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-09T04:26:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2014 04:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by elanachan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T04:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can get pretty far from Earth and still find atmospheric particles, but their influence on a craft is negligible.

That is the reason the Karman line is defined as the beginning of outer space: because from that point on, you no longer conduct atmospheric flight.

In this model, only one source of gravity affects the spaceship at any given time, and the spaceship is said to be in that gravity source\u0027s \u0022sphere of influence\u0022. When gravity from that source becomes so weak over distance that another source becomes stronger, then that source takes over and the spaceship \u0022switches spheres of influence\u0022. But in real life, the gravity from the previous source doesn\u0027t just magically disappear. In true n-body systems, gravity from an object behaves much like the atmosphere we\u0027re talking about here: it becomes progressively weaker up to the point where you cannot detect it anymore, but there\u0027s no real end to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, objects in Earth orbit are affected by the gravity of the Moon... and also the gravity of, for example, Jupiter. Our resident gas giant is so extremely massive that its orbital motions subtly disturb the entire solar system, and even affects the Sun: the barycenter of the Sun/Jupiter system is actually above the surface of the Sun, meaning Jupiter forces that massive star to wobble about like a drunkard. But the key word is \u0022subtle\u0022; for most of humanity\u0027s intents and purposes, the influence is negligible.

This is because SoI\u0027s do not exist IRL as they do in KSP, so your simile here is actually countering your own point.\u003Cp\u003EThe game uses a simplification of orbital mechanics called the \u0022patched conics\u0022 model. In this model, only one source of gravity affects the spaceship at any given time, and the spaceship is said to be in that gravity source\u0027s \u0022sphere of influence\u0022. When gravity from that source becomes so weak over distance that another source becomes stronger, then that source takes over and the spaceship \u0022switches spheres of influence\u0022. But in real life, the gravity from the previous source doesn\u0027t just magically disappear. In true n-body systems, gravity from an object behaves much like the atmosphere we\u0027re talking about here: it becomes progressively weaker up to the point where you cannot detect it anymore, but there\u0027s no real end to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, objects in Earth orbit are affected by the gravity of the Moon... and also the gravity of, for example, Jupiter.

If i were to orbit the moon (our lunar moon not that crazy mun in the game) at x vlocity that on paper with no other bodies would give me a perfect circular orbit of y kilometers. If we then plop earth nearby would that change our perfect circle to a slightly eliptic orbit? and be destined to have a permanent eliptic orbit as long as the earths gravity is taken into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr is it closer to ksp physics in that, lunar gravity is so much stronger at that altitude, that the earths gravity has no hope of doing anything? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA side question as well (as I\u0027m here) If my first statement turns out to be true would that mean if i left an object orbiting the moon that various factors would eventually cause it to get pushed closer and closer to earths gravity? or does it all cancel itself out. IE if the object is in a clockwise equitorial orbit solar winds would cause it to gain velocity at one point in the orbit but at the exact opposite point it also slows it down therefor keeping the orbit stable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just asking questions here so if I\u0027m spouting a load of crap please be nice.
