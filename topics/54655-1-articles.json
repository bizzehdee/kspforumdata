I don\u0027t think that is impossible since the piston in damned robotics essentially operates on the same principle and it allows for attachment points on both ends. In damned robotics, the extending arm and rotation part are basically the only 2 I used, but the extending arm is a bit cumbersome since it always has some length to it and doesn\u0027t extend very much. I haven\u0027t seen any of the updates, so I don\u0027t know if there are any new parts that serve the same purpose in the same way. looking at the thread, I do see that the telescopic parts must be stacked to create length, although I don\u0027t know what they look like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebasically the smallest center ring is what does the actual extending from the main outer ring that serves as the base (that way you don\u0027t have parts extending beyond the attachment point before the animation actually moves the attachment area up), then the rest of the rings should animate to follow it, from the inside to the outside, each animation for each ring stopping at the height it becomes flush with the top of the next ring in line, then the whole stack moves up together, and so on. is that not possible? or can it only be just 2 rings? the only 2 parts that need to mesh collide are the outer and inner most rings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou could probably do the animation in reverse as well, if it\u0027s simpler. for example, the first animation would raise the whole inner stack, then the continued animation would raise the whole stack again, minus 2nd the outer most ring, then the 3rd outer most ring, and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei still have to work the model, since it\u0027s not 100% precise, just a quick copy and paste and resize job. I forgot where the command in my modeler is which allows me to create multiple copies with each one being smaller than the next so they fit inside each other and precisely line up, but I was playing with it a month ago so I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll figure out where it is again soon enough to have it modeled properly. but I have no problem sending the model to you when I\u0027m done....heck if you wanted, you could release the finished part yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-29T04:02:44Z\u0022 title=\u002211/29/2013 04:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by trekkie_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T05:27:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason animating parts will not work is because nothing that you attach to it will move with the model.

The problem with current IR is that you can only move one model (so you can have one static model and one dynamic) and one attachment point. The only way to get multiple cylinders to work is stack a few of them on top of eachother, but that wouldn\u0027t save as much space as much you and I want.
