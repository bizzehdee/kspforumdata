Like, don\u0027t you have to apply somewere to get a license to use? Join some sort of organization? Put down a few bucks to receive a certificate? It just comes with the kind of word that \u0022license\u0022 is. It implies a lot and commands respect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is though: you don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have created something unique through your own work, that is yours. \u003Cem\u003EYou\u003C/em\u003E are the authority that creates the license. Nobody else has a right to arbitrate over what happens with your creation, until you grant it. You implicitly have this right both by convention and (in most countries in the world) formalized by local law.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when it comes down to it, you can literally make up something on the spot. Just write a freeform text about who you allow to do what - and that can be anywhere between \u0022this is public domain, do whatever you want\u0022 and \u0022this is mine, you can look but don\u0027t touch\u0022. This statement you give about what rights you, the creator, grant third parties is really what the word \u0022license\u0022 describes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, freeform texts are all fine and dandy for things like a simple image and such. But the more valuable and effort-consuming your creation is, the more you want something that can actually stand up to a lawyer\u0027s attempts to find loopholes in the wording. For that purpose, there are certain keywords that you can use that let you describe your intent in a law-binding way without having to think about how to word it. Things like \u0022all rights reserved\u0022 are unambiguously defined, they cannot be squirmed around no matter how someone might try. \u0022Public domain\u0022 is another such keyword, and there are more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings like the Creative Commons license are also like that. They let you put a single line of text and a nice representative icon under your creation as a proxy. It tells a lawyer who is looking to suss out exactly what you allow to go look at the Creative Commons website instead. It says \u0022My license is in wording and intent exactly as defined by that standard\u0022. You defer it to the CC organization to draft up a license wording that is unambiguous and holds up in court.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T08:56:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregA\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregA\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThen you want a GPL 3 license.\u003Cp\u003Epaste this into your source files, and in the meta tag of any included files that don\u0027t happen to be source.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0026lt;one line to give the program\u0027s name and a brief idea of what it does.\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Copyright \u00A9 \u0026lt;year\u0026gt; \u0026lt;name of author\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (at your option) any later version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
