Originally, I thought that would be the only way to go. I mean, if you spend several billion dollars building the thing, why should you not leave the thing in LEO and ferry crews and supplies to it? But this got me thinking, would it have exceeded its lifespan while completing its first mission? Would the current level of technology on Earth be on par with the technology aboard the ship? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big question is, should we make an expendable ship rather than a reusable one due to the costs, since it would probably be cheaper to build a new ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warhorse","CreatedById":83495,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T00:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that as long as we are limited to chemical propulsion, expendables are the only thing that makes sense. There\u0027s no point in hauling a lot of empty tankage any further than you have to, chemical rockets just don\u0027t have enough power. Once we graduate to something better (nuclear? ion? solar sail?) the answer will depend a lot on how reliable the engines are, and how much maintenance they require.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Genius Evil","CreatedById":72989,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T00:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith current rocket technology, a single stage interplanetary craft would be impractical, so most of it will be left behind. It might actually be more expensive to send a reusable habitat on two interplanetary trips than to just launch a new habitat, because a reusable habitat would have to be able to survive at least twice as long as a single-use one. The cost of launching the extra fuel for the higher-mass reusable habitat would probably balance out the savings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krevsin","CreatedById":83150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T14:13:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith chemical rockets, using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMars Direct\u003C/a\u003E route would be the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd even otherwise, maintaining a large craft in orbit for several years of constant wear and tear (even moreso than the ISS, because a mothership would have an engine and quite possibly a heatshield) isn\u0027t exactly economical without cheap space access, so it\u0027ll be a while before a reusable mothership may become reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T14:39:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven for KSP it makes more sense to design rockets/spaceships with stages instead of having a reusable mothership that has to be supplied by tank ships (thereby imposing an additional fuel cost to the transpoted fuel due to the fuel the tanker ship has to use to get to the mother ship [and maybe back to Earth/Kerbin]).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this even without KSP simulating wear and tear, like mentioned by Krevsin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ANWRocketMan","CreatedById":65251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T21:34:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would only become viable if Career mode with a monetary system comes along.

The way around this is to make the ENTIRE thing modular, but that adds more expense and engineering complexity, plus you have to launch the new modules into space, which is expensive.
