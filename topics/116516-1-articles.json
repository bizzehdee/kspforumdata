You\u0027ll get some shockwaves, but no overheating. It also let\u0027s you carry less fuel if you have first stage boosters. As they Accelleration passes 25 m/ss, Mj will throttle back the liquid fuel engines, sometimes cutting them off completely. This extends your liquid engines range during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T20:18:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome flames on ascent are \u003Cem\u003Efine.\u003C/em\u003E Just because you\u0027re going fast enough to make the air glow doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s imparting worrying levels of heat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
