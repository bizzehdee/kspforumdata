I am able to apply a \u0027wind\u0027 and make them push a boat. In the image above, you\u0027re seeing some funky lines. Those are showing the thrust transform for the sail so that I can visually make sure I have them pointed in the right direction (I don\u0027t in that image). So... yes... sails will be eventually forthcoming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my ideas on how they should work and you\u0027re free to comment or give me other ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWind should not be a constant. The only other mod with \u0027sails\u0027 that I know of uses solar power. As long as they face the sun, they push the boat at a constant speed. Wind should not work that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENextly, wind should not always be from the same direction. If you look at wind patters on the earth you\u0027ll see near the equator they flow east to west (generally) and in the upper and lower latitudes they flow from west to east. There\u0027s also some \u0027bending\u0027 of the wind direction near land masses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I envision is a table of various latitudes and longitudes on every planet that has water. I\u0027m ballparking that at 100 locations. Each location will have a wind speed and direction assigned to it. When you drop a boat with a sail in the water, it\u0027ll look through the list of locations for the 3 closest ones. It\u0027ll then (based on some serious trig) guesstimate the wind speed and direction at the location of the boat. And, there should be also other random forces at play, like gusts and doldrums (break out the oars).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also envision this table to be dynamic so that you\u0027ll never know exactly what to expect from the wind. It\u0027ll change based on other nearby wind conditions and will save those changes. Once you start sailing, your wind environment will be unique to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the sails should be linked to the throttle. As you increase the throttle, the sails lower and you get more \u0027thrust\u0027. As you decrease the throttle, the sails raise and your speed slows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have accomplished toward this goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have wind... matter of fact (I\u0027ll show this in a video eventually) I\u0027ve sailed off Kerbin and right past Jool. Lots of wind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have wind directions and speeds applied to the sails.

This is without a doubt going to be one of the most complex creations I\u0027ve put out. The bridge alone has 4 animations on it. Then, there\u0027s underwater camera code (which will be turned on and off via the bridge), code to help control all those animations and sync them with the throttle, sub control code to shut down intakes if you submerge and the throttle if you try to fly this thing... and then there\u0027s the code I\u0027ve been working on for 3 days now... a \u0027computer controlled\u0027 neutral buoyancy system and an automatic keel leveling system and of course (every sub needs this) an emergency ballast blow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s progressing.

I\u0027m happy to say it worked and worked really well. The other thing you don\u0027t see is that the automatic keel leveling had been keeping the vessel mostly level through that \u0027freefall\u0027 descent. The keel leveling though... Well, let\u0027s just say you better a. get it close to being level manually first and b. be patient.

Nextly, there will already be one mask to handle the depth down to 1,000m. Dice uses two... a second one appears at 600m and is a sphere. Neither of these \u0027masks\u0027 prevent the camera from zooming out beyond them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, my plan is to simply limit the depth of the sub to 1,000m. But, there will be a cfg file for this new .dll and in it, you can override that setting. The reason is, all stock planets have a visual bottom to the oceans at 1,000 even though the physical depth may be much deeper. Other mod generated planets may not have that fake bottom. For now, keeping the boat from going further down that 1,000 is going to be the easiest solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T02:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to have to retract a previous \u0027possibility\u0027, namely launch tubes for the sub.

IVA\u0027s are a pain in the ... nozzle. First reason being, they\u0027re inside out. Take for example the cargo bridge. I had to basically disassemble half of the cargo bridge and then, make the outside faces the inside faces. And that doesn\u0027t always work. Then, I had to reconstruct the back wall.. so now I\u0027m working on the inside of a model which means I\u0027m zoomed all the way in and trying to spin around. Next, you have to create the structure, the control panel, place the chairs, etc. and, if you don\u0027t already have them, each one is a completely separate part. You have to create them. Like the little voice pipe stuck to the ceiling. That is a separate part I had to create. The chairs... had to be created. The wheel, the radio, the radar, the sonar... all parts that had to be made and textured. Then, you have to place a \u0027transform\u0027 wherever the chair is to indicate that\u0027s where the Kerbal sits. Then, you have to go through KSP\u0027s part tools and start placing all the fun stuff, like switches that do nothing, buttons you can\u0027t push, the throttle, the compass, etc. And since your end user will be seeing this stuff close up, it has to be placed pretty accurately. Then, you have to create all the little things that make it look right, like the wheel, the radar, the notes to klean the head... etc. I just whipped out a basic part for the sub in about 15 minutes. That includes putting it in Unity, setting up the meshes and writing the .cfg file. An IVA... hours... and hours. I think it took me over 6 to create the one for the cargo bridge. And even then... I had another mess getting it positioned correctly. You\u0027d think it would face in the same direction as the part... no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me show you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/BridgeUnity.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BridgeUnity.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took me over an hour just to get the bridge rotated right. Consider this. Every single time I want to test a part I have to exit out of the SPH, hit f-12 and reload the database. I make one change to the .cfg, and I have to do that again. If I\u0027m writing a plugin, I have to go the long route and every single time I change it, I have to close out KSP and completely restart it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now, for the really fun part... when I ran the update the last time Unity came out with a patch, it completely wiped all of the KSP props (compass, switches, buttons, etc.) from the Unity save file. The bridge I have saved now only has the props I created (the chairs, the wheel, the notes, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this gives you and idea as to why I have the huge aversion to IVA\u0027s.

I\u0027m going to test it with a placeholder first, but I\u0027m betting you won\u0027t see anything but black and blue. The bottom of the ocean, the really important thing you don\u0027t wanna hit because it\u0027s REALLY hard... is under the boat. Not something you can see.
