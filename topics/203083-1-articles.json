And while we\u2019re on the subject- don\u2019t install mods in the Steam copy of KSP, Steam likes to meddle with stuff and can corrupt mods causing he game to crash. Instead, copy KSP from steam/steamapps/common and paste it somewhere else, then put your mods in the copy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo change your KSP version in Steam:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRight click KSP in your Steam library and click Properties,\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nClick the Betas tab.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPick whatever version of KSP you want and it should automatically install.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"}]}
