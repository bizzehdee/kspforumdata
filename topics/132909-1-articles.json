My intent is to make it an SSTA but I need advice on packing stuff in the MK2 cargo bays. I have one short bay, opening from below, for the drill-o-matic jr. I used a second bay, opening from above, intended for solar panels. After installing I learned the gigantors will not fit without clipping and the 1x6 panels aren\u2019t adequate to power the small ISRU. So looks like I need power cells. I also need ore tanks and batteries, along with some radiators. I can\u2019t figure out how to get everything inside two bays. Anyone have a working set up that you can share how you stuffed the bays?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more thing. I noticed the radiators in the cargo bay heat up while going to orbit.
