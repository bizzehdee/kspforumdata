I used one GravMax for High Above, one GravMax and two Seismic at \u0022Just Above\u0022 the surface, everything else just on the surface. There was 16 of this pack, sorted in four Science Module. I wanted to make the mission with four landings and filling the four Packs at four different Biome. There is \u0022only\u0022 15 Biomes so I had one Pack remaining for \u0022High Above\u0022 science. In the itinerary I wanted to \u0022jump\u0022 from one X to another, but I was not able to make the Green and Red X-X-X-X in one so I had to go back to the ship for fuel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A2sRDlW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022A2sRDlW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I had multiple landings, and a lot of rearranging the ship. I also had to write on a paper what was done and what science was used because there was about 16x11 readings plus 15x3 (LowSpace/Surface EVA \u002B Surface Sample). About 221 data at the end. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E This is how the main ship looked like: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CaGDU1R.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CaGDU1R.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander was like this (note the changeable Science Module part!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fOw4Rwo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fOw4Rwo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made some mistake for the main ship that it didn\u0027t have RCS or SAS so I had to send a supply ship with RCS/SAS parts and which also refueled it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tEwqGwB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tEwqGwB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s a picture about the science points, 10039.6...
