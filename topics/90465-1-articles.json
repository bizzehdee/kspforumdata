Philly is in the command chair. He\u0027s flown it several times now, and knows the plane rather well. She has her shimmies and shakes, but he loves the bird he designed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027s come in from a near perfect reentry, from approximately 90km up. Retro went smooth, reentry was nominal. Glided in towards the landing strip at the KSC (Old Stripey, he calls it), and touched down just a touch hard. The gear bowed in a bit, but the ship recovered and continued on down the runway. The ship slows to 40m/s, and he gingerly applies breaks... she begins to slow further. Suddenly, there\u0027s a loud BANG!!! A wing segement suddenly disappeared, and there\u0027s an explosion off near the VAB. One of the minor buildings detonates. The tower reports that the port side wing segment hit it at extreme velocity. There was no indication of this segment actually moving between the two points in space. It suddenly was gone, and there was a boom in the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhilly, with nerves of steel, manages to wrangle the suddenly unruly spacecraft back under control as it veers off the runway and onto the grass, struggling.
