The underlying model seems to be mostly fine, but the scheme of how much heat you pick up from where will probably need to go through a few more iterations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA big problem is that the spaceplane pilots want to ride up at similar speeds as capsules coming down. How can you have heat for one, but not the other?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a non-issue most of the time. Keep in mind that physics work nicely for the vessel you\u0027re watching -- only unattended stuff is subjected to the simplified physics. Most everything will be in some stable condition before you leave it. The issue is most noticable with spent stages that are either silently destroyed (iow, unrecoverable) or remain in a steady orbit that should by rights be unstable. The latter can be dealt with if you take the time and watch them as they enter the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn regards to Lagrange points.

In short KSP stock doesnt do a whole lot of the real world stuff. But it does do a lot of real world stuff in a way that works for the scale of the environment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind you Kerbin is roughly 1/3rd the size of the real Moon. Which makes it quite small but it still has the gravitation pull of Earth. There are mods that change the scale of everything and make KSP into a pretty good simulation of the Real Earth Solar System including Earths atmosphere. But a great many here dont care for it because of the shear number of additional mods needed to get it to work with in 90% accuracy of the real world. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if realism is what you are looking for then check on the Realism Overhaul thread. If you just want something close but dont want deal with having to build a rocket with over 9.8km/s of Delta-Velocity to get to orbit then you may want to avoid it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally have both versions of KSP installed on my computer a RO install and a regular install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankyou for your reply and greeting !!!!!!!!!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I do want realism, but it is more realism of mechanics, rather then just plain realism.

Thats more the realism I am after.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have actually been looking at that exact thread (realism overhaul) over the past few hours. I think I am going to keep my MODS to a minimum to begin with, and really only looking at modding the parts of the main game that are the least realistic/immersive (either due to a poor model, or not being accounted for). Perhaps I also might include a few utility MODS like Kerbol Alarm Clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou guys/gals really are a great community. Really expected for this thread to degenerate into a \u0022why are you trying to mod the game when you have so little experience etc etc etc\u0022.
