Exactly what I was looking for.\n\nSounds good. \n\nThe water issues surprised me a little, I thought KSP would modal these a little better, but as you say its not a huge game focus so .......\n\nI do hope the Reentry Heat issues are patched.

If I may : Does the game account for other forms of heat ie direct solar radiation, superheated atmospheres etc.\n\nThe under 20km caveat concerns me a little, but I did know that one existed, I assume its so that discarded stages and space debris don\u0027t end up hogging cpu cycles and memory over time. I assume care must be taken when dealing with satellites etc.\n\nThanks again for your help. \n\nBTW I have been looking at the various mods for KSP and have only settled on one one so far : SCANSAT. Am very happy it has been recently updated to the current version, and that it integrates with the stock scanning parts. Can\u0027t really explain it, but the scanning aspect is probably the bit I am looking forward to the most about KSP. I am currently perusing a few of the more realism related MODS, ie FAR, deadly reentry and life-support.

For most space missions, the side effects are negligible. However, Lagrange points are places where the gravities of two bodys even out. They just cannot exist in KSP. This is one of the few cases where \u0022there is a mod for that\u0022 does not apply.\n\u003E The whole heat thing is underwhelming at this point. The underlying model seems to be mostly fine, but the scheme of how much heat you pick up from where will probably need to go through a few more iterations.\n\u003E \n\u003E A big problem is that the spaceplane pilots want to ride up at similar speeds as capsules coming down. How can you have heat for one, but not the other?\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s a non-issue most of the time. Keep in mind that physics work nicely for the vessel you\u0027re watching -- only unattended stuff is subjected to the simplified physics. Most everything will be in some stable condition before you leave it. The issue is most noticable with spent stages that are either silently destroyed (iow, unrecoverable) or remain in a steady orbit that should by rights be unstable. The latter can be dealt with if you take the time and watch them as they enter the atmosphere.\n\nIn regards to Lagrange points. I would have thought introducing a new SOI with No/Low mass at its centre, would solve the problem. Given you can only be under the effect of a single SOI in KSP. Perhaps this would not work and I am over simplifying the system. I don\u0027t know enough about how the SOI integrate with other KSP systems/mechanics to know if a quick and dirty solution like this would work.\n\nA little disappointed by what you said about heat. I don\u0027t know why but accounting for heat (in its various forms is a really cool aspect of the game for me , or at least I think it will be). AM seriously looking at Deadly -Reentry ATM, and will look around for other heat MODS.\n\nYour comments on the 20km limit, were heartening. I was a bit concerned by that one.

That last sentence is confusing even me, i will try to do better ...\n\nFor example the re-scaling of the Kerbols diameter, while keeping an earth like Newtonian gravitational force is fine by me.\n\nIts more : given a series of assumed constants/forces/etc does the world behave in a reliable and logical way. Thats more the realism I am after.\n\nI have actually been looking at that exact thread (realism overhaul) over the past few hours. I think I am going to keep my MODS to a minimum to begin with, and really only looking at modding the parts of the main game that are the least realistic/immersive (either due to a poor model, or not being accounted for). Perhaps I also might include a few utility MODS like Kerbol Alarm Clock.\n\nYou guys/gals really are a great community. Really expected for this thread to degenerate into a \u0022why are you trying to mod the game when you have so little experience etc etc etc\u0022. I really like to savour my first playthrough of a unique game like this, and I have a week or so to kill till I can play so learning about the mechanics and choosing MODS is on the agenda.\n\nOn a totally unrelated note : SCANSAT is awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Greetings!
