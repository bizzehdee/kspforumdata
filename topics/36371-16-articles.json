I have compared no struts with extreme wobble (making it difficult to control the craft) to using stock struts holding the fairing and payload firmly where they should be. Whenever struts are used on the fairings, any fairings attached to a strut have 0 jettison force. They just sort of fall away from the craft from just gravity.
