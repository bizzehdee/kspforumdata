Might get some upgrades soon, but money is a bit tight at the moment. I\u0027m loving it, it is quite fast and incredibly silent, it is everything I built it for.

There are a few upgrades that would be mildly useful, but I think my money is better spent elsewhere. Though especially the GPU seems a bit under powered, everything I play and run (Adobe CS, Solidworks, Minecraft, Kerbal Space Program, CitiesXL, Saints Row 3, Skyrim, et cetera) is actually running very nicely at high settings. Spending the money for a GPU that amounts to effectively a minor upgrade seems a bit excessive. I did buy my motherboard to be SLI and CF compatible, but I do not think I will use that any time soon due to power and noise concerns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently looking at a 3D-printer, something I gave been flirting with since the dawn of the RepRap. I was on the verge of buying parts about a year ago, but due to various reasons it never actually happened. Now there are some even newer versions that look very good and are quite affordable (for 3D-printer standards), so I think it is time - or actually long overdue. That will be a much better investment than a better video card, hah.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
