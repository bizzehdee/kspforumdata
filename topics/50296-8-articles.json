Remember that your periapsis needs to be at 70, when you start to enter the atmosphere pay attention to your vertical airspeed. You can see the dial in the cockpit view. if it goes below -100 you will burn up. Use your pods RCS to rotate it so the weighted side points in a direction that gives it lift. But not too much lift or you will bounce back out. Try to stay above 50,000 meters as long as possible. You should be below 4000m/s before you can go lower than that. once under 4000m/s rotate your pod continuously and evenly so that the upward lift cancels out with the downward lift. This will give you a ballistic reentry which should now be survivable as long as your Head shield still has some ablative material left. pop your drogue at 7000 meters then cut it when your speed is under 250m/s and open your main parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-03T09:18:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2013 09:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Zander\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gunnyfreak","CreatedById":67266,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T09:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eah i see... so I just suck then...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust for reference, what kind of speeds can the shield take?
