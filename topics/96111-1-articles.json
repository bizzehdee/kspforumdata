It ended up smoothing out the wake behind the vehicle if I remember right. They were approaching it from the perspective of fuel efficiency, what I\u0027m wondering is, if you provided the same dimples to a craft undergoing re-entry, would this smooth out the wake and theoretically reduce buffeting?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI expect some humorous replies, as I am smirking myself right now. But at the same time, I\u0027m quite curious if anyone has any idea as to what effect might be gained.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T16:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor reentry, you wan the opposite effect, the bumps of a training golf ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it may require spinning, but if not, it may be of benifit to spaceplanes, that spend ore time in higher drag regines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T16:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can imagine someone suggesting this idea to NASA. \u0022Whiffle Ball Re-entry\u0022 needs to be a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T17:18:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor reentry, you wan the opposite effect, the bumps of a training golf ball.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding is that if you did that, it would increase the drag on the re-entry vehicles. While I understand the usefulness of increased drag, it would almost seem that the best setup is to keep the usual smooth/flat base, but then have the edges immediately around that, extending up just a bit of the hull, be the dimples. This causes the base to still have the properties NASA likes about such a base, but it might make the path through the upper atmosphere a bit smoother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking about it, one thing they did test on Orion was to drill a couple holes (I think one was 1 cm deep, and the other 3 cm deep) to see how it affected the shield.
