New to KSP mods! still getting the hang of things. Seem to have the basics down... but simple or small stuff seem to still have me stumped. For one I have MechLab, PowerTech, Powertech_MuMech?, MMI_Kethane, and zKreuzung plugins. I also have the PunchPack Remix, Kosmos SST, Deep Space, and Mechanical Mouse Ind. packs installed. My question I have is for the solar panels, I noticed some parts, such as the station parts from Kosmos SST(which BTW I had a hell of a time finding) the panels do not produce energy. I was wondering if someone can point me in the right direction in either downloading cool solar panels that charge or how to edit parts to do this for me. Thanks for anyone that can help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheHengeProphet","CreatedById":14895,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T07:39:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe you could edit the solar panels to be engines with zero thrust and negative fuel consumption. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s a terrible and hacky way to do it, but should be pretty easy. The gain would have to be pretty slow to be balanced, IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T07:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe station panels for Kosmos have never produced energy, but you can make them by copying the module from the bottom of the cfg file of the solar panel from deep space pack, into the bottom of the cfgs for each of the panels in Kosmos pack, and tuning the energy gain to your liking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the masses in tons I decided upon, which are proportional to the apparent size of solar collection area for each panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe electrical gain in EPS energy units is 0.05 times these masses. so the gain for TKS for example would be 0.012.
