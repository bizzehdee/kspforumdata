Though, this isn\u0027t a basic thread about how to make a plane, I\u0027m more asking about how to make planes that can fly around the KSC with a great deal of agility. I know that torque is required but i don\u0027t know how much torque is necessary. Also when i right-click my engines it says \u0022Gimbal: Free\u0022 what does that mean? And finally, would it be necessary to place control surfaces all around my plane or only on a designated spot? Thanks for Helping!"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T07:21:52Z","Content":"I\u0027d start with [Keptin\u0027s thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures). Mind you it\u0027s like two years old, so not everything is applicable to the current version (eg: you don\u0027t need FAR mod these days to get drag on darggy parts, etc), but most of your questions are answered and well illustrated in it.\n\nI think the only thing he doesn\u0027t cover is gimbal: it means that the engine can do slight torque direction adjustments, thus it helps you to steer. Or it helps you to destabilize the craft, as a plane is better steered with control surfaces. If you face stability problems on manuvering, you can try limiting or disabling the gimbal on the engines - or just on a few of them. Though generally drag, lift, CoM-CoL balance causes more trouble.\n\nEDIT: another thing he doesn\u0027t cover: By default, all control surfaces are used for roll, pitch and yaw. That\u0027s pretty silly, but you can right click them in the hangar to designate what surfaces should be used for what kind of adjustment.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T07:32:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 07:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis**"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T07:31:05Z","Content":"Gimbal in this context is the ability of an engine to change the direction of the exhaust flame.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/J9F0WzdV4fI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n Gimbaling starts at about 0:40.\nThe Space Shuttles engines could do this too. I think they have the highest gimbal range of all rocket engines.\n\nThere are several factors which affect the agility of a plane:\n\n- having engines with high gimbal to increase control authority\n\n- medium to high TWR to get you out of stalls fast\n\n- lots of control surfaces to increase control authority\n\n- high wing area stabilizes flight, provides lift at low speeds (= less stalling)\n\n- low weight to improve effectiveness of control surfaces and increase TWR\n\n- CoL should be right behind the CoM or your control surfaces have to fight the plane\u0027s mass too much\n\nControl surfaces should be placed where they make sense. In most cases this only means to not place them near the CoM because there they\u0027ll be less effective.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T07:34:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 07:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by \\*Aqua\\***"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T08:59:29Z","Content":"With control surfaces it\u0027s not so much amount as amount x distance from CoM that affects maneuvarability (the further a control surface is from the CoM, the more leverage it has and so the more maneuverability it adds). So if you have delta wings where the CoM is near to the elevons, they won\u0027t have as much effect as, say canards at the front of the same aircraft.\n\nHaving more wing area per tonne of aircraft decreases wing loading and gives you much more maneuverability, especially at low speed. However, they also add drag and decrease top speed.\n\nThe CoL should be really close behind the CoM (probably about halfway inside the little yellow sphere). Alternatively, having a CoL actually in front of the CoM will give you a craft that, although unstable and probably not suited to high-speed flight or flying without SAS, will be extremely maneuverable.\n\nEDIT: Just realized Aqua said pretty much everything I said before me ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
