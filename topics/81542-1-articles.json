I was able to recreate this lucky slingshot, but I wanted to ask if there is some plugin that will predict this manouver instead of just using luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see I only need 174 deltaV to get back to Kerbin. This is such a big saving I obviously want to always use slingshots but cant see how its possible to plan one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny info would be appreciated, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h165/Hail_Odin/c_zps9d8a89f6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022c_zps9d8a89f6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h165/Hail_Odin/b_zps590df576.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b_zps590df576.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h165/Hail_Odin/vd_zps938d0392.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vd_zps938d0392.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T21:14:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know of any plug ins.

Tylo is the most \u0022powerful\u0022, I think Laythe can work too and maybe Vall. If your orbit intersects the one of that moon, you should get a marker - if not, adjust your orbit until it does. Then, go about getting an actual encounter in a similar fashion to rendezvousing with a target ship in Kerbin orbit. Once you actually have the encounter and projected onward course, set up a correction that gets you booted appropriately from the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T22:43:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou also want to wait until the moon in question is positioned such that your escape trajectory sends you retrograde relative to the Jool system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fuzzdemon","CreatedById":113669,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T22:51:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t think to target the moons i\u0027ll try that tip and see where it takes me, thanks guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"weeble","CreatedById":117348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T06:10:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s definitely the mod that tells you what phase angle/ ejection angle and even how much DV you\u0027ll need to do it, it\u0027s called Protractor Continued.
