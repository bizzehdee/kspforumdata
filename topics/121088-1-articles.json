(These engines will come standard on the crew-carrying Dragon variant SpaceX is developing, as well as newer versions of the cargo Dragon. The SuperDracos\u0027 main purpose is to get the capsule to safety in the event of a launch emergency.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERed Dragon is too heavy to use parachutes, but it could slow down enough for the SuperDracos to take over by entering the thin Martian atmosphere at a relatively shallow angle, thereby subjecting itself to the effects of drag for a long period of time, Lemke said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how much would all of this cost? It\u0027s unclear at the moment, because the team has not yet drawn up any cost estimates. But Gonzales said he\u0027s hopeful that the Red Dragon concept would be considerably cheaper than the Mars sample-return effort envisioned by the 2013 Decadal Survey, which would likely cost around $6 billion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-17T13:13:43Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2015 01:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Exoscientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T13:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m no expert, but I\u0027m fairly sure that the Dragon would need a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of modifications to be a Mars lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T13:22:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, it seems like a Crew Dragon could land on Mars on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T13:23:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow many modifications is a bit up for debate.
