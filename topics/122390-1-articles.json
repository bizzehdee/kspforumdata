You\u0027re taking advantage of your high launch velocity (the well know Oberth effect) to increase your ship\u0027s energy enough to reach a high altitude. At that high altitude you can then make a relatively small adjustment in velocity to increase your periapsis to circularize. To circularize at 71 km you need to add significantly more velocity as well as lose velocity to reach periapsis (i.e. waste Oberth effect.) At this point you then step up to 250km, then increase your periapsis to 250km. Though this second periapsis increase would be less than the first version, the savings on that step would not outweigh the losses at other steps. I might try to set up a test later to try this out, but it\u0027s going to vary somewhat depending on the particulars of your launch anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EETA\u003C/strong\u003E: Better, I just did the math. I\u0027m assuming burns are instantaneous for sanity\u0027s sake. Real burns take time, so the difference is slightly less, but if your burns are taking a significant fraction of an orbital period, you really ought to increase your TWR (or be using a crazy efficient engine to compensate for the loss.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran a quick launch to see where my periapsis would be with a reasonable 71km apoapsis, and it happened to be right at the surface (321 meters below it, but that\u0027s close enough for government work.) I hit that periapsis at about 40km. Let\u0027s assume that you\u0027ve burned to a 71km apoapsis with a 0 km apoapsis and your ship is at 40km. You\u0027re now going 2340 m/s.

Burn to 250km apoapsis: Doing the math here is rough. If you simply increase your speed here without changing direction you would raise both periapsis and apoapsis. You\u0027d have to intentionally orient your ship at some wonky angle to force your periapsis to remain at 0km. Doing a horizontal burn to avoid gravity drag gives me a new periapsis of 35km, and apoapsis of 250km, all at 40km altitude. Your mileage may vary, of course. In any case, this yields a new velocity of 2507 m/s. 167 delta-v\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Burn to circular orbit: At apoapsis your velocity will now be 1887 m/s.

Let\u0027s say that during ascent we cut our engine at an altitude of 45 km, leaving us in a temporary orbit with an apoapsis of 71 km and a periapsis of 0 km. By the time we coast up to our apoapsis, we require a burn of 65.0 m/s to circularize at 71 km. We then perform a second burn to boast our apoapsis to 250 km, and then a third burn to circularize at 250 km. These second and third burns require \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv of 131.2 m/s and 123.7 m/s respectively. That\u0027s a total \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv of 319.9 m/s to establish the 250 km orbit, not counting what it took to get up to our initial 45 km cutoff point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s now say we travel up to the exact same cutoff point as before, but instead of stopping we continue to burn prograde until we boost the apoapsis all the way up to 250 km. This takes an additional \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv of 167.9 m/s, leaving us in a temporary orbit with Ap = 250 km and Pe = 37.3 km.

You\u0027d have to intentionally orient your ship at some wonky angle to force your periapsis to remain at 0km. Doing a horizontal burn to avoid gravity drag gives me a new periapsis of 35km, and apoapsis of 250km, all at 40km altitude. Your mileage may vary, of course.
