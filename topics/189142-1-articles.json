Making History added many historic space race parts and a scenario maker but not much else. The Breaking Ground not only adds the robotic parts but also new science parts along with contracts for that science. If that was not enough it also adds anomalies like ice geysers, trees and rocks you can pick up. \u00A0Unless you really want to create custom\u00A0scenario\u00A0 that other people can play, I would go with Breaking Ground\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-21T21:32:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBreaking Ground has much more playability so that gets my vote.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T1mo98","CreatedById":148056,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-23T11:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you already bought one?
