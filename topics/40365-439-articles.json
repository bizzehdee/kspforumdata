Basically what I\u0027m looking to do is have a profitable yet balanced mining operation to earn cash without simply adding funds, which feels like cheating to me. I know it has been said that pricing will be balanced in the future and grinding for cash/science are undesirable, but I was looking for a realistic and temporary work around to these issues. Interstellar isn\u0027t working in the science only mode and I am a fan of setting up large space stations: modular interplanetary mining/refueling/science vessels... TONS of cash... Logistically it would make sense that if a program could gather valuable resources to fund its operations it would do so and it would seem easy enough just to add a value to a few ORS resources... On the other hand, I don\u0027t want to make a mining run to a hotspot on kerbin, get back to ksp and magically have 50,000,000 either... I use karbonite as well if anyone has values they feel are reasonable for that too. Please and thank you for any input or guidance, these files aren\u0027t hard to edit, but a heads up on a respectable and balanced values would be much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
