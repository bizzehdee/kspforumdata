Do I need to further scan in orbit with the narrow band, or is it more like I fly over and area, find the hotspot within the hotspot and try and land there, or is it more like I aim to land in a hotspot, and use the narrow band on the way down to refine my landing?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T06:45:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 06:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps**"},{"CreatedByName":"rhadamant","CreatedById":119663,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T06:24:03Z","Content":"You could try to use the narrow band on your way down, but I\u0027ve found that surface scanning is a lot more reliable.

Scan that area in detail with a narrowband scanner from orbit and/or a surface scanner on the surface to find out in detail where the best spot is."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T14:22:21Z","Content":"After finding the hotspots from orbit i sent the jeep to find the best spot possible using surface scanner and narrowband scanner on minmus. After that sent my mobile fuel bus to the best spot and marked it with a flag and started the operation. Now its time for the fuel tanker to carry the fuel to orbit. The lack of markers in game made it harder for me to find the best spots on narrowband scanner tho mechjeb helped with its rover waypoint marker by entering the coordinates shown on the narrowband scanner.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

One of the best designs I\u0027ve seen in ages. Utterly captures the spirit of KSP. Jeb or Valentina would give their left norphlax to pilot it."}]}
