After that sent my mobile fuel bus to the best spot and marked it with a flag and started the operation. Now its time for the fuel tanker to carry the fuel to orbit. The lack of markers in game made it harder for me to find the best spots on narrowband scanner tho mechjeb helped with its rover waypoint marker by entering the coordinates shown on the narrowband scanner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/58oAZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
