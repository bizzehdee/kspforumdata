Nuclear weapons are frighteningly easy to design.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, the only thing you need to do to make a basic nuclear bomb explode is to rapidly assemble a supercritcal mass of weapons-grade fissile material. The natural decay, creating neutrons, will get the reaction started, and since its supercritical, it will rapidly go out of control. That\u0027s IT. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be challenging assembling the supercritical mass quickly enough, however; if you do it too slowly, the very start of the runaway reaction will blow the components apart, and the weapon will fizzle as a very low yield dud. So the key is to assemble a supercritical mass very quickly, before it can blow itself apart. High explosives are necessary in all the designs that I\u0027m aware of, but the designs are still very simple. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why Iran is such a worry. Having the ability to produce highly enriched uranium makes you a defacto nuclear weapons state.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-12T02:52:19Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2013 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
