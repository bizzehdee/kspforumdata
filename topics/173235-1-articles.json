When I\u0027m in the map view flying a ship, I can\u0027t click on the orbit lines to create a node, nor can I double click on things to get the \u0022focus view\u0022 or \u0022set as target\u0022 menu. When I first load up KSP, it all works fine. After a few minutes of messing around with nodes in the map view, all of a sudden I can\u0027t make nodes anymore. Saving \u0026amp; Loading does not fix it, neither does returning to main menu and coming back. I literally have to restart the game, which, essentially makes it unplayable as we all know how long it takes to restart KSP, and you just can\u0027t do that every 10 mins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got half a million mods. Precise Manuever being the only one that messes with nodes, and then Kerbal Alarm Clock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else had this issue or know how to fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-30T03:28:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2018 03:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Crixomix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
