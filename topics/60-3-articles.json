It would be an engine system and fuel tank that attaches to the back of the command pod. The fuel tank would be half the length of the normal tank and the engine could use the standard liquid engine model with a different skin (it would be nice if this was smaller, but that might be too much work). The engine would be very weak but the tank would have a lot of fuel. Just having the fuel tank and engine on the capsule would not provide enough thrust to lift it off the ground and only the engine or another fuel tank would be able to attach to the bottom of the fuel tank (so it\u0027s large tank size won\u0027t be exploited). Once you\u0027re in space this would make it easier to adjust the orbit, because it takes very little force to change the path of a stable orbit. It would also give players an easy way to de-orbit instead of just drifting if their rockets have run out of fuel. The names could have something like \u0027Nuclear...\u0027 or \u0027Orbital...\u0027 to explain the use.

I realize you can only have one snap point, but if the LT-20 can connect two side-by-side 1 meter rockets, I don\u0027t see why it can\u0027t be done with 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry attaching them to the top and bottom of 2 of the large srb\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonly 1 connects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mixinghoney","CreatedById":2266,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-16T17:07:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply. I\u0027m using 0.8, reducing the mass of the part doesn\u0027t seem to help unfortunately.

You can\u0027t see it in a still image but it\u0027s wobbling all over the place, which obviously is bad for keeping the rocket flying straight! Sometimes it goes so far out of whack, everything on top of the motor falls completely off the side, it\u0027s hard to get a screenshot of though because everythign explodes a fraction of a second later when that happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoverweight?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
