After completing a series of contracts related to the Mun, I expected contracts for Minmus to start popping up as per usual. Instead, *Pol* of all places started appearing on my contracts list. The usual lot of contracts (plant a flag, transmit/return science data, build a base/station) started popping up as though nothing out of the ordinary were going on. Why do you suppose my Kerbals are suddenly so fascinated in Jool\u0027s speck of pollen that they\u0027d favor contracts going all the way out there over visiting its bright-blue analogue in Kerbin orbit?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T03:57:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 03:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:51:08Z","Content":"I have only gotten an \u0022explore minimus\u0022 contract in one of my career runs. It always seems to get skipped and go to duna. (fine by me. sending a probe to duna is easer than sending a manned lander to minmus anyways). If you want to go to minmus (I recommend it, the low grav makes it a biome hopper dream), just do contracts for minmus (fly by, science) or LKO to get your funds."},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:52:33Z","Content":"Maybe they wanted to find out what those rock spires were made of. Pure ragweed pollen?\n\nHow is the contract system supposed to pick them, anyways? Is it reputation? You may have gotten a surge doing mun contracts and BAM Pol? I usually get it after Duna and Eve, though.\n\nEDIT: Though one time I got explore contracts for Jool, Pol and Bop.
