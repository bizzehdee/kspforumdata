After completing a series of contracts related to the Mun, I expected contracts for Minmus to start popping up as per usual. Instead, \u003Cem\u003EPol\u003C/em\u003E of all places started appearing on my contracts list. The usual lot of contracts (plant a flag, transmit/return science data, build a base/station) started popping up as though nothing out of the ordinary were going on. Why do you suppose my Kerbals are suddenly so fascinated in Jool\u0027s speck of pollen that they\u0027d favor contracts going all the way out there over visiting its bright-blue analogue in Kerbin orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T03:57:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 03:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:51:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have only gotten an \u0022explore minimus\u0022 contract in one of my career runs.
