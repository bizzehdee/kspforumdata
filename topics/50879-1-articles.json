I\u0027m trying to \u0022bomb\u0022 Kerbin from atmospheric flight with probes in order to efficiently gather data on 3-4 biomes per flight. First I had the problem of the game despawning probes that get farther than 2.5 Km; solved it with TouhouTorpedo\u0027s NeverUnload, but probes still get destroyed on touchdown. The game does not seem to emulate parachutes on probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn this video you can see me dropping two probes, one with NeverUnload enabled and one with it disabled. This flight was run in conjunction with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/m4v/DontUnload\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDontUnload\u003C/a\u003E, which doesn\u0027t seem to do anything, as probes keep despawning at 2.5 Ks and crashing on terrain even with it enabled. The probe that \u0022splashes down\u0022 was actually destroyed, but the core survived, on ground they invariably explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ba9Ggmjh2Pk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try to do the same from space and deorbit them one by one, but if anyone knows anything that could help me I\u0027d be very thankful.
