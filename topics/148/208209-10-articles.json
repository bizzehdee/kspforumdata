Starfield, Elden Ring, etc, come from companies that have\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Edecades\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0in the business pumping out game after game on multiple franchises. Sure, a lot of them might be not good games, and one of those companies certainly has built up a reputation (or already had it if you didn\u0027t fall for the skyrim fad). KSP2 comes from one of the worse publishers out there in terms of how they treat their products and community, and KSP2 itself is being developed by a studio formed by poaching, boat jumpers, and what remains of the original people that rushed KSP1 to release just to \u0022prove people wrong\u0022 that the game wasn\u0027t green.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224135173\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208209\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653065618\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsmh.

Because we have seen that Squad has broken some promises, and T2 has broken promises, but has anybody on the current KSP 2 team previously broken promises beyond something tangential like biweekly updates? Not counting the developers \u00A0who transferred from Squad - I don\u2019t think the devs intended to break the promises that were made around multiplayer or other stuff.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, the impact of responses needs to be looked at. (This is in reply to the \u201Cblind praise and eternal patience\u201D). People are not ignoring the past, they are simply interpreting it differently from you. While you may see a delay as an indication of a problem in the studio, others see it as a natural part of game development. Additionally, it is not blind to praise a developer studio for their achievements even if they do have problems (which remember, is still under debate). People can be happy that the devs are making progress (and I wager that you are too), and they can choose to express that happiness instead of expressing their dismay at another delay. It is a difference in how you choose to respond to your outwards situation. And everyone has \u201Ceternal patience\u201D because everybody is going to have to wait until the game is released, whether they like it or not. You might as well choose to change how you feel about such things and have a better time in these next nine months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConcerns are perfectly valid - but consider when your interpretation of events is not the only plausible one. What I see a lot of people saying is that we simply don\u2019t know what is going on, and making (reasonable) inferences will not lead to anything and for some, it casts too much of a negative light on an unknown situation. As always, we will see soon enough what the situation is, whenever the game comes out or gets canceled or whatever else happens. Let\u2019s just enjoy the time up until then, because we have already seen that plaintive requests for a change in company strategy is met only by the NDAs that the devs probably had to sign.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-20T18:15:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2022 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by t_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-20T19:30:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224135192\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208209\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653068406\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258026\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, PDCWolf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n.

Because we have seen that Squad has broken some promises, and T2 has broken promises, but has anybody on the current KSP 2 team previously broken promises beyond something tangential like biweekly updates? Not counting the developers \u00A0who transferred from Squad - I don\u2019t think the devs intended to break the promises that were made around multiplayer or other stuff.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, the impact of responses needs to be looked at. (This is in reply to the \u201Cblind praise and eternal patience\u201D). People are not ignoring the past, they are simply interpreting it differently from you. While you may see a delay as an indication of a problem in the studio, others see it as a natural part of game development. Additionally, it is not blind to praise a developer studio for their achievements even if they do have problems (which remember, is still under debate). People can be happy that the devs are making progress (and I wager that you are too), and they can choose to express that happiness instead of expressing their dismay at another delay. It is a difference in how you choose to respond to your outwards situation. And everyone has \u201Ceternal patience\u201D because everybody is going to have to wait until the game is released, whether they like it or not. You might as well choose to change how you feel about such things and have a better time in these next nine months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConcerns are perfectly valid - but consider when your interpretation of events is not the only plausible one. What I see a lot of people saying is that we simply don\u2019t know what is going on, and making (reasonable) inferences will not lead to anything and for some, it casts too much of a negative light on an unknown situation. As always, we will see soon enough what the situation is, whenever the game comes out or gets canceled or whatever else happens. Let\u2019s just enjoy the time up until then, because we have already seen that plaintive requests for a change in company strategy is met only by the NDAs that the devs probably had to sign.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224135245\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208209\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653075000\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think they\u0027ve grown so much as two or three of you just repeat the same arguments over and over again.
