This is because of a security tweak we did, which invalidated the passwords.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no need to worry. All account information is secure and safely stored, and no data was lost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you\\\u0027re having trouble logging into the Store, you will have to reset your password using the password reminder function.
