But don\u2019t you worry, the issue was fixed and now you\u2019ll be able to use the \u201CQuicksave As\u2026\u201D feature under those circumstances without worrying about this issue. Another fixed issue involved the Crew Management controls remaining active when the Pause menu was opened and it would clear/fill all the vessel\u2019s seats when trying to close the Pause menu. The PS4 build also had a bug that involved the launchpad appearing as destroyed/damaged after repairing it several times. Repairing it and heading to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to launch a vessel would prompt the \u0027out of service\u2019 message every time.
