Rome I rules will be applied by the courts of Member States even if the application of those rules results in a non-EU law, e.g., Chinese law, being the governing law of the agreement. Further, the courts of Member States will apply Rome I even if some or all of the parties appearing before them are non-European.This is regulated by which party is required to offer\u00A0CHARACTERISTIC PERFORMANCE. This usually means the ruels of the bussines \u0027\u0027home\u0027\u0027, but not in consumer right matters.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E That means, since i bought it from Sweden, our policy aplies to my consumer rights. If i buy a product, there is already a PRE-DETERMIND law that regulates our agreement, and it is a so-called FORCED law, which means it is \u00A0NOT DISPOSITIVE and can therfore not be changed even if i were to sign under a document stating otherwise. This is to protect bussiness from\u00A0\u0027\u0027going around\u0027\u0027 the consumer rights by making their own contracts when selling products. So when i bought the game, an AGREEMENT WAS MADE on the basis of Swedens consumer rights law, of\u00A0which both partners are obliged to follow since the transaction is complete and therfore is signed by bopth trading parties. Now, i will and would happily have paid for any additional content which i have previously stated. But appearently you have not read it. I will not however, pay for bugfixes. All software contains bugs,and therffore, it is a UNREASONABLE demand to have it bug-free at once and unreasonable demands would be discussed in a court. Law is not black and white in that way. But all companies know that if they release software that not always works accordingly, they will fix that bug and for free as to make sure they do not violate the rights of their consumers. If a company would sell a product with bugs and not fix them or sell it as a complete game before it was complete,\u00A0which happend with one of the Call of duty games if i recall this case correctly, and now also happens with No Mans Sky, an investigation followed by a court descision will then decide if the consumer demands are reasonable compared to what the product should deliver. If a business goes bancrupt, then there is nothing i can do, not in my country anyway. But that also means that the company cannot make profit, so it is not an issue (by swedish reasoning) that should be included in consumer rights, since it is in the companies interest to make a profit. It is reasoned that you, before making\u00A0an important purchase, should make a informed decision on the health of the company. Several companies, like\u00A0Apple and Google have or are under investigation of violating consumer rights in the EU, because they operate under EU law when performing bussines here. Now, i am quite content with squads bugfixing etc. But my response was to a really vague and uninformed reasoning that you cannot demand bugfixing or req\u00FAired updates that makes the product complete. This is all a matter of reasoning and would require a court. So to even suggest there is no agreement between me and squad, is crazy. There is also a long discussion if we are entitled to know about the workign conditions of Squads staff. \u00A0This is a matter of fine balance and also, more reasoning. Are we not entitled to know, that a company we support financially, treats it staff well? I remember when Apple was caught having horrible conditions and mass suicides in their sub-contractors factories, and it was a HUGE DEAL and apple made promises to pressure them. Matter are not black and white and it is not as easy as to just silence people when they question certain bussines practices, because we are a society and things are complicated. I hope this clears somethings up, but it seems to be a huge confussion in this thread as to weather we are even entitled to breath oxygen etc. When bussiness inclduing money is involved, especially across borders, there is \u00A0a huge and complicated set of rules being applied and that is what we have courts for. There also does not have to be a law always, there can be a thing called predecent cases and this is applied in Great Brittain in many cases where court decisions are not made by existing law but my pre-existing court decisions, some dating even back hundreds of years. Law is compl\u00F6icated, and i dont mean to be rude here or anything but there is alot of misinformation being spread in this thread about what rights you have and whatnot, so i just wanted to clarify this so there are no more misunderstanding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeace \u0026lt;3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222797797\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149285\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476214716\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002232993\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022razark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, razark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Squad were to close their doors and cease operations, how would that law be enforced?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do you square that with the fact that all (significant) software contains bugs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni adressed\u00A0all this in my latest response which you should \u00A0and it is not hard to miss since it is a huge wall of text but i cover everything i think is of importance there as to avoid furhter misunderstandings \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-11T23:49:33Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2016 11:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FlyingKiwibird\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pieman478","CreatedById":170069,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T23:51:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Ch3 style=\u0022line-height:1.2;margin:0px 0px 3px;text-indent:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u00A0FlyingKiwibird,\u00A0Paragraphs\u00A0would be nice....\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThanks...\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingKiwibird","CreatedById":156508,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T23:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222798459\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149285\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476229873\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022170069\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pieman478\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, pieman478 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ch3 style=\u0022line-height:1.2;margin:0px 0px 3px;text-indent:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u00A0FlyingKiwibird,\u00A0Paragraphs\u00A0would be nice....\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThanks...\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyeah sorry about that xD its late and i had a couple of whiskies and now im gonna play KSP but i hope this clears somethings up if you dont want to read it now you know that it is there should you change your mind \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
