As the community grew that changed, as people started taking every offhand comment as a gold plated promise, being insulting and non-constructive in feedback; generally just making the forum an environment that did not encourage the devs to speak at all. So they mostly stopped, and now instead of banter and an inside look at how the game is developed we get carefully phrased developer notes that have probably passed through PR and legal departments before going public.
