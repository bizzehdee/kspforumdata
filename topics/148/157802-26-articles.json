They aren\u0027t taking anything from anybody, and will create their own content from scratch. Also, as others have pointed out, a number of things in the game now were preceded by mods which performed the same or similar functions. If Squad had not made stock equivalents, you would still be relying on mod makers to keep updating things such as docking mechanisms and rover wheels, and if that mod maker quit the game, you might no longer have any docking mechanisms and rover wheels. And as I pointed out earlier, the only way to prevent this from happening would be if Squad determined never to include anything which might be made into a mod at some point in the future. Squad cannot work backwards and try to make their product conform to the needs of the multitude of often conflicting mods available, and so they are\u00A0going to do the only practical thing, which is to make stock versions of whatever they want to have in their game regardless of whether or not a modded version of that feature already exists.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents ipsClearfix\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDLC\u0027s should always be optional, and they should be developed and implemented with this thought in mind.

I suppose the distinction may be a bit vague, so I\u0027ll try to explain a little. For example, in the case of scenarios, I\u0027d prefer that the core code required to enable scenarios be part of the core game while the actual scenarios and perhaps \u0027plugins\u0027 for specific features be part of the DLC. This would allow modders access to the same functionality as the DLC, with regards to how it accesses the game.

I suppose the distinction may be a bit vague, so I\u0027ll try to explain a little. For example, in the case of scenarios, I\u0027d prefer that the core code required to enable scenarios be part of the core game while the actual scenarios and perhaps \u0027plugins\u0027 for specific features be part of the DLC. This would allow modders access to the same functionality as the DLC, with regards to how it accesses the game. At that point, the only mods that would need to depend on the DLC are ones which want to rely on the specific functionality of the DLC for whatever reason rather than writing it from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose I have this viewpoint because one of the things I\u0027d really like to see with KSP is the core functionality becoming more flexible and extensible, in much the same way that the new comms system in 1.2 can be extended (in theory) to support functionality like RemoteTech, rather than having to write it from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBohemia, when they release a paid DLC, allows all player who do not have the DLC to participate in matches with people that do have the DLC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey see a lower quality texture version of the DLC, or they see a vehicle that is part of the DLC and can interact with it to a \u00A0point, but cannot drive it or use it in a particular way. It doesn\u0027t try to split the community so people with DLC can only play with others that also have the DLC, excluding the rest. In this sense, if Squad is coding this in a way that mods can be develop for those with and without DLC in a very flexible manner and in the end if only a matter of taste separating those with and without DLC, then yeah by all means go for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-29T14:11:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2017 02:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by JeeF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_stilgar_","CreatedById":147818,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-29T19:41:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t understand the problem with mods and DLC.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a mod uses something from the DLC, one of those things will happen:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na) mod has two versions, one with the DLC feature and one without\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nb) mod is split into two modules - base version and additional module that you only install when you have the DLC (which is a variation of the point a)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nc) if the feature from the DLC is so important that the mod can\u0027t exist without it then you either don\u0027t use this mod or buy the DLC...
