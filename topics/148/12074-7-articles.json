If you aren\u0027t favouring one point of view over another then both sides will complain of \u0022bias\u0022, compared to if you were actually being bias, in which case only one side will accuse you of bias. This goes for almost everything, whether it be multiplayer game balance, moderator performance, etc. It\u0027s actually quite amusing to see the same pattern repeated so many times over (although to what degree people complain varies with the sort of userbase a community attracts, either way though it can be difficult to gauge how happy the community really is - you can\u0027t hear people not-complaining after all).
