But what I meant, was that anyone creating an account on these forums, or on IRC from FacePunch with the sole intent to inflame, cause trouble, or other wise cause issues would be immediately banned without warning. We do not allow open discussion of Forum Moderation, period. It doesn\u0027t lead to anything other than the issue at hand. If you have an issue with any of the Mod\u0027s, PM them and if that is not handled, escalate to the next moderator in the chain of command until your issue is resolved. This forum is about the Game, not about how we moderator the forum. Though I do apologize to FacePunch users who have been good users on these forums, and to FP users who have not joined yet. No one has been banned that has not directly broken the rules of KSP Forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
