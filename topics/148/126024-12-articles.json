I understand that some companies have turned into role-playing and from there into arguments. However, I feel that having \u0022employees\u0022 and \u0022companies\u0022 does NOT mean role-playing, or, at the least, not enough role-playing that it creates arguments. \u003Cbr\u003E\nMy company (AMRSD) had employees, partnerships, and requests, and (you\u0026#39;ll have to trust me on this) I\u0026#39;ve never received an infraction for it, or a warning. I\u0026#39;m not well-informed enough to say whether rule-breaking is rampant on some threads or not, but I do know that some companies, representing hundreds of hours of work, in their replies alone, don\u0026#39;t appear to break the rules to me. My company never had much going on, so it can transfer over to the SCE fairly easily without much loss. \u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, I do feel that with some companies, especially ones without active founders, will really lose a lot. \u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, my company will stay almost the same, minus employees, etc, in the SCE, and I imagine that many other companies will do the same thing. If my company is that kind that is the problem, then pushing them into the SCE won\u0026#39;t help.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd finally, I want to say that I don\u0026#39;t know much about the moderator\u0026#39;s decision, and there may be factors I left out. RBs may just be a source of net unhappiness, but from what I\u0026#39;ve heard, it isn\u0026#39;t, and it definitely isn\u0026#39;t for me.\n"}]}
