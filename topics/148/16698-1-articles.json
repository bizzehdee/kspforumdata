The first - and most important - is so the code can be vetted by the community for exploits or malware. The second benefit is so modders can learn from each other, which is the best and quickest way to promote and disseminate expertise.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end there are people who do not understand and of this (and probably will not for years) and there are mods that simply are not updated anymore but still work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese new rules should be enforced on new mods and mods that are being constantly updated. The rest should be grandfathered and assumed to be some sort of licence that protects the creator. That would include locking their thread with a notice to have it unlocked to have a licence lined up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end this problem will still continue and will be a problem off the site. Yes it is nice to have people who know how to pick a correct licence out but lets be honest here, most likely the average user age on this forum is quite low and there needs to be materials for them to make a decision. Hopefully we don\u0027t need to go into DMCA Takedown Notices and explaining that horrible mess to people who could care less but that is also something that might happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jordguitar","CreatedById":4524,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T21:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is also another problem of this notice being in a place where it affects people the most (as in all add-on sub-forums).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T21:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving this rule is better than not having this rule, despite the problems.
