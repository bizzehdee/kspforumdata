agree that adding structural parts (panels, tubes, engine plates, ect) as DLC only isnt really that great a move.\u00A0 They have absolutely nothing to do with the DLC itself (how is a hollow tube historical), and whats worse, is that means that similar parts are automatically never gonna be added to stock KSP since the devs have no reason to add duplicates of something.\u00A0 Not that everyone agrees, but what ive found the stock game to lack the most of all, is proper structural parts.\u00A0 We already have plenty of fuel tanks, engines, command pods (albeit the latter doesnt have any good ones, just bloody circular trash), but what we really need is more structural panels, specifically ones that are very very big (its an absolute pain to make anything large scale in the stock game due to part count with large craft or buildings).\u00A0 Who knows, maybee one day well get procedural panels and wings, but for now we are stuck with wings as the largest single component if you want
