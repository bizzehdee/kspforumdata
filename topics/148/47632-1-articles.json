The reputation allows you to give a compliment to other users who have made a quality post or have helped you. Giving a reputation point is generally considered a nice gesture. You can view the reputation that you have received in your User CP and you will be alerted when someone has given you reputation points. Your total reputation will be shown as series of reputation indicators in your posts and profile. The more positive your reputation, the more positive icons will be shown. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[table][tr][td]\u003Cstrong\u003EGiving reputation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give reputation, click on the reputation icon in the relevant post.
