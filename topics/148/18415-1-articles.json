But as Adrian has stated the game will eventually go on Steam, and currently, as far as I know, it will not be through Greenlight. Though it\u0027s come to our attention that people have posted KSP on Greenlight, these files will be removed as we do have communication with Valve. If it comes to light that anyone on these forums has posted KSP on Greenlight without permission, there will be punitive action taken against that person. The truth is, that while we very very much appreciate how much you all love the game, trying to add it to greenlight without the dev team\u0027s permission is actually going to cause more harm then good. So in short, please don\u0027t do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-DR\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
