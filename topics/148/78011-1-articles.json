This major release, numbered 0.24, is a substantial advancement in the game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Career Mode, which challenges players to run a space agency.

One of my favorite aspects, is how it\u0027s added new challenges for even the most veteran players.

Players can accept or decline contracts, offered by companies, institutions and other Kerbin entities, or Agencies. Contracts are generated by a context-aware system, which takes into account a player\u0027s in-game progress. Signed contracts come with a deadline, so players must finish their objectives in time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers will also find \u003Cstrong\u003Enew engines, updated parts\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Evessel recovery\u003C/strong\u003E, which means you can reclaim the value of landed parts and any resources they contain, in the update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launchings!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-18T06:28:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2014 06:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rainbowtrout\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed a small error.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
