Surely you can add a hi-tech probe-core to your vessel for accurately holding retrograde etc, but only a true Pilot can figure out how to raise your orbit from 100km to 300km all by itself.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMechjeb-like functionality to create and execute waypoints (change orbit, rendez-vous, even docking) is no longer \u0022cheating,\u0022 as you only get that functionality after proper \u0022training\u0022 the pilot for it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt now makes sense to have a pilot on board over a probe core!

However, during the 8 month trip he\u0027ll accumulate enough time in the Simulator together with Jeb, to land your lander flawlessly anyway. To transfer skills, the receiving pilot may need a minimum level (along the lines of: orbit transfers; 2 stars, rendez-vous, 3 stars, docking: 4 stars, landing 5 starts). So now we have a part to go with the expansion. Who\u0027d want an expansion without any parts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSkills increase accuracy.
