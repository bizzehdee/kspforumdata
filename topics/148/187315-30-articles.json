I guess what I\u0027m saying is it\u0027s no fun to come back and find your colony dead, but it\u0027s also no fun to have empty game mechanics.

My guess is that to expand the colony, you\u0027ll need to build habitats with life support systems, and gather/gain access to appropriate resources. My guess would be a tiny colony that lacks resources to expand just has a closed cycle life support system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my guess is it would be something like: if you have a \u0022farming dome\u0022 and a \u0022water recycler and waste reclamation dome\u0022 linked together, your colony is stable and won\u0027t collapse, but is limited to 50 kerbals. You\u0027d need to gather more resources and build more domes to have it continue growing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d be Ok with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, these advanced drives do seem that they\u0027d make getting around a system too easy. I already play at a 3x rescale because I find it too easy to get around.
