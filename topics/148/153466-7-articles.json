You think my statements are justifications. They are emphatically not. They are truth, they are fact. Allow me to reiterate:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: Squad is a SMALL operation that (not sure if still connected to the parent corp) at its start when Felipe started KSP was a Commercial Advertising Company, most likely still is, that makes games on the side or in a newly formed subdivision. They run on a microscopic budget with a small team for a game house. Especially when compared to titans like Square-Enix, EA, DICE, Microsoft etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: Blitworks or Flying Tiger (still unclear on who is porting) is working multiple projects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: Porting is time intensive, expensive, complicated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: KSP is being translated (every aspect of that word applies) to multiple languages, both in terms of what is spoken by us humans and computer devices. This takes time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: this causes bugs in the extreme. A fix for a bug on PC may break something for both XB1 AND PS4. This isn\u0027t easy even when you do like say Square-Enix and FFXIV for XB1, PS4, PC AND iOS on MAC, and they have tremendous amounts of money. Squad doesn\u0027t. The company doing the port doesn\u0027t in all likely hood.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis list can go on ad infinitum but, the bottom line?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts a slow, expensive, complicated process.
