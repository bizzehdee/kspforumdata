When it became obvious (to Squad, it was pretty obvious to many in the community at the time of the announcement of FTE\u0027s involvement) that FTE was too inexperienced, too incompetent, and ultimately utterly incapable of producing a functional port, Squad decided to part ways with FTE and hire Blitworks (a company with a much better portfolio and reputation) to fix everything. At that time I\u0027m sure Squad thought Blitworks could clean up whatever FTE had done and release a fix by early 2017. That wasn\u0027t an unreasonable thought, but Squad doesn\u0027t have any experience with console software and must have had no idea just how bad a job FTE did. It\u0027s very likely they remained optimistic about Blitworks abilities to turn it around, even when it became apparent that FTE\u0027s work was so bad it would have to be restarted from scratch. If a broken version took about a year from announcement to release, it\u0027s not unreasonable to think that a working version built from scratch is taking about a year to release. I acknowledge that the Squad only recently admitted that Blitworks had to start from scratch and that it seemed like the console versions were taking way too long to fix, but given that information it now makes sense as to why it\u0027s taking so long. It\u0027s no excuse for not communicating better, but at least now it all makes sense. Also, it\u0027s a much more reasonable scenario than believing they\u0027ve just been outright lying this whole time. Plus, it\u0027s a really bad lie when they\u0027ll be proven as liars in about two months time. It also makes sense that it would take so long to announce a release window: if they give an optimistic window and miss it because software development is hard even for experts who have been doing this a long time (not to mention a studio that has only done it once and then only on PC), it would be the second time they missed their announced release, and if they give a pessimistic window it may be much longer than it\u0027ll actually take and be very discouraging and upsetting to customers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGranted, if February comes and they haven\u0027t delivered I\u0027m thinking they might as well cancel any further plans to sell anything else on consoles. It\u0027s likely that no one would be interested in anything they had to say or sell at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223214399\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153466\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221510185428\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175814\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022yingyangaje90\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, yingyangaje90 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHighly doubt it I trust them on the console update as far as I could throw them which wouldn\u0027t be very far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t blame you for not trusting them, and it isn\u0027t your responsibility to understand how software is made.

For example, they have already announced the console version re-release date as \u0022by the end of January 2018.\u0022 That is rather far off from your estimate of 2020.
