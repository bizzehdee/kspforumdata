Your **20th kerbal** costs **more** than you get from completing the \u0022**explore Duna**\u0022 contract, for Christ\u0027s sake... **some of us like to keep our space stations and bases populated**.\n\u003E Actually, picking up kerbals along the way for your bases and stations and then terminating the contract to rescue them is probably cheaper then just hiring them outright.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hmm. That is what I would call a problem, yes. Maybe they accidentally a number there? Maybe it was intentional, to represent how much life support you need to keep a Kerbal alive in space compared to a simple probe?\n\u003E Still though, I would say that Kerbal Hiring needs a buff (or a nerf?
