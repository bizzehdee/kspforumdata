Open communication with the Kerbal Space Program community has been a hallmark of the game and a big reason for its positive evolution over the years, so we wanted to give all of you advance notice that the End User License Agreement will be changing on March 15, 2019.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe main change in the updated EULA is an added arbitration clause which is a common license provision. In plain English, that means that any potential disagreement between Take-Two Interactive and you will be resolved using an arbitration process.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you do not want to participate in arbitration, there is an opt out period of 30 days starting from the day of the change\u2019s implementation on March 15, 2019. In order to opt out, a written notification must be mailed to Take Two Interactive Software, Legal Department, Attn: Arbitration Opt Out, 110 West 44th Street, New York, New York, 10036. The notice must include (1) your full name; (2) your mailing address; and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with the Company through arbitration. You are responsible for ensuring the Company\u2019s receipt of your opt-out notice, and you therefore may wish to send a notice by means that provide a written receipt.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe deeply appreciate everyone\u2019s understanding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
