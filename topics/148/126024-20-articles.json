Drama aside doesn\u0026#39;t matter where you are in life, or what you\u0026#39;re doing, role playing or not, drama is gonna happen.

If a person doesn\u0026#39;t like your role playesque rudeness, than you as a person should stop, or switch personalities for your character, or... just stop role playing with that person. If it does reach those heights, than the moderator has every right to ban the rude person, role playing or not, seeing as a its a very real lack of respect from the real person for continuing when the other person doesn\u0026#39;t like it.

It cause more load on the moderators, which at times includes the squad devs. Many People have exactly the mindset in my above example, it\u0026#39;s just make believe roleplaying. Overall this always causes more issues to arise because people treat it as such. Other people don\u0026#39;t see it as roleplaying, and eventually the line of true insults or roleplaying gets blurred, then disappears completely.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nit causes a burden to the staff moderating the forum as more opportunities for moderation arise, it\u0026#39;s true and the mods said so themselves in a few posts. And really if even on dev has to come spend more time moderating the forum, which I\u0026#39;ve seen devs moderate before, couldn\u0026#39;t that persons time be spent doing much better things for KSP?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nand do we really want to increases the amount of chances and rate of banning because people inevitably overstep when roleplaying? Does banning someone ever work out well? Many times they make a new account and come back with even more of an attitude and just try to cause disruptions because they feel slighted from being banned. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIsnt it really much simpler to just ask us as a community to not roleplay. They are working with people to save their hard work and creations, and allowing them to continue working together building, and sharing creations. Isn\u0026#39;t it really simpler to say ok we won\u0026#39;t roleplay and cause more issues for mods to deal with. Allowing them to keep the forum even nicer by spending time dealing with the real problems here? \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRoleplaying gets carried away, it causes more issues. many times it\u0026#39;s just someone who got carried away or it\u0026#39;s a 3rd party who joins in and doesn\u0026#39;t like something. I don\u0026#39;t think many of these people need to be banned. People like to use the human argument here, well it\u0026#39;s also a fact that people will exploit these blurred areas to truly be a donkey and hurt people. And in the process someone who makes a mistake and gets carried away would end up in the middle and getting banned when they probably shouldn\u0026#39;t be. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt it causes a much more difficult situation, and more work for the mods. They have explained as much in a few posts. And in my view I agree that negative aspects outweigh the positives of letting people roleplay on forums. The decision is truly being made to to keep and make this a better place and experience for everyone, as much as possible. Making things harder on the mods, and possibly causing them to leave isn\u0026#39;t good. If it becomes difficult here for mods and they start leaving, and if moderating becomes that difficult often times the moderators found become of lower quality. And when that happens things begin to devolve. I for one feel we have great devs and mods here, as they are just as passionate about this place. That\u0026#39;s generally not the issue in most forums. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nanyways I\u0026#39;ve said all I can really.
