I recall it being mentioned that the technological advancements will have more relevance to the science experiments performed. However, given how long it will take to develop, any comment in the past (or even recent present) is probably going to be superseded by whatever ends up being presented in that update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dinkledash","CreatedById":224462,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T13:51:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224239769\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210187\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677242120\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160814\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022septemberWaves\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, septemberWaves said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are answering a question that was not asked.

The devs have no doubt played with a lot of the popular science mods, like SCANSAT, but that sort of thing would probably be related to resources in the Exploration module, which is pretty far along the roadmap.\u00A0 I expect Science mode will be like KSP1 stock when it comes out, where you get all the science you earn available to spend on technology immediately, and probably no mobile labs. We\u0027d get labs with colonies, I should think, as without resources, there\u0027s no other reason to make colonies.\u00A0 Once resource gathering is available in Exploration, buying more advanced parts would presumably cost specific resources, and perhaps going forward on the tech tree would also cost resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just hope we have a way to get accurate elevation data out of the box, and a suicide burn calculator.
