I have a bad feelings, mainly about mods and TT potentially monetizing KSP. I love the game the way it is now, and I\u0027m using a lot of mods (they expand the enjoyment of the game beyond the stock playing), so when I heard that KSP being acquired by TT, which has a problem in the past regarding mods, it surprised me (no, seriously. I just heard about this yesterday). Will this game still mod friendly after this? Like all this time? And about monetizing KSP, I do realize that TT is a company, and company want a profit, so it\u0027s logical to assume that they want a return investment from KSP. The question is, how? If they kill big name mods, or start to monetizing with paid DLC (which I assume ranges from new planets, star system or new parts that you can probably obtain for free from mod, over powered parts or something ridiculous like \u0022your ship runs out of fuel on eelo orbit?

GTA is a completely monetized game with paid microtransactions \u003Cem\u003E[snip]\u003C/em\u003E (it can cost 20 bucks for a god damn car Darn it, more than that for even higher end cars), they could turn around and do the same thing to ksp\u00A0cause after all they want to turn a profit. paid DLC, threatening mod makers with lawsuits, officially removing support for mods, microtransactions, the simplifying of the game to appeal to a wider fanbase etc. I think it\u0027s repurposed bovine waste and I wish take two would back off cause from the eyes of the community at least in my opinion, it feels like a hostile takeover more than anything. take 2 has made it extremely apparent they dont care about their players and only money, squad cared about us, and cared about delivering an amazing game for us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-29T09:34:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223106198\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022161355\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221498728636\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002265729\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022noobsrtoast\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, noobsrtoast said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want it to continue being that one indie game that the developers pulled out all the stops on for the sake of making a good game, not making money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is so cute to think Squad did not go after the money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-29T10:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223106198\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022161355\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221498728636\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002265729\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022noobsrtoast\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, noobsrtoast said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want it to continue being that one indie game that the developers pulled out all the stops on for the sake of making a good game, not making money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s easy to be generous with other people\u0027s money and, more importantly, time.
