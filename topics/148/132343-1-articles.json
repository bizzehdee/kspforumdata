Because KerbalStuff was arguably the most popular third party community website we feel it\u2019s important to share our view on the events of the past few days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo understand the position KerbalStuff had in the community it\u2019s important to go back to its roots. Back in the day we hosted our own mod repository named SpacePort. It was a very simple system based off a Wordpress platform and maintaining was, well, not the easiest thing. In 2014 we had come to the point where we had to decide on the future of that service. We were faced with one of two options: rebuild the SpacePort platform from the ground up and continue to invest significant amount time, or outsource the mod repository. We eventually opted for the latter and partnered with the Curse network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring that time the community had also started the process of creating a community-run Spaceport replacement (the \u201CMajiir challenge\u201D). When we announced our partnership with Curse that effort picked up steam and Sircmpwn\u2019s proposal called KerbalStuff was born. KerbalStuff grew to be (one of) the biggest mod repositories for Kerbal Space Program. It featured tight integration with CKAN, a mod manager that many players and modders use. Although the website was initially hosted by Majiir, Sircmpwn moved the website to his own servers after some months of operation and Majiir is no longer involved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLately, Kerbalstuff had grown to the point where the current hosting was no longer adequate. This is definitely a testament to the website\u2019s popularity in the KSP community. This week, the website went blank and ultimately came back with the message that it had been closed down. It\u2019s fair to say that this took everyone by surprise. Given that KerbalStuff was an independent website, closing the service is Sircmpwn\u2019s personal decision, and we had no part in it. We have not received a request to help with or take control of the website prior or after the shutdown, nor are we aware of anyone who was asked to help or take over Kerbalstuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe message that Sircmpwn put up on the website cites that a lack of interest in continuing the service is the reason for its closure. The reasoning behind the apathy contained, and still contains, elements that we disagree with. Because these arguments have caused a lot of.. let\u2019s call it passionate questions in our direction we feel compelled to reply to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, we were blamed for continuing to support Curse as the official mod repository, in spite of KerbalStuff hosting more mods. The reason for this lies in the history of the website\u2019s creation: it was developed specifically to be an unofficial, independent alternative to the official mod repository. Curse provided, and still provides, a stable platform for uploading mods and other ingame content, and we have no reason to end our partnership with them. Because of those two arguments, we never explored the possibility of making KerbalStuff the \u2018official\u2019 mod repository. At this time similar arguments can be made for other community initiatives, such as KerbalX, CKAN or the KSP Subreddit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelated to KerbalStuff not being an official website, we were blamed for never mentioning KerbalStuff in public. Although we did not link to KerbalStuff from the game\u2019s launcher, Kerbal Space Program itself or our websites, we did often talk about it in community conversations, forum posts, and on social media. We never actively promoted the website, but we feel we certainly didn\u2019t ignore it. Many people who work for Squad have expressed their fondness of the website, and the developers who work on the game sometimes also had mods on the website.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, but perhaps most importantly, was the accusation that we threatened the website with legal action. We would like to stress that no such thing happened. Back in 2014 when the website was being developed we were in the process of acquiring a trademark on the word Kerbal, and part of the obligations one has as a trademark holder is to investigate possible infringements of your trademark. Failure to do so may invalidate the trademark entirely at a later point. To this end we talked to the people behind Kerbalstuff to determine what the website was going to be, and several scenarios were discussed briefly including possibly renaming KerbalStuff. As it was to be a non-commercial community website it quickly became clear that no legal action was warranted against KerbalStuff, and we never pursued legal action against Kerbalstuff or any other community website for using the phrase Kerbal in its name. We\u2019re thankful that Sircmpwn has since retracted this part of the statement from the Kerbalstuff website, but we\u2019ve received a lot of questions about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s probably time to wrap up this post, but we couldn\u2019t possibly do that before thanking Sircmpwn for his efforts that undoubtedly benefited the community. Maintaining a service like KerbalStuff is both costly and time consuming, and not many people would step up to do what Sircmpwn did. Thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently the KSP community is already working on an alternative website (working name SpaceDock) based on the open source framework of Kerbalstuff. We hope that this new website will fill a void for many people. At the moment of writing it does not seem to be the case that Sircmpwn will allow this new team to use the KerbalStuff name, domain registration or user and mod database. That means the website will largely have to start over, but if help is needed we\u2019re ready to look at ways in which we could support it. Meanwhile people are free to upload and share mods from any source they wish; we can happily recommend Curse for this purpose, at the very least as a stopgap measure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks again to Sircmpwn and Majiir for running this amazing website, an even bigger thanks to our amazing modding community and the best wishes to the team picking up where KerbalStuff left off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T18:03:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTruly appreciate a response.

Not just as a side remark in some thread that a lot of us could miss if we happen to not stroll along it, but feel free to post a statement on a front page or in a new thread. Give us a chance to see it and react. I think you might be pleasently surprised by the reactions, enough to ignore those that can\u0027t seem to do but complain.

We shouldn\u0027t blame Squad for standing to their decisions, or maybe even to agreements, contracts or whatever happened in the background. I really hope SpaceDock will be as good as (or even better than) KS, and I\u0027ve no doubt that its popularity will reach at least that of KS in no time.
