Good thing there isn\\\u0027t a skill requirement otherwise I\\\u0027d be thrown out after all the Kerbals I\\\u0027ve killed in the one week I\\\u0027ve been playing! My 6 year old wants to sign up so bad but understands he isn\\\u0027t quite ready yet. Instead, there will be a $5 donation coming from his piggy bank. I told him I had already bought the game, but he insisted after hearing about how the project started and that it needs people\\\u0027s help to complete it and make it a success. We spent this morning watching numerous shuttle launchers, a documentary on Spaceship 1 and a bunch of Apollo mission videos. He\\\u0027s been so inspired by the game (and gets really upset when I lose a crew!) that we\\\u0027re setting up a real rocket build and flight before he officially starts school. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to finish, special thanks to Kikoskia and his Let\\\u0027s Play for introducing me to KSP, to tryDyingtoLive and his very helpful LP\\\u0027s and last but not least, to Squad and the crew for all their efforts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3,2,1, blast off!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
