Today, the favorite entries were pared down into a group of winning logos that will be officially placed into the game. We saw many great entries, from the professional to the hand drawn. We appreciate all the effort that went into making each one. Many hard choices were made, but in the end, we were happy with the final picks and we hope you will be, too. Winners will be contacted soon. Thanks again for dedication and hard work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
