The previous communications definitely were contextually and tonally implying that the game, as a finished \u00221.0\u0022 product, would be released in early 2023. I\u0027m also rather disappointed that it is effectively being delayed again and more-so disappointed that they are choosing to burn some goodwill by disingenuously trying to spin this as a \u0022we need your input\u0022 for the core functionality. The majority of their core audience aren\u0027t braindead, they aren\u0027t 10 year olds, and the majority will be well aware that this is putting lipstick on a pig of another significant delay while needing to start generating some revenue stream to satisfy the publisher/T2 investors. If they had been more forthcoming with the previous delay announcement(s) this wouldn\u0027t be as disappointing as it is now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise this announcement should have been treated as what it is, another delay. They should have acknowledged where they are in development and announced that they have now chosen to launch it in EA rather than delaying it further to continue developing it behind closed doors. They also should have shown some level of progress or current state of those delayed features (essentially the majority of the game) and provided some estimated timeline for when they think they will be introducing those features to the EA public branch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be doing the same as Master39. I\u0027ll check it out on Steam when it launches to EA, however, given what they\u0027ve shown with this announcement it is very likely I\u0027ll be refunding it. Also to be clear, this is a failure in their communication in my opinion which had they handled this better I\u0027d have no qualms buying it as an early access just to help fund the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-24T09:13:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome content has been removed.

well done on the team.\u00A0 This is exactly how you market a release date, whether EA or otherwise.\u00A0 Very early on, the game promised things before they even knew what it would take to get there.\u00A0 Several times along the way, the date was pushed, but still given.\u00A0 Furthermore - the game was \u0027announced\u0027 when it was at the paper-napkin stage, which was a terrible mistake.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut now, you\u0027ve got a small, manageable, achievable goal that you can clearly meet.\u00A0 You\u0027ve given a date close enough at hand to be exciting, but far enough out to give you time to meet it.\u00A0\u00A0Had you announced the game upon EA being ready for release, instead of announcing it in 2017, that would be have been the proper way to handle marketing.\u00A0\u00A0I think this means the team is finally being able to properly evaluate their own potential and ability in regards to their timeline and goals, which speaks to a higher functioning in the team, and that\u0027s a good thing.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you, for waiting to announce this until you had a scaled-down, achievable goal that you\u0027ll be able to deliver on.\u00A0 Please keep doing that.\u00A0 Any other big announcements - wait until you\u0027re\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ealready at beta stage\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0before announcing them publicly.\u00A0 A lot of the backlash I see here surrounds broken promises and over-extended hype.\u00A0 By waiting and being more discrete with announcements, you can prevent that effect in the future.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m looking forward to the game, though undetermined if I\u0027ll participate in EA.\u00A0 Like many others, I\u0027d rather not burn myself out on this game as a beta-tester, especially if I\u0027m going to be paying a lot for it.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinal note - as others have mentioned - This has a real chance in EA with mods being allowed, to take off well past the development team.\u00A0 Already in KSP1, modders were able to take the game places the original team had never imagined.\u00A0 My worry is that this is going to\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Esupplant\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0actual development of the game.\u00A0 The Kerbin that was shown was a worse rendering, from the land, to the clouds, than some of the better mods for KSP 1, and if modders come along and fix that - they\u0027ll have less incentive to build it in to the game for release.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo my only plea - as modding takes off, I hope the team will have a policy/procedure in place for adopting mods to become core components.\u00A0 That will be critical, but it will also be critical to have a model in place to\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ecompensate financially\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0the mods you incorporate - because the modders will, in effect, be finishing your modules for you in Early Access.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-25T00:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224190195\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210187\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666636814\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022217956\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nazalassa\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Nazalassa said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFebruary 2023 \u002B (4 * 2 months) = December 2023\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is an insane timeline if the team expects to get community input at every stage, much less produce a quality end product.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re probably looking at a much more reasonable February 2023 \u002B (4 * 6 months) = February 2025.
