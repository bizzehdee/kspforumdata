We have made the difficult decision to move the release date of KSP 2, which will now launch in early 2023 on PC with our console release later that year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe are building a game of tremendous technological complexity, and are taking this additional time to ensure we hit the quality and level of polish it deserves. We remain focused on making sure KSP2 performs well on a variety of hardware, has amazing graphics, and is rich with content. We\u2019ve built a spectacular team at Intercept Games \u2013 a team that includes, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/204167-kerbal-space-progam-1122-is-live/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eas previously mentioned\u003C/a\u003E, key members from the development team behind the original Kerbal Space Program. We have the perfect combination of experienced, passionate, and skilled developers to fully realize this game\u2019s ambitious potential.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe are forever grateful to the KSP community for sticking with us on this journey, and we appreciate your continued support as we push towards the finish line.
