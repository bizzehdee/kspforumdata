I\u003Cbr\u003E\nknow this is frustrating, especially considering that this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve adjusted our schedule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe knew we were taking on an immense technical and creative challenge when we started this project.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe\u2019ve heard time and again from this community that quality is paramount, and we feel the same way.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u2019s not enough to deliver a bunch of new features \u2013 those features have to be woven together into a\u003Cbr\u003E\nstable, polished whole. We\u2019re creating a reliable foundation on which players and modders alike can\u003Cbr\u003E\nbuild for another decade or more. That involves solving problems that have never been solved before,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand that takes time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u2019ve got a team of talented people working every challenge from every angle, and because I\u2019m lucky\u003Cbr\u003E\nenough to get a front row seat, I can see the huge leaps we\u2019re making. It\u2019s killing us how much of this we\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave to keep under our hats until the game is released. We can\u2019t express how much we\u0027re looking\u003Cbr\u003E\nforward to soaking up all your reactions and discoveries on that day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the meantime, we\u2019ll keep posting cool images here to give you a taste of what\u2019s in store. We will also\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontinue to release feature videos and developer diaries that go more in-depth on specific areas of the\u003Cbr\u003E\ngame, and hopefully those will help 2021 to go by a little faster. Stay tuned for a new dev diary coming\u003Cbr\u003E\nsoon, as well as a new Feature Video this winter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks as always for sharing our commitment to making KSP2 as great as we all know it has to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Nate Simpson\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/197935-kerbal-space-program-2-to-be-released-in-2022-discussion-thread/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EClick here\u003C/a\u003E to enter the discussion thread for this post \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E]\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
