regard to complexity and so forth...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d maybe point to where some of the new sandbox games are going.\u00A0 \u0022Stormworks: Build and Rescue\u0022 for instance has both an \u0022Advanced\u0022 and \u0022Simple\u0022 career mode.\u00A0 I much prefer advanced, which doesn\u0027t just require that you add a motor... you have to add an engine and then connect it with fuel lines, electrical systems, gearboxes, alternators and so forth... and then hook it up to a prop/rotor/or jet.\u00A0 In this particular game, the jets are more difficult to construct than rotor/propeller craft.\u00A0 They took the approach of treating the rotor/propeller as a single unit and magically managing the blade pitch.\u00A0 ...but setting up the engines in advanced mode is also far more challenging.\u00A0 Additionally, building jets is more difficult in that game because you have to assemble the parts of the jet: intake/compressor/combustion chamber etc.\u00A0 Interesting design options there because it lets you construct a jet for a plane or a turboshaft for a helo with the same set of parts, just arranged a bit differently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStormworks is a bit of a different type of game though.\u00A0 You get to build your craft from the inside out, which is pretty cool.\u00A0 There isn\u0027t any need for part clipping cuz the building blocks are just that... little blocks.\u00A0 So as for the sandbox designer player base, I would definitely not say the majority are in the camp of basic is better.\u00A0 I mean in this game there are PID and logic controllers, you can make circuit boards for an autopilot system...\u00A0 Did I mention you even have to create your control dashboards and hook up the dials to engines and sensors (pitot tubes for speed detection, pressure gauges, heat sensors, gyros, you name it).\u00A0 I saw someone posted a little Asteroids video game cabinet to the correct scale that you could plop it down in the game room of your ship.\u00A0 ...then I realized, not only was it to proper scale to your boat and avatar captain, when I walked over to the thing...\u00A0 It was a working Asteroids arcade game!\u00A0 There was a monitor on the thing and they used the freakin LUA language (which the game natively supports) to actually code a playable arcade asteroids game!\u00A0 You can build your own radar display screens in this thing.\u00A0 So no, I don\u0027t really buy any argument that says the overall sandbox player base is looking for KISS building options.\u00A0 I do however appreciate that in that game they also have the \u0022Easy Mode\u0022 that just lets engines work without having to link em up.\u00A0 Of course when people build and post stuff like that, first question is always \u0022Hey do you have a version that works in Advanced Mode?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, I like how they implemented the blades in KSP and since I play other games like Stormworks, it feels like it struck a balance for KSP players, maybe even erring a bit on the side of being simpler since we don\u0027t have such minute

Infernal Robotics paved the way. So aside surface features, the DLC is aimed at exactly that userbase wanting to do more. Do complex stuff. And I\u0027m glad Squad recognizes a lot of people actually consider KSP a powerful design tool, much more than a game. Because in ways, the editor is the biggest selling point.
