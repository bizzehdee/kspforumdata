Guess I\u0026#39;m a bit late to the party on this one. Ah, well, here are some more thoughts anyway:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m sure there are reasons for this move beyond what any of us truly know, outside of the developers and moderators themselves, so I am trying to approach this issue with an appropriate amount of deference to those in charge. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith that said, I suppose I didn\u0026#39;t realize that the roleplaying was such an issue. Personally, I was a member of a company (and perhaps still am for now). I actually really enjoyed that membership because it challenged me to build ships and think about Kerbal in ways that would never have occurred to me by myself. My building acumen improved exponentially because of the unique challenges inherent in working and competing with others who shared and provided specific goals. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPerhaps some took it too far, I suppose (I don\u0026#39;t have any personal experience with that). However, this does make me ask, where is the line drawn with roleplaying? I guess I just saw it as another exercise in imagination, which is really what this whole game is all about. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHonestly, isn\u0026#39;t there a little bit of roleplaying in the challenges thread, as well? How many challenges present you with a fictitious mission or background story that requires you, as a designer, to put yourself in a certain role in order to achieve that goal? It all takes imagination. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust my thoughts. I\u0026#39;m not speaking about the drama aspects of the decision, so please keep that in mind. I usually keep to myself enough that I\u0026#39;m oblivious to any of that occurring (at least as much as I can). However, I just hope that this will not stifle fun and interesting designs in any meaningful way and will still allow the players to form communities centered on shared goals.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCheers.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T22:44:21Z","Content":"\nTo me it\u0026#39;s page 10, but I have modified my settings a bit for faster* navigation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh well, I hope stuff will go according to plan - let\u0026#39;s not have another forum derp...\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T23:03:02Z","Content":"\nWould I be right to expect that locked threads are not being ported over to the new forum?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T23:05:39Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Po0ka\u0027]I have a concern about the look of the new forum, it might sound like nothing but would it be possible to have \u0022square\u0022 avatars?\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wouldn\u0026#39;t like to sacrifice my avatar\u0026#39;s details just to have a supposed \u0022modern\u0022 look, if it\u0026#39;s a circle, it would use the same space as a square, just with lost details.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut as it\u0026#39;s still in development i doubt the apparence is final, i just wanted to express my opinion.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(If it was already brought up by someone then i\u0026#39;m sorry, i didn\u0026#39;t want to read [I]all[/I] these pages)[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes, I\u0026#39;ll enable Square avatars (in fact, since taking that screenshot they\u0026#39;ve also been enabled on the test forum). \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027nsgallup\u0027]Existing threads aren\u0026#39;t getting deleted are they?[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027Yakuzi\u0027]Looking forward to the new forums, though a bit sad there won\u0026#39;t be any blogs anymore :(\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@ Mods, would it be possible to add a voting system (positive only perhaps) for individual posts in the \u0022Suggestions and Development\u0022 subforum?
