That doesn\u2019t mean some of the lacking issues are easy to solve (multi-player game mechanics, no single-player storyline, etc) but it will surely get attention.

Issues that are not easy to solve right now can be addressed with a game that is much smoother, richer and colmplexer than the current game is, even when running on similar hardware (but I expect that you \u003Ci\u003Ereally\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0want a high-end rig for it).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nT2\u2019s agenda is unknown.

In my mind, it\u2019s much more likely that they set up an \u201CIndie\u201D label which covers various studios for a much more strategic reason: to diversify the range of games the company relies on.

And here is where the 60$ comes in. For a game that complex and performance dependent\u00A0a longer open ended development (like Early Access) is much more fitting,\u00A0but it also has less chance to become a \u0022Hit\u0022. So to me the way KSP2 is to be released feels like a marketing decision. They might still pull it off, but it will be \u0022in spite of\u0022 not \u0022thanks to\u0022 multi-platform full game release at full price.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat im trying to say is that there is a lot of design decisions that can be altered mid development at a small cost, but when the game goes live it\u0027s usually very hard to make such alterations.
