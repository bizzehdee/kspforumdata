Anyone who has a Kerbal Account will need to upgrade their existing account to a Private Division Account to access download links for previous KSP-related purchases, as the old account pages will be unavailable.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat does this mean for me?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you have a Kerbal Account, you will need to upgrade it to a Private Division Account to access previous purchases of Kerbal Space Program. You will receive an email reminder from Private Division, or you can directly visit the Private Division Account page and use your existing Kerbal Account credentials when it is live, and follow the steps outlined.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor anyone without an existing Kerbal Account, this change does not affect you, however, you can still signup for the new Private Division account for all the benefits of easily managing your Private Division titles and more. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy is the Kerbal Account being replaced?\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe release of a Private Division Account brings with it new standards for account creation and security (such as code verification) which weren\u2019t part of the Kerbal Account. We also want a wider inclusion of Private Division initiatives to live in a central location, meaning one account for everything. In addition - one of the reasons this is happening now - is the Kerbal Account uses a direct purchase store provider which is being replaced.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat new information will be requested to upgrade to a Private Division Account?\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo complete the upgrade process from a Kerbal Account to a Private Division Account we will ask for your Country, Date of Birth, and a Display Name. Your Country and Date of Birth is required for account eligibility purposes.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe will also require you to agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which have been used when making a Kerbal Account.
