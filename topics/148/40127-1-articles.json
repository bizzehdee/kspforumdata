Firstly, the board was moved to its own category to make it stand out more but more importantly we now have five sub forums for what we believe are the most active and matured foreign language communities on the forums: Russian, German, Spanish, Polish and French. To accommodate these new languages we have also recruited new moderators, so a big congratulations to UbioZur and Stupid_Chris (French), fcbayerndm and FEinchiner (German), asmi and austin4050x (Russian) and Aaraujo (Spanish). We\u0027re still contacting Polish and Spanish candidates at this time, but we would also like to thank all other applicants who took the effort to fill out the form we posted earlier. There were simply too many qualified candidates to grant each one a spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moderation team for the International forums will be lead by Olex, who has been a part of the moderation team for a long time and previously held the position of global moderator. He will be supported by other senior moderators who also speak the languages mentioned earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo once again a big congratulations to the new moderators and to Olex.
