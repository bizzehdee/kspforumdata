Even a bone stock install can creep up to over 20GB of RAM over time. Can anybody here confirm this? Or am I the only one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe safe file that gives me the hardest time is very very big though, with tons of surface stuff and more than 100 flights. Earlier leaner safes are not as bad. But still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have numbers, but it started to lag noticably after a few hours running the game, and a restart fixed it. This happened several times, and a memory leak was what I assumed to be the cause as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA bug report should probably be submitted, if it has not already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
