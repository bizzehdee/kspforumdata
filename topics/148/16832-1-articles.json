There are a few simple rules in place to provide the respect to these creative people/groups that they deserve:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first and most fundamental rule is that you \u003Cstrong\u003Emust seek permission\u003C/strong\u003E to alter someone\u0027s work, to mirror it or use it in any way other than for personal use. No permission, no editing, no mirroring, no adding to your mod pack, no editing and sharing around your private squad, none of that is acceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously we cannot unfortunately control what people do outside of these forums, however on these forums you \u003Cstrong\u003Emust \u003C/strong\u003Efollow this rule, if a person/team post a thread to share an addon/mod using content from someone else without permission and we receive a complaint then the mod thread will be closed until the issue is resolved and the forum member(s) risks being permanently banned from these forums for taking someone\u0027s work without permission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t just limited to re-using content in addons/mods/missions however, it\u0027s not acceptable to edit someone\u0027s work without permission and then to post screenshots of it on the forums (even if the edited addon/mod is purely for personal use), it\u0027s also not acceptable to edit someone\u0027s work, or use someone\u0027s work in any way that you don\u0027t have permission for and then to create videos which you post on these forums, doing any of the above without the permission of the original creators risks a permanent ban, for individuals, for whole mod teams or squads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EBioware Community Forums\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://social.bioware.com/page/site-rules\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://social.bioware.com/page/site-rules\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBioWare staff, Electronic Arts staff, official Moderators, or appointed agents reserve the right to edit or delete any content found on these sites and ban any offenders to the site rules without warning.\u003C/strong\u003E By using this site you are accepting the Site Rules and agree to follow these rules. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThere is a zero tolerance policy on any form of abuse towards staff, moderators or other Community members.\u003C/strong\u003E Content that is insulting to anyone based on gender, lifestyle, religion, ethic group, race etc. is unacceptable and will be deleted without warning.
