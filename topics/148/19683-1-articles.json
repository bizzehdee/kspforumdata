Adrian came to us and said \u0022We need a new video for our Youtube channel with the Bobak guy\u0022 and then we gathered around some ideas. There was actually a script I drafted, but it was too much for what we needed. So we ended up with a single shot at the two kerbals. The rest was the production phase, with the creation of the new set, props and animations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that answers your question\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TG_bigboss","CreatedById":24189,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-21T16:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love that video lol the are playing ksp during the mission =P god this is the first time i can access the forums in three days because of the click happy people going on with 0.17\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxMurder","CreatedById":11958,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-21T19:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis must have been the scene at Squad when .17 went live. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
