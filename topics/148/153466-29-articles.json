Squad is still currently handling development, but Squad sold ownership of KSP to Take-Two Interactive.

I think Squad shows some promise, but I\u0027m very curious to see what comes after\u00A0console and PC updates and Take-Two\u0027s first expansion to KSP.

Take-Two in my opinion is no better than Rockstar. I used to be a huge fan of them, especially in the Bioshock days. But money and greed took over, and freemium games run rampant in T2\u0027s repertoire.

One of the critical issues involved an exception error thrown when entering MiniSettings from the Pause menu, which locked up the game until it was rebooted. The other one was a bug that made the game crash/freeze after a while when the player launched several vessels into orbit around Kerbin. Once one crash occurred, more frequent crashes would follow even when not yet in orbit. In addition to those critical bugs, there were also minor fixes, including an input device issue, which prevented presets changes on horizontal movements after selecting the controller presets in the settings screen.
