Came out in 1996. Visionary game, to date the largest landmass of any open world game. Mostly randomly generated content though, kinda like No Mans Sky, really, but apparently not so excrementsty. Built around the D\u0026amp;D Role Playing System. Minimal Graphics (of course), and intended for a specific audience, namely Pen\u0026amp;Paper players who want to play something on the PC as well. A niche product, but still reasonably successfull. Introduced most of the background story to the games, and garnered some Mass-Market appeal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext came the much more well known TES III: Morrowind. Came out in 2002, and change a whole lot of things. Everything is handcrafted now, graphics are at the forefront of their time, the background story is hugely expanded, the game world itself is strange and unfamiliar, even compared to the previous games. Many things are streamlined: Less skills, not able to buy houses anymore, far fewer factions, map significantly smaller (like ... 1% the size of Daggerfall), easier controls, etc. But many things stay the same: Combat is still based on dice-rolls, as are most skill checks. Character creation stays pretty complex, learning curve is still high. You are still required to read and understand what is said to you (no voiced dialogue). Garners huge mass market appeal and praise from ciritcs and players alike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow fast forward to 2011 and Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Game-world-size is still the same, or even slightely less (depends on your metric). Graphics got a huge upgrade. Dialogue options got reduced massively, thanks to fully voiced characters. Character Creation is simplified (to the extreme, some might say). A third of the skills is axed, as are classes, attributes, meaningful background information (200 years have passed since the last game, yet there are almost no new books, for example), and first and foremost: Everything is streamlined. You are not required to read - just follow the pointer. You don\u0027t need to explore anymore, everything gets marked on your map beforehand. Equipment slots on your character are down from 15 to 9, the first thing you are introduced to is the fast travel menu, weapons don\u0027t degrade anymore, potionmaking can not fail, etc. etc. There are comprehensive lists out there. Oh, and it was developed with consoles in mind, so the UI is utter garbage as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what has all this meaningless banter to do with KSP? Well, thats really simple. When Bethesda Softworks, who develop Elder Scrolls to this day, started out, they had a vision, a goal: To create the Pen\u0026amp;Paper experience for the PC. But over the years, something changed, and that was that they were acquired by ZeniMax Media due to financial troubles. Now they got cash, allright, and they still could develop their game, but they also had to deliver. To create a game that wouldn\u0027t sell would be a serious concern. Create two in a row that don\u0027t sell, and you are out. Forever. Mind you, they at least still own the IP-Rights to the franchise. So they did the only thing they could: They changed their target audience. And naturally, they targeted the biggest audience they could. And that was not the Pen\u0026amp;Paper crowd. It was the casual, instant-gratification-but-zero-attention-span crowd. Granted, that process took some time, but it happened. Just look at Fallout 4, their latest and greatest. And the same thing will, without fail, happen to KSP. You all who proclaim \u0022We are the community\u0022, are the target audience for the game that was originally envisioned. So while the practically guaranteed KSP-2 may still please you (larger budget, much more polished, more comfortable to use, but basically the same game, with some features missing), KSP-3 will not be your game anymore. Because you are not the target audience, and TakeTwo wants to make money. Of course, they are a buisiness. They are not evil, they just do what is best for buisiness. And while you, or we, the current core community, is very vocal, because we care about the game - we are still very few. Lets say, a few tenthousands. KSP sold what, 2 million kopies? Drop of water on a hot stone. We just don\u0027t have the financial power to make the developers and publishers do what we want, not anymore at least, with a big publisher behind it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd please, don\u0027t buy into that \u0022KSP development remains independent from TakeTwo\u0022 talk. It can\u0027t be, since T2 owns the property now, and they decide what to fund. Oh, and another point. Yes, ElderScrolls is extremely modable, and mod friendly. Some even go so far as to say that the base game is purposefully bad, because \u0022Mods will fix it\u0022. But mods can\u0027t fix everything. Let\u0027s say, for example, the Aeromodel is not modable in a future KSP release. Out the window go all the better athmosphere or realism mods. Or that you can\u0027t add planets anymore - because those are a paid feature of an expansion pack. The possibilities for limitations are endless. And you have to realize, that it does not matter to TakeTwo what kind of game KSP is, just how well it sells. If it were a tree growing simulator, where you just watch trees grow in real time, but half the planets population buys this - T2 does not care - even if the vocal minority is begging for features like \u0022Let us choose which trees to grow!!\u0022 and the old guard is whining all day about missing features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo no, in the long term, I don\u0027t like this at all, because I can see where it is going already. Maybe I am wrong, I sure do hope so. Maybe there is enough of a niche-market, like there is for the Paradox Grand Strategy Titles, which still make a profit, mainly due to very pricey add-ons. Europa Universalis with all addons costs about 150$ right now. Maybe TakeTwo is going that route. Or they focus on the \u0022fun\u0022 and \u0022child friendly\u0022 aspects of the game: Plushy Kerbals with big eyes, they are so cute, after all. Then it becomes the next Spore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I am done, lets just hope for the best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*There is one well known and financially successful exception to this rule, which is the Dark Souls franchise, which is entirely built around high difficulty and a steep lerning curve. I am excluding multiplayer games that are built solely for competitive play here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raven Industries","CreatedById":159877,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-02T17:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223077706\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022161355\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221496423389\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259415\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John FX\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, John FX said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would buy that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEh, it sounds pretentious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-02T17:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223077706\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022161355\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221496423389\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259415\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John FX\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, John FX said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would buy that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet Firaxis to make it?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSid Meier\u0027s Kerbal Space \u003Cs\u003EPirates!\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0Program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-02T17:23:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2017 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Orionkermin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-02T17:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMmmm.....after reading every comment in this thread I see both sides of the coin however where I was not bothered before I\u0027m starting to feel the end of KSP as we know it is soon approaching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe this is a bad thing...maybe a good thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me though Im starting to feel that maybe I should stop here at 1.2.2 before things change too much away from where we are right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSOOO many mods already that I haven\u0027t used or experienced will give me years of enjoyment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill be watching closely but I\u0027m not prepared to give my favourite toy to someone else to play with right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
