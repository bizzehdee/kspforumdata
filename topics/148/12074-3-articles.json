Hoping to get some more guides up soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also sent the following e-mail to Eurogamer, one of my favourite gaming websites in the hope that they\\\u0027ll pick up the story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst and foremost - I\\\u0027ve been a long time reader of your excellent site. There have been quite a few games that have been featured on your site (particularly from the indie genre) that I\\\u0027ve been subsequently drawn into because of your coverage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\\\u0027d like to return the favour and introduce you to the gem that is Kerbal Space Program or KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs gaming is your bread and butter you may very well have come across it already. I\\\u0027m writing to you just in case you haven\\\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat awaits you is probably the most addictive sandbox game I\\\u0027ve ever played and it\\\u0027s still in alpha development. Without going into great detail the basic premise for the game as it stands is to build space shuttles and rockets from a set parts bin. The game is built on the Unity engine and uses PhysX to calculate forces on each individual part. Just snap them together in the hangar, be they wings, jet engines, rocket engines, parachutes et cetera and away you go. Hit the \\\u0027Launch\\\u0027 button and you\\\u0027re taken to either the runway or launch pad for the start of your \\\u0027mission\\\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve never seen such scale in a video game. The planet you launch from is 600km in radius, it\\\u0027s moon orbits 11,400km away and the whole lot orbits a star 13million km distant. And it\\\u0027s all accessible to you and your creations - provided you can build a stable ship and have a basic understanding of how orbits work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game\\\u0027s developers (some guys from Mexico called Squad) have tried to make the game as accessible as possible to the masses. Despite the underlying orbital mechanics involved the dev\\\u0027s goal is to provide the player with the visual aids necessary to reach space without any complex maths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve been following it\\\u0027s development for nearly a year now and since then feature after feature after feature has been added, with more on the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to my passion for the game, and my hopes of seeing its community grow I implore you to at least take a look at this incredible game and possibly even do a review or feature on it. It needs to be in the spotlight! I would like to point out that I am in no way affiliated with Squad or any of it\\\u0027s developmental team so I don\\\u0027t really stand to gain anything from your coverage.
