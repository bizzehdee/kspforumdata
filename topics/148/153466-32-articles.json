We failed to properly test it before release, and as a result we had to re-port the game from scratch which took a year and a half, longer than originally\u00A0expected. We took our time on the re-port because we wanted to give our fans on console\u00A0the best\u00A0experience of KSP possible, and we wanted it to be perfect. We hope you enjoy the newly re-ported version of KSP. As a show of good faith, everyone who previously bought KSP on console will get a discount on a future game. We will use this mistake to better our games and\u00A0oursevles as a company.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitely not a perfect apology, but you get the idea. I already\u00A0knew neither will probably\u00A0happen, but its the only way I\u0027d forgive Squad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it was a cash grab, maybe FTE gave them their build and Squad releaseed it as a finished product after successfully building and launching a rocket or two, maybe they used some kind of inaccurate\u00A0emulator to test the console version, or maybe due to some impossible miracle they did properly test it and no bugs were found. Whatever the reason, Squad is at fault, and this is why I would like a detailed explanation, however that is very unlikely to happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake Two is the parent company of Rockstar, and Rockstar made Grand Theft Auto V. I have had countless glitches happen in Grand Theft Auto Online and I have always been properly compensated by Rockstar for those glitches, like when my Adder vanished they gave me the money to buy and customize a new one, plus a little extra for the inconvenience. That is why I believe Take Two will allow compensation. I understand Take Two isn\u0027t the perfect company, but they did allow compensation. I also understand Rockstar getting greedy with shark cards, so no reason to point that out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love companies that take their time to perfect a game, even pushing back the release date to do so, like Rockstar. However, KSP on console was far from perfect. I understand\u00A0the thousands of lines of code make it difficult to port a game, but still, they should have taken their time and pushed back the release date to begin with. Unfortunately they can not do that now as it\u0027s too late, so an apology and compensation will have to suffice, even if that compensation is just as simple as a console exclusive feature. (yes I know mods can allow any feature on PC)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-24T21:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223202653\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153466\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221508878027\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168295\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jeremiah\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, Jeremiah said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why I hate going on forums, people are so quick to shoot down your ideas without even thinking, even if they don\u0027t know what they\u0027re talking about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing\u00A0I read from their\u00A0responses sounded like they didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.
