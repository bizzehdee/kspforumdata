(The site was sold to a new owner and I resigned shortly after the turnover for several reasons.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn active user requested that she open up an RP thread. We made the (mistaken) choice of allowing her to do so. It started off simple enough. However, eventually, things got out of hand. The thread had rules that some were starting to not follow or were VERY lax about. (A core tenant being you may not RP another user\u0026#39;s char for them in any manner. Another was to actually READ the thread to get a grasp of the event before just jumping in willy-nilly.) It got to the point I had to get involved myself and reset the roleplay and kick some users. We eventually just killed the thread and made \u0022NO RP\u0022 standard on the site. Playing around was fine, but nothing long term, in-depth, or dedicated.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom that experience, what I can say is that with RPing, some people CAN NOT distinguish between reality and the RP. The line between \u0022personal\u0022 and \u0022role\u0022 gets blurred. One user I recall went nuts during the whole event because the time they invested was deem a \u0022waste of time\u0022 because of the reset. Could things have been dealt with better? Perhaps. I don\u0026#39;t see that worth the effort though, not on a site where staff have far better and bigger issues to deal with. (It was an imageboard.) You know it\u0026#39;s a bad time when some users state they came to the site for the Role Play instead of the site\u0026#39;s main purpose: showing off artwork.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRoleplaying has its time and place. I personally don\u0026#39;t think it should be done on any site/community that has a clear intent and purpose that isn\u0026#39;t RPing in the first place. SQUAD have better things to do than trying to diffuse community conflict brought about because of fiction-induced friction between members (or groups thereof). If you want to roleplay, go (or start) some place where that is the core focus, not here where the focus is on feedback and additions to make a good game greater. A work today is defined by both the work itself and the community built around it. You can have the greatest masterpiece, but if the community around it is trash, not many will want to touch it. (\u0022Guilty by association\u0022.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, with Roleplay, the thing about it I noticed is that people don\u0026#39;t know when to stop and it starts to seep. Some start to take RP events and actions as personal and it clouds their judgement. It\u0026#39;s a stupid and horrible experience. It\u0026#39;s not worth it, not here.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T01:59:02Z","Content":"\nI have a question about the soon-to-be-gone Rocket Builders forum. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs you can see in my sig, I have a currently dummy logo for \u0022AddictionAeroworks\u0022 my name for my craft repository, I would post any craft I make there, and take requests.
