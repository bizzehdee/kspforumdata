Like you aero I got bored of the constant crashing and reverted to buying on steam on my old gaming laptop. I personally really prefer KSP on console, but it was never ever designed for it. KSP 2 will undoubtedly be a better game I disagree with the earlier comments here. But what we need to realise is that the dev team on ps4 enhanced edition is a skeleton crew and likely will get our update but by the time KSP2 is on early access on PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIve done a fair amount of logging bugs, never got any official responses and tracking the issues on the game and even gave the Devs access to this tracker. I suggested I would be happy to install monitoring for them if they wanted and no response.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve come to the conclusion that there is a point in any career where the game simply gives up. If you start a new career it is highly likely you will get 5 hours gameplay without a single crash. The official support narrative was to flash my ps4 and reinstall everything, and I did that .. started my old save (yes I worked out how to get it saved to a usb stick) and still got the same crash frequency. I then started a new career and played it until about level 4 on the tech tree, i.e about the time of visiting eve and jool with small probes... And this is when I believe you start seeing problems start. I destroyed all my asteroid mappers in the off chance it was this causing the crashes when switching to the map, alas no dice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe support guys frankly weren\u0027t interested, and said that they themselves play the game fine without issue. So, as had been suggested I believe there is a common similarity with those of us that get the issues and those that don\u0027t. So, if those that don\u0027t get the issues are in long careers past level 4 and have presence around several kerbol bodies then the only possiblity comes down to a technical difference between our consoles. Fyi... It should be noted that there has been next to no reports of issues on the Xbox... Which kinda validates the conclusion.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027m going to suggest that we all share our ps4 stats, I believe that older ps4 PRO models may be the centre of the problem... That\u0027s my hunch. I\u0027ll document them all if we can all share?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be noted that irrespective of the update coming, this game is and has been simply brilliant, I am excited for KSP 2 as it has been developed in a much more controlled way and looks so good. Let\u0027s face it KSP was only ever a bit of a throw of mud at the wall to see what stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELastly, as this issue is highly likely to be hardware based we must appreciate there will be no amount of updates that the development team could do to remove the problem.
