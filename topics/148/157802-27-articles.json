You could also bring your ships for repairs and upgrades. The ships will gain reputation or reliability points the way Kerbals earn experience points. Ships will no longer be thrown away, but either dismantled for parts or upgraded. Upgraded, higher grade ships will allow for better exploration and science gathering, have better specs, features and will be tougher.

If you were managing a space program that had LEO assets, cismunar assets, etc, and you needed routine resupply, you should be able to schedule them, and they just happen, not have to install one mod\u00A0(\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E) to remind you to do it, then another mod (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E) to do part of the resupply. Minus autonomy at some level, there is no management aspect to KSP, just micromanagement (the player does everything). or, for example, if I wanted to do a SpaceX-like booster recovery. I can fly the booster, or fly the stage 2, but not both. With autonomy, I could do both (because Jeb could fly S2 to station rendezvous himself).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, right now, the player is tied up 100% to whatever it is he or she is doing. Landing a mission on the Mun? Everything else has to wait. Doing a 30 minutes burn, can\u0027t do anything else. This is one of the things that turns me off from doing actual missions in KSP. It just feels awkward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAspects of the game need to be automated and the player should be able to schedule things while doing other stuff. Although, I\u0027m not the one to ask for multiplayer as I don\u0027t have any friends or family who play games so I play alone, but this could also be a perfect reason to implement multiplayer. I read these forums often and it\u0027s incredible what people do with this game. Some do sharks and submarines, some do tanks, some do balloons. Imagine if a group of people with diverse skills and interests got together to play a KSP game: one can manage, one can engineer things, one can fly far-out missions while another would focus on orbital stuff, such as maintaining the space stations or labs, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think Squad has a gold mine on their hands. If they do this right KSP2 could be the greatest game of all times. There interest in space games is coming back. Just please don\u0027t make KSP2 something like Elite Dangerous: huge and empty. KSP2 should remain at its core a non-fighting game focused on building and flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe I\u0027d even hook up with people and do multiplayer?
