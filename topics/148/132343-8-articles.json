I don\u0027t think this discussion is helpful at all, we all have our preference, and we\u0027ve seen Squad\u0027s stance on this and frankly they are right to stick to whatever official solution they want, we can\u0027t/shouldn\u0027t expect more of them or pressure them on that front, IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat we \u003Cstrong\u003Eshould\u003C/strong\u003E expect though, and put pressure about it on Squad if necessary, is the official KSP website\u002Bforum to visibly acknowledge the existence of alternative mod repositories, or, as Hotaru suggested, at least the largest/most popular one. I strongly disagree with the notion that it would be \u0022too much effort\u0022 to maintain such a link. It really is a simple task. Besides, the community can always help point out where to go for mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason this is actually important is because the majority of KSP players, especially new ones, will only find the Curse site now.

That is lack of proper communication between SQUAD, moders, regular users and mod hosting sites. Don\u0027t get me wrong, SQUAD already doing much more than most of other companies. I\u0027m happy to see that some of moders become regular staff. Probably there is no better worker than those that already showed their passion to KSP project.

Most valuable asset in KSP project is not SQUAD as company or developers of KSP, it is this community. In most of aspects KSP is pioneer. There is no other game that have provided so much fun and it is educative at the same time. Also there is no project that have gathered such community like that have gathered around KSP. That means you can\u0027t just copy-paste dealing with community like other companies deals, SQUAD need to be pioneer in this area too.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeaning, from SQUAD side, you should not wait for something to happen and react to it, you should be more proactive and try to help where help is needed before something bad happens. From moder side, if you fall in some kind of trouble that prevents you to continue work on mod, don\u0027t hesitate to ask for help, whatever you need help with, this community have already proove that you will get help in one way or
