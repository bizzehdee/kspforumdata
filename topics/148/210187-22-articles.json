It just created a tense environment on the forums where every argument is dismissed as speculation, where there are no promises made because of fear of not delivering. Not to mention the \u0022may or may not exist\u0022 aspect of the internal betting board in the Intercept offices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s the actual point of Early Access if everything is already decided upon or implemented? Bugfixing. So then if we strongly disagree with a way a feature is implemented, when can we give our feedback? Only during EA? Because I feel there\u0027s been a lot of interesting conversations and I don\u0027t see how they have informed the decision making process of the dev team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow can the game ask for community feedback only during Early Access if in reality the feedback had been continuous for years without anyone at Intercept talking about the actual implementation of the systems? Example: how will the delivery routes system be implemented? Will we see automated flights and driving or will it be just a resource bump from time to time?

As much as we\u0027ve been allowed to look into their processes and so on, does it really feel any different to 2019? I\u0027m against rushing, but it feels like an absolutely sluggish pace.

When it launches in EA next year it will be about 5 years of development, and like sweatbox this announcement gives me substantial pause in regards to the state of the game. What happened with KSP1 is irrelevant in this discussion in my opinion. The context of the previous communications over the past 3 years including the last delay announcement\u0027s phrasing appeared to set an expectation of delivering a feature complete game at launch. This announcement not only is a radical departure from that tone, it also lacks any indication as to the state of the roadmap features or any target/expectation of cadence for when they will be added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the \u0022just getting each feature finished and \u0022polished\u0022 enough to enable for users \u2014 not starting on each feature from the beginning.\u0022 when in context to the stated rational for early access just doesn\u0027t pass the sniff test. If you\u0027re at the point of \u0022polishing\u0022 those features then the \u0022getting users feedback on the core experience\u0022 is meaningless because it is not going to substantially change a nearly complete feature that is \u0022just getting each feature finished and \u0022polished\u0022 enough to enable for users\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also been very optimistic and looked forward to when KSP2 would launch. This announcement however seems like it came from a completely different direction when compared to the last 3 years of communications, and as such it gives me the feeling that Private Division had kicked the can as far down the road as they could and Take Two ran thin on patience and gave Private Division an ultimatum to either start generating revenue or cancel the project. I will check it out when it hits early access launch like I\u0027ve said before, however, given the context of things I will very likely refund it and wait until there is at least most of the expected features and an established cadence of how quickly they are delivering the features on the roadmap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, this is exactly how I feel. The launch of EA sounds like they were given an ultimatum to start generating revenue for the project, at least when coupled with the apparent progress of the game up to this point along with the history of this game regarding changing studios and potential mismanagement.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is what we need for the project to have continued support, and the missing features come in a reasonable amount of time after this release, then I\u0027ll be fairly satisfied.

After a wave of bug fixes and the like in the first month or two we\u0027ll start to see the first roadmap features come along 5-ish months after release minimum. The full game will probably be out by early 2025 at the earliest.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow as a massive KSP fan I\u0027ll be buying into this thing no matter what (something I\u0027ve never done before, and probably shouldn\u0027t do but eh) because, well, 1) it\u0027s KSP 2, and more importantly 2) I believe that in the long term KSP 2 has a decent shot of being lightyears ahead of KSP 1 in gameplay, scope, potential for growth, and most importantly, performance, once everything is ironed out. Release however?

Overall I am very hopeful and don\u2019t want to come of as negative but as release gets closer and closer I find myself getting less and less excited as I know it will be very similar to KSP and what we can achieve in there. The new pieces will certainly be fun to play with but for how long? Especially without any incentive or ability to progress? I fear we will see all the new stuff there is to see until interstellar travel. Personally I really hope for quick updates, hopefully outpacing player exploration so we can start growing a list of objectives or destinations we are excited to reach rather than a list of things we are waiting for.
