Despite not giving a specific date, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re all way too smart and had a correct hunch for the day we had in mind. Your levels of hype practically matched all of ours within the company for wanting to bring the update to you yesterday. Unfortunately, the devs ended up hitting a snag that stemmed from a Unity update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue itself is minor, but bothersome enough to your experience to make sure it gets squashed before sending an update out into the world. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re as disappointed as you are that expectations weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t met, but the good news is that you won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be in for as long of a wait this time. As we speak, the devs are on the cusp of smoothing out the issue. From there, that means one last experimental build to test. If nothing breaks (knock on wood), we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be issuing a release candidate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite things looking good right now, you still never know what can happen from build to build and won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t release the update until it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fully ready to go. What this means for some of you is that you can lay off the F5 for a bit. Really. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ok\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.see? There. Feels good, doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t it? When it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ready, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll announce it on all of our usual haunts and you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll know right away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
