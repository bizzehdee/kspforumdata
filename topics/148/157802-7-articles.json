So I have no issue with them replacing Contract Configurator, because it\u0027s clunky for in-experienced creators, but putting it behind a pay-wall is what gets me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, KSP has given me more value than any other game ever, at I think 2500 hours, that means I paid half of a penny for every hour I\u0027ve spent in this game. 1.2 does feel like a definitive \u0022finished version\u0022 of the game, but, I would of liked to see this in an update, and not an expansion, I see it separating the community in a way due to custom contracts being behind a paywall. Would that mean a player with the DLC would be able to make and play contracts, but the DLC-less player wouldn\u0027t be able to make or play? Or would they be able to just play? The way they explain the effects of the expansion is abstract. Would it give more to modders at the cost of splitting the community between DLC and DLC-less players?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, the corporate machine runs on funds, and KSP probably isn\u0027t getting any more, it\u0027s a game past it\u0027s release by, a good year or two now, and I\u0027d take a guess that income is drooping. It\u0027s either make an update that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emight\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eget more people to buy the game, or make the fabled expansion packs. And I respect that decision, because it was either this, or hope the modding community can keep the game afloat with no income for the company. So as much as I can sit and whine about this expansion pack not being a free update, I think for the 15 dollars I paid for this game, I got 15 free updates. That\u0027s 1 dollar per update. So paying, say, 5 dollars for an expansion pack after all this time\u00A0is totally fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the critical hand though, I can\u0027t stop thinking about these new parts, they\u0027ll be Squad made, yes, but we have a good few, massive part packs that probably add the same parts, give or take art style.

I think most people will agree with my definition of finished - the devs have fulfilled all their promises, and there are no (or few) game-breaking bugs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as KSP is built on Unity, the latter is not always in control of the Devs. Some things are beyond what they can manipulate, and that is understandable. But the first point still stands - the devs should fulfill their previous promises before moving on. Promises like the sorely-needed part revamp for older parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: I\u0027m down for DLCs, the devs need money, but this is not the way to do\u00A0it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-17T18:29:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2017 06:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by minepagan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boborene","CreatedById":136245,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T18:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222988165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157802\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221489754009\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002299637\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Woodstar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Woodstar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP finally succumbed to the DLC virus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI must agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T18:30:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222988641\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157802\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221489774674\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002296644\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Malah\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, Malah said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents ipsClearfix\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA mod developed for stock KSP will work for KSP with the extensions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission Builder will be based on the work done for the tutorial?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cooly568","CreatedById":17763,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T18:32:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222988652\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157802\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221489775429\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022114736\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JPLRepo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, JPLRepo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(251,251,251);float:none;\u0022\u003EA mod developed for stock KSP will work for KSP with the extensions?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay that\u0027s good to hear.
