These changes will likely not affect you, apart from the change to the signature rules. We\u0027ve added a new category about account security with two rules: all users are considered to be responsible for the security of their own account, and only one person may use an account and only one account on the forums. We\u0027ve also added back the rule that outlaws topics that ask for release dates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most notable change is that the signature limits have been relaxed a little: the maximum signature height has been increased from 80 pixels to 120 pixels. Together with this change we\u0027ve modified the forum so that any signature that exceeds this limit is automatically cut off. Note that the maximum height includes both images and text.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the forum rules are now known as the community rules, because parts of them also apply to other parts of the community, such as the IRC channel and KSP-TV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
