This fixes the hop when retracting landing legs.\n* Added tweakable that allows player to specify whether his wheels deploy while shielded in a cargo bay.\n* Fix landing legs being exported to the wrong collision layer.\n* Wheel gravity is now properly handled in a standard manner, which should fix a good deal of instability.\n* Fix EVA kerbals blowing up wheels on contact. They now go through them.\n* Fixed landing legs teleporting from a semi-deployed state to a semi-retracted state when retracted.\n* Wheel damage does not process damage for two seconds after a vessel loads, prevents spontaneous explosions.\n* Suspension colliders are no longer disabled for 0.5 seconds upon retract, causing them to fall through the ground momenarily, blowing up your engines.\n* Deployable landing gear and legs now have deployment sounds.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BCommunications Networks\n* Additional functionality and gameplay components to the Antenna and Probe parts through a series of distinct but related mechanics. When CommNet is enabled, probes will require a connection back to Kerbin or to a control point to have full control, and crewed vessels lacking pilots will have slightly limited control without such a connection. Relays can extend the range of such connections and bounce signals around planets and moons that would otherwise occlude. Science transmission receives a bonus for high signal strength. New antenna parts allow building complex networks, which can be visualized in map view. See KSPedia for more details.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BKerbNet\n* Added KerbNet, which allows the player to see terrain under their satellite, and place custom waypoints with a targeting interface. Allows the player to see biomes and anomalies at higher levels. Scan field of view for KerbNet varies by part and smoothly changes between surface altitude and orbital altitude.\n* KerbNet allows all probes and labs manned by a scientist to map as long as they have a communications network connection that eventually bounces to Kerbin.\n* Gave KerbNet visibility modes to hide some of the interface around the map.\n* Gave KerbNet auto-refresh settings to allow it to refresh without player intervention.\n* Gave KerbNet enhanced mode, which activates on some vessels such as rovers to give them better sensors in certain situations.\n* Add game option that allows KerbNet to either orient to the orbit normal, preventing flipping when passing over the poles, or to orient to north, which is less disorienting for some players.\n* Many aspects of KerbNet given flavor and fluff. Scanning a sun results in yellow and white noise, scanning a gas giant is similar except hued based on that planet. Stars and scan static can appear in the background past the horizon of a scan.\n* Resources can specify a scientific abbreviation. Utilized in KerbNet for the mode icon.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BDebug Window\n* Completely overhauled the debug window to utilize new Unity GUI.\n* New debug console has syntax highlighting that highlights classes with persistent pastel colors if they bracket their names. [Bracket] your class names in debug logs modders.\n* New debug console has command input support which is moddable, type /help for a full listing of commands, and what they do.\n* Added new debug screen for creating kerbals with specific names, genders, skills, levels, and classes.\n* Debug options for displaying errors/exceptions as screen messages.\n* Added set orbit debug cheat screen.\n* Added rendezvous controls to set orbit debug cheat screen.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BOrbits\n* All anomalies (ObT, mean anomaly, eccentric anomaly, true anomaly) are now consistently negative when approaching the periapsis for both elliptical and hyperbolic trajectories (previously, only hyperbolic trajectories used negative anomalies). This means that eccentric anomaly and true anomaly are now in the range -pi..pi instead of 0..2pi for elliptical trajectories.\n* Reference frames instead of quaternions are used for calculating orbital position and velocity, leading to increased speed when rendering patched conics.\n* Improved precision in orbit calculations.\n* Rewrote orbit targeting / closest approach finding.\n* Fixed issues where objects jump when going on and off rails.\n* Fix target orientation markers when the target is on rails.\n* Refactored such that orbital position and velocity and vessel position and velocity are correct for the FixedUpdate cycle.\n* Made target relative velocity work for celestial bodies.\n* Trajectories that re-encounter a body just escaped are now detected.\n* Trajectories that encounter two bodies now correctly show the first encounter even if it is further out (eg, Mun stealing a Minmus encounter).\n* Elliptical encounter trajectories no longer flicker.\n* Conic patch settings (draw mode and limit) are now exposed in the Video Settings.\n* Added game option for legacy orbit targeting.\n* Map node labels space themselves out nicely when cluttered.\n* Targeting info for moons in other SoIs now works.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BContracts\n* Contracts are now also weighted by celestial body, so if the player starts declining contracts to Jool, they will see them less often.\n* Contracts now keep track of if they have been viewed. There are three states: unseen, seen but not clicked, and clicked and read.\n* Contract weighting now applies negative weight if a contract has been viewed when it expires.\n* Exploration contracts now always appear in Mission Control if there is not one currently available.\n* Explore contracts overhauled, they now utilize the same logic World Firsts used to use to select a \u0022package\u0022 of related objectives. They can appear multiple times per planet now, and should have a much more logical progression than they used to.\n* Exploration contract progression slowed slightly, now requires science on a planet before allowing a fly by of the next one. Also, in the early game, return from orbit and return from fly by are required before advancing on the Muns of the homeworld.\n* Removed old single objective World First contracts, other than the initial four.\n* Waypoint captions for survey contracts now state the altitude band of each waypoint.\n* Fix contract orbits not cleaning up properly when their contracts are cancelled as opposed to completed.\n* Grand tour contracts now require a new vessel to complete, so they cannot be cheesed by keeping one around that has seen every planet.\n* Fix contextual surveys not properly bouncing the navigation waypoint.\n* Asteroid recovery objective reworded and given a note for clarity.\n* Asteroid side objectives in facility construction contracts will now not appear unless the same requirements for asteroid recovery contracts to appear are met.\n* Crew transfer progress tracking objective reworded to make it clear that it does not need to utilize existing crew.\n* Reworded objective to hold above a waypoint in stationary orbit contracts for clarity.\n* If Kerbal G limits are enabled, tourists can either require going unconscious or require not going unconscious during the trip. Check the parameter details!\n* Adjusted Exploration contract flavor text to work better in multi-objective scenarios.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BBiomes\n* Biomes for many bodies have been redesigned for clarity, beauty, and utility. And we\u0027ve hidden a few extra surprises around as well!\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BEaster Eggs\n* Added hidden fun stuff to almost every planet.\n* Mohole given an empty PQSCity, which allows it to appear in KerbNet.\n* Gave many easter eggs colliders.\n* Fix Duna\u0027s SSTV not playing.\n* Unburied Duna\u0027s MSL.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BOther Work\n* Advanced Tweakables option in Gameplay Settings. With it off, some advanced features are hidden. Defaults off.\n* Autostrutting available for all parts (AT).\n* Autostruts can be gated behind a technology in career and science mode defined in Physics.cfg, by default it is the same technology regular struts are on.\n* Add grandparent mode to auto-struts.\n* Parachutes can have automatic holding of deployment until safe (AT).\n* Actuation toggles now affect symmetry counterparts in editor (some other \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/gimbal bits do too). Also hidden under Advanced Tweakables (AT).\n* Utilize HSV color space in more locations.\n* Quadrupled the amount of loading screen messages. You know, the important stuff.\n* Loads of new options in the difficulty settings.\n* Science data can be transferred by the part-part transfer mechanic (for certain probe cores).\n* Added physics easing for when landed/splashed vessels come off rails.\n* Certain probe cores (and the new science container part) can transfer data with no EVA required.\n* There is an additional drag curve whose function is to raise drag coefficient to a power based on the mach number. This leads to blunter things having (relatively) more drag supersonic than they did and pointier things having (relatively) less than they did. Pods will slow down better on steep reentries and planes will produce drag in better proportion to how streamlined they are (less overpowered airplane drag).\n* Fairings now include support for placing multiple payloads in them (and showing trusses for said payloads).\n* Tourist contracts work better with the Kerbal Gee Tolerance option.\n* Add a small negative contract weight for contracts that are read but not accepted.\n* Existing resource narrow band scanner ported to KerbNet interface, allowing it to zoom, among other things.\n* Removed biome readout information and flag rendering on narrow band scanner.\n* Added ellipsis to many text labels and fields, to prevent overflow while looking nice.\n* Input keys in the settings screen automatically expand with screen resolution.\n* Default parachute deployment mode set to \u0022when safe\u0022 - players everywhere rejoice.\n* All tooltips cooked to a nice golden color.\n* Added Viewmatic Survey Satellite stock relay craft.\n* Added /b4d455 command, which starts a game off with basically everything.\n* Background ambiance in the space center scene now fades smoothly between birds by day and crickets by night.\n* Background ambiance in the space center scene now fades out when at max time warp.\n* Background ambiance in general no longer always starts at zero, it randomly seeks when the scene loads. Hence, loading a game no longer immediately plays the exact same bird trill.\n* Most stock planes given a look over based on player feedback.\n* Added editor part categories for ground, electrical, communication, thermal, payload, and coupling parts.\n* Screen message text given much higher visibility.\n* Facilities in the space center now have verbose context menus in sandbox mode, allowing you to see their upgrades. They always show the maximum level of upgrades.\n* \u0022Require Complete\u0022 on antennae is now persistent and its state is saved.\n* Added community contest winner kerbal and unique waypoint names.\n* Camera can now be pointed at parts, not just vessel center of mass.\n* Added Plane and Relay vessel types/icons.\n* Airbrakes now have deployment limits.\n* Rebalance fairing panel mass downwards slightly.\n* Difficulty options for limiting part pressure and G-force tolerance.\n* Difficulty option for kerbal G-force tolerance. Kerbals go unconscious if their tolerance is exceeded.\n* Slight performance tweaks to some early 1.25m engines.\n* Swap around some early science parts in the tech tree.\n* Redid Eve\u0027s atmospheric pressure curve to smooth it out and remove errors. Eve\u0027s atmosphere thins out much faster now, so the high atmosphere is thinner. Also tweaked Jool\u0027s atmosphere so it rapidly goes from 15 atmospheres to 50 in the last few kilometers to achieve crushing pressures.\n* Can right-click on icons in the staging list to trigger the Part Action Window.\n* Support Rigid Attachment (non-bendy) option for part joints in cfg and in the PAW.\n* Added an \u0022Action Groups Always Allowed\u0022 advanced difficulty option.\n* Add 0.625m heat shield.\n* Lift from capsules and heat shields better handled to make lifting reentries better (easier).\n* Restructured in-flight pause menu to better show all options.\n* Don\u0027t lock all controls when using Warp To, only some.\n* Fix terrain vanishing at 1000m depth.\n* Allow targeting of close vessels by double-clicking.\n* Angle the canopies of parachutes in symmetry away from each other.\n* Resource transfer rate when transferring between parts now based on ingame time (taking warp into account) not realtime.\n* Fix issues with TR-2L stats.\n* Show tooltips on kerbal portraits.\n* Fix scientist skill text.\n* Fix issue with ladders not being re-grab-able if you board a seat, retract a ladder, leave the seat, then extend the ladder.\n* Update maneuver node patches (for targeting) when the vessel target changes.\n* The runway lights now follow the day/night cycle.\n* Moved a low tech wheel to a lower tech tier.\n* Moved an atmospheric sensor down to the science tech branch.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BMisc Fixes and Changes\n* Fixed issue where disabled \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E would enable during staging. Mods need to set stagingEnabled=False in their ModuleRCS blocks (unless they want staging on).\n* Catch exceptions during part loading so the loading process doesn\u0027t come to a halt.\n* Fix some issues with decouple modules, allow specifying the ejection force vector.\n* Try/catch the other PartModule update loops so one bad module doesn\u0027t interrupt others.\n* Don\u0027t try to set constant KSPFields.\n* Null check when getting resource mass on unloaded vessels with removed resources.\n* Remove some debug spam when querying Science Subjects by ID.\n* Fix Resource Display to show all resources correctly.\n* Improve launch clamp stability on revert.\n* Fix an issue with ModuleTripLogger not applying to kerbals in non-root parts.\n* Ablative shields with Ablator tweaked down in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E no longer show up pre-scorched in flight.\n* Ablative shields no longer show solid black when reaching zero ablator.\n* Fix serious regression with flow multipliers in ModuleEnginesFX.\n* Fix a wrong rotation in Moment of Intertia calculations.\n* Correct stock temperature gauges to use gauge threshold.\n* Fixed currency symbols not displaying properly when UI scale is changed by using inline Text Mesh Pro sprites.\n* Probe cores now have a hibernate feature which offers only partial control when activated but draws much less electricity. Can be set to automatically hibernate in warp (advanced tweakable).\n* Added a game setting for default throttle (rather than keeping it in Physics.cfg).\n* Fix bug where space center view can be messed up on loading a save from the main menu if the game was switched away from during load (old workaround was clear the input locks).\n* Renamed Science Tech to Scanning Tech since that\u0027s what it\u0027s for.\n* Fixed where CoPOffset and CoLOffset had CoMOffset added to them during application.\n* Fixed where an exception during loading of parts would stop the game loading.\n* IVA navball works like normal navball (vectors hidden when velocity is too small, radial and normal cues show only in Orbit mode).\n* Fix an issue where prop requirement met (on engine menus) was not being intuitively correct. See note in Moddability, below, for how to update jet parts.\n* Fix kerbals sliding on ladders.\n* For EVA kerbals, \u0027\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027 light shows whether the kerbal will reorient when a translate key is pressed (as set in Input Settings). T toggles this behavior when in EVA mode.\n* Several dialogs (such as quicksave) now accept Escape and Enter keys for dismissing or accepting contents. Science reports accept Tab to cycle messages.\n* Quicksave and Quickload hotkeys (F5/F9) work in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E view.\n* The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E part search tool now clears when pressing Escape.\n* Crossfeed toggle module can now require a technology researched to enable itself. Radial decouplers now cannot toggle crossfeed until Fuel Systems.\n* Fixed loader info in saves to not contaminate a stock save if you load a modded save while playing pure stock.\n* Can toggle whether navball hides going into map view.\n* Can now use antenna\u0027s Start Transmission action in control groups.\n* Added ability to register credit for Kerbal experience gains in the MPL\n* When a Kerbal plants a flag, credit is given to all landed/splashed Kerbals in physics range.  Prevents the need to have flag-planting parties with large crews.\n* Made celestial bodies rotate in the R\u0026amp;D archives again\n* Updated in flight Pause Menu to include Load, Save and Exit options\n* Updated in flight quickloads to show more detailed load dialog\n* Fix CBAttributeMapSO (biome detection) to use only nearby biomes as candidates, not all biomes.\n* Fix for vessels not retaining targets on quickload\n* Fix for targeting hanging up in limbo state when reverting to launch\n* Fix for losing targeting when switching vessels (such as when docking)\n* Targeting properly restores for individual parts (i.e. docking ports) during quickload and vessel switching\n* Fix for Tracking station list deselcting active vessel on list changes\n* Fix for Map filter hiding the current and/or targetted vessel\n* Fix an issue with stars fading in/out instantly.\n* Add lift and drag displays back to wings/control surfaces.\n* Fix some EVA state issues not updating correctly, leading to kerbals getting stuck \u0027floating\u0027.\n* Retractable landing gear produce less drag than they used to when retracted and much more when extended.\n* Enable staging toggling on fairings.\n* Fix ModuleSAS in standalone mode using real time not game time for resource requests.\n* Properly format facility name in editor exit dialog.\n* Stopping near things no longer keeps EVA interaction messages open in map.\n* Corrected usage of the word \u0022topology\u0022 in ScienceDefs.\n* Settings screen does not actually set the resolution unless the resolution actually changes.\n* Mark 2 docking port given the same tooltips as other docking ports.\n* World First speed, distance, and altitude records can no longer be set while in a prelaunch state.\n* Fix engineer report entries not updating when their icons change.\n* Fix Skywinder stock vessel having no description.\n* Fix typos in stock \u0022SatelliteLauncher\u0022 craft file.\n* Fix early game progression cheat not unlocking the science progress node.\n* Manufacturer added to mystery goo.\n* Part search now splits search terms on dashes, fixing searches for several engine designations, and things like \u0022Convert-O-Tron\u0022.\n* Version text made more visible in experimental builds.\n* Using curly braces in a vessel name no longer obliterates the universe.\n* Resource scanners now show \u00220%\u0022 rather than \u0022Unknown\u0022 if the area is known, but the resource abundance is super low.\n* Remove roll torque on docking ports (by default).\n* Fix pod lights not being in Lights action group by default.\n* Fix some zeroed attachment vectors on parts leading to log spam.\n* Fix drag from struts and fuel lines.\n* Vessel G-force is now reported correctly when on rails.\n* Fix issue with ModuleDeployablePart (and solar panels, which derive from it) always reporting multiple drag cubes even when the animation isn\u0027t the panel\u0027s and it doesn\u0027t track the sun.\n* Fix long-standing bug with FlightLogger not logging Gs right.\n* Fix missing manufacturer for Mystery Goo.\n* Ion engine now has resource bars, and will leave a tiny bit of EC remaining when drawing EC so the vessel can still be controlled.\n* Fix issue with ladder tests in Engineer\u0027s Report.\n* Fix explosions moving with vessel.\n* Fix issue with command seat and docking port joints.\n* Fix vessel counts in vessel type filters.\n* Fix shielded docking ports to not be stageable.\n* Fix issue where parts would play their staging FX on load, not just on staging.\n* Fix an issue with zero drag area breaking physics.\n* Deactivate Lab if it is activated and no scientists are present.\n* Improve stars\u0027 fade-in-fade-out during dawn and dusk.\n* Fix issue where loading an unloaded vessel with a converter will lead to it not processing all ore.\n* Default to not logging (to flight logger or to the log file) when engine exhaust heats a part.\n* Show negative funds and negative altitudes (depth) by turning the widget red.\n* Fix issue with screen rotating when KSP is not the active application.\n* Ignore launch clamps when getting craft size for facility checks.\n* Fix CoP/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E on two fins being off.\n* When finding first vessel control source, require crewed parts to also have the command module on them before they are valid candidates.\n* IVA radar altitude gauge shows height from seabed when underwater.\n* Fix initial rotation of LT-1 and LT-2 landing legs.\n* Don\u0027t allow docking port shields to be closed while docked.\n* \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrust forces array properly zeroed when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is not firing.\n* Fix Offset Gizmo issue for surface mounted parts with colliders that don\u0027t cover the entire visual model (like the LY-01). They will no longer jump when an offset is attempted.\n* Fix vessels/kerbals landed on other vessels teleporting to the ground on load.\n* Fix issue with a kerbal targeting a vessel and boarding it leading to maneuver node functionality being broken.\n* Fix wrong vessel being made dominant during docking if the docking is so fast as to skip the acquire phase.\n* Fix Aero FX being improperly applied to some explosion FX causing square particles and slowdown.\n* Fix planet orbits sometimes not responding to clicks (or responding when clicked off-orbit).\n* Empty science containers (or containers with limited capacity) may show experiment count/capacity.\n* Fix problems with sliding maneuver nodes.\n* Fix landing legs exploding when landing on Gilly.\n* Fix handling of mouse interaction with solar escape trajectories (for maneuver node placement).\n* Fix bad things happening when quickloading while warping.\n* Fix IVA overlay button not always responding.\n* Fix offset target markers when more than 200m away.\n* Tweaks to wheel autoboost to help with wheels.\n* Increased allowable gizmo offset when holding SHIFT.\n* Fix bug when transferring fuel from an empty to an empty tank (causing the universe to come unglued).\n* Added highlighter brightness factor to game settings.\n* Added settingsload and settingssave commands to debug console.\n* Added highlighter colors to settings.cfg so they can be edited as well.\n* Added in flight UI for highlighter setting.\n* Add Mouselook mapping to settings screen.\n* Add shielding status to parts.\n* Add Lights to MPL.\n* Fix occlusion shielding radius values for Cargo Bays.\n* Add version stamps to save files for version save created in and version last saved in.\n* Fix issue with WarpTo orbit jumping.\n* Add \u0022Always show closest approach for target\u0022 markers option.\n* Fix AppLauncher not having global scale applied.\n\n\u002B\u002B\u002BModdability\nAPI Docs: https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/api/index.html\n* Added FlightGlobals.VesselsLoaded and FlightGlobals.VesselsUnloaded which lets us iterate over a specific portion of Vessels without checking the entire list.\n* Added onVesselPartCountChanged event, fires any time a part is added or removed, the moment it happens, unlike onVesselModified.\n* Added onVesselStandardModification event, collects various vessel events and fires them off with a single one. (onVesselPartCountChanged, onVesselModified, docked, undocked, et al)\n* Added onScreenResolutionModified event, fires when the screen resolution is modified.\n* Added many accessors/setters.\n* Vessel control level can be clamped to a field in Vessel (so can be restricted to Partial even if otherwise would be Full).\n* GetModuleMass/Cost methods can now be passed the situation.\n* Fix where kerbal mass (if set to nonzero) was not applied in the editor.\n* Added two new dictionary-related classes (DictionaryValueList and ListDictionary).\n* Celestial bodies now cache all of their PQS Cities.\n* All game root nodes now generate a random persistent seed, which is different from game to game.\n* All forces on valid parts except wheel forces are now done via Part.AddForce/Torque/AddForceAtPosition. Note that the forcemode used is Force; to use a different forcemode, convert the force to the correct amount. It is the job of the Flight Integrator to then apply all these forces to actual rigidbodies (rather than all the disparate modules\u0027 job).\n* Use mass-weighted average angular velocity of parts for vessel angular velocity.\n* ITorqueProvider now reports two Vector3s, positive torque (that produced by control actuation 1,1,1) and negative torque (that produced by -1,-1,-1).\n* Added various accessors.\n* Node definitions can take an extra digit after size, either 0 or 1: that sets whether the node can crossfeed. Defaults to 1 (yes). NODE definitions can take crossfeed = True/False\n* ModuleEngines now supports \u0060clampPropReceived = True\u0060. This will clamp the ratio of propellant requested based on prior results, so if IntakeAir is listed first and less than the full requirement is returned, it will request only that ratio of further propellants. In this case the \u0022Prop Req Met\u0022 display will show the minimum requirement-met ratio rather than the average. Engines that use IntakeAir (or other cases like that) need to have \u0060clampPropReceived = True\u0060 in each of their MODULEs that do that, and need to have that PROPELLANT first and the other PROPELLANTs later. See stock jet cfgs for examples.\n* Added another crew transfer event.\n* Added more startup options for KSPAddon\n* Allow kerbals to have/save/load arbitrary experience points.\n* ResearchAndDevelopment.GetTechnologyTitle(string id) will convert a tech ID to a tech title and is available as soon as parts start loading (can be used in GetInfo() ).\n* Support max pressure (dynamic \u002B static), \u0060maxPressure\u0060, and max G, \u0060gTolerance\u0060, for parts.\n* Added system to allow mods to add custom difficulty settings.\n* Added CelestialBody.hasSurface so mods that add a PQSController to gas giant don\u0027t cause silly things such as \u0022Plant a flag on Jool\u0022 contracts.\n* Replaced all checks for experience traits (Pilot, Scientist, Engineer) with individual experience effects. They are now loaded before part loading so can be queried in GetInfo().\n* Icons in TechTree.cfg can now use a relative path (allows mod icons to live outside the Squad directory).\n* Added KSPAssemblyDependencyEqualMajor as an attribute. Use instead of KSPAssemblyDependency if you want to force requiring the stated major version, not \u0026gt;= the major version, from your dependency.\n* If you are setting a vessel\u0027s position and/or changing its orbit, call Vessel.IgnoreGForces(framecount) on the vessel for the number of frames that g forces should be ignored (try 1, then 2 if that doesn\u0027t work, etc).\n* ModuleDeployablePart (covers antennas, solars, radiators) also has a gResistance (for Gs) as well as windResistance (for Q).\n* Crew transfer now derives from a generic abstract PartItemTransfer class. Classes can derive from it to implement any kind of (crew transfer-style) part-part transfer. Also we fire an event right before a crew transfer is created so mods can just kill it and easily create their own CrewTransfer-derived class and have that be called on that event.\n* Extended ModuleScienceContainer to allow sending and, (from ModuleScienceExperiment) receiving, experiment data. Also added support for a Collect All option to such containers.\n* ModuleColorChanger supports changing arbitrary shader colors and implements IScalarModule. ModuleAnimationSetter works similarly and is used to more directly link an animation to being set by IScalarModule.\n* PartModules now support upgrades. In a MODULE node, add an UPGRADE node. Inside that add one node per techID you wish to provide upgrades, in ascending order. Inside that place keys and nodes you wish to upgrade. e.g. \u0060UPGRADES { basicRocketry { maxThrust = 250 } }\u0060 will change maxThrust to 250 once basicRocketry unlocks. Upgrades will never override persistent data. Further, by default they overwrite each other; to make a node apply on a clean slate (so you can, say, add two PROPELLANT nodes and not have them conflict due to the overwrite logic) set \u0060IsExclusiveUpgrade__ = True\u0060 in the upgrade\u0027s node. That will clear the upgrade state and apply that upgrade fresh. Upgrades are applied only when you add a part to a craft in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, they don\u0027t magically apply in flight. When a part on a craft is upgraded, a new option will appear in the PAW (when in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E) where you can view the current stats of all those modules with upgrades.\n* ModuleEngines now supports alternate (RealFuels-style) throttling and rates.\n* ModuleEngines now supports throttle-Isp interactions.
