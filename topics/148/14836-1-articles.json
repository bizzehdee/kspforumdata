We realize that the 0.16 release has been pretty rocky, particularly for Mac users. We had a few problems with deploying 0.16, and eventually had to roll back the new system and didn\\\u0027t have enough time to test the deployment to the old one. We realize this has caused several major problems via your feedback, and we\\\u0027re working on fixes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, please realize that this is the weekend and much of the company is out trying to decompress from the stresses of the work week. Because of this, we won\\\u0027t be able to deploy the aforementioned fixes until Monday, or until we manage to get a hold of someone who can package and deploy the fixes. We realize this isn\\\u0027t ideal for you, the customer, but we\\\u0027re trying to get these fixes delivered to you as soon as possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil then, \u003Cstrong\u003Ebefore reporting any issues, please read this \u003C/strong\u003Ehurriedly-prepared \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ausi7t4oC9wndENpSWlfQmR5a0VxMGVwYWprb1JTSHc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elist of known issues\u003C/a\u003E.
