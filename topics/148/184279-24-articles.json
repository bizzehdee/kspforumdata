Us veterans, who\u0027ve sunk hundreds or thousands of hours in, can very reasonably afford a little extra for some more stuff to do in the ground. Plus, Infernal Robotics is old and a pain in the neck to get working, and a stock replacement seems really useful to me.

Squad\u0027s dudes do also. And so, in order to have them (or anyone else!) working on a game so I can enjoy it, they have to face the exact same problems I do : they have to spend most of their time doing things that earns them money. Since I need this game ongoing so I have what to do on my free time, I need that guys to keep earning enough money so they can spend their working time on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I pay for game, including MH - even by not really enjoying the Missions - at least for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that most of the people complaining about this are young people that are not used to have scarce Leisure time (Larry - get out of here!), but have very scarce budgets, so is kinda understandable to see some complains on the matter.

Not because there weren\u0027t\u00A0changes, but because since 1.5\u00A0I conceded to the fact that things change and I\u0027m taking precautions to prevent at least the nastiest breakages. You can\u0027t have the cake and eat it too, so the price we pay for this prevention is some lateness on supporting new things: \u0022if I don\u0027t know what\u0027s this, I don\u0027t touch it\u0022.

Take Cities: Skylines, for example. With all the expansions and DLC they offer, it leaves little doubt that expansions were part of their goal since the beginning. They intended to have expansions, and as such, likely left stuff out of the base game on purpose, so they could flesh it out better as an expansion. That is the business decision they made, and I can\u0027t fault them for that. Though if they didn\u0027t do it this way, then if they wanted to release a game with all the features the DLC offers in the base game... it would have been under development for 10 years, and still wouldn\u0027t be released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever the game itself is very well made, and looks fantastic, so there\u0027s no reason IMO for a Cities: Skylines 2. Honestly, if they did add a new one, that would irritate me. It\u0027s like with The Sims. You buy, say, Sim 3, and all it\u0027s expansions, now when Sims 4 comes out, you have to rebuy everything again, since the base Sims 4 won\u0027t include even half of what Sims 3 \u002B Expansions had. This example is taken to the extreme, but it is a real possibility, since it happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad, on the other hand, had no intention of offering DLC/expansions at the start of development (as evidenced by their poorly worded EULA back then).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote, I own both games, but only buy the DLC when it\u0027s on clearance sale.
