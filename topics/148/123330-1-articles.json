We\u0027ve had contact with our hosting provider and they\u0027ve rescheduled the maintenance. The new maintenance window is 08:00UTC - 10:00UTC next Wednesday. During these two hours the websites are expected to go down for about 30 minutes, and the forums will be unavailable while the update is performed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe server update will likely mean an updated IP for our websites, and since we\u0027ve had transfers in the past the following might be important if you\u0027ve ever hardcoded the KSP website IP to quickly update the DNS records: if you have ever done so I strongly advise you to open the C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\\HOSTS file and remove any references to kerbalspaceprogram.com or any subdomains. This will prevent you being unable to open the website or forums after the server update. Different procedures may apply to other operating systems, but I\u0027m not 100% sure how they work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T21:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.faqs.org/docs/securing/chap9sec95.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELinux\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E it\u0027d be the /etc/hosts file, and /private/etc/hosts on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/edit-hosts-file-mac-os-x/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOSX\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would only apply to people who have deliberately added the IP address of the KSP forums to their hosts file so no DNS lookup takes place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if it\u0027s Greek to you, you don\u0027t need to worry about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-18T22:01:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2015 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T22:00:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you hardcode it in the browser settings or something?
