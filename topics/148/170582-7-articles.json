It affects PC players as well as console players, but console players do feel it much more acutely since they have faced two different ports both plagued with issues (poor communication on controls in Enhanced Edition has been one of those issues).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, I have to agree with Raptor9 and say it\u0027s not an easy answer at this time. I think the only answer that would be reasonable for them to give, and therefore the only answer that would be reasonable to expect, is something like \u0022We would like to bring the\u00A0Making History Expansion to consoles in the future, but at this time our priority must be focusing on getting the console versions to the quality level that our players deserve. We hope to discuss the possibility of expansions and/or other DLC on consoles at a later date. As always, stay tuned to the forums and follow us on our social media for all the latest announcements on both PC and console versions.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny other answer at this time would probably be premature at best and a complete\u00A0lie at worst, unless Squad knows right now that Take-Two is going to say yes or no. The only reasonable answer is \u0022Maybe?\u0022\u00A0and instead of irresponsibly getting hopes up they\u0027re choosing to not say anything until they know for sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be one of the first to say that Squad\u0027s communication could use serious work, but staying silent on the expansion for consoles is probably the right call for as long as they don\u0027t have a definite yes or no answer to give.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luckyluca","CreatedById":184498,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-15T09:19:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno console release?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JEB\u0026#039;S DESTINY","CreatedById":182658,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-15T13:38:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYAY, MORE STOCK\u00A0PARTS!!!!!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAND MORE MISSIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-15T14:32:43Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2018 02:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Deddly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERemoved some !!!!!

What you interpret as excuses are actually honest attempts to help you or welcome you from people who would love you to be able to enjoy the game as it should be experienced. Don\u0027t be put off by their responses - this is not like most places on the internet. Give it a chance and you\u0027ll find the community exceedingly patient and helpful. Some of the people here have insight into software design and distribution, some are programmers, others are actual aeronautics experts or scientists.

Currently console versions are 2, soon to be 3, updates behind the PC and there\u0027s still people experiencing huge problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about Squad worries\u00A0about getting the console versions patched and working well for players, and then worry about updates and potentially DLC? Unless you think the best way to move forward is to build upon a problematic base?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI totally appreciate that you want parity across all versions (that\u0027s the perfect world scenario, hopefully it\u0027ll happen) and that you\u0027d like a commitment right now from Squad/Take-Two, but if they say yes now\u00A0and it winds up not happening you\u0027ll be angry. And if they say no now you\u0027ll be angry. So either way you\u0027ll be angry. It\u0027s easier if they just stay silent until they\u00A0know for sure. I\u0027m not saying this because I love Squad, I\u0027m saying this because it\u0027s what companies do and it\u0027s foolish to think they\u0027ll do otherwise just because you want them to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want Squad to release a roadmap, and I\u0027ve said as much for a long time now. They haven\u0027t released one, and they have never really commented on releasing one. At this point, it\u0027s foolish to think they will. Realistically speaking, if this DLC fails to sell well, and if the console versions haven\u0027t sold well, I won\u0027t be at all surprised to see\u00A0development wind down to support/bug fixing before ending all together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo be upset, post all you want, but don\u0027t act like me and others who provide reasonable answers are against you or telling you to be quiet. You made your demands, you stated your opinion, and you received some responses that were hoping to provide you with reasonable expectations regarding both.

And just like the rest of us, you paid for what was available at the time of purchase including any future base game updates with no guarantee of updates ever actually being made or doing what you want. Consoles are a unique consideration in that regard, because it can be argued that Squad did not deliver a good product on consoles.

It may be a long shot, but there\u0027s more of a chance now than back in the day when physical copies were the only option. Ultimately, Sony wants to keep you happy and keep you buying from them, so one would think that they would try to make you happy with their end of things, at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou say that you don\u0027t want a \u0022watered down\u0022 version, and I can appreciate where you\u0027re coming from, but you have to admit that the consoles will always be watered down when considering mod support.
