I am using the simplified preset and the controls panel doesn\u0027t show any button for accessing offset mode. I stumbled upon it once but I have no idea how. I already have overlapping parts enabled in the cheats section, but I still can\u0027t fully overlap them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerkyJerkyWreaksHavoc","CreatedById":207646,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-10T02:41:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nvery simple. you know the small side button on the top side of the PS4 controller (R1 button). i belive that should toggle between regular, offset, rotation, and root mode. if not, you can press the button on the right joystick on the PS4 which will enable the cursor. once the cursor is enabled, you can hover to the offset button and press x to enable it almost like you would be doing it on pc. trust me, i play ksp on Xbox Series S and its a pain. anyways, hope i answered your question and happy flying! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
