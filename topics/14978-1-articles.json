Eventually, I figured out the easiest way to pull off a landing on a low-framerate computer, which unfortunately goes against all of the advice I\\\u0027ve ever seen in videos or the forums. I\\\u0027d just like to see if anyone else can build and land a rocket in the goofy way that I do. It goes a little like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Your lander gets you all the way from (hopefully low) suborbit to the munar surface, and back. Return stages are possible, but a single-stage lander will net you bonus points. Usually, this involves a single stage to kick the lander out of the atmosphere, then a massive, overbuilt monster to handle the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. No orbiting the Mun. In your TMI burn, you\\\u0027re going to try to fall as close to vertical onto the munar surface, and then all you do on descent is retroburn. Landing in some mountains? Good luck. Hope you packed enough legs. Nighttime where you\\\u0027re coming down? Nut up or shut up, if an idiot like me could bring a lander down on the night side you can too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. RCS. C\\\u0027mon guys, there\\\u0027s a lot to be said for RCS. When you\\\u0027re doing a vertical descent and you want to \u003Cem\u003Estay\u003C/em\u003E vertical, RCS can keep you steady. This one\\\u0027s more of a...suggestion, though. Kudos to you if you come down on RCS only or have over 16 thruster blocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Incredibly slow landings. By the time my altimeter hits 3000 meters, I\\\u0027m doing 12 m/s. By touchdown, I\\\u0027ll be maxing out at one meter per second. If you can survive the thrilling boredom of coming down into a crater at that sort of speed, congratulations! You\\\u0027re my kind of crazy. Ultra bonus points if you can touch down at 0.4 m/s or slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Headwonky returns. Ehh, who cares about equatorial return orbits or fuel efficiency? Just turn whichever way you can and don\\\u0027t throttle down until your Kerbin periapsis is in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you say? Can you build a rocket insane enough? Probably! Screenshots would be appreciated if you claim a successful mission, and .crafts if your lander takes up over half of the vehicle\\\u0027s total height. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clouds","CreatedById":32610,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T04:38:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, in .15.2, with MechJeb for precise and efficient piloting, I had gotten to the Mun and back to KSC with no stages or detachments at all, and powered return descent without parachutes.
