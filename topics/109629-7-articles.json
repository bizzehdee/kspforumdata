Adding a ton or reaction control wheel torque will do it but is cheap. I was thinking of lowering the centre of mas to just below or inline with the wings. But the oms engines will spin the shuttle in space. This thing has always lost control for me on re entry even on ksp 0.9.\n\nHas anyone made any spaceplane in the game thats controllable on reentry? Maybe I can copy some ideas but obviously I cant change the shape of the orbiter.\n\nI have spent more time so far getting it to land and fly right than reentry. My last few days so far have been spent on fixing other things. \n\nYoure welcome to have a go at modifying it to get it to handle better. Let me know how it goes.\n\nI also notice having the wings as lifting surfaces makes act strange when flying and having them as control surfaces works better ."},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T22:55:17Z","Content":"Interesting. \n\nI notice jovzin seems to now be doing the shuttle.
