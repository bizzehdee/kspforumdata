It would also be usefull to be able to call a different action group from within another one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeature #2 ~ Timed/Proggrammable Action Groups\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this it would be nice to have an action group\u0027s actions happen in the order you have them set. In addition it would be nice to have a timer feature to space out the actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeature #3 ~ Deactivating tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that often I have certain tanks(usually RCS) that I don\u0027t want the RCS system to use initially. The problem is that they are often hidden and it\u0027s difficult to disable them manually before you launch every time. Consequently, being to disable/enable tanks from within action groups would be very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind Regards,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T13:15:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFeature #1 ~ Staged Action Group activation - yes please!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeature #2 ~ Timed/Proggrammable Action Groups - maybe a bit complected, so unlikely but still yes please! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeature #3 ~ Deactivating tanks - I\u0027m pretty sure you can already do this with tweakables in the VAB/SPH\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ANWRocketMan","CreatedById":65251,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T13:28:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the feature 3, I want to actively activate/deactivate certain tanks on the fly without having to do a dance of death with the very irritating CoM camera mode in order to get access to all my tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T13:37:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe timing should not be an issue at all. It should be as simple as just ordering the actions. As far as precision timing goes, I think you run into the problem of once things depart your craft they are no longer useful but I think he\u0027s talking about say, deploying the parachute 3 seconds after the launch tower activates or similar. The other features I\u0027m not so sure I\u0027d have a use for, but I think there is a feature that is being overlooked here. We should be able to remove objects from staging or set up staging sets so that my lander parts are not intermixed into my liftoff rocket stages. Being able to add and remove them from staging (also while in space) would be helpful. Being able to drag ENTIRE GROUPS into stages would also help. The program guesses wrong a lot, and though it will let you move an entire stage, you can\u0027t just combine it into another.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T13:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERiiiggghhhtt, sorry get it now. you want to assign \u0022open/close fuel tank\u0022 to and action group. yes please.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T15:20:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the things that I\u0027d like to see is the ability to put action groups in the staging list themselves (similar to option 1, but a visual marker). This obviously also opens up more opportunities based on the above suggestions too, so I\u0027m also all for them as well!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
