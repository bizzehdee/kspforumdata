One that applies to users of all abilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set up a perfect sat system after reading the comments in this thread, all orbits perfect to the resolution of the readout. After doing a Jool mission and a Duna mission I noticed the sats were all out of place by about 70 degrees, causing some dead zones, yet their orbit timings were still perfect to less than a second. Using the method I describe above, they would still not have moved into places where there would be dead zones of no signal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERobustness is the reason to use this method. Set up your satellites as perfect as you like, warp forward a few years and see how \u0060perfect\u0060 their positions remain or set them up \u0060messy\u0060 like this and see how perfect your signal coverage remains...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
