After adding in my mods and installing all the preqs noted in the Linux Install Threads, my game started crashing immediately on startup. \n\nFiguring the mods were to blame, I wiped out all traces of the mods and tried again. Again an instant crash on startup. Same after a reinstall. For some reason my KSP is reading the following system info in the output\\_log:\n\n    Direct3D:    Version:  Direct3D 9.0c [atiumdag.dll 8.14.10.741]    Renderer: AMD Radeon HD 7900 Series    Vendor:   ATI    VRAM:     64 MB (via fallback)    Caps:     Shader=30 DepthRT=1 NativeDepth=1 NativeShadow=1 DF16=0 INTZ=1 RAWZ=0 NULL=1 RESZ=1\n\nMy actual video card is a Radeon 280X with 3GB of VRAM. I\u0027m assuming that KSP is crashing as soon as it loads a graphical asset larger than 64 MB(!?) \n\nAlso potentially relevant is KSP not finding a specific video driver file? I\u0027ve installed every dependency mentioned in any Linux Install thread I\u0027ve seen to my knowledge. \n\n    ========== OUTPUTING STACK TRACE ==================(0xF5C4B3C3) (fglrx_dri.so): (filename not available): (function-name not available) \u002B 0x0========== END OF STACKTRACE ===========\n\nWhat have I ballsed up to make KSP think I\u0027m running a potato GPU? What steps do I need to take to troubleshoot this and provide more info to help? \n\nI\u0027m brand spanking new to Linux--I installed it purely to have a stable KSP x64 with far too many mods to make sense, but I\u0027m liking it enough to stay for more than just KSP. That being said I have very little clue on using the terminal to do things other than basic apt-get commands.\n\nErrorlogs:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/a6mm0ygyuiw5wiw/2015-07-07_194648.7z?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a6mm0ygyuiw5wiw/2015-07-07_194648.7z?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T08:45:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 08:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cleric2145**"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T04:19:59Z","Content":"Why are you running the windows version in wine?
