If adding in recyclers does work then that sounds like a plan. I\u0027ll have to see what works with that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, unfortunately, I was only able to make the recycler work while its the active vessel. The only way to make it work while the vessel is inactive would be to have the plugin calculate it (kind of like what it\u0027s doing now to calculate how much of each resource should have been used in the time since the vessel was last active. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not familiar enough with Unity to say if its possible to make this happen or not. I would think that you could make some checks \u0022does vessel have recycler\u0022 if yes calculate recycle rate vs consumption rate debit the supplies. Etc Etc etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the same reason that Kethane doesn\u0027t \u0022mine\u0022 while your ship is not active, something with or in the unity engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow TT has done some interesting work called \u0022never unload\u0022, where the vessels remain loaded (I\u0027m not sure if that means active or not). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really haven\u0027t had time to mess around with it anymore to this point, I will try and make some tests with these ideas in the next few days, but I doubt the outcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
