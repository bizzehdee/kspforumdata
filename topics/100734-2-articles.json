However, I don\u0027t think the dichotomy you\u0027ve presented is correct. I don\u0027t believe that the world (or this forum) consists solely of jerks and non-jerks. Sure, some small number of people are just jerks and likely will not change. On the other end of the spectrum from jerks, you have a few people who are possibly too nice. But I think most people fall in the middle, and are decent people. Sometimes, otherwise decent people will act like jerks because of situational factors, like a particularly heated argument or a misunderstanding. We don\u0027t want to automatically assume that person is a jerk just because they got caught up in a moment. Once they cool off, they will likely go back to being a decent person. The problem is, when two decent people get angry, it now looks from the outside like you have two jerks. Sometimes, other people get roped in, and the apparent jerk population multiplies. But none of those people are jerks in reality, they just got swept up. And it\u0027s easy to get swept up by something, it happens to all of us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of this thread is that with some introspection, a person who might have otherwise come off as a jerk will approach the situation differently. If one person approaches the situation in a thoughtful way, it may cause the other person to de-escalate. In the worst case scenario, you may just have one person who looks like a jerk. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf most of the apparent jerkery come from decent people acting like jerks, and not irredeemable jerks, then the solutions to the problem change drastically. You don\u0027t have to remove all the jerks you see, because those people aren\u0027t really jerks at all. So creating a positive environment isn\u0027t an issue of removing negative people, it\u0027s a matter of individuals \u003Cem\u003Eadding\u003C/em\u003E positivity in their actions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gather that you see this as a free speech issue.
