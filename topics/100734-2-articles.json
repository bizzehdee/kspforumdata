You\u0027ve all experienced it. As have I. Most people don\u0027t talk about it because, again, it\u0027s the ego protecting itself.\n\nAs for logic, most people don\u0027t even know what it is or what it does. They simply think it\u0027s \u0022common sense\u0022 which it is not. Sometimes they even confuse it with rhetoric. The worst thing is that these faults are not limited to young people. They hardly go away.\n\nAnyway here\u0027s how it\u0027s relevant:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - If someone attacks you (or someone else) for your opinion, spelling, design or anything else, don\u0027t tell them off. Instead, make it your goal to cheer them up. Try asking for suggestions on how to improve\n\nThis is hindered by a person\u0027s ego.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - If someone picks at you for something small and insignificant they don\u0027t like you doing, something that\u0027s not against the rules; tell them you\u0027re thankful for the suggestion and you will try to think of it next time you post. Be careful not to sound patronizing or sarcastic; it must be sincere.\n\nSo is this. Actually an openness to criticism is a state that few people in my experience achieve. Most people want to seem correct, not to be correct. That\u0027s ego.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - If feel strongly about something, don\u0027t give others the feeling that you think your opinion is more important than theirs. Instead, calmly explain how you feel and why you feel that way - others will be more likely to take your opinion seriously that way\n\nThis requires logic. You can resort to rhetoric if you want but that will only convince the mediocre mind, and will just confuse an inferior one to the point of embarrassment. Logic is your only way to convey a lasting point to someone.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - Most importantly, no matter how you are treated by someone else, treat them the way you yourself would like to be treated\n\nI guess both apply here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-01T05:21:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2015 05:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt.

So that others don\u0027t \u0022feel\u0022 a certain way? Even if you were successful, what exactly would that accomplish?\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E We\u0027re assuming that negativity is created by \u0022negative people,\u0022 right? Like jerks? Well a jerk is going to cuss, rant and rave no matter what you do. You could pamper them and dote on them and do your best to make them \u0022feel\u0022 all warm and fuzzy but they\u0027re still going to be *jerks*. They\u0027re going to stay that way. Probably until the day they die, as a matter of fact.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Or what if you meant negativity as in what I\u0027m doing right now? Which is to say: disagreement with any lick of conviction behind it? Am I being *negative* and a net drain on the forum because I don\u0027t buy into this feel-good movement at all, and even find it somewhat dangerous? You do of course realize the implications if you said yes. You\u0027d be telling people with convictions, any of them, including moral and ethical ones, that they shouldn\u0027t stand up for anything, because it makes some people \u0022feel bad.\u0022 It\u0027s bad enough caring about the fickle feelings of a jerk, but shutting up others to create some kind of padded-room environment is even worse.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Yes, yes it\u0027s practically an obligation to \u0022support this message,\u0022 and to do otherwise looks \u0022bad.\u0022 But that\u0027s what you get when you only deal with feelings, isn\u0027t it? I didn\u0027t need a dozen prior examples of this kind of petition in other communities over the years to know it isn\u0027t going to change anything, and that it\u0027s wishful thinking with a hint of self-aggrandizement (members feel good about it, even though it\u0027s not accomplishing stated goals). The only useful suggestion in the OP is supporting or backing up the peacemakers in some way, but that implies a kind of camaraderie that large, mostly anonymous boards never really have. A couple of people can do it with a bit of dedication and humility, but it\u0027ll never turn into some \u0022movement\u0022 with all of the \u0022mass\u0022 implications that come with the term.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E If you *really* want to make this place a \u0022positive environment,\u0022 whatever that phrase really means to you, then you\u0027re going to have to do the same thing that countless other radicals have done: You\u0027re going to have to go on a witch hunt. And by the time you\u0027re done, you will be worse than the jerks and \u0022negative-nancies\u0022 you set out to silence.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E What else is there? Maybe if ego really \u0027was\u0027 something to be triumphed over by everyone involved you could go into the gritty implications of having a community with so many appeals to elitism and snobbery in it. At least then you could have a discussion about facts. But then what would the solution be, anyway? Ban everyone who claims they\u0027re a scientist IRL? Stop any and all discussions of the latest mission at SpaceX? Or perhaps KSP mission logs too, since there are plenty of people who would scoff at \u0022noobs\u0022 and \u0022casuals?\u0022 Delete all criticism of Squad? Take your pick.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Either you go on a witch hunt or you ignore it. Either you use blunt force to remove people, topics and even ideas, or you simply tune out the ones you can\u0027t or won\u0027t stand. Forum rules about swearing, flaming and obscene content are already a kind of \u0022witch hunt lite,\u0022 based on the notion that there is a \u0022jerk tolerance level\u0022 defined by those rules. So unless you want to make them even harsher, becoming a tyrannical jerk yourself in the process, then I honestly don\u0027t see what else needs to be discussed.\n\u003E \n\nI can identify with what you are saying because I used to feel much the same way. However, I don\u0027t think the dichotomy you\u0027ve presented is correct. I don\u0027t believe that the world (or this forum) consists solely of jerks and non-jerks. Sure, some small number of people are just jerks and likely will not change. On the other end of the spectrum from jerks, you have a few people who are possibly too nice. But I think most people fall in the middle, and are decent people. Sometimes, otherwise decent people will act like jerks because of situational factors, like a particularly heated argument or a misunderstanding. We don\u0027t want to automatically assume that person is a jerk just because they got caught up in a moment. Once they cool off, they will likely go back to being a decent person. The problem is, when two decent people get angry, it now looks from the outside like you have two jerks. Sometimes, other people get roped in, and the apparent jerk population multiplies. But none of those people are jerks in reality, they just got swept up. And it\u0027s easy to get swept up by something, it happens to all of us.\n\nThe point of this thread is that with some introspection, a person who might have otherwise come off as a jerk will approach the situation differently. If one person approaches the situation in a thoughtful way, it may cause the other person to de-escalate. In the worst case scenario, you may just have one person who looks like a jerk. \n\nIf most of the apparent jerkery come from decent people acting like jerks, and not irredeemable jerks, then the solutions to the problem change drastically. You don\u0027t have to remove all the jerks you see, because those people aren\u0027t really jerks at all. So creating a positive environment isn\u0027t an issue of removing negative people, it\u0027s a matter of individuals *adding* positivity in their actions. \n\nI gather that you see this as a free speech issue. It doesn\u0027t have to be an issue of speech vs. censorship."},{"CreatedByName":"anachronicus","CreatedById":139237,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T16:05:43Z","Content":"Deddly, I absolutely love this post! \u002BRep to you ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T16:12:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by anachronicus**\n  \nClarity :)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T03:30:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E This is exactly the point.
