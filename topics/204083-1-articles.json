(clockwise) but if I press the button to roll right, it still rolls right. In other words, I can\u2019t roll left no matter what I do. I know the issue isn\u2019t with my controller, as all other functions in the game with that button (LB/L2) work fine, so something is wrong with KSP. Loading a quicksave does nothing to resolve this. Is there a fix for\u00A0this?\u00A0It is very frustrating how many unresolved bugs are left on the console version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-29T07:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum and sorry to hear about your issue. I\u0027m not sure this is a bug, it may be that you have trim engaged so\u00A0please check the controls for your system and see if there is a \u0027cancel trim\u0027 option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
