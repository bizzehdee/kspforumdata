Anyways, I created a replica of the Russian fighter jet t-50. Ever since 0.25, modeling and building things has changed, and building things in detail has become very different and people like me and others will have to experiment around with this new wing system to find out tricks for certain goals. One thing I can say about the new wings is that they really easily show the clipping of wings, which we will have to find something against. In this design I have created the t-50 while trying to keep wing clipping to a minimum. As for all of my crafts, this jet is really stable and agile (especially for its size). I used Kerbpaint for the colored wings (their still stock), Hotrockets for the cool exhaust (still stock), and bdarmory for the cluster bomb (not stock, but isn\u0027t included in the download).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/2e4jmkTAo9c?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://download1487./gyezft829x6g/6675kfit3w1ajua/SU\u002BT-50.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-11T01:09:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2014 01:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by manni01\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceXray","CreatedById":113396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T09:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PikachuNL","CreatedById":124257,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T11:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice one, but not sure if coincidence, or just illuminati (jk).
