I was already a proponent of sending humans to Mars, but having a better idea of what exactly is required made me even more confident in our ability to go and made me feel empowered as a citizen. I think there\u0027s this idea that a human mars mission would cost a trillion dollars or something outrageous like that, while that can\u0027t be farther from the truth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027m thinking about is making a big poster or picture laying out the various proposed mars missions and their craft, showing how the mission profiles have evolved over time. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/images/artgallery/1968-IMIS-Mars-Mission--02.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis is what gave the idea to make this.\u003C/a\u003E Generally, the old 60s era proposals required more tons in LEO and shorter stays on mars, while newer missions have less tonnage and longer stays at mars. Price goes down, science goes up. More bang for your buck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recreate the ships in KSP (with mods of course) and show them in the LEO configurations before departing for Mars. The ships can be shown photogenically lined up next to each other to give a sense of scale and whatnot. Below is information about the various proposals, their mission profiles, costs, etc. I especially want to have a \u0022cost per citizen\u0022 figure, because it makes it personal for us. \u0022this is how much you\u0027d pay over the time of the project\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts/suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chris P.
