First of all sorry for my English and any mistakes, because i don\u0027t know it well. I wanna ask you about ksp formulas (Math, Physics, Astronomy) . Does anyone use formulas for play in KSP? I mean use them to calculate all aspects of your mission such as time to reach orbit, transfer to another plane and etc. Can someone help me or maybe show where i can find some good information?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T15:01:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/index.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis site\u003C/a\u003E is really good for orbital mechanics math without overwhelming non-physicists.
