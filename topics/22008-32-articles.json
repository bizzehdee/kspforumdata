If the wiki is accurate, then it is true that your balloons should float in Jool\u0027s atmosphere because all atmospheres in the game are made out of the same thing, a mysterious, unrealistic \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cgas\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 that does not change in density when the temperature is changed! So assuming the wiki is accurate, then it\u0027s not your balloons, but the atmosphere they are floating in, that is unrealistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, I must strongly (but respectfully!) disagree with your statement that air density is properly modeled. To me it is not properly modeled, not even close. First of all, it is very unrealistic to assume that all planetary atmospheres have the same specific density. Let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s look at the specific density of real-life solar system atmospheres at \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E1 atm and 0 degrees C\u003C/span\u003E: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVenus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.0 kg/m^3 (almost entirely CO2, molecular weight 44)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.3 kg/m^3 (approx. 80% N2, 20% O2, molecular weights 28 and 32)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMars:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.0 kg/m^3 (almost entirely CO2, molecular weight 44)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(all roughly around) 0.1 kg/m^3 (mostly H2, molecular weight 2, with a small to smallish fraction of He, molecular weight 4, thrown in)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETitan:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.25 kg/m^3 (almost entirely N2, molecular weight 28)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, remember these are specific densities- specific to 1 atm and 0 degrees C.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess my point is that I find it to be a very poor atmospheric model if they assume that all planetary atmospheres have the same density at the same pressure and temperature. It is not even close IRL, especially when comparing gas giants vs. rocky worlds. As a general rule, rocky worlds will have atmospheres largely composed of heavier gases, as they do not have the gravity to hold onto anything lighter, while gas giants are heavy enough to prevent the escape of even the lightest gases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it gets worse yet. In the above example, notice that I was just comparing specific densities of planetary atmospheres- not their actual densities. I just wanted to make the pointthat all other things being equal, it is still a very poor model to make all planetary atmospheres equal in specific density. But all other things are NOT equal. The density of a gas is ALSO related to its temperature. The cooler a gas gets, the denser it gets. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even see temperature as a \u003Cem\u003Efactor\u003C/em\u003E in those atmospheric density calculations. Instead- we only see a single factor, pressure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not surprised- Squad only has so much time on their hands, and the game is still in development. Still, at some point, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to see atmospheres get a realistic treatment, with attention paid to making the atmospheres of the various planets actually \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C/em\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still going to send those atmosphere probes to Jool, because wikis are not renowned for their flawless factual accuracy. It could be wrong. I\u0027ll probably share the results here, I\u0027m assuming you would like to know, at least just for curiosity\u0027s sake?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and about high pressure hydrogen- again, that applies to pressures that far exceed what you would float a balloon in.

Right now it outputs for every part, where it removes the old buoyancy and then applies the new. I think part of the problem is that the Destroy(partBuoyancy) is not immediate, it happens after all parts seem to run FixedUpdate at least once. Thus, you see each part post that it is trying to remove the old buoyancy from every other part (so messages roughly = number of parts squared).
