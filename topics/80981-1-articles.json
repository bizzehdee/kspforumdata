Now I haven\u0027t got a bloody clue as to what it actually is but it might be the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn .24, kerbal companies can give you contracts and you can complete them for funds and a little science. Well, since they are companies, you could have the possibility of investing funds and/or science in those companies who will in turn take a certain amount of time to research a new part/parts for example: Invest x funds or y science every kerbal week for 4 weeks and we will research/build next generation solar panels, etc. This way, the science system can be reworked so that an eva report over the munar poles does not directly influence the researching of atomic rocket engines. Rather, science can be split off into several branches separate from each other. For example: Surface sample science, eva science, barometer science, etc. This way, a surface sample from Duna can aid in the researching of wheels with better traction, or a temperature scan from Kerbin\u0027s high atmosphere can help in researching heat shields, or perhaps upgrading certain parts\u0027 heat resistance etc. Going back to investing, the economy can rise or crash on a (mostly) periodic basis which can affect how long, how costly, or let alone able to research the part/parts. In addition, the funding/investing can be influenced by how well your space program is going, For ex: When your shuttle exploded during liftoff and several kerbals were killed, the companies will become more reluctant to research parts and will often demand more funds/science.

But requiring additional data (just a bit) to research certain types of parts would really make that interesting and I guess fit quite good in my system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the financial management, I wouldn\u0027t like to see Kerbin economy based on ones space program.
