This happened even when I slowed myself down to less than a m/s of velocity. After a second time I just said love it and retracted the legs cause its Gilly and its possible to land there with a Nerv. But this is still a bit of a frustrating issue and has caused my Minmus and Mun landers to bounce, sometimes leading them to tip over. Is there anyway to increase the rigidity of the landing legs so that they aren\u0027t just springs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sitting Duck","CreatedById":200432,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-17T00:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Advanced Tweakables enabled from the main Settings window (just after loading KSP) on the General tab, you can perform some \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/LT-2_Landing_Strut#Tuning\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eright-click adjustments\u003C/a\u003E to landing struts during game play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Once Advanced Tweakables is enabled, right-click on a strut (or anything else) in-game to see the usual options plus more.
