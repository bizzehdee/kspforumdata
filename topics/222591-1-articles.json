However, I noticed it had vanished shortly after I accepted it. It\u0027s gone from the contract list and the target orbit is no longer there. In mission control, a new contract has become available as if the sentinel contract was complete. I went through my contract history and it\u0027s not listed as completed or failed, it\u0027s as if it never existed. I got to keep the advance for accepting the contract, and haven\u0027t been penalised for failing it, so yay, free money I guess. I was quite eager to do the mission though as it would be my first time outside Kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E this playthrough.
