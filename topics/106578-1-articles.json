It would be quite cool if it was just there while in low atmo and just when experiencing really high Gs.\n\nExactly what I was thinking. It makes sense when you\u0027re launching with a ton of Mainsails or Kerbodyne\u0027s engines, travelling at Mach 2 with turbojet engines, crashing into the surface(and buildings), or suffering re-entry. Doesn\u0027t make much though outside of these circumstances.\n\nNevertheless, I like it, so I toned it down to 0.7."},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T14:58:12Z","Content":"I like it, especially during re-entry, and it makes atmospheric flight a little more interesting.

At the default setting, it looks remarkably similar to the twitching spasms that happen when you\u0027ve got a physics-enabled part clipped into something. (Had a probe shake itself to pieces on the launchpad until I noticed my mystery goo containers were clipped into the top of my service bay.)\n\nMax settings on IVA and half on external cam sounds like a great idea, though!
