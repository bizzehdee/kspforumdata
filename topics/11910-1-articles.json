I can\\\u0027t get anything working now. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just modeled a semi-complex fuel tank. It loads in-game as usual, but sigh, I can never seem to get the UVs right, ever. I joined all my objects in blender into one, which may or may not be a mistake. But I only did that because I couldn\\\u0027t get all the individual UV maps to join into one. Either way, I applied a standard grey material to the tank, and the texture is also grey.
