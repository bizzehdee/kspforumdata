As well as this various officials have been saying they will launch a new sat soon, even the big guy claimed he wanted one for the October celebrations (NK 70th anniversary), it should also be noted October always comes up in these claims. And now just today another head official from NADA claimed they were building a newer, more advanced satellite for a launch soon. Considering the special event and recent activity in Sohae.SLS, i\u0027m going to assume that they are serious and that we should prepare for it; so here\u0027s a quick breakdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDate; 7th Feb 2016\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch site; Sohae Satellite Launching Station, after being upgraded for two years Sohae is ready for launches.

Not keeping pace. but falling behind. While I do not doubt that they will eventually launch a successful satellite, and that they have managed to invent nuclear weapons, these achievements are not considered modern.
