The lander has one full Rockomax X200-16 and one full FL-R1, with a Poodle engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander is docked nose to nose with a support ship that has one full and one partly full X200-16 and one partly full FL-R1, with a poodle engine. Behind that are three empty tanks, a Rockomax 64, a X200-16 and a X200-8, then a Skipper engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything in flight is all stock parts except for the control pod mod for MechJeb 2.0.9. Also in orbit are two stations with six full Rockomax 64 tanks with a ship docked to one that is an RCS tanker, but it\u0027s mostly empty on fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kicker is the autopilot has failed. MechJeb finds it impossible to do anything without first completely reversing the orbit direction before executing the desired maneuver, doesn\u0027t matter if the inclination is set to 0 or 180, it\u0027s reverse gears first, oops, there\u0027s no fuel left. There is enough fuel to leave Mun SOI, MechJeb has managed it several times, sending our poor Kerbals on a dutchman towards the outer system with no fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus the player has three options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Manually trigger the separator to jettison the empty tanks then fly out of Mun SOI manually, keeping the support ship docked until its tanks are empty. Can\u0027t use MechJeb because even though a manual separation leaves the support ship\u0027s engine set to inactive, MechJeb will activate it AND throttle up the lander\u0027s engine at the same time. Once out of Mun SOI, either make it back to Kerbin with enough fuel to land or do an orbit rendezvous to take on fuel for landing. (Once out of Mun SOI, MechJeb should recover its sanity and be able to do a Hohmann transfer to Kerbin.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Build a rescue vehicle to send out and fill up all the tanks on the support ship, giving the player what should be plenty enough fuel for even the most ham-handed pilot to manually fly out, or for Insane MechJeb to waste on reversing orbit direction before doing anything else. In that case, the empty tanks are a resource to keep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Build a rescue vehicle to dock only fuel tanks to the lander, completely replacing the dead weight parts of the service ship (engine, RCS tank, Rockomax Brand Adapter etc.) Either leave the service ship in Mun orbit to be refueled later or crash it for disposal. Fly out manually or let MechJeb waste some fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA note about the lander. It has no parachutes and no way to cut the crew pod loose. MechJeb has brought it down to Kerbin several times from orbits as high as 200KM and landed with almost 1/2 a tank left. So that\u0027s an additional challenge, the lander has to have at least half of a X200-16 full of fuel upon re-entering Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere in order to land safely. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flickr.com/photos/27748767@N08/9550456375/in/set-72157635319720861\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis landing\u003C/a\u003E convinced our engineers that the lander was a robust enough design to upgrade to a manned version. Immediately after, it was updated to the design seen in this scenario and has proved to be reliable in many flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s not possible to get the lander back to at least a refuel rendezvous so it can land on Kerbin, I\u0027ll have to re-think my Mun landing strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do manage to figure out how to make MechJeb \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E burn all the fuel reversing orbit direction I\u0027d love to know how you do it. I\u0027ve even tried setting it to 180 degree inclination in an attempt to make it use the direction the ship is already going. Seemed logical.
