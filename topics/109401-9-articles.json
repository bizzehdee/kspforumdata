Typical solid rockets have a specific impulse of about 260 seconds (2.5 kN\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7s/kg), but using the same fuel in an air-augmented design can improve this to over 500 seconds (4.9 kN\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7s/kg), a figure even the best hydrogen/oxygen engines can\u0027t match. This design can even be slightly more efficient than a ramjet as the exhaust from the rocket engine compresses the air more than a ramjet normally would; this raises the combustion efficiency as a longer, more efficient nozzle can be employed.

They would also be a source of extra drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuselage SRBs would be much more streamlined and would yield more thrust but require more planning when building a plane around them, especially if they are being jettisoned.
