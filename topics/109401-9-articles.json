I could see this being used in tandem with a Scramjet to get to Scramjet speeds...\n\nThree: 3) Scramjets have always been stange beasts in KSP, mainly because they dont really start producing thrust until ~1800m/s, and Kerbin\u0027s escape velocity of ~2300 m/s gave them a very short window of operation. Would be great in RSS, though.\n\n@ABZB; There are pros and cons to fuselage or radial Spaceplane SRBs - Radials are easy to detach, but be careful about that, lest they take out a stabilizer when they go, and can be used in the same way as standard SRbs to provide a little extra needed oomph to a craft. They would also be a source of extra drag.\n\nFuselage SRBs would be much more streamlined and would yield more thrust but require more planning when building a plane around them, especially if they are being jettisoned.

That would be much more usable than what i tried; I was going off of theorized real world stats, so activation at ~1750m/s, TWR ~2, ISP of ~1000, which meant I found myself needing to use ESTOCs on rocket mode to get up to speed, and at that point, why not just continue to use the ESTOCs?\n\nWith the emissives constantly emitting, are you trying to stick more than one particle emitter in your FX? I discovered that things like shock diamonds have to be their own FX, and then you use a FXMultiparticle module to combine them when the engine is running.\n\n@Cuky; Yeah, I figured it would be something like that, considering the size of mk3 wings. Heh, now I\u0027m going to have to throw in some mk3 wing segments as well...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-02T01:52:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2015 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SuicidalInsanity**"}]}
