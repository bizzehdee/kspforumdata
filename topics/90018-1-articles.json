There would be multiple space centers scattered all around Kerbin. People could launch from wherever they like, but if two people try to launch from the same center at the same time, one player will be help up until it\u0027s their turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as time-warp goes, I don\u0027t know if it will be a global time warp, a per-player time warp or just no time warp at all. It\u0027s such a big issue because global time warp would need all players to agree to warp, which would be extremely difficult to do. Per-player time warp would throw off the time balance, so for example you could see ships zooming by in LKO while you\u0027re docking with a station. No time warp at all would require hours to years of waiting, which nobody wants to do. The best solution for the time warp issue would be making multiplayer a turn-based game, which is still not fun compared to playing simultaneously. I\u0027m sure Squad will find a way to solve this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe things I would picture people doing together in KSP multiplayer would be things like space races, wars, and collaborative space programs. People would build space stations together (or destroy them), people would fly rockets and planes side-by-side, and have races on the Mun with rovers. It would be a whole lot of fun, but it won\u0027t happen for a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T18:02:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt will be awesome!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T20:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice to make stations and transit points with friends.
