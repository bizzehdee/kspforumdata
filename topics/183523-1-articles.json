I\u0027ve been playing for several months but I haven\u0027t\u00A0really made an advanced spacecraft before. Most of the time i just build jets or other random vehicles, and I\u0027ve recently been working on a satellite communications network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been spending most of my free time for the last week or so building a prototype for the Spaceship Endurance from Interstellar. I\u0027m well aware of the mod that allows you to get a realistic model for it, but I\u0027ve been trying to build my own out of stock parts. As far as I\u0027ve seen, nobody has made a photo-accurate Endurance without using mods. I plan on using it as a sort of gateway system to construct bases on other planets, where I could change which modules I wanted for each mission. I also plan on recreating movie scenes, like the docking scene, Lazarus Mission rescues,\u00A0or the black hole gravity assist, but instead with Kerbol. I found that if I go for a long range mission with fuel modules instead of payload modules, I can get my burn time to well over three and a half hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been building the engine modules using NERVs, and I sent one to space, but other than that, its been grounded. I\u0027m asking if anyone has any advice for me in the construction of my station. I\u0027m planning on launching it realistically; one module at a time, not some ultra-heavy misshapen rocket that carries it all up at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone has any advice about scale, engines, construction, assembly, or anything else, please help me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
