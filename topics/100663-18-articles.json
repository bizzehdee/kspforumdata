(Easy way to check: put in some deployable solar panels, bind them to an action group, and try to deploy them while the bay is closed. If they open, the bay isn\u0027t shielding anything.) I\u0027ve tried to [**add IScalarModule to FSanimateGeneric**](https://github.com/snjo/Firespitter/issues/121), but haven\u0027t succeeded (and it doesn\u0027t seem to have caught the attention of anyone more experienced than I).
