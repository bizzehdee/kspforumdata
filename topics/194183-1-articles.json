While orbiting, I jump to a random position in the orbit every time I exit non-physics time warp. Even going to 5x acceleration for \u0026lt;1 second could make me jump to the other side of Minmus. It seems that it might be related to an incorrect position of Minmus (but whether this is cause or effect I don\u0027t know), as I noticed on the map screen that Minmus is no longer on its orbit curve, but somehow closer to Kerbin than it should be. I\u0027m running \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E on 1.9.1 with most of the Near Future mods, as well as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, alarm clock,\u00A0 and [x] science. The weird thing is that this glitch so far only appeared on Minmus, and it seems to reoccur randomly, but is not continuously present (or at least to a significantly lower degree). Kerbin, the Mun, Eve, Gilly, etc. haven\u0027t shown this glitch yet. Has anyone experienced something similar, and/or knows how to solve this problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also see some flickering on the surface of Minmus, so I suspected it might be something to do with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E. I\u0027ve already tried uninstalling and reinstalling \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, but that did not seem to resolve the issue. I could uninstall \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E altogether, but I don\u0027t want to lose my clouds and city lights. And please no \u0022try uninstalling and reinstalling all of KSP\u0022 answers. I\u0027d rather keep that as a last resort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
