Continue fighting all the way up to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is worse. I am expending more effort on more pointless busywork.

Ship continues to drift, and comes to a stop several degrees off the node. Activate fine tune controls and make tiny taps until I am on the node, then activate Time acceleration to stop SAS messing it up. Come out of warp at burn point. During burn, must repeatedly correct for SAS doing naff-all to stay pointed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.Is.Worse.

This is not an issue normally, because you aim to design a balanced craft where you do not need 2 or 3 axis corrections at the same time. If your craft is imbalanced in a way that it is not able to be corrected by the available control surfaces (either by bad design, or by inducing instability for testing), then SAS won\u0027t help it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI forced the Areis 3A into the position it is in in your shot, going 200 m/s, and ASAS pitched right around and back to where it took over control from me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd your off-thrust rocket is not flying straight because of the Probe Core on it having low torque, engine trust vectoring range is too small for that stuff in ksp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe only problem I currently see with the SAS system, is that it should expect high torque requirement corrections after you make a high torque manual change.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt flips when apply a small amount of pitch.
