Looks like if you make your window more than 1450 wide, you will see it.\n\nWill fix it later"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-14T23:10:32Z","Content":"Ths fixes the issue of the window being off screen:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zmo8oqw4tvlq1b/NodeHelper-4-1.4.1-beta3.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zmo8oqw4tvlq1b/NodeHelper-4-1.4.1-beta3.zip?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jiraiyah","CreatedById":97667,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-15T03:32:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ths fixes the issue of the window being off screen:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zmo8oqw4tvlq1b/NodeHelper-4-1.4.1-beta3.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zmo8oqw4tvlq1b/NodeHelper-4-1.4.1-beta3.zip?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\nthanks"},{"CreatedByName":"COL.R.Neville","CreatedById":168067,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-15T14:19:57Z","Content":"how are you getting the node helper icon to show up. ive never been able to use dds files for toolbar icons and have them work. some super secret decoder ring i need to make it work?"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-15T16:29:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E.R.Neville said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E how are you getting the node helper icon to show up. ive never been able to use dds files for toolbar icons and have them work. some super secret decoder ring i need to make it work?\n\u003E \n\nLook at the Github repo:  [https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/NodeHelper](https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/NodeHelper)"},{"CreatedByName":"FiiZzioN","CreatedById":108954,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T05:43:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 11/14/2016 at 6:10 PM, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ths fixes the issue of the window being off screen:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zmo8oqw4tvlq1b/NodeHelper-4-1.4.1-beta3.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zmo8oqw4tvlq1b/NodeHelper-4-1.4.1-beta3.zip?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\n404, still have the file?"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T12:30:06Z","Content":"Recompiled, added code to display messges on screen and write file name to log file.\n\nall changes are pushed to Github\n\n[https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/NodeHelper/releases/tag/1.2.2b](https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/NodeHelper/releases/tag/1.2.2b)"},{"CreatedByName":"Skalou","CreatedById":133496,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-14T14:14:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 13/01/2017 at 1:30 PM, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Recompiled, added code to display messges on screen and write file name to log file.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E all changes are pushed to Github\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/NodeHelper/releases/tag/1.2.2b](https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/NodeHelper/releases/tag/1.2.2b)\n\u003E \n\nthank\u0027s for this update ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nbut I have a problem with the compressed  .dll incuded in the zip, i had to take the one from the masterbranch to replace it and make it works."},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-14T14:59:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 44 minutes ago, Skalou said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E thank\u0027s for this update ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E but I have a problem with the compressed  .dll incuded in the zip, i had to take the one from the masterbranch to replace it and make it works.\n\u003E \n\nTry this one:  [https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/NodeHelper/releases/tag/1.2.2c](https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/NodeHelper/releases/tag/1.2.2c)"},{"CreatedByName":"Skalou","CreatedById":133496,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-14T15:01:45Z","Content":"Seems to be Ok, thank you ![:rep:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/rep.png \u0022:rep:\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-14T15:35:00Z","Content":"\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).
