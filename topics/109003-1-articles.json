They were designed for ease of operation and to minimize cost and tech requirements, beginning simply and progressing in complexity as necessary parts and facilities are unlocked. All are pure stock.\n\nIf you\u0027re using the level-1 runway with these, taxi into the grass instead for a smoother takeoff.\n\n[Here\u0027s the list of Kerbin biomes, including KSC.](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin#List_of_biomes)\n\n![vzbxMWn.gif](https://i.imgur.com/vzbxMWn.gif)\n\n**AC-SJ1-1 \u0022Snail\u0022** is a KSC biome hopper. Its balance, high AoA and slight wing dihedral give it very low takeoff speeds and shallow stall angle, and a tendency to right itself on all three axes without SAS or control input. The engine is thrust-limited so it will snail through the air around 20 m/s, allowing ample time to choose a rooftop or parking lot to drop onto with its parachute. Taxi it to one of the KSC ground biomes or land on the SPH or VAB with the chute for some early science points.\n\nVal insists that this is actually a Bumblebee.\n\n**Facilities**: Level 1\n\n**Crew**: Any Kerman will do.\n\n**Science**: SciJr, Goo canister\n\n**Cost**:10,511 $\n\n**Mass**:4.3 t\n\n**Parts**:17\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **Tech required**:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1.
