I had a contract to activate an engine on an escape trajectory out of Minmus, but the previous stage ran out of fuel when I was still in orbit with a 1400 km apoapsis. So I started to wobble the rocket using \u0022A\u0022/\u0022D\u0022, the apoapsis went up and down between 1450 and 1350, I did my best to press the period key at the right time and got a 1420 km apoapsis. Back out of time warp, wobble again, time warp: 1435 km. I got it all the way up to escape trajectory step by step (above 2000 km!), so I could activate the next stage in the required conditions\u00A0and finished the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe time warp trick does not work if the wobble is too intense (cannot activate time warp during acceleration), but once the intensity of the wobble has decreased somewhat, it does work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI filed bug report 9131.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
