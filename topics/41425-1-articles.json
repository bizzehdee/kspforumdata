Until then it seems complicated and real tough. My best advice is to launch a small probe core and practice lining up phase angles and ejection angles. Also use maneuver nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, travelling to Duna or Eve is no tougher than going to Mun or Minmus. It requires very little additional D-V, especially if you aerobrake to close your orbit. The only big difference is lining up the planets. This is your phase angle. I use ksp.olex.biz that Crown linked above. Of course, you also need a mod to tell you the current phase angles in game. MechJeb can do this, Kerbal Alarm Clock can do this, and Protractor can do this, although each one does it a little different I believe. You can also look at your map and make a best guess. You don\u0027t have to be perfect, just pretty close is good enough. After your initial ejection burn, you will want to make another correction burn either right after you change from Kerbin to Kerbol SoI, or at your Ascending or Descending Node. Make sure you set Eve as your target to get your AN/DN to show up on the map.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
