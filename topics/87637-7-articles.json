One thing that the stock game doesn\u0027t allow is easy exploration beyond Kerbin. I\u0027ve explored every inch of the vicinity of KSC, because I could build a specialized vehicle to drive or fly where I wanted to go and try again if I failed. Beyond that small bubble that sort of exploration and experimentation is not possible, because you need to a build a time-consuming mission to even get there and if something goes wrong it\u0027ll take another mission to get back to where you were. It\u0027s a shame that vast swaths of the bodies beyond Kerbin go practically unexplored, because there\u0027s a lot of interesting details to be found.

Abstract the resources needed to a single \u0027ore\u0027 resource, add an excavator part to get it out of the soil and a smelter convert it to \u0027metal\u0027. Metal could then be used by the large (at least 3.75m) construction facility part. Using it would bring the player to a small VAB-like environment where they could build rovers, planes and small spacecraft. Once done, they\u0027d be launched from a launchpad part attached or nearby.
