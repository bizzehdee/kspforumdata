Sometimes, it crashes when I decouple my engine and fuel tank from my payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes opening chutes cause KSP to consume more RAM? That doesn\u0027t make any sense. The chutes are already loaded into RAM at the beginning. Also, in most of the error reports, it says I was using about 75% of my RAM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m at work right now and don\u0027t have access to the files, so I can\u0027t submit anything like that until later. Although this is the second craft and the second mission this has happened on, so I don\u0027t think it would be the .craft file. And for months before I started my career mode game, I was playing sandbox, repeatedly deorbiting huge rovers, with numerous parachutes, and never had the game crash when I was about to land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
