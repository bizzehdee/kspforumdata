On long trips, it\u0027s a hit or miss kinda thing.\n\nyeah I do wish I had tested the Banzai under physical time warp on land, it goes seriously fast outside of it (it can happily reach 75m/s on mildly uneven terrain without trouble!) but the moment I got into time warp the thing will just randomly explode and... well it\u0027s probably easier to show you the results of that...:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![tumblr_noydn2Wa3x1r0o48lo1_1280.png](https://41.media.tumblr.com/56d0bb24be71de3c4c3446ede86c9a02/tumblr_noydn2Wa3x1r0o48lo1_1280.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E I got blasted off at 250m/s initially, thankfully I saved, tried time warp again and the same thing happened, decided it wasn\u0027t a fault of the craft so much as a fault of time warp so I\u0027m carrying on just no timewarp over land!)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nand the craft itself:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![tumblr_noydv3keni1r0o48lo1_1280.png](https://41.media.tumblr.com/5ef7cded6c798ac211391f468d00df48/tumblr_noydv3keni1r0o48lo1_1280.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![tumblr_noydv3keni1r0o48lo2_1280.png](https://41.media.tumblr.com/e90c49c4eb42f676171777deca67a2cb/tumblr_noydv3keni1r0o48lo2_1280.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T11:19:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 11:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T12:47:22Z","Content":"Good luck, Squiggsy! I like the looks of your new ship.\n\nOn the issue of catching big air when warping, I\u0027ve had that happen before and ultimately decided it was caused by having too many wheels. Each time you hit a bump, the suspensions flex, and if you\u0027ve got a lot of wheels, under warp conditions the flexing can make a self-reinforcing pogostick-type oscillation, ultimately launching your vehicle.\n\nSo there are 3 basic options.\n\n#1 is eliminate all but the wheels on the corners. Your ride isn\u0027t so big that it really needs any more than 4 wheels on the ground to hold its weight.\n\n#2 is to lock the suspensions of some or all of the wheels. Maybe just lock the corners so the middle wheels can flex when going over ridges.\n\n#3 is to retract all wheels except those on the corners.\n\nAnyway, give these a try and see if any of them help."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T13:25:13Z","Content":"I get big air, but not because I warp.
