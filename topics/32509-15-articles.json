Anti-fighter weapons are either powered solely by RCS, (using radial thrusters or puffs) for guided missiles, or are sepatron-based. They are accurate and can knock out small ships, though are ineffective against much more than wing armor. Anti-fighter missiles are almost always .625m radius and have no warhead/penetrator. A basic anti-fighter missile might consist of a hex probe core, with an in-line rcs tank, plus RCS thrusters to maneuver and accelerate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnti-ship missiles: This is the standard fare of medium to large ships, and is capable of punching through wing armor easily, and maybe some steel-based. These are typically either LFO or sepatron-based (occasionally RT-5s), and sacrifice a little bit of accuracy for power and effectiveness. These missiles are typically tipped with I-beams or other warheads (ruggedized vehicluar wheels and fixed landing gear have high crash tolerances, too) to help punch through armor. A basic anti-ship missile is an FTL-200 with four radial engines, two I-beams, and a RCS system to aim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnti-capital missiles: These are the heavy weapons of a fleet. They are designed to punch through the heaviest armor and destroy ships in one shot. Aerospikes and RT-5s are typically found on anti-capital missiles. A basic anti-capitol missile is a RT-5 with a probe core and four I-beams attached to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeapons can be guided or unguided (LFO designs typically being guided and solid-fuel ones typically being unguided), and their usage is up to preference. Guided missiles are more accurate, at the cost of being larger, slower, and less effective at short range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, I have comparatively little experience, compared to Zekes or Spartwo, but I hope you appreciate my two cents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScriptKitt3h","CreatedById":82780,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T03:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222552012\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002232509\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462067140\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022135127\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Matuchkin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Matuchkin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat brings me to a new, very simple question.

These also are often equipped with RCS thrusters/vernor engines for fine-tuning impact trajectories at range.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003E-Capital Ship missiles\u003C/em\u003E:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese are what is often referred to as \u0022shipkiller\u0022 or ASM (anti-ship missile) weapons: guided, (normally) 1.25 meter-ish weapons, often with multiple LF\u002BO engines (RCS is not really used as the main propulsion on these from what I\u0027ve seen) and plenty of SAS/RCS/Vernor control for precision strikes at range. Warheads and missile designs range from advanced penetrator systems to \u0022popper\u0022 style weapons that explode into clippy shrapnel\u002Bprovide strong kinetic impact damage, to slug-style missiles that strike with enough high-speed mass to fracture hulls. Guided 1.25 meter ASMs are more often than not a serious threat to most warships, as the designs currently in use by many players are often based around defeating the most durably-armored ships out there (a good example is how Zekes\u0027 Drek-series warships essentially lead to an arms race for a bit, in order to defeat his armor design). Guided ASMs are also often used in smaller numbers than their unguided brethren, as they pack a much larger punch per shot than simpler, unguided munitions, and also are higher part count per unit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, there\u0027s also\u003Cstrong\u003E rocket cannons\u003C/strong\u003E (rocket engine(s) propelling objects out at high velocity\u00A0via thrusting), which generally come in two varieties: scatterguns and mass drivers. Scatterguns function much like their IRL namesake- shooting high-speed clouds of high-impact shrapnel at a target, making it hard to avoid incoming fire and easier to score multiple hits in quick succession. These cannons often can be fired quite rapidly, via ammo \u0022clips\u0022 of launchable projectiles inside the cannon\u0027s launch tube/barrel. In addition, mass drivers function much like their spread-shot cousins, but instead fire unguided and/or guided rounds individually, allowing for more precise shooting (guided rounds could be equipped with RCS/vernor/LF\u002BO thrusters for course correction).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I will mention, though, that rocket cannons do pretty much require line-of-sight on the target within a decently close range, unlike guided ASMs which can be fired from even beyond visual loading range if one is skilled at guiding them in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-01T04:01:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2016 04:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ScriptKitt3h\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matuchkin","CreatedById":135127,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T04:56:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome very useful information I\u0027m getting! \u003Cstrong\u003EHow about hull angle?
