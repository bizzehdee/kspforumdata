This I don\u0027t think is a KSP glitch, but I got here through a series of game crashes first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was re-entering the atmosphere early on in my hard career mode, my vessel flipped over and burned up and I had to redesign a new one. I built essentially a stack of FL-T200s with a Swivel engine on it. That was too tall so I offset it into the pod a tiny bit until it was small enough for the tier 1 launchpad. Pressed launch with Jeb and two tourists inside and the game crashed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...this is where I didn\u0027t make a copy KSP.log before starting it again. I did scroll through and saw a lot of stuff about wheel modules not working or something when the game was loading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoad to menu, open save, click on vessel sitting on launchpad, crash again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpen game again, it loads about 100 pixels tall and I can\u0027t click on anything. I tried to resize the window and it snapped to show just the window bar at the top and wouldn\u0027t budge again. Closed KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpen AGAIN, it instantly loads into the unusable window bar thing and won\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting desperate, I removed all my mods and tried to launch on both x86 and x64, neither of them actually did anything when I clicked them, nor showed up as a process in system monitor. I rebooted my computer, redownloaded KSP, copied from my SSD to my HDD and still got nothing. This is probably an issue on mine rather than KSP\u0027s side but the game crash before this happened did make me suspicious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast-minute update before posting: I did get KSP to open by running it as root from the command line, and it doesn\u0027t crash on loading the vessel. I blame the computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T01:36:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindowed mode is thoroughly borked ATM.
