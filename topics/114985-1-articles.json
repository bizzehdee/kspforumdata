The vertical parts of the burns should cancel out and leave you with the two horizontal parts which you can make smaller than one direct horizontal burst depending on your angle. Or you make their sum slightly bigger and do a third burn in the other horizontal direction.\n\nCan one limit thrust on RCS ports?"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T21:49:08Z","Content":"Use thrust limiter on engines.

Like you have discovered with your Communitron 32, going over just a bit will have bad consequences. If you are approaching a distance limitation with your deployment, best to rethink it and consider what you are trying to accomplish. \n\nAs far as getting your birds to sit pretty exactly where they should, well that is a matter of theory vs application... 2868.75 km orbit may seem like perfection, but in reality 100% coverage is the goal, and there are far more ways of accomplishing that than a synchronous orbit.
