(Kerbal has a 600 km radius.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick and dirty method is to equalize the distance between all three sats, given they are at the same altitude (and inclination!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith RT, setting (and respecting) the tolerances for distances in your constellation is a priority. Like you have discovered with your Communitron 32, going over just a bit will have bad consequences. If you are approaching a distance limitation with your deployment, best to rethink it and consider what you are trying to accomplish. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as getting your birds to sit pretty exactly where they should, well that is a matter of theory vs application... 2868.75 km orbit may seem like perfection, but in reality 100% coverage is the goal, and there are far more ways of accomplishing that than a synchronous orbit. (If using a synchronous orbit to relay to Mission Control, why need a second one also in synchronous orbit? If their primary purpose is redundancy, then remove the need for \u0022synchronous\u0022 on your other satellites.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T18:13:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup.
