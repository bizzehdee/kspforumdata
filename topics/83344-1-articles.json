I choose mine because, to be blunt, I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and I\u0027d rather not leave my stuff in a place where people cannot modify it.

Just as having something in a different license is someone else\u0027s choice.

Karbonite was not created to kill off Kethane. It was created because not so nice stuff got bundled with Kethane, and there was no way for someone to fork it and get rid of it. That\u0027s the flip side of that choice (and again, let\u0027s emphasize choice). IMO forks are good. Forks are where you get innovation and improvements. Multiple contributors and collaborators (again, IMO) are also good. Most of the mods I have, or the things I add to them, are either the result of collaborations, or based on absorbing in changes from the community (or at the very least, letting them collectively steer things). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also good stuff in the case of KSPI because there was a permissive license in place. But again, Fractal chose that. The flip side is that when he comes back, he now has a fork... so then the question of divergence or rolling back in come into play (thus the downside). IMO the good outweighs the bad, but that\u0027s still for everyone to make a choice on - provided it\u0027s an educated choice.

In the end the community is going to figure out how to get the stuff they want. So one reason (let\u0027s not use issues as noted above) to go open is it makes it easier to accept change, and encourages innovation. Your flip side is going to be that you will lose creative control. And that latter case IMO is one that\u0027s tough for folks. Some will see it as an opportunity to pull in and curate the very best derivatives (the overlay Cyrik is making for ORS is downright sweet), and others will see it as a constant risk to the cohesion of their vision for the mod. Neither answer is right, but folks should not be surprised if someone decides they want to do the same thing in a different/better way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are things I don\u0027t like about KAS... and bits of code I would have preferred to just have rolled in, because it enhances the overall mod. But not really an option given it\u0027s licensing model (yes, I am aware I can still do a pull request... but call it a principle thing. IMO taking in modifications to a closed license mod is like having your cake and eating mine too). So choices. I\u0027ll just plink away at my own mod that grabs stuff and sticks stuff on things, because that\u0027s where I (again, my choice) feel there\u0027s a path to innovation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T03:14:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d just like to point out, as I did on the KAS thread (although apparently no one concerned \u003Cem\u003Eread it\u003C/em\u003E), that the issue of abandonment is rather overblown.

That thread was locked, the issue appeared as a frustration in the KAS thread, and I responded with my opinions in that thread, but my opinions are more about licensing in general and not directly related to KAS. For me it\u0027s just an interesting topic of discussion, which doesn\u0027t need to be heated, as it\u0027s just peoples opinions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ferram4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhh, I see that now, well, that\u0027s why we have discussions, to find the flaws in our opinions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I noticed yesterday after jumping into the discussion, is there doesn\u0027t seem to be a list of mods and licenses. The requirement of having a license specified is newer than some of the mods. I sort of have a goal this weekend to see if I can scrap the forums and make a list with licenses, as I think having actual data directly related to the KSP mod scene would be handy with the discussion about licenses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wonder how much of this is an issue due to hindsight... by that I mean, no one cared (no license was required, people probably had a lax respect for the default all rights reserved), then we had to care (cause spyware is bad), and then people got to work on competing mods due to licensing reasons. (I\u0027m fine with modstats btw, giving mod devs info should mean better mods, the opt-in vs opt-out is a whole another topic that many people on the planet debate.) It\u0027s also interesting to me on a professional level, as the product I work on could have the exact same issue (although with only scripting, no dlls/etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I\u0027m attempting but probably failing at, is I\u0027m not attempting to suggest karbonite is better than kethane (heck, it probably wouldn\u0027t even exist if kethane did not), it\u0027s just those two mods seem to be the at the crux of the licensing issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also find it interesting, when looking this up on games that are not KSP, what happens if someone submits a language pack to a restricted licensed mod, but the terms of that weren\u0027t clearly defined. Is it now the property of the first mod dev by the nature of the submission, is there an implied right granted to use those changes? How does that work for KSP mods, if I make a patch for More Struts (just an example), and that patch is accepted by the More Struts dev, what\u0027s my license to those changes I created?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I need to write faster... so many responses before I could respond to ferram4.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-30T03:21:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2014 03:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by fathed\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T03:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELicenses have been required for a damn long time, and most of the mods that existed before licenses were required are dead and gone.
