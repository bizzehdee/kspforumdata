I finally found Scott Manley\u0027s vids and even tho they weren\u0027t tutorials, gave me enough clues how to make this work.\n\n#2- I kept crashing on the Mun real hard. I couldn\u0027t land properly. Until I found out that the circle with the \u0022X\u0022 in it to cancel my momentum properly. Then it was only 1-2 tries until I figured how to land.\n\n#3- Couldn\u0027t build good Mun rovers. With the help of this forums for nifty tricks (wider weel base, low center of mass, disabling breaks on forward wheels, etc) I made 2 very nice Mun rovers, one heavy for science, and one light for speed.\n\nHaving a Delta-V calculator (Kerbal Engineering) was a game changer for me tho, it made Inter-planetary possible and easy.\n\nThe rest really came naturally as I was playing along... Docking wasn\u0027t that hard for me (and I don\u0027t even use the docking mode that is provided in-game).\n\nI still transfer without transfer windows, because when I want to get somewhere I go somewhere, and I don\u0027t feel like installing the (excellent) mod for that.\n\nI also optimized my launches quite a lot thanks to 5th Horseman\u0027s videos, cutting dV for orbit by at least a grand (sometimes more).\n\nBut really, once I had gotten point 1-3 correctly I was all set.\n\nAll and All must\u0027ve took 1 month for these all things considered.\n\nA friend that I had over when I was 3 weeks old in KSP came back at one point last xmast and his reaction was \u0022Wow, you really improved, you need to teach me stuff)\n\nFun to know you\u0027re getting better =)"},{"CreatedByName":"krillin678","CreatedById":79985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T17:34:09Z","Content":"I have had many learning walls.

My very first launch ever in KSP involved a physics experiment pitting a rocket engine against a parachute. Once I got that sorted out, things went pretty well until I discovered Mystery Goo. I could not for the life of me figure out how the heck I was supposed to fly a rocket to space with one of those things attached to it. \n\nThen I made two discoveries:\n\n1. Add two for balance!\n2.

With autopilots everything seemes easy, but after i broke through that, ive actually started learning abotu how stuff works in this game.\n\nI avoided mods for quite a while, but IMO mechjeb shouldn\u0027t be a mod -- it should be stock. Or at least, most of it should be. And it seems that Squad somewhat agrees, because they keep putting parts of the mechjeb functionality into the game.\n\nI\u0027m an engineer, personally, and I am a lot more into designing ships and planning out the overall space program than I am into hand-flying the ships. So mechjeb is perfect for me. I don\u0027t think of it as \u0022cheating\u0022, but just as a way to let me focus more on the parts that are fun for me. It\u0027s good that the game is open enough to allow people choice like this.\n\nI think I\u0027ve done everything by hand that mechjeb does (at least once, anyway), but mostly I\u0027m happy to use mechjeb.
