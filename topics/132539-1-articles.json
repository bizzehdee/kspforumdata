To that end, I have been using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/104505-10x-kerbokatz-smallutilities-v125-18092015-now-with-autobalancinglandingleg/\u0022\u003EKerbokatz\u0027 FPS Viewer and Physical Time ratio viewer\u003C/a\u003E to see how the game is running under different platforms. I\u0027ve got KSP installed on Windows Vista and Linux (Ubuntu 15.04). I flew the Dynawing stock craft, and watched the reported Physical Time ration, and here are the results:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhysical time ratio, using a physics time step of 0.02. (Higher is better).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows Vista, DX9: ~58%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows Vista, DX11: ~50%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinux x64, OpenGL: ~50%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows Vista, OpenGL: ~35%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with my hardware, DX9 gets the best performance (though at the cost of higher memory usage as others have discussed). DX11 and Linux OpenGL, and Windows OpenGL is significantly worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing I noticed: Under DX11 and OpenGL, the performance drops to about 25% at the default zoom, but if I zoom out just a bit (so the craft fills about 1/2 the screen vertically) the performance increases to the above values. This doesn\u0027t happen on DX9. It performed the same regardless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, Physical Time Ratio Viewer has an option to display the physics time-step. I noticed that if I increase the physical time-warp, the physics time step goes up proportionally, but then doesn\u0027t come back down when reducing the physics time warp. The effect on performance is noticeable, so I don\u0027t think it is just the mod not recording it correctly. It seems like the mod is getting it right, and the game isn\u0027t resetting the physics time-step when warping down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComputer specs, for the curious: Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 overclocked to 3.78GHz;\u00A0Nvidia GTX 960, playing at 1080p with a few graphics mods (EVE, scatterer, Real Plume).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, these are just some observations I made. Maybe they\u0027ll help someone else figure out how they want to run their setup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
