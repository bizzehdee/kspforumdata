Maintaining a heading on the horizon (-5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 min) should be enough of a dive. The important bit is to stop wasting thrust fighting both gravity and transonic drag. Even my turbo jet SSTOs flatten out to go super sonic so they can hit the power band sooner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of diving is to overcome transonic drag. Once you hit 600 m/s you have completely left the drag wall and can pull up gradually.

It needs to be going fast before it can deliver peak thrust. What people see in here as a transonic barrier is really more that their engines aren\u0027t going fast enough to start delivering the power required to make them go faster. The \u0027dive\u0027 adds speed, which adds engine power, which adds more speed. It\u0027s nothing to do with the sound barrier and everything to do with the mechanics of how the engines work. Turbojets power up at lower speeds than turboramjets, which power up at lower speeds than rapiers. That\u0027s why adding a \u0022lesser\u0022 engine to your stack can boost the performance and get you up over the line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SSTOs I\u0027m using mostly in my career at the moment are both turboram driven with 909s. My lightest one, useful for launching probes of around 1t uses one and a 909. Not as good a TWR as a 45 but lighter and more efficient (at 20km the ISP is very near vac numbers anyway.) The drawback is that with less thrust you need a longer burn with less margin to muck about, especially with heavier payloads onboard. I like to be heading at ~900-1km/sec (more is better) at 20km at an angle of around 20 degrees. That\u0027ll generally give me a time to Ap around a minute.. That gives me time to accelerate with only a minimal deflection from prograde to hold my Ap out in front and keep it rising while I get up to escape velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah.. I\u0027ve generally found that having to hang around building speed in atmosphere is ultimately wasteful... For me, anyway. If you\u0027re having to level off or dive to get speed up, you probably need more air TWR.. either lighten your load up a bit (it\u0027s amazing how much difference a little weight can make, especially with that \u0027more speed = more thrust = more speed\u0027 mechanic in the new engines, it\u0027s a really exponential change) or find a way to get a bit more engine in there... but be aware, more engine = more weight and more fuel, which is also more weight.. Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and accept the limitations of your launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
