A strong sneeze will send almost anything into orbit so its prety much personal preferance. That said I prefer refinery\u0027s on the ground with a fuel depot in orbit and a tanker shutteling between the 2. What I do is design my tanker with a reserve tank that holds just enough fuel to get down from the orbital station and land at the base (with apropreate safety margins). This way I\u0027m carrying no more fuel than I need on the way down. I then top off at the refinery and return to the depot, repeat as needed.\n\nPuting the refinery in orbit can be done but you loose some effiency due to needing to carry your accent fuel down to the planet as well requireing even more fuel for the landing stage. Instead of needing to burn 100 units to land compleatly empty you\u0027ll probaly be burning 150 units due to all the extra fuel weight your luging down to the planet.
