Please keep that in mind.\n\nWhile some of you may not all be overly impressed or even minorly happy with the aerodynamics changes that 1.0 (and the subsequent patches) that brought, it is important to remember one thing : You have many options that can be tweaked.\n\nFirst of all, the physics.cfg found in the KSP sub-directory contains all of the options used to configure the new aerodynamics system in 1.0. All of them. You can change drag, lift, thermal, and mach options very easily. You can go back to the old souposphere. You can remove the atmospheres entirely. \n\nSecondly, if physics.cfg doesn\u0027t contain the options you want, ferram4\u0027s Ferram Aerodynamics Reasearch (FAR or nuFAR) has a great deal of customization and even more realism available than the stock physics.cfg.\n\nSo please, before you post that thread complaining about how drag is too high, take a peek at physics.cfg and change the values around until you have what you want.\n\nPicture of alt\u002Bf12 aero debug menu - change your physics values in-game until they\u0027re just right!
