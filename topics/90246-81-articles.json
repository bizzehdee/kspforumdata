That is definitely a flaw in the CKAN model, but testing every metadata change is simply not a practical goal for CKAN maintainers. CKAN is tracking over a thousand mods, and there are only a handful of contributors. The initial metadata addition is tested, although the automated CKAN integration KerbalStuff implemented is somewhat of a hack job, and I\u0027m not sure how thorough the testing of any submissions it puts in that get past the automated verification checks (which is not a lot).

Only modification I\u0027d add is that I personally (and this probably doesn\u0027t extend to all other modders that have problems with CKAN), generally find the idea that modders should fix CKAN\u0027s issues to be the kind of situation that creates a moral hazard. If CKAN can create an issue for modders, and then modders can be relied on to step in to fix it (under pain of users clogging support channels until they do), what incentive does CKAN have to make sure that things work well?

Having now read a lot more of your crusade against CKAN, I think part of the trouble I had might have been the uninstall of FAR not cleaning up the FAR-created files, causing other mods to think FAR was installed when it wasn\u0027t. I\u0027ve been going through the hassle of changing Linux graphics drivers, that involved a lot more serious computer issues for me than whether any particular mod was working. I gather the trouble with the incorrect ModuleFlightIntegrator version was caused by your inconsistent version numbering not alpha-sorting correctly.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, it might work now after I\u0027ve screamed enough, but that\u0027s not guaranteed for the next FAR or KSP update.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EOf course not. Nothing is guaranteed to be perfect straight away. Especially since your antipathy towards CKAN means you aren\u0027t helping CKAN to handle FAR properly.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T18:27:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m writing a set of netkan files for the Arkas mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are four configuration options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

honor a modders request not to be listed? Honestly even if CKAN has a legal right to do so that constitutes an act of bad faith between CKAN and modders, and is poor conduct in general. Basically It\u0027s not how you make friends. I\u0027m of the growing opinion that farram4 should seek for a change of forum rules for mod management services like ckan so that they can\u0027t list a mod against a modders wishes under penalty of the services discussion being removed from the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPressuring a modder into supporting any system under penalty of support requests is wrong. If CKAN wants to be believed that they are supporting FAR under their own efforts and not generating trouble for farram4 to pressure him then they would delist FAR until they have an extensively tested and working set up and when an update comes they can delist it again until they can generate another stable copy. Similar to how things are done in linux repositories you don\u0027t make something available to the end user until it works that simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut really complying with farram4 is a undeniably reasonable request. The law of navigation is that the more maneuverable yields to the least maneuverable. Ckan can more easily maneuver to delist FAR at farram4\u0027s request than farram4 can maneuver to support it. So the party at fault here who should be bending over backwards is CKAN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure entitled users will complain during periods when FAR isn\u0027t available at first, but they will come to accept the routine eventually and its for the best to foster a good relationship between the mod management service and the mod other wise all that\u0027s left for farram4 is the nuclear option of suspending FAR development until CKAN folds(Ckan claims to need FAR not the other way around) or someone who wants to put up with CKAN adopts it (highly unlikely)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
