Specifically, it was this picture of Atlantis during (probably after) reentry on its final mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/135/135graphics/fd14/072111_entry2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022072111_entry2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this piqued my interest, because if that trail is to be believed, then it would seem like the orbiter drops almost straight down for reentry, which doesn\u0027t seem right. Not only does it seem confusing as to how that would allow the orbiter to actually gain any horizontal speed at all (and thus be able to glide), but it also seems like it\u0027d be a lot more dangerous than the way I presumed reentry was performed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo whats the skinny here? Did Atlantis really drop straight down like that, or is that trail not what reentry would have looked like?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T22:27:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re looking at the trajectory the wrong way around. The really bright part (and the sudden edge) is at the top of the picture; that\u0027s probably the Orbiter, which has gone from the bottom of this picture to the top. The shape of the trajectory on the picture is then more a function of perspective than anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T22:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that since Atlantis is coming almost directly \u0022towards\u0022 the craft that took the picture, its angle of reentry appears to be much steeper than it really is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Shuttles had enough fuel left after making orbit to knock a few hundred m/s off their orbital velocity, but not nearly enough to fall straight down, which would require much, much, much more Delta-V. Imaging a Kerbin orbit with the apoapsis at 100 km and the periapsis at 10km or so. This is about the eccentricity that the Shuttle\u0027s path had returning from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, the Shuttle actually came into the atmosphere at an angle far lower than its actual glideslope at landing. It then went into a steeper dive after burning off much of its velocity, only to pull up immediately before landing to lower its vertical velocity to near-zero.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T23:18:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe more and more I look at it, is it that the trail isn\u0027t actually going straight down but just looks like it because there\u0027s no reference next to it?
