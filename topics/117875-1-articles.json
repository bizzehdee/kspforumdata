I\u0027m going for something that WORKS similarly and has more or less the same form and layout. Hopefully it will look good on it\u0027s own merits, but make no mistake - it WILL be a Battlestar type of ship. Specifically There will be hanger bays in pods to port and starboard, a generally wedge shaped front end and a set of massive engines at the rear of the main body. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - though I do use mods, I\u0027m going to do my best to get it into space legit. That means it\u0027s going up in several pieces and will be assembled in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - here\u0027s what I\u0027ve got so far. The hanger pod design, using B9\u0027s HX series of parts plus BD Armory and some bits from LLL. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SqfH4ht.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SqfH4ht.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hanger pod design is not fully finished yet, but it\u0027s 95% there. What\u0027s left is to figure out where the docking ports for the sub-craft will go as well as placing extras such as supplemental lighting. I also fully intend to utilize KAS and KIS for some things, such as refueling and even limited repairs. I\u0027m pretty happy with the overall result. Especially since I\u0027ve managed to keep the part count down around 94 parts! Hopefully I\u0027ll be able to keep the fully assembled craft under 250! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1oKiKaN.png\u0022 alt=\u00221oKiKaN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll notice the placement of the dual (and giant!) docking clamps on one side. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dktskuV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dktskuV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xkE4Qzh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xkE4Qzh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other side had a nice \u0022armored rib\u0022 look to it that evokes but doesn\u0027t copy that of the armor (and launch ports) of the Galactica. If you look closely this is one of the best views to spot the armament - mostly facing outward. There are LLL Cannon Turrets and 8 BD Armory 50-Cal turrets spaced around the hull. 2 each are positioned above and below the hanger entrances to discourage other fighters or (hopefully) shoot down any incoming missiles from getting inside the hanger! There\u0027s a power plant producing frankly insane amounts of power. But the ones in these hanger pods are really just auxiliary back-up units. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pRwirpP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pRwirpP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0pGnAx0.png\u0022 alt=\u00220pGnAx0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from the asymmetry to port and starboard, all the details of the hanger pod design are mirrored so that I only had to create ONE design and not do major work flipping all the hull elements for two separate hangers! All I have to do is get two of the same type into orbit safely and then the main ship can dock with them and it doesn\u0027t matter which side goes where because both work on either. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zXvcuPe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zXvcuPe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese hangers don\u0027t have any engines themselves, but they do have a LOT of fuel and will be able to feed boosters which will be clamped to them for delivery to orbit. And they are perfectly balanced so there shouldn\u0027t be any oddities with weight distribution causing RUD events during the launch phase. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the easy part, though, I suspect. And I\u0027m wondering if the main body of the ship will go up in one piece or need to be split up. In any case, once I get the overall design nailed down, I\u0027ll check it in the SPH/VAB for thrust balance overall before sending the separate parts up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, I\u0027ve got my own take on a Viper Mk II, and two of these will fit side by side in that hanger above!

Are all those interior space shots inside the hanger blocks or inside the main body? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see that the limitations of .90 limited the way you could place the various large sections. (I don\u0027t think we had the re-positioning and fine rotation tools back then, did we? I kinda skipped .90 and up through 1.03 and kept playing my .25 saves. Didn\u0027t really start with the up-to-date game again until 1.04) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve learned some interesting things the last couple of days in regards to size tweaking and sliding parts around. It makes balancing things a lot more do-able in terms of tweaking the center of gravity and thrust. Plus it can make things look closer to what you really intend. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example - I realized that unless I got a hanger extend mod or went with extra-planetary ship-building (which I may still do) that it\u0027s difficult to impossible to balance test the entire full sized ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd by extension, that meant that despite getting the shapes of the middle block, the hangers, the nose, and the engines right, I couldn\u0027t test the whole thing. And THAT meant I was getting WAY ahead of myself in terms of design. I could be going down a path that led to a design dead-end, get frustrated, and give up prematurely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided to ramp things back a bit. And go with something smaller, less accurate to scale and form, but easier to manage in terms of learning how to balance the COG and thrust factors of a form like a Battlestar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBehold - the pocket Battlestar test article! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V0ec7Fw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022V0ec7Fw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SaP7O3t.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SaP7O3t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s almost cute isn\u0027t it? Heh. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hangers are just there for looks and balance, not really meant to be anything full-scale to hold things (though they could handle some smaller designs). My Viper II design would just BARELY... not fit. The wings would scrape. So they\u0027re just there as place holders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main point here was to LEARN. Learn how to balance the COG and thrust lines. A Battlestar - with the way it\u0027s engines sit high - does not appear to thrust through the center of gravity. This is less of an issue with the Nu BSG designs, as they appear more balanced. So they are where I\u0027m drawing the majority of my inspiration from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the intent was to learn more about pulling the various blocks around on a fully realized B9 HX ship, as well as size-tweaking of parts and such, etc, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may notice in the above version that I did what you did, Azimech. I wound up with a vertically aligned engine block. This... turned out to have issues. As I will get to momentarily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway - I managed to keep the part count relatively low on this design. RELATIVELY, I say. For any ship this size made out of normal parts, I\u0027m sure it would be around 5-600 parts. But that\u0027s the great thing about the B9 HX blocks. You can build things at a huge scale with lower part counts. This design overall varied between 230 and 280 parts as I did various tweaks. But it never went over 300. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a lot of the part count was actually struts! I think I might\u0027ve been over-doing it on the struts actually. I could probably afford to cut back by almost 50% on the amount of struts I was using. But I wanted something that would hold together under some rough treatment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch as this - I fully intended to use a gravity hack to get the thing into the air long enough to get up some speed on the main engines. But I forgot a main lesson that sometimes even afflicts Scott Manley - to hilarious results! CHECK YO STAGING!!!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hu2XHW5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hu2XHW5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zOE03WG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zOE03WG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rtf46XH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rtf46XH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least it\u0027s a TOUGH little big ship! It survived falling and destroying the runway and only lost one engine and some RCS blocks! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway - I did the gravity hack to get off the runway and then discovered the problems with the engine layout. I THOUGHT I\u0027d balanced it properly in the SPH, or at least came close. But close isn\u0027t good enough. Particularly with something this size that takes so long to turn. It has to be RIGHT on the perfect line. Or you\u0027ll be left with a set of engines you can barely use! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZbIPwGP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZbIPwGP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was frantically messing around with the thrust limiters on the top row of engines ramping them up and down trying to balance the control. After a while I realized I wasn\u0027t really getting anywhere with this design version and reverted back to the hanger - but on the positive side I\u0027d learned a few more things! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) With something this large and with a shape like this you\u0027ve got to be PERFECT in your thrust/COG balance from the start. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Something this big needs a LOT of control authority. I hadn\u0027t given it enough reaction wheels. I ran out of RCS very early on and had to hack infinite RCS fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Related - more RCS Fuel tankage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALSO - a weird bug kept dogging me. Random launch clamps spawning and sometimes following me through the sky! Not sure if this is a problem with the B9 HX parts or just an artifact of trying to launch something this big and the game going wonky. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IwgGaX0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IwgGaX0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - back to the hanger, for the next version of the Pocket Battlestar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time I did a lot more with tweakscale. Plus using the off-center and rotation controls to refine the design. And this was the latest result: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G6F9Uh8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022G6F9Uh8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qiWPYBK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qiWPYBK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmediately you\u0027ll notice that the engine block design is a LOT closer to the show. I downscaled the engines and many of the connecting parts so that I could get the double-4 engine rows. Also much of the ship up to the midline has various bits tweaked and moved around if you look closely. More fuel and RCS tanks etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - to sidestep the clamp bug I decided to dispense with the launch clamps and use the large B9 Landing Gear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gzJkEsY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gzJkEsY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time I managed to get the thrust line perfectly balanced through the center of gravity. And the COG itself right through the main connecting block (the root part) in the center of the ship. I had placed a VTOL thruster right under it - though I knew it would never lift without a gravity hack. That was okay - again, all I wanted to do was hack gravity long enough to stand the thing on it\u0027s tail and use the main thrusters without having to go to the trouble of designing a set of disposable launch boosters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - note that each of the 8 main thruster blocks also has an associated pair of reaction wheels. There\u0027s also a LOT of RCS blocks back there. More control authority! (Also - the middle 2 top engines are thrust limited to 50% - which was the final tweak that finally got the thrust line perfectly lined up with the COG)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - I spawned the thing onto the runway, and actually managed NOT to break it!

But not because I didn\u0027t have enough! It was the balance problem showing up again. With the fuel at a lower level, the COG had shifted and I needed to leave the fuel where it was for balance. I\u0027ll have to go back again to the hanger and remove all the fuel and try to balance it again between fully fueled and not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALSO - a design like this is almost going to REQUIRE TAC fuel balancer. And maybe the dynamic balanced thrust mod too. I have the former. I used to have the latter on my .25 save. Need to add it again. It might help in automatically balancing the engine thrust properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was using MecJeb\u0027s automated liftoff control, but then I noticed that I wasn\u0027t gaining altitude anymore. In fact I was starting to fall in front of the apoapsis and start on a slow downslope sub-orbital trajectory. But continuing to gain speed. So I decided - to hell with it - lets just see if we can gain enough speed - and if the ship can hold together through the heat while it does it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H3ZxfDo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022H3ZxfDo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F25eV5m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022F25eV5m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd...

This was after all, just a theoretical test after all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - what I learned, in summary: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Thrust line through the center of gravity IS in fact possible to do with a shape like the Galactica. But you have to be PERFECT with it. Something that big does not react quickly, even at the smaller scale of the Pocket Battlestar test vehicle. The real thing will be a BEAST to turn, even in space. So the balance better be as perfect as it can get in both fueled and near empty fuel tankage set ups. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Control authority, Control Authority, CONTROL AUTHORITY!!! LOTS of reaction wheels everywhere they can be fit in! RCS can only do so much! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Struts are important, but you can go too far with them. Especially for something that\u0027s ONLY supposed to maneuver in orbit. I can afford to cut back to bare minimum and reduce part count on the final design I think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I\u0027ve GOT to find some way to build/view the entire package assembled. I\u0027ll have to install hanger extender if it will work. But now I know it IS possible to get the shape and the balance right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Tweakscale will be a must-have. It was essential even on the \u0022small\u0022 test article in getting the thrust balance close to right. (And I still messed up because I didn\u0027t do a balance pass with empty fuel tanks. I\u0027ll correct that on my next design pass.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I want the various pieces to be launch-able for people who don\u0027t have extra-planetary launch pads or hanger extender mods. But it\u0027s going to be DAMN difficult getting even the individual sections off the ground if my experiences here are any indication. I DON\u0027T like hacking/cheats except for specific purposes such as testing specific things like the above. I don\u0027t want to force it on other people either. I will do my best to get launch packages set up for lofting the sections into orbit. But no guarantees. I\u0027ll make sure this thing can fly when assembled in orbit. But I\u0027m still not sure how that\u0027s going to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may add further thoughts later. But that\u0027s all I can think of for now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh - one last thing - Nertea\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101699-1-04-Mark-IV-Spaceplane-System-The-redo-everything-update-bigger-and-better-%2824-07-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMk 4 Spaceplane\u003C/a\u003E cockpit makes a great combined \u0022Bridge/CIC\u0022 if you clip it into the nose at the right angle.
