I\u0027ve seen this type of argument in flight sims where the serious pilots, i.e. the ones that fly only big iron complain that the small plane users who want better terrain are wasting the time and efforts of developers with eye candy demands. Time that could be better spent on making the big iron simulation better.

The Mod creator gets a gold star from me for effort in building this mod. The newest pre release build is astounding, Jeb can launch, orbit, land, dock, transfer all by itself. It gives data to the user if needed and its accurate to my assumption. Sometimes it does seem to use A LOT more fuel opposed to when I am at the controls. When I fly by WASD there are times I can complete a complete launch,orbit,docking, and landing, some to most times successful. Personally I consider myself a tester of all others creations, the game being in alpha is one of them in constant testing, along with all mods and parts created.
