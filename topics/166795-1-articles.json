It is the Squad-recommended way to fix the situation if those two files should get corrupted -- and is recommended\u00A0as one testing step when your game starts acting funny. If you honestly think that rebuilding those files changes things -- save a copy of those two files just after you rebuild them, and do a diff on the files when you start to suspect they may have been changed.
