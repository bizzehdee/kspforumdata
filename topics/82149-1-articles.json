OP, have you done an orbital rendezvous before with anything? If not, then do not even thing about attempting to put Jeb in orbit! There are a billion things that could go wrong. The biggest one being that your lunar intercept will put you in an orbit in the opposite direction that Jeb is going in. You would have burn alot of fuel to correct the orbit and then burn even more to catch up with Jeb. I think a plain and simple rescue mission, try to land right on top of where he is, it may take some practice to get close to him.

Why I\u0027d strongly recommend a mod such as Kerbal Engineer Redux or Mechjeb. Both will give you vital information on your rockets dV and thrust to weight throughout the stages and even adjusted for other planets and moons as you are building it.\u003Cp\u003EAs for getting to LKO (Low Kerbin Orbit) it is done in a few easy steps - assuming you got a stable rocket that do not behave like a wet noodle:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Press T to activate SAS then throttle up to max.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Start your rocket, go straight up for the time being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- At 10km up, rotate right until your rocket tilts 45 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- At 20km up, rotate to follow the prograde marker on the navball, add say 5 degrees lag to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Shift to map view, bring up the navball, keep an eye on the AP readout by hovering the mouse over it. Continue to follow the prograde marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When the AP readout says 100km (or whatever is your desired orbit altitude) cut engines and coast until you are at AP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- At AP, point about 5 degrees below the prograde marker, fire up the engines again until the PE marker is at same altitude as the AP marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should give you a nice circular orbit in a pretty fuel efficient manner. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
