This will create a higher angle of reentry, and a higher speed at periapsis. What kind of periapsis are you using for reentry? You may want to go for 30-40 km. Also, be sure to try and hold a fairly decent angle of attack with your space plane. This will create more drag early on, bleeding more speed before you get into the deeper, thick parts of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T05:56:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs he said, lower apoapsis or higher periapsis.

With a real Spaceplane, you might get better results coasting in the upper parts of the atmosphere. With a Spaceshuttle type of craft this isn\u0027t possible because it is designed to perform a controlled \u0022stall\u0022 at high AOA through these layers and only transition to a real glide when all the braking and heating has subsided. If your craft can\u0027t hold this high AOA to brake in a way like this, you must of course follow a much shallower flight path because you are actually gliding it down all the way. However, you\u0027ll encounter much more heating this way, because you spend much more time in the heating airstream, because you don\u0027t brake enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Gliding in the upper parts of the atmosphere = longer braking phase, less heating, but a longer duration of the heating phase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Stalling into \u0022lower\u0022 parts of the upper atmosphere (~25-30km) = shorter braking phase with higher intensity of heat but a shorter heating phase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to find the equilibrium between those two solutions according to the design of your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, i prefer the low periapsis reentries for precision purposes.
