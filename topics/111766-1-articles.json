Of course there are (sadly) way better improvements to be made \\*cough\\* memory leaks \\*cough\\*, but i\u0027m just mentioning a weird detail that, although not important, could probably be fixed easily.\n\nAnd yeah, chutes don\u0027t always need a vent hole, but since they offer stability and do not reduce drag pretty much every bowl-shaped parachute has some now.

Although I have a feeling that it will stick around for nostalgia purposes. It also suffers from problems with shading (the string area turns dark grey at low altitude) and a number of weird artifacts, at least on my computer.\n\nI do prefer the newer models myself, especially the radial mounts. I wish the parachutes came in more colors too.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
