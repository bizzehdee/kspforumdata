I know that sometimes this change in temperature will show up on the F11 indicator but I feel like I have experienced situations where this change in temperature has been negligible. In these cases, is there some way to check if a part is blocking an engine\u0027s exhaust and reducing effective thrust?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-16T23:02:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224032789\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204871\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221631825234\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154094\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dobelong\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Dobelong said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nis there some way to check if a part is blocking an engine\u0027s exhaust and reducing effective thrust?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you see can be deceiving, because the KSP code doesn\u0027t check the visual model to decide on blocking. Also, some engines have an offset added to their exhaust effects. Visually, it can look like the exhaust is going right through another part, and yet to KSP, the engine is not considered \u0027blocked\u0027 and the other part is not getting heated. On top, there are different multipliers for the exhaust heat some engines produce, which makes them more/less likely to show heating effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately we\u0027ve been given no way to see directly whether the thrust is considered blocked. The PAWs, even the debug windows, will all merrily continue to show full thrust being produced, even when you have none.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce upon a time it used to show in the logs when engines were heating another part, and that\u0027s how we could tell. I haven\u0027t seen such entries anymore in a long while though, I think they were removed; possibly it was part of the old engine module. Or it was some undocumented setting that I forgot along the way, I\u0027m not sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, all we got to go on now is this: if you can notice the engine is producing thrust, ANY thrust, it\u0027s not blocked. The way it works, it\u0027s an all or nothing thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously this is per individual engine, so if you have more than one, you have to account for that. Note also that you do need to check this \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eper exhaust nozzle\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, if the engine has multiple. Engines like the RAPIER, Mammoth, and others, will still produce thrust from the unobstructed nozzles, which will affect torque and total effective thrust produced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-17T06:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ll just add - I\u2019ve had situations where thrust was not obstructed while not steering, but was blocked when gimballed over while steering. \u00A0That can seem to the pilot like an intermittent, hard to diagnose overheating problem. \u00A0But yeah, no way to find out except trial and error. \u00A0Maybe something like a static fire test, where you start engines but don\u2019t release launch clamps, and try every combination of steering inputs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
