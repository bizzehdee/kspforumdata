I suppose you could make a part that gives you more available Intake Air, that\u0027s been done but they\u0027re labelled primarily for jets. Really that\u0027s how everything works, it just does its job and we convince ourselves it\u0027s doing it a special way through the look, effects, and flavour text.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a few turboprops out there, which should have similar thrust curves to a supercharged engine. Or if you can find a good source of thrust curves for specific engines, you could try applying them to existing models.
