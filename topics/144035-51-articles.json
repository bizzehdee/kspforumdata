That title has just been taken by newly upgraded\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EHurricane Florence\u003C/strong\u003E, which has unexpectedly intensified to an 85 mph Category 1 storm.

If this season\u2019s pace continues for the next month or two, it could easily be among the top 5.

Unlike Miriam, its convection has yet to be torn apart from its center of rotation. The NHC expects it to remain a Category 1 for another day and a half to two days. Behind Norman is rapidly intensifying Hurricane Olivia, which has just become the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esixth\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0major hurricane of the 2018 Pacific season with winds of 120 mph. It has a chance to become yet another Category 4 hurricane before gradual weakening starts late tomorrow or Thursday. Based on current infrared satellite imagery, Olivia looks pretty close to doing so.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome final thoughts on the Atlantic: Hurricane Florence is set to become a tropical storm again tomorrow, but will return to hurricane status later this week as it enters a large area of 28-29 C waters off the US East Coast. Models are still in disagreement about whether or not it will threaten land. Meanwhile,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EInvest-92L\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0is looking much more likely to develop into the next named\u00A0storm, with the NHC now giving it an 80% chance of development during the next five days. They say that it will likely become a tropical depression or storm between late week and thand weekend. The next available name is Helene. After 92L, there will likely be another strong tropical wave coming off of Africa, and most models say that it will develop and could become stronger than Future Helene. It would likely get the name Issac, depending on whether or not a predicted area of low pressure will form and develop in the southwestern Caribbean.

Its intensification makes even less sense than Norman\u2019s, because it\u2019s being plagued by both dry air and wind shear. It\u2019s quite unexpected that it has managed to rapidly intensify like this. Florence currently has 120 mph winds \u2014 slightly stronger than Norman \u2014 and should start weakening a bit due to the previously mentioned dry air and wind shear. By Friday or Saturday, though, it will be in very favorable conditions and will likely reach major hurricane status again. After that, its future is uncertain. It could be drawn up north and taken out to sea, or it could be drawn into the eastern US by a ridge of high pressure. It may also just stall for a few days near Bermuda due to the opposing forces of opposite steering factors. If the second or third scenario happens, Florence will impact land (either the US or Bermuda) and has a good shot of becoming a Category 4 hurricane due to low wind shear and high SSTs of around 29 C. If the first scenario occurs, we would still have to keep an eye on Florence to see how close it gets to the Northeast or Atlantic Canada (Nova Scotia and Newfoundland).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ProtoJeb21","CreatedById":153551,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-05T19:09:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223445692\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144035\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221536159030\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153551\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ProtoJeb21\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, ProtoJeb21 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlorence\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E currentl\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003Ey has 120 mph winds \u2014 slightly stronger than Norman \u2014 a\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003End should start weakening a bit due to the previously mentioned dry air and wind shear.\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI take that all back.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EHurricane Florence\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eis now a Category 4 with winds of 130 mph according to Tropical Tidbits, and it may be slightly stronger by the time of the NHC\u2019s advisory.

It should bottom out as about an 80-85 mph Category 1 hurricane before it moves out of the patch of wind shear by the first\u00A0half of Saturday. There, it will reach an area with little to no wind shear and highly favorable SSTs, which is expected to cause it to regain major hurricane status. How strong it gets depends on its speed. The current NHC forecast cone has Florence slow down south of Bermuda this weekend due to conflicting steering currents. This is the same time as the storm\u2019s environment become very conductive, so it may be able to surpass its initial peak intensity. That\u2019s not good no matter where this storm goes, because it\u2019s still going to be too close for comfort to Bermuda. After that, though, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess where it ends up.

However, Florence has currently been fighting some dry air that managed to sneak into its center, which has caused the now-symmetrical convection to become less potent. The storm should be able to eventually remove that dry air from its center within the next day and continue to intensify in increasingly favorable environments. On the Atlantic SST map, I labelled three major time periods that need to be discussed in more detail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETUESDAY:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Florence will be a hurricane by this point, and will enter the most favorable environment it\u0027s ever been in. Wind shear will be practically nonexistent, SSTs are around 29C, and atmospheric moisture is relatively high. These conditions will last for the next two days as Florence moves west-northwest towards the Carolinas, steered by a strengthening ridge of high pressure to the north. Florence will have been strengthening before Tuesday, but once it reaches this extremely favorable region of the Atlantic, it will likely begin a phase of rapid intensification - something that the NHC says is almost certain to happen. From Tuesday to Thursday, Florence will gain the most intensity and be the most unpredictable. The NHC predicts\u00A0it\u00A0getting up to a 145 mph Category 4 hurricane during this time frame, but there is a possibility that Florence could get stronger, maybe a high-end Category 4 with 150-155 mph winds. Because of this, everybody should pay very close attention to Florence at the beginning of the week. Unpredictable and unexpected changes in intensity are a strong possibility.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETHURSDAY:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EWithout a doubt, Florence will be a major hurricane (\u0026gt;111 mph winds) at this time, and the first significant impacts from the storm will start being felt in the southeast coast on this day or a bit earlier. While models are more in agreement with Florence\u0027s path today than before, there is uncertainty in where it will be on Thursday. It may end up slightly north or slightly south of the location labelled on the SST map. Regardless of where exactly it will be, people from northern Florida to southern Virginia - mainly North and South Carolina - should begin experiencing stronger winds and storm surge. Florence is expected to be a Category 4 at this point when its right off of the SE coast, but even though it\u0027s offshore, do NOT underestimate it. Treat it as if it were making landfall at that time (which may turn out to be the case, depending on how fast it ends up).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFRIDAY-SUNDAY:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Florence will most likely make landfall on Friday (or late Thursday), and it will continue to follow the ridge of high pressure off the coast. Depending on how north Florence makes landfall, it or its remnants can be dragged up into New England and the Mid-Atlantic, meaning the entire eastern seaboard, and a few inland states, should be prepared for potential impacts. I can\u0027t go too much into detail because this is too far away to make any reliable and specific assumptions.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:28px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETROPICAL STORM ISSAC\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFormerly Tropical Depression 9, Issac poses a threat of striking the Lesser Antilles as a hurricane, almost exactly a year after Irma and Maria ravaged the Caribbean. Right now it\u0027s still facing some wind shear, partially exposing its center of rotation, but it is in better shape than yesterday. Thunderstorm activity has significantly flared up and more of the circulation is being covered. Below is a comparison of Issac\u0027s infrared satellite appearance over an eight hour period. While this is slightly outdated, the storm\u0027s convection has not changed much since 22:05z.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022w2nn613.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022340\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/w2nn613.png\u0022 width=\u0022960\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are multiple dates to talk about with this storm due to its uncertain track next week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETUESDAY:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This is when Issac is expected to reach or approach hurricane intensity. The current shear it\u0027s fighting a bit will be just about gone, and SSTs will be slightly warmer than before. There is a chance that Issac may end up going through a phase of rapid intensification at this time, but it\u0027s a bit too far out to be certain.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWEDNESDAY:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Issac will be a hurricane this day, either as a Category 1 or possibly a Category 2, depending on how much intensification happened within the previous 24 hours. Here, wind shear will be at its lowest and SSTs will remain around 28 C. If Issac doesn\u0027t rapidly intensify on Tuesday, then this is the most likely time that it will, which will unfortunately give the residents of the Lesser Antilles less time to prepare for a stronger cyclone. Therefore, preparations should begin as soon as possible in case this storm becomes stronger than anticipated.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETHURSDAY:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Late Wednesday into Thursday will be the most uncertain time for Issac. As of late Saturday, there are three different scenarios that could take place. The first and most likely is that Issac will continue on a due west trajectory, passing through the Lesser Antilles as a slightly weaker hurricane due to some wind shear from the north at this time. During the past two days, some models have suggested that Issac may weaken considerably once in the Caribbean (once again from shear), but it will continue through the sea and maybe reach the Gulf of Mexico or pass over Central America between Friday and the following\u00A0Monday. We will have to wait a few more days for any sort of confidence in Issac\u0027s post-Lesser Antilles future. The second scenario is the most concerning: a high pressure system will cause the storm to come up slightly north, bringing it on a path towards Dominica, Barbuda, and/or Puerto Rico. These were by far the hardest hit islands from last year\u0027s cataclysmic storms, so any tropical cyclone will be a major threat to their recovery. Finally, the third scenario would have that high pressure system pulling Issac to the north, sparing the Lesser Antilles from a direct hit. So far the latter is the most unlikely - it\u0027s been getting less and less probable over the last 24 hours - and there\u0027s about an even chance for scenarios one or two happening. I\u0027d say we should be keeping as much of an eye on Issac as Florence.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:28px;\u0022\u003ETROPICAL STORM HELENE\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last storm I will be covering is Helene, which has wasted no time getting its act together. Despite being barely a day old, Helene has been organizing quite rapidly, developing a strong circulation and an organized mass of powerful convection. Right now it doesn\u0027t have a well-developed core, but this is going to change very quickly. A comparison of two IR satellite images is below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221NpcGB4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022351\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1NpcGB4.png\u0022 width=\u0022960\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn just 7 hours, Helene\u0027s organization and convective structure has significantly improved, and it continues to do so. The last image is quite outdated now, as a symmetric\u00A0mass of powerful thunderstorms (cloud top temperatures of -70 to -80 Celsius) has formed around the center of circulation. It looks like Helene will have a developed core within the next six hours and will reach hurricane status around the same time or not long after. As with the previous storms, I\u0027ll go through some important dates for this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMONDAY:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Helene will almost certainly be a hurricane by this point. This is when the threat to Cabo Verde will be the greatest. Along with the potential for hurricane force winds, there will be more flooding and heavy rainfall. Already, some of the southern islands have had significant flooding from Helene, resulting in three deaths. This will, unfortunately, not let up through the next day and a half to two days. In addition, there is a good possibility of Helene undergoing a period of rapid intensification by this time frame.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETUESDAY:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This is when Cabo Verde will finally get a break as Helene moves too far from the islands to have any more negative impacts. It will also be the time when the storm will likely max out its intensity. Helene is in an area of 27 C waters, which aren\u0027t as favorable as the SSTs Florence and Issac will be in on the same day. Once the cyclone gets into 25 C waters on Tuesday, it will not strengthen any more, or at least not by much. Any intensification process continuing from the previous day may still continue for a little bit, but I think it\u0027s safe to say that Helene will be done intensifying at this time...temporarily.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETHURSDAY:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0There are two tracks Helene could take. The first is a gentle curve to the north, and the second is a much sharper curve. With the latter, there is a potential that Helene will be steered towards the Azores islands, which very rarely gets hit by a full-fledged tropical cyclone (2016 and 2017 were exceptions). Regardless of the exact track, Helene will be moving into more favorable SSTs of 27-28 C that may allow for some re-intensification before other factors take their toll on the storm.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are my predictions for the three systems in the Atlantic.

Based on this and Florence\u2019s satellite imagery, it will likely become a Category 4 within the next few hours, and there remains a possibility of it nearing or reaching Category 5 intensity by Wednesday before land interaction and drier air halts intensification.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUPDATE: the HH craft completed its first pass, and the results are extremely concerning. Winds are up to 130-140 mph and the pressure has dropped from 962 mbar to 945 mbar.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-10T15:54:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2018 03:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by ProtoJeb21\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ProtoJeb21","CreatedById":153551,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-10T20:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/141267-saturnianblue/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022141267\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/141267-saturnianblue/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SaturnianBlue\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Florence\u2019s intensification is....extremely worrying. It\u2019s now a 140 mph Category 4 with a pressure down to 940 mbar. During the last NHC advisory, it was predicted to be a 130 mph storm by this time. If Florence keeps intensifying at this rate, it has a chance of becoming a Category 5 before landfall \u2014 something that a few models are predicting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ProtoJeb21","CreatedById":153551,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-11T00:08:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral interesting things are starting to happen to Hurricane Florence.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Microwave satellite data indicates that Florence has yet to develop a complete eyewall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) A second incomplete eyewall appears to be forming.

The first is that Florence will undergo an eyewall replacement cycle before rapidly intensifying again, potentially reaching Category 5 status. The second outcome is that Florence won\u2019t go through an EWRC, but will still be able to improve the structure of its core and convection. Both scenarios will cause a temporary (12-ish hours) halt in intensification before Florence begins another phase of rapid strengthening either during the second half of Tuesday or during Wednesday. In both scenarios, a Category 5 remains a disturbing possibility, but the good news is that drier air and land interaction starting early Thursday will keep this from being a landfalling Cat 5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
