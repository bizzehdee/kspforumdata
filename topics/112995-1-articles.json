He has not had much to say in the last two SQ\u0027s. He is under a heavy NDA regarding something cool that he\u0027d like to share, but until that lifts, he\u0027s been rather tight-lipped, to avoid leaking info inadvertently. NDA\u0027s protect all sides, in case the deal does not go through, for whatever reason.\n\n Per the Devnotes telling us three developers are out on vacation, there hasn\u0027t much more to talk about that isn\u0027t in the written in Devnote Tuesday postings. The 1.0.3 patch has been in testing, but we are waiting for developers to return (hopefully this week) and see what might need adjusting, based on the testing. Finally, Max announced he\u0027d be going on his own vacation this week, no official SQ is expected - there\u0027s a small chance Kasper might host it.\n\nMods: I suggest a merge with [Squadcast last Friday?
