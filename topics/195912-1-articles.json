Or perhaps associate a sound font for each propeller part and play it when the motor is running. At least that way, the propellers won\u0027t be silent when running...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-28T00:34:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a bad idea!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if there were to be just a constant prop sound that would play, get louder as throttle is increased?
