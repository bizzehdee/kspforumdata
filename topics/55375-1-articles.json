You can download the last version on Steam by accessing the Beta options for KSP. I think you can download old versions through Squad too if you don\u0027t use Steam. Or you can just get the old part folder from someone else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreedomFighterEx","CreatedById":58750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T15:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince Steam always auto-update, i think the old file already been replace :\u0026lt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T15:45:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could also just get the Demo from the KSP website and make a new part entirely (This way you have both).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"42undead2","CreatedById":47664,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T16:16:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreedomFighterEx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreedomFighterEx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince Steam always auto-update, i think the old file already been replace :\u0026lt;\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can turn auto-update off.
