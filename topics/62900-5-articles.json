On other words a second on kerbin is equal to 1/4 of real life, is there any config I can do, or any mod I can install that allows me to change it? I wantz 6 hours day koddamit!

I can\u0027t tell if it\u0027s been abandoned, it may just be considered \u0022working\u0022 and so there haven\u0027t been updates, and I don\u0027t have the time to take on another project (I already spend too much time on KSP for my girlfriend\u0027s liking, plus I have a senior thesis I should be working on...) but if it\u0027s a small change it shouldn\u0027t be too bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short: I can possibly make a tweak if it will be easy, but am not willing to \u0022take over\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T02:55:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust uploaded PR4b.

Stable is defined as periapsis within 10% of apoapsis, so an AP of 250km can have a periapsis of minimum 225km. Debris is ignored, as is anything landed on a body. I would have preferred to just require no SOI changes, but apparently you can\u0027t check for those on anything except the active vessel. Time warp in the flight scene is always possible (though could be slow if your craft is in a low orbit), which is why I recommend planting a flag or other landed object, just in case you need to warp. Theoretically if you are warping and a vessel changes SOI it will stop warping and alert you, but I didn\u0027t code that and have literally never used it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get around this by setting your vessel as debris, but that\u0027s just asking for trouble for yourself \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T17:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust an update, it\u0027s probably going to be a while until the next release since I\u0027m quite busy IRL right now.

If you can get me both of those (or at least the second one) after launching the craft and the escape tower being destroyed then I can try to figure out what\u0027s happening.

The purpose of that was partly because things were assumed to burn up on reentry (you can\u0027t drop something uncontrolled from orbit and expect it to survive intact), but KSP doesn\u0027t actually have reentry heating. I\u0027ll remove the restriction (up to 70km for safety) and perhaps later on add in a lower restriction if Deadly Reentry is installed. Though I\u0027d like to see the logs to be sure that\u0027s the cause first. There\u0027s a chance that it isn\u0027t, since the limit at which KSP will delete things in atmosphere is around that height (though it might be 36km). Above that, things on rails won\u0027t be deleted (which is why things can be in a \u0022stable\u0022 orbit at less than 70km when unfocused)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-26T15:45:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2014 03:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T22:14:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got the output_log.txt saved but didn\u0027t know about ksp.log \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E SRB sep is usually around 10km, never less than 5km.
