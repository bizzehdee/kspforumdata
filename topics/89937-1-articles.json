This has a limit, obviously -- every computer will have a different max part count before the user starts seeing lag. There\u0027s just no way around that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with getting a super-fast single- or dual-core processor to speed up KSP is that all of the other things that you want to have running simultaneously would likely perform \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C/em\u003E with one of those slightly slower (per-core) 4- or 8-core processors. It will always be a balancing act... Your best bet is finding some middle ground, getting a top-of-the-line 4-core Intel chip will be very expensive and (in my opinion) the 8-core AMD chips are not worth the money right now. (Plus they don\u0027t REALLY have 8 cores... but that\u0027s another discussion.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as mods go, you\u0027ll always have the 32-bit ceiling of ~3.3GB of RAM available (changes depending on your OS and other programs running). You could have a whopping 512GB of RAM available in your epic powerhouse of a system that can run BF4, Crysis, and Far Cry on max settings AT THE SAME TIME and still only be able to use about 3GB of RAM for KSP. Someday that may change if the 64-bit version ever becomes more stable but for now, be prepared to limit your mod choices somewhat. With Active Texture Management and texture resolution turned down a bit you can cram a surprising number of mods into 32-bit KSP... Just keep in mind that your visuals will suffer as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as graphics go, that part is easy. KSP isn\u0027t terribly GFX heavy... Sure, with some beautification mods mid-range PCs may stutter occasionally but any modern GFX card should be able to pull it off just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of it all, KSP just isn\u0027t super optimized yet. Over time the game will become more stable and these specifications may change but for now I think this is what we get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDISCLAIMER: Most (if not all) of my knowledge is \u0022hearsay\u0022.
