From what I know of unity Input.GetKeyDown() should only be true on the first frame the keyDown is detected and thus should only happen once for every key press.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I just updated my references to the ones with .20 and visual studio is now complaining that \u0022 \u0027PartLoader\u0027 does not contain a definition for \u0027goToSceneAfterLoad\u0027 \u0022 when I can see it in the object browser\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help will be greatly appreciated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghjm","CreatedById":67452,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T02:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fixed this and posted a link to it over in the 0.20 compatibility thread. The issue is that the loader was instantiating the EdTools class four times. So it\u0027s not that GetKeyDown() was running in four frames - it was running once in the frame when the key was pressed, like it\u0027s supposed to - it was just doing so for each instance of EdTools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know anything about UnityEngine or how module loading is supposed to work or what the calls to DontDestroyOnLoad are meant to do, so I wasn\u0027t keen to change them - instead, what I did was make the EdTools class instantiate as a singleton by caching the first instantiation as a global static variable. It works for me, at least until someone smarter comes along.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T05:32:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you guys post links to the 0.20 updated EdTools and DynamicWarp?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Simplicity","CreatedById":57473,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T05:37:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere ya go, a copy of ghjm\u0027s post \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E - hope he doesn\u0027t kill me for posting it here...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ghjm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ghjm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere is an updated version of DEADBEEF\u0027s EdTools that works with 0.20, minus the CTRL key temporary clipping removal, and the command-line ship loading, neither of which I could figure out how to get to work in 0.20 in the amount of time I was willing to spend on it.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40584845/EdTools020.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEdTools020.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"a.g.","CreatedById":59470,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T08:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is my update of Dynamic Warp: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14711013/DynamicWarp-0.20-fix.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14711013/DynamicWarp-0.20-fix.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T13:46:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
