The kinetic energy scales as velocity squared, so you require a lot more energy to accelerate the same amount when at high velocity. (exempli gratia: 0 to 10m/s for 2 kg object is 10^2 - 0^2 = 100J, 1000-1010m/s for a 2kg object is 1010^2 - 1000^2 = 20,100J) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rocket that spits out rocket fuel gains momentum equal to the momentum of the rocket fuel relative to the ship. Say the exhaust velocity is 1000m/s and you spit out 0.1kg of fuel from a ship that is 1kg at the end, the rocket will gain 100 kg m/s of momentum or 100m/s of velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssume the ship is originally travelling at 1000m/s. An observer following alongside at 1000m/s sees the ship accelerate from 0m/s (relative) to 100m/s, gaining 5000J of kinetic energy, and he sees the fuel accelerate from 0m/s to -1000m/s, gaining 50,000J of kinetic energy. He therefore sees a net increase of 55,000J of energy from the fuel being ejected; this would be from the chemical explosion, or ion propulsion or whatsoever device propelled the fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second observor who is stationary sees the ship originally travelling at 1000m/s. It accelerates from 1000 to 1100m/s gaining 105,000J of kinetic energy. The fuel decelerations from 1000m/s to 0m/s loosing 50,000J of kinetic energy. The net kinetic energy change is an increase 55,000J, the same as above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that your ship is gaining a heck of a lot more kinetic energy when you burn at high velocity then low. Does this have any ramifications for how orbital manoeuvres should be done? Like, should you only do burns when at highest velocity possible (periapsis) in order to have best fuel use? \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T01:07:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bluejayek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bluejayek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that your ship is gaining a heck of a lot more kinetic energy when you burn at high velocity then low.
