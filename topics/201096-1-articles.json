I have two problems:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 - I can\u0027t start the engines 21 minutes before the maneuver node because in this case my periaxis should fall below 50000 mt. inside the kerbin atmosphere (even if I start at 200000 mt.). But ok, I could solve this by starting closer to the MN and making some later course correction on the way to Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 - The real problem is that the ship can\u0027t keep the MN direction for such a long time.

Just fine tune your encounter with Jool - do it as early as possible - so that the trajectory crosses Tylo orbit at the right time, and if properly set up, it should put you in Jool orbit without using a drop of fuel.

For Kerbin to Jool, the gate orbit is at 250km. This altitude minimizes the delta-V to get to Jool (not counting the delta-V required to get into that orbit).

Once you\u0027re about 5 minutes past the maneuver point, just burn prograde. It will cause your ejection angle to be a bit off. One way to help plan\u00A0around this is to split your maneuver in KSP -- place one maneuver that you can do within ~5 minutes at Kerbin\u0027s PE. Place another one about 5 minutes after that one that you can do in 5 minutes, and so on. It\u0027s a pain to do any corrections in timing (you\u0027d need to move all your maneuver nodes around), but it will tell you with good accuracy where you\u0027ll end up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-20T22:08:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone has sound advice, but I want to draw your attention to the root of you problem:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe maneuver node system assumes instantaneous velocity changes. When burns are short (a fraction of an orbital period) the difference between your node and your burn is negligible, but longer burns will compound error. Long burn craft need integration of velocity over the course of the burn. That\u0027s a much more complicated problem to solve and KSP does not have tools to help solve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
