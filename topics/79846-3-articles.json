Well honestly thats 1 of those that I gave a try to in my life before too, and to get good quality arrows is a rather notable skill. But if you\u0027re good enough to get within 100-200ft of your target, even crappily fletched arrows would work (from experience, although I wasn\u0027t the hunter shooting them) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of arrows though, the difficult to make thing would be bows themselves. Modern nylon bowstrings can last for several years, but when they break, where are you gonna get new 1s? Also most of the wood around is garbage for bows. It would take a good bit of work to find a good sapling that can be used as even a 40lb bow. Although there are guides out there about using a few PVC pipes to make a bow, and they do work kinda well, but they don\u0027t last long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso lacking the ability to fletch a good arrow, why not crossbows? A good Cbow can be made easily of wood and scrap metal, and sprigns if they can be found. And nominally, their bolts are just highly straightened sharpened pieces of wood with a notch at the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso there are always high quality steel and aluminum arrows we have now that can be shot thousands of times without them getting damaged. And remember, arrows are retrievable, unlike bullets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut forgoing all that jazz, its not like fletching or bows would be important for the first several years because there are guns and bullets everywhere. Hunting would probably be big the first couple years as agriculture needs time to expandand ramp up (I\u0027m from New Hampshire. We probably couldn\u0027t survive on existing farmland, and clearing out forests to make farmland woudl take time. Assumign you don\u0027t try to level towns because well, there would be so much more time spent jsut trying to break up foundations, although everyone could help out by throwing a garden in their yard). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at an iowa website, tells me that 1 acre of corn turns out ~150bushels (without the husks, thats just kernals) and 1 of those bushels is ~56 lbs. Japan has a unit of a \u0022koku\u0022 back in the day, which was about the amount of rice needed to feed 1 person for 1 year, and I believe it was about 300-350lbs of rice. Ofcourse you couldn\u0027t live on jsut corn or rice, but assuming the numbers balance out somewhat similar. 1 acre would turn out ~8400lbs of corn (perhaps more considering if youre starving, those husks start looking plenty edible) so 1 acre in a good harvest could provide baseline food for ~30 people a year. AN acre is only about the size of a football field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther info, glancing around, in Vermont a site claims that 1/8th acre of winter wheat, planting 30 lbs of it, netted them 250lbs of grain at the end of its growth somewhere in July. Ofcourse, vary your crops and have something growing throughout the whole year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess what can be taken away from that, Surviving off of some subsistence farming, is actually kinda legit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming my area, houses around in New Hampshire are usually built on ~1.5 acres, farming that (which could be handled by running out there with hand tools. And really wouldn\u0027t be a hard job aside from during the planting and harvesting times. I mean, when my mom decided she wanted a garden, it ended up being ~ 1/8th acre, and we tilled that out with just myself and my friend Steve over the course of a morning) Yeah we might see an influx of people storming up here from areas around Boston. But if the situation was known, and a nice town meeting laid down the fact that if you don\u0027t work, you\u0027re gonna die. I\u0027m sure that given some time, and hard work, at least the food could be gotten back on track.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T19:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sky_walker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sky_walker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot - and I mean: A LOT - would depend on who gets in power - but if lead wisely, promoting people with knowledge (instead of warriors), we could progress extremely rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a cliche to imagine the two are mutually exclusive.

Even in a completely peaceful situation many of our military personnel would make excellent leaders.

That\u0027s not currency, that\u0027s barter. In a barter economy (which I agree would naturally arise once central organisation fails) many things would have value. Yes bullets, but also food, medicine, fuel, generators, books and maps, tools, etc. A currency would only become useful once a degree of central government had been re-established and once you\u0027re at that point there\u0027s no reason not to use a fiat currency like we have currently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEven an IPAC paper-pusher lady on an USMC base has probably heard a few things about surviving in the field (if only from the grunts complaining ) and fired a rifle at least once,\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what IPAC is either, but if you\u0027re talking about a civilian clerk instead of a uniformed one then it\u0027s highly unlikely they would have every fired a weapon. All military personnel qualify on personal weapons as part of their basic training, but from my experience the levels of ongoing refresher training are spotty. Standards vary between countries and services, but from what I\u0027ve seen it\u0027s not unusual for non-combattant personnel to have very limited contact with small arms in peace time. People are busy doing other things, and units often only send a percentage of their people for annual qualification shoots. Obviously everybody has to go qualify before any deployments, and combat trades will obviously be continuously qualified.
