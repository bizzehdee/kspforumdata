A ladder down the side would just be wrong. Only thing I can think of at this point, is to combine the cargo pod with the command pod, clunky and ugly. Or, just assign the cargo pod as the command pod, also clunky but not so ugly. KSP wasn\u0027t really meant for modular ship designs like that. To be able to swap out cargo pods, or have none at all, wouldn\u0027t work either that way, unless there were several versions of each part, with crew, without crew, etc. Not a pretty solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the Cygnus is probably out of the question, the thing was a mile long or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedSpar","CreatedById":6185,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T23:03:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I have a solution to the hatch...

It flies well, it maneuvers well, and it handles extra parts easily. There are a few omissions and a couple of oddities that make it a bit less than the \u0022superstar\u0022 it could be. But it\u0027s a great flying ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the hatch needs to be easily accessible. The current hatch is a real pain. There needs to be a place to put a ladder that doesn\u0027t protrude into the windows, or a ladder needs to be built in (like the stock pods). Maybe move the hatch to the side of the pod? Next it needs a bit more SAS, perhaps convert the ASAS to SAS (that\u0027s what I did with a part.cfg edit) since this mod requires mechjeb which is an ASAS, there is no need for another. The Eagle flies much better with additional SAS. This is a big issue, because using mechjeb eats RCS fuel. For some reason mechjeb abuses RCS and will use up all of the fuel quickly. With mechjeb SAS is the better way to control attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried the Eagle with wings and quite a few other different parts and it\u0027s a very versatile and flexible design.

Can\u0027t wait to see what you come up with. Now I just need to learn to fly better and stop crashing the things. Really wish there was a separate throttle for the VTOL and main engines, that would make normal in-atmosphere flight so much easier, having the VTOL engines at half or third power, whatever is needed to keep it in the air, and the main engines at full to keep forward flight. Since it has no flight surfaces, this is pretty much the only way it really could have flown.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Edamski","CreatedById":44695,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T14:09:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is great fun!
