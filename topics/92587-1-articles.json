Since its the most \u0022legit\u0022 version of KSP you could possibly play. But then it hit me, it might be to easy with mods, but is it even playable if you don\u0027t use mods like Kerbal Engineer? Every flight would extremely important, so Squads idea of \u0022Trial and Error\u0022 wouldn\u0027t exactly work. To much trial and you have to restart a new game completely. Which isn\u0027t exactly fun or intutive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to make this a little more tangible without mods that give you at least some insight as to what will happen when you deploy the rocket? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany people say Kerbal Engineer is vital to playing this game. I would personally agree, but in no way you MUST have this mod to play the game and have fun.(the main reason why its not in stock) But when things go on ultra hard mode, it seems the game should give you \u003Cstrong\u003Esomething\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know here are a number of ways to sidestep this whole problem, (like test the flight in another save) or just be VERY crafty in playing your save file. But the fact the game literally hands you nothing, makes me feel like Iron Man mode is only playable with mods. I could be wrong and find its totally playable just hard (which is justified) but the level of skill needed seems to be unnecessary for what it could be. (If you screw up you lose, compared to if you test/fail to much you equally lose) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking about starting up my own Iron Man Mode game just to see how far and difficult this really is. Again without mods such as Engineer or Mechjeb to help with how my rockets will perform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS Iron Man mode is no reverts, quicksaves.

I played a long time without mods (300 - 350 hours), but once you are doing more than a mun landing it\u0027s not going to work reliably enough to do mission without keeping a massive reserve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t consider using a spread sheet to be more or less cheaty than using kerbal engineer. You get a delta-v read out. Gameplay wise nothing changes if you let it calculate or do it yourself (I do not count the spread sheet or the calculations of KER as a part of the gameplay). I\u0027m not saying one thing is better than the other. It\u0027s just not related to the level of difficulty. You get that info either way and that data vastly changes the mission profile and efficency. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that the \u0022iron man\u0022 settings are a solution for a number of different styles of playing the game. There might be people who can actually do it without calculating the delta-v. But I guess they more or less do that stuff for the x\u0027th time and now exactly which parts to use for the lander that worked last time.
