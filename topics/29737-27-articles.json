I balanced the masses, but the CoL is pretty far set off to the side by the RTG. With just shield/pod/radial parachutes/docking port, the CoL is just a tiny bit higher than the CoM, and centered.

I lost all of the ablative at about 13 km, like you, but the temp on the shield never went above 1090\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 because at that point peak heating was over. Maximum deceleration was about 6.2 g, but that didn\u0027t do damage. I pulled the two chutes out at about 5 km (I landed at about 500m above the sea), doing maybe 400--500 m/s.

At 550 m above ground, before full deployment, I got 160 m/s. The only groaning sounds came when the chutes fully came out.
