After clicking launch, the game appeared to lock up for a second, the screen flashed white (just your usual crashing window white) and then the KSP window closed by itself. I launched the game again and tried to load a save but the game would not let me move past \u0022Resume Saved\u0022, as if there is no saved game to go to. The rest of the menu works fine. Two out of two saves still exist in the KSP folder. \n\nI then tried deleting the persistent save to see if I could load a quick save, and this caused the game to show the \u0022There are incompatible / invalid saves on your saves folder message\u0022. Putting the persistent save back in to the folder caused the previous behavior of the Resume Saved button not working. I restarted the game after each attempt and I\u0027ve restarted my computer for the hell of it.\n\n**Log:**  Game did not create a crash log. Nor did I get the usual prompt saying that KSP is unresponsive and needs to close.\n\n**Mods:**\n\n- Active Texture Management\n- FAR\n- Firespitter (Not used in craft)\n- KAS (No KAS parts, no parts selectable in EVA)\n- HyperEdit\n- InfernalRobotics (Not used in craft)\n- MechJeb2\n- SmokeScreen (Not used in craft)\n- TweakScale (Not used in craft)\n- PWings (Not used in craft)\n- RCSBuildAid\n- KWRocketry\n- ModuleManager2.5.10\n\nThe most recent change I made was removing Kerbal Joint Reinforcement from the game as it was causing docking ports to break. I did that about 3 loads ago.\n\nEDIT: I just started a new save, and I exited the game. Upon reloading that save would also not load. Going to reinstall.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T04:36:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 04:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vulfilla**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wesreidau","CreatedById":75430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T19:37:24Z","Content":"I\u0027m keenly interested in knowing if a solution to this presented itself. I am also having the same problem of being unable to resume saves. I can load my game if I create a new game, then open that save\u0027s folder, deleting everything, and dragging in my old save. Once I quickload the save file in there, it works fine. I have approximately the same mods."}]}
