person.\u00A0 The one I have found success in is Mantra Induced Lucid Dreaming (MILD).\u00A0 In that, you basically repeat an intention to yourself over and over to sort of drill it into your mind.\u00A0 What I do is I go to bed normally, and then I wake up naturally in the night after 4-5 hours of sleep, after that I go to sleep again while repeating a mantra in my head like \u0022I am dreaming\u0022, \u0022the next thing I experience will be a dream\u0022, or \u0022I am about to dream\u0022.\u00A0 Sometimes it\u0027s hard to go to sleep while doing that, and it\u0027s OK to stop once you get tired as long as you think about lucid dreaming as you go to sleep the rest of the way.\u00A0 It\u0027s also helpful to use mantras while awake like \u0022I will become lucid in my dreams\u0022 and things of the sort.\u00A0 The exact wording is unimportant, just as long as you have the right meaning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you did this right then before you know it you will find yourself in a dream, and the mantras you repeated before will still be bouncing around your mind subconciously.\u00A0 This will cause you to question weather you are dreaming.\u00A0 At this point, you need to do a reality check.\u00A0 My favorite reality check is to plug my nose and try to breathe, and in a dream you can still breathe just fine (and it feels incredibly weird).\u00A0 This is where things get tricky, and where I am still struggling.\u00A0 At this point, this tends to happen:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp

that you are dreaming wakes you up unless you do something about it.\u00A0 There are multiple ways to go about stabilizing it, but they all involve immersing yourself in the dream world and forgetting all about your real body lying in your bed (which you may or may not be at least somewhat aware of at that point).\u00A0 You have to interact with the dream world or stare at your hands as you rub them together.\u00A0 Pay attention to every sensation in the dream down to the direction of the wind.\u00A0 You must also come to grips with the fact that this is all in your head, and therefore that you are in complete control of everything.\u00A0 In a dream, believing something makes it real.\u00A0 If you think that you will wake up, you will, but if you believe that you can make the dream last as long as you want.\u00A0 The dream also responds to commands, and it really helps to vocalize them.\u00A0 Vocally demand that the dream become clear by saying something like \u0022CLARITY NOW!\u0022 if things become unclear (which is almost guerenteed as you first become lucid).\u00A0 Expect some trial and error when doing this, because it takes a while to get the hang of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can get past this step, you are in a lucid dream!\u00A0 Things may become unclear and unstable after a while, so you will need to stabilize the dream again.\u00A0 It\u0027s also possible that you may forget that you are dreaming (which happens to newbies sometimes because your brain works a bit differently when you dream), and that can be prevented by regularly doing reality checks and remembering that you are dreaming at the back of your mind.\u00A0 To control the dream, just believe something and it will become real.\u00A0 It is recommended that if you want, say, a portal gun (or any other object) you should not make it apear in front of you, you should just believe that it\u0027s behind you or around a corner and when you look it will be there.\u00A0 You can also make anything (even yourself) morph into anything (or anyone).\u00A0 Dream control can be a bit tricky, and one of the easiest ways to do it is to vocalize your intention like \u0022When I open this door, the surface of the Moon WILL be on the other side!\u0022.\u00A0 I highly suggest you look up things to do in a lucid dream, because there is a lot of cool stuff you might never think of on your own like telling your dream that your worst fear is behind a door and then confronting said fear with a lightsaber and superpowers.\u00A0 You can even ask dream characters what they represent and they will give you a strait answer, and I hear that convincing a dream character that they are not real can be quite entertaining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

Two were very good, in terms of control and duration, while the others have been short and lackluster. It seems to come down to how I became aware I am dreaming. In the two best lucid dreams, I became aware of myself in a dream world entirely from a first person perspective, and I found that the dream became extremely malleable to my will, but I couldn\u0027t actually control it. I wasn\u0027t creating the scenario, or deciding what would come next, but basically whatever I wanted to happen would happen.

I think it happens because I am already starting to wake up, and part of my conscious mind that I don\u0027t yet have an awareness of is starting to exert the desires of my waking mind on the dream state, if that makes any sense. Like, I\u0027ll become aware that I want the dream to go a certain way, and the dream world will change to accommodate that thought, but I\u0027ll wake up within a couple minutes tops. This normally happens when dreams attempt to morph into nightmares. At the point where I would come to harm, some part of my mind will change the dream, and if I don\u0027t immediately wake up once that happens, I sometimes become aware that I am dreaming, but the control is never as good as when I spontaneously realize I am dreaming.

However, after a couple run ins with Hypnagogic Hallucinations, I\u0027ve been somewhat reluctant to pursue making lucid dreams more common (since it also tends to make the hallucinations more common). I very vividly remember lying on my side, knowing with 100% certainty that \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E was behind me, and that if I moved, it would see me, and I would die.
