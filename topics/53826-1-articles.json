I was thinking off Lee Smolin\u0027s black hole-based natural selection hypothesis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmolin\u0027s idea, which became widely publicized a few years ago, is that a new universe is created every time that a black hole is born, and that the new universe inherits the same basic physical constants as the parent universe, but with perhaps a few minor tweaks here and there (like, a bit higher value for the gravitational constant or a slightly weaker strong force, etc.). The idea is that in time, the whole ensemble of universes will \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022evolve\u0022 towards physical laws that most favor the creation of the largest number of black holes. Very strong evidence in favor of this idea would be to discover that the laws of physics ARE in fact, fine-tuned for black hole creation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, believe it or not, the same physical constant values that favor black holes also, in many ways, favor life. Life needs long term, large structures to form- galaxies, with star-forming regions, so that heavy elements can be manufactured, and planets can form around stable stars. That is much the same things that black holes require. Life needs long-term, stable atomic nuclei- and so do black holes, as the density of matter in a universe that was just a sea of subatomic particles would probably not ever get high enough to form black holes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I think an independent analysis of his idea was done already, and they said that the universe was NOT in fact, fine-tuned for black hole production. Of course, that doesn\u0027t rule his idea out entirely, because we don\u0027t know the exact mechanic for even how a black hole could form a new universe, how traits would be inherited, or even if this independent analysis was in fact, correct. Maybe, for example, only black holes of a certain size form new universes. Or maybe our universe falls within the standard \u0022mutation\u0022 range for a new universe. Who knows. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut \u003Cstrong\u003Eanyway\u003C/strong\u003E, I was thinking of his idea, and then I remembered how many theoretical physicists had discussed the possibility of making a universe in a lab. It truly might be possible to design a particle physics experiment that creates a new universe. This possibility has been discussed for decades. From my memory of the last time I had read of this idea, the new baby universe would only, for the briefest fraction of a second, be connected with the universe of its creators through a small wormhole. The wormhole would quickly pinch off, and the new baby universe would undergo inflation, expansion, and in general, very likely end up resembling our own universe- but the creator universe would never again be able to interact with the created universe after the wormhole had closed (otherwise, they wouldn\u0027t be separate universes, would they?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t ask me how exactly you could do this, that\u0027s above my pay grade. Maybe create a higher false vacuum state and then collapse it back down? I donno. Anyway, I realized that if it truly WAS possible to create a universe in a lab, then the number of universes in which the physical constants were fine-tuned for life could vastly outnumber the number of universes in which life could not exist. All you need is the first, original universe in which intelligent civilizations could arise. This universe might naturally arise through the \u0022eternal inflation\u0022 concept or other multiverse theories. Anyway, this original life-bearing universe gives birth (through those civilization\u0027s particle physics experiments) to millions or billions of new universes, which inherit the same or similar properties of the parent universe, whether by design or by accident (if you were creating a baby universe in a lab, wouldn\u0027t you want your creation to have the possibility of one day hosting life?). Those children universes then give birth to billions of universes of their own, and so on, until the number of universes in which life is, or was, possible outnumber the lifeless universes by a ratio of infinity to one (as the lifeless universes produce no progeny). So it ends up infinitely (or nearly so) more likely for you to find yourself in a universe in which life is possible than in a universe in which life cannot exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe life really does have a huge impact on the evolution of the multiverse.

Such calculations show that a change of as little as 0.5% in the strength of the strong nuclear force, or 4% in the electric force, would destroy either nearly all carbon or all oxygen in every star, and hence the possibility of life as we know it. Also, most of the fundamental constants appearing in our theories appear fine-tuned in the sense that if they were altered by only modest amounts, the universe would be qualitatively different, and in many cases unsuitable for the development of life. For example, if protons were 0.2% heavier, they would decay into neutrons, destabilizing atoms.\u003Cp\u003EIf one assumes that a few hundred million years in stable orbit is necessary for planetary life to evolve, the number of space dimensions is also fixed by our existence. That is because, according to the laws of gravity, it is only in three dimensions that stable elliptical orbits are possible. In any but three dimensions even a small disturbance, such as that produced by the pull of the other planets, would send a planet off its circular orbit, and cause it to spiral either into or away from the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe emergence of the complex structures capable of supporting intelligent observers seems to be very fragile. The laws of nature form a system that is extremely fine-tuned. What can we make of these coincidences?
