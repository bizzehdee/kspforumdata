For example, with the Rockomax BACC Solid Fuel Booster. I have tried to use the Hydraulic Detachment Manifold (450 ejection force) and the TT-70 Radial Decoupler (one that creates a space between the parts) and it just doesn\u0027t work, flying strait up and after separation the rocket starts to turn and slams itself against the ship (also tried to add a bunch of Sepratron I and it didn\u0027t really work). Also, when I use it to decouple Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tank, same thing happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really like some help on how to use those things properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: A while back, before the game had science and missions, decouplers seemed to work fine, the parts would just fall strait down, that doesn\u0027t happen anymore! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPSS: Thx for all the help!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-10T16:27:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2014 04:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ZoroastroBR\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T00:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right.
