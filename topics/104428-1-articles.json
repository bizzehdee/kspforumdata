But I think some people who are enjoying KSP will enjoy this as well. Note that I love playing KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m here to tell you about a game I made with a bunch of friends. And the game is called:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EEmptyEpsilon\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a futuristic spaceship bridge simulator game. Like a Star Trek bridge, but then in your own home (or office). The idea of the game is that you gather a bunch of friends. Designate 1 person as a captain, put the other crew behind different \u0022stations\u0022 that control different parts of the ship, and fly missions. Kill enemies, and try NOT to touch that tempting \u0022self destruct\u0022 button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptimal is to play with 6 people in total. But I\u0027ve played with as little as 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHistory\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout a year ago, me and some guys played a sessions of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.artemis.eochu.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EArtemis Spaceship Bridge simulator\u003C/a\u003E. We really enjoyed ourselves. But, we ran into quite a few issues with the game as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur main problems where:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Comms station was boring as hell, you pretty much sit there, tell all stations to make nukes. And that\u0027s about it, you can report that stations are under attack, but science should be noticing that earlier in most cases.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Game lost sync. What was happening on the server was not always happening on the clients. Annoying as hell, as sometimes enemy ships where in front of us on the main screen, but behind us on the weapons screen. Ruins the fun quite quick.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E While it has a \u0022game master\u0022 screen. You cannot do much there.

(Not with blackjack and hookers... yet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, being the nice people that we are. And because we created it for our own amusement. We are giving it away for free, including the sourcecode. So anyone can modify it up to their own wishes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, what\u0027s in the game?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, we\u0027re still working on it. But the game is quite complete already. We have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Up to 32 player ships, allowing up to 192 players to play in single game (this has not been tested, but should work in theory. Max computers connected to a single session was 12 so far)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Bunch of different enemy types. From simple fighter enemies, to advanced ships with missile weapons and warp drives.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E 5 different officer stations:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Helms - Controls the ships movement. Heading set to 115deg, full speed ahead. Preparing for a jump of 20km.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Weapons - Fire zhe missles! MOAR NUKES!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Engineering - But captain, I\u0027m giving it all she\u0027s got! Sending out repair crews to fix the front shield generator!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Science - Scanning... scanning... enemies everywhere captain. Put weapons on 480THz for maximum effectiveness.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Relay - Just requested backup at station DS5, and supplied will be dropped of at WP3 in sector D4. Also got a friendly scout ship scanning the nebula in C2 for enemies.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] 1 captains main screen per friendly ship. Can be just on a 3D screen, or switched to short and long range radar. We put this on a beamer, but you can also put it on a big TV. It\u0027s best if all players can see this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] Fully scriptable scenarios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] Actually, lots of stuff is scriptable. Even communications that the relay officer does. And the layout of the ships, the \u0022factions\u0022 that are in the game. You can pretty much customize the game to be star-trek if you want (not doing that for IP reasons, and we don\u0027t want to be true to star-trek)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] That said. The main goal is fun. Not realism. So the physics are \u0022wrong\u0022, you stop when you turn your engine off. But who cares, that makes for a better game. If anyone asks, it\u0027s because of the anti-gravity-based-impulse-drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] Nukes, mines, missiles and EMP missiles. Oh, and lasers. Lots of lasers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] Full fancy 2D action! No need to think in complex 3D maneuvers during the heat of battle. You cannot go up/down. Once again, not realistic, but makes it easier to program, and less complex to play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] A useful game-master screen. Want to play a complex scenario, and do not want to script it? Well, put someone behind the GM screen, and he can create\u0026amp;destroy just about anything. He can order ships around with ease. Even magically move them around with the powers of a god! He can even hail the relay officer on the player ship and chat with him. Having a friendly suddenly turn on you? You could do that with the GM screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] Jump drives, warp drives, or both. Personally more a fan of jump drives on player ships. But that\u0027s fully configurable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] Optional touch-screen support (we managed to get 5 very nice touch screens for cheap)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScreenshots!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample of the main screen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RZX7u1e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RZX7u1e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShowing the players ship.

(Abandon ship! Have your crew run out of the room like maniacs during this time, tripping over cables and destroying computers in the process)\u003Cbr\u003E\n* 5 new transport ship models, with 1 to 5 cargo containers each.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Fixed a few problems when using the 3/4 crew member screen options, where some controls where not accessible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Added extra console types, \u0022damcon\u0022 which is just the top part of engineering, \u0022power management\u0022 which is just the bottom of engineering. \u0022database\u0022, which is just the science database.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nChanges for modding/changing the game:\u003Cbr\u003E\n* F5 in the GM screen copies the current selected objects to the clipboard for pasting in script files. For easier setup of new scenario scripts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Music list is no longer hard-coded, and any file in the music directory will be used at random.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Objects can have descriptions that are shown in the science station.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* (not yet in the latest release, but code finished). Allow scenarios to define GM functions, that show up as buttons on the GM screen.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, some people have been testing to play trough the internet, which worked very well according to their report. Does require you to forward port 32666 in your router. And manual IP connecting, as there is no internet server discovery yet.
