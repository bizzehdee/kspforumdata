But I think some people who are enjoying KSP will enjoy this as well. Note that I love playing KSP.\n\nSo, I\u0027m here to tell you about a game I made with a bunch of friends. And the game is called:\n\n**EmptyEpsilon**\n\nIt\u0027s a futuristic spaceship bridge simulator game. Like a Star Trek bridge, but then in your own home (or office). The idea of the game is that you gather a bunch of friends. Designate 1 person as a captain, put the other crew behind different \u0022stations\u0022 that control different parts of the ship, and fly missions. Kill enemies, and try NOT to touch that tempting \u0022self destruct\u0022 button.\n\nOptimal is to play with 6 people in total. But I\u0027ve played with as little as 3.\n\n**History**\n\nAbout a year ago, me and some guys played a sessions of [Artemis Spaceship Bridge simulator](http://www.artemis.eochu.com/). We really enjoyed ourselves. But, we ran into quite a few issues with the game as a whole.\n\nOur main problems where:\n\n- Comms station was boring as hell, you pretty much sit there, tell all stations to make nukes. And that\u0027s about it, you can report that stations are under attack, but science should be noticing that earlier in most cases.\n- Game lost sync. What was happening on the server was not always happening on the clients. Annoying as hell, as sometimes enemy ships where in front of us on the main screen, but behind us on the weapons screen. Ruins the fun quite quick.\n- While it has a \u0022game master\u0022 screen. You cannot do much there. You cannot even create new enemies in a simple way.\n- Visuals. Space is black. Not green\u002Bblue\u002Byellow\u002B\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQSNhk5ICTI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nSo, being the software engines that we are, we programmed our own game from scratch. (Not with blackjack and hookers... yet)\n\nAnd, being the nice people that we are. And because we created it for our own amusement. We are giving it away for free, including the sourcecode. So anyone can modify it up to their own wishes.\n\n**So, what\u0027s in the game?**\n\nWell, we\u0027re still working on it. But the game is quite complete already. We have:\n\n- Up to 32 player ships, allowing up to 192 players to play in single game (this has not been tested, but should work in theory. Max computers connected to a single session was 12 so far)\n- Bunch of different enemy types. From simple fighter enemies, to advanced ships with missile weapons and warp drives.\n- 5 different officer stations:  \n\n    - Helms - Controls the ships movement. Heading set to 115deg, full speed ahead. Preparing for a jump of 20km.\n    - Weapons - Fire zhe missles! MOAR NUKES!\n    - Engineering - But captain, I\u0027m giving it all she\u0027s got! Sending out repair crews to fix the front shield generator!\n    - Science - Scanning... scanning... enemies everywhere captain. Put weapons on 480THz for maximum effectiveness.\n    - Relay - Just requested backup at station DS5, and supplied will be dropped of at WP3 in sector D4. Also got a friendly scout ship scanning the nebula in C2 for enemies.\n\n    [\\*] 1 captains main screen per friendly ship. Can be just on a 3D screen, or switched to short and long range radar. We put this on a beamer, but you can also put it on a big TV. It\u0027s best if all players can see this.\n\n    [\\*] Fully scriptable scenarios.\n\n    [\\*] Actually, lots of stuff is scriptable. Even communications that the relay officer does. And the layout of the ships, the \u0022factions\u0022 that are in the game. You can pretty much customize the game to be star-trek if you want (not doing that for IP reasons, and we don\u0027t want to be true to star-trek)\n\n    [\\*] That said. The main goal is fun. Not realism. So the physics are \u0022wrong\u0022, you stop when you turn your engine off. But who cares, that makes for a better game. If anyone asks, it\u0027s because of the anti-gravity-based-impulse-drive.\n\n    [\\*] Nukes, mines, missiles and EMP missiles. Oh, and lasers. Lots of lasers.\n\n    [\\*] Full fancy 2D action! No need to think in complex 3D maneuvers during the heat of battle. You cannot go up/down. Once again, not realistic, but makes it easier to program, and less complex to play.\n\n    [\\*] A useful game-master screen. Want to play a complex scenario, and do not want to script it? Well, put someone behind the GM screen, and he can create\u0026destroy just about anything. He can order ships around with ease. Even magically move them around with the powers of a god! He can even hail the relay officer on the player ship and chat with him. Having a friendly suddenly turn on you? You could do that with the GM screen.\n\n    [\\*] Jump drives, warp drives, or both. Personally more a fan of jump drives on player ships. But that\u0027s fully configurable.\n\n    [\\*] Optional touch-screen support (we managed to get 5 very nice touch screens for cheap)\n\n**Screenshots!**\n\nExample of the main screen:\n\n![RZX7u1e.png](http://i.imgur.com/RZX7u1e.png)\n\nShowing the players ship. A nebula in the distance (which blocks long range radar)\n\nSlightly older screenshot, showing 2 enemies attacking a player. And a small station in the distance.\n\n![mainscreen.png](http://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/screenshots/mainscreen.png)\n\nThe helms station. Once again, slightly dated screenshot (the combat maneuvers at the bottom did not work out that well, and have been replaced by a different system)\n\n![helms.png](http://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/screenshots/helms.png)\n\nWeapons. Easy. Weapon tubes, shields on/off (so important, so much fun when people forget this ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) )\n\n![weapons.png](http://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/screenshots/weapons.png)\n\nEngineering. Controls power\u0026coolant levels of different systems. Needs to manage the heat of those systems. More power to a system means a more effective system. Also controls the repair crews.\n\n![engineering.png](http://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/screenshots/engineering.png)\n\nScience. Long range scanning radar. Your information is vital for the captain. As you can see doom or easy prey incoming, and tell the difference. 25km range by default (can be changed when setting up the game)\n\n![science.png](http://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/screenshots/science.png)\n\nRelay. Can always see around friendly ships\u0026stations in a 5km range. Can talk to both ships and stations. Has different information then science. Can send ships into nebulas for watching inside those.\n\n![relay.png](http://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/screenshots/relay.png)\n\n**Hardware?**\n\nBecause we are slightly crazy. We made our own hardware setup with touchscreens. (also, we have 3D printers and a big CNC mill. So that made it easier)\n\nHere the setup is just being \u0022stored\u0022.\n\n![20150116_114106.small.jpg](http://daid.eu/~daid/20150116_114106.small.jpg)\n\nActually setting up the game. Using a TV because we couldn\u0027t find the beamer we usually use.\n\n![20150219_204125.small.jpg](http://daid.eu/~daid/20150219_204125.small.jpg)\n\nOlder setup photo, when only 3 of the touchscreens where ready:\n\n![20141106_190834.small.jpg](http://daid.eu/~daid/20141106_190834.small.jpg)\n\n(We usually play with the lights off, which makes taking photos during play sessions hard)\n\n**Finally!**\n\nWell, if you have read up to this point. You most likely want these links.\n\n[http://emptyepsilon.org/](http://emptyepsilon.org/) \u003C- Main website\n\n[http://software.ultimaker.com/EmptyEpsilon/](http://software.ultimaker.com/EmptyEpsilon/) \u003C- Downloads of pre-compiled versions (Mac version might still be broken)\n\n[http://bridgesim.net/](http://bridgesim.net/) \u003C- Place where we talk about the game (not that active.

The rest enjoyed the game because of all the hilarious stuff that goes wrong due to miss-communications. (Like enemy shield levels being interpreted as your own shield level).

Game is still being improved. Lots of small tweaks and fixes has been made, as well as this list:  \n\nMostly, bugfixes, and small enhancements.  \n\n\\* Two new scripted scenarios that actually give you more advanced game objectives then \u0022destroy everything!\u0022  \n\n\\* New \u0022science scanning\u0022 minigame. Practice makes you better at this, and makes science more engaging to play.  \n\n\\* Bunch of new alien ships with a new race.  \n\n\\* New AI that fires a volley of missiles at your side instead of taking you head on.  \n\n\\* The new ship-scanning \u0022minigame\u0022 can be disabled server wide, which is better for conventions where new players are already overwhelmed with the game without this.  \n\n\\* Self destruct now has a countdown. (Abandon ship! Have your crew run out of the room like maniacs during this time, tripping over cables and destroying computers in the process)  \n\n\\* 5 new transport ship models, with 1 to 5 cargo containers each.  \n\n\\* Fixed a few problems when using the 3/4 crew member screen options, where some controls where not accessible.  \n\n\\* Added extra console types, \u0022damcon\u0022 which is just the top part of engineering, \u0022power management\u0022 which is just the bottom of engineering. \u0022database\u0022, which is just the science database.  \n\nChanges for modding/changing the game:  \n\n\\* F5 in the GM screen copies the current selected objects to the clipboard for pasting in script files. For easier setup of new scenario scripts.  \n\n\\* Music list is no longer hard-coded, and any file in the music directory will be used at random.  \n\n\\* Objects can have descriptions that are shown in the science station.  \n\n\\* (not yet in the latest release, but code finished). Allow scenarios to define GM functions, that show up as buttons on the GM screen.  \n\nAlso, some people have been testing to play trough the internet, which worked very well according to their report.
