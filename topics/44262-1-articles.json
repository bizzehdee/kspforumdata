I\u0027ll not add anything new but will suggest ways you can help yourself. First, as mentioned above, a screen shot will help us if you want our help. Captain Sierra tells you how to get the picture to us. OK, this will be new. If you are using a Mac and access the game via Steam, go to Library (to the right of the Store tab). In the list on the left side, right click on Kerbal Space Program. Click on Properties in the new menu. Then the Local Files tab in the pop up menu. Then the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBrowse Local Files ...\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 button. Find the Screenshots folder. Your screenshot(s) will be in there. Just drag the photos from within the folder to a folder on your desktop or in the Finder. Then proceed with Captain Sierra\u0027s instructions. Back to the not so new. When you are in the VAB, look at the parts you are using for your rover. Also look at batteries and the nuclear generator. Read what they do, how much power they use or generate. Remember to look at their mass. You will need to total up what your parts use in electricity and find the parts which will generate that total (per second or per minute). For solar panels, do they move or not? Do you need to open them or not? As said above, these only work in enough sunlight. Recommendations to add a battery or a nuclear generator are good suggestions. When you are ready, post your picture and we can help you if you still need help.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-04T23:57:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2013 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGrammar.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T00:13:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using RTGs, you need to pack at least one per wheel plus an extra one or two for additional systems. You can have fewer but you\u0027ll want to pack batteries; I\u0027d pack batteries anyway in case your power draw is higher than you anticipate (my Hellhounds have eight RTGs plus a couple of Z-100 battery packs, and six wheels). At least that way you can drive for a while on battery power, let off the gas when the batteries run dry and let the RTGs charge them back up - my mini-rovers work that way. Solar panels work well and weigh less for the amount of power they produce, but of course they only work during the day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, it really depends on a large number of factors - for an exact fix, we\u0027d need to see the craft in question.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
