In your case, you lack most of the lateral speed required to stay in orbit, so you want to burn either radialy or anti-radialy (the blue markers on your maneuver node). Use the one pointing torwards Kerbin, as you have a bit of lateral motion in that direction and we don\u0027t want that to go to waste, don\u0027t we? As the Mun has no atmosphere, a pretty low periapsis will suffice, albeit I would keep it above 5km to avoid munar peaks getting in your way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd 45 degrees? Isn\u0027t the \u0022eyeball-y\u0022 way to wait until Munrise/Munset and push your Apoapsis out, resulting in an angle of about 90 degrees?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T08:12:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Aiming at the Mun rising\u0022 while useful, won\u0027t help him reach other bodies. IMHO it\u0027s better to learn maneuver nodes from the start. Also, you don\u0027t really need to cross the Mun\u0027s orbit. You just need to get an encounter when you are at AP, or near it. You will move very slowly then, which means your retrograde burn to get into Mun orbit will cost less dV. It\u0027s easy to see when your trajectory \u0022jumps\u0022 into Mun\u0027s SoI - if it\u0027s straight (or close to straight line) it means you are moving fast. If it\u0027s curving around the Mun already, it means relatively small burn will get you into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
