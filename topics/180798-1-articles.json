However, I quickly discovered that vertical decouplers were missing from my local computer. I therefore tried to completely remove KSP from my computer and reinstall. Including saved games and AppData. This didn\u0027t help and suddenly gave a new problem. All texts were replaced with #autoLOC_number. I couldn\u0027t fix the error. I tried deleting\u00A0steam completely, and change the download server in steam. Nothing helped. I even tried to make a clean installation of windows 10 in a virtual computer, but here the error also came. Is there anyone who knows how to solve the problem. I can play through Geforce Now, but I want to play on my local computer whenever I can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-23T01:16:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223509633\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022180798\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221545516042\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022194184\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hansj\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, hansj said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter starting KSP via Geforce Now,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a history of third party launchers screwing up the files of KSP, causing a variety of issues including #autoloc errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223509633\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022180798\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221545516042\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022194184\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hansj\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, hansj said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried deleting\u00A0steam completely, and change the download server in steam.

On that server I can run steam and start my games from there. I think the difference is that nvidia caches the games, so I don\u0027t have to wait for the download.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nuclear option was my last resort. I have tried to reinstall several times. I just wanted to make sure there was nothing else on my computer that bothered KSP.

He has noticed that it is steam that deletes files when it starts KPS. This also happens to me. A workaround is to start\u00A0KPS directly from the folder, bypassing steam, but it is not really a good solution in the long run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
