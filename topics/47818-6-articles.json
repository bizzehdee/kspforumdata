With FAR don\u0027t make any large corrections low in the atmosphere or when moving greater than Mach 1. Another thing to consider is ensuring the CoM and CoL are in the proper orientation (you may need to move fuel forwards). Depending on Altitude you may need to make a couple of passes through the atmosphere.

Or is that a separate tutorial?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasic quick version: level planes turn horribly. To make them turn, you need to bank and then pull up. As you bank, watch the navball. If your nose starts dipping below level, either reduce your bank or yaw upwards to keep the nose up. If you have FAR installed, watch the flight condition indicator and back off if it gets beyond minor stall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for landing...the trick is to get lined up, slow and low as early as possible. Watch your bearing; the KSC runway is east-west, so if you\u0027re in line your bearing should be 90 or 270 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may find it helpful to park a rover just off each end of the runway to use as navigation beacons. Set the furthest one as a target on approach, and aim for it. Occasionally flick your target to the other one; if both targets are on a heading of 90 (or 270 if you\u0027re coming from the east), then you know that you\u0027re roughly in line with the strip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt landing, bleed off as much speed as possible, but try to avoid any vigorous manoeuvres once you\u0027re over the strip (you\u0027ll probably over-correct and make things worse). A touchdown speed of 100m/s or so is fine. Be prepared to do a bit of very gentle steering after you land, and make sure that you have the steering unlocked on your front gear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smurfalot","CreatedById":72587,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T06:45:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBasic quick version: level planes turn horribly.
