The main reason is energy costs. I will explain. An ordinary household hair dryer consumes approximately 0.375 watts for 15 minutes of operation. High-power hair dryer (construction) - about twice as much. For efficient operation, there must be at least 20 nozzles under the bottom of the machine. We get about 17 watts for 15 minutes of work. In order to clean a street 2 km long, it will take about 1.5 hours and we get about 102 watts. For an hour and a half of work. Now imagine that such a system works for several hours every day.
