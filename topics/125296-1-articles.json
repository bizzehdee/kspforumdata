Take off from KSP, angling east to get into a prograde kerbin orbin, lining up as close to the equator as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Make a maneuver node so that you reach the mun\u0027s orbit, making sure the Mun Encounter occurs before crossing the Mun\u0027s orbital path. If you cross that line, you will get into a retrograde Munar orbit. To setup this maneuver node, fiddle with the icon by grabbing the white circle and pulling it around your current kerbin orbit path. Did you know you could do this? By adjusting the white circle and playing with prograde/retrograde, you should be able to setup a decent Mun encounter. It doesn\u0027t matter if the encounter occurs in front of, or behind, the Mun, as long as you don\u0027t cross the Mun\u0027s orbital line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Fast forward to the mun encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. When you get your Munar vector line, setup a maneuver point to orbit the Mun by retrograding (slowing down). I set this point up in the middle of the line, at the Ap point. After executing this, you should have a decent prograde orbit around the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Retrograde accordingly to get down to 100K orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Setup a maneuver node, retrograding to the spot desired on the Mun. I try to pick a spot clear of craters. I don\u0027t come straight down, but at a bit of an angle. The more angle you use, the more inaccurate your landing spot will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Hit the maneuver node and come down. With the weight of my ship, I fire my engines at 25K to slow down. I am pointing directly retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Nearing the surface, 3 of my fuel tanks inevitably run out, and I have to jettison them. This causes my ship to move a bit in another direction, so i have to use RCS to stabilize. I also have to take SAS off of retrograde and put it on stability assist, otherwise I\u0027ll be pointed at a bad angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Land. Sounds simple, but often isn\u0027t. Use RCS to stop moving laterally. Avoid craters. I use radiators, besides landing struts, for additional stabilization in case I land on an angled surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I do when I want to land on the Mun and do research, plant a flag, etc. I would not do this if trying to rescue someone. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E In my experience, it\u0027s too frustrating to try to hit that exact point on the mun without wasting a ton of fuel, inevitably not having enough to get back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, I use what I call a \u0022space buggy\u0022. It is a ship that can also fly like a plane. It is a normal looking rocket with capsule/180 fuel tank/360 fuel tank/terrier engine. It has 6 LY-01 landing gears on the \u0022underside\u0022 so it can take off and land like a plane. It also has 4 vernor engines on the underside that ease landing, along with the usual 2 sets of RCS on the 4 axis (top/bottom).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a fuel depot orbiting the Mun. The space buggy is docked to the depot. Whenever I need to rescue someone on the surface, or perform temp/pressure scans on the surface, I send the buggy out. I can see the markers and a target far more easily with this ship than I could with a normal \u0022upright\u0022 ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI perform the tasks, and have enough fuel to make orbit again and rendezvous with the depot. After achieving Munar orbit, it is surprisingly easy to use only RCS to link back up with the depot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a crash on the Mun, stranding a kerbal, and spent two week trying to design the right ship to get him. I eventually used my original design, detailed above. I left the kerbal at the depot, in case I need to perform EVAs for future Munar missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: I believe you can perform your rescue with one ship, but it\u0027s going to be very frustrating. And the further they are from the equator, the worse it will be.

If you don\u0026#39;t like mods, it is possible to work out \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC\u009DV with some not-too-hard mathematics, but that\u0026#39;s rather tedious to do.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Set up your approach before you get there.

Have a capsule with a pilot and the lander can with heat shield at the bottom. Don\u0026#39;t be cheap about getting it there, you\u0026#39;ll spend more doing it twice. Overbuild the rescue rocket so you can orbit the Mun with the second stage, even slow down a bit with it on decent if you are lucky. Then your lander will have plenty of fuel for the rest of the matters.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI found that having a one star pilot helps a ton for landings, make them point at retrograde in surface mode so you can focus on the speed end of it.
