How do you place waypoints? And Is it possible to have the comm system enabled, but still transmit without the restrictions imposed by it? Is it possible to place waypoints without the comm system?\u00A0What I really need to do is place waypoints across Kerbin out of range of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0without a orbital\u00A0communication satellite system.

For KerbNet to remain activated, it needs a comm connection. So, in general, the answer to your question is no. If you have CommNet turned on and set to max difficulty, then you won\u0027t have connectivity, and you won\u0027t have KerbNet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo actually place the waypoint, you click the mouse to move the KerbNet cursor to your target, you enter a name in the name input window (there is usually an amusing default name there already to overwrite), and you click the waypoint button.
