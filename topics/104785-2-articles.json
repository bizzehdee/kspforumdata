It cannot because it has been too open for too long. Almost all of the great mods have been released under licenses that would disallow their creators from properly monetizing them. Once code has been released open source it cannot be crammed back into a proprietary license. So any number of people could attempt to monetize such a mod. Some other licenses, the \u0022copyleft\u0022 branch, specifically forbid monetization. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if monetization was legally practical, the IP issues would be insane. Nearly every mod here relies in some part on others such as module manager. Releasing a monetized copy of a mod with a bundled copy of a dependency would require permissions. Then imagine if the dependency was subjected to a takedown. Not only would it break all those who use it, but they too would be subject to the takedown. And then there are the Squad-specific trademark issues. Trademarks must be defended. It\u0027s not an option. If you don\u0027t defend your mark then you can loose your mark. If mods become monetized, any mod using Squad\u0027s trademarks would have to be stopped. So basically every mod with the name \u0022Kerbal\u0022 would probably be struck down or renamed.
