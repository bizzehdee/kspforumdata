When you switch to the docking/rcs controle on the ship, it can only go into the first mode, which rotates the ship on all axis, however if you then press space to switch the mode to get direction control in all axis it switches the little indicator light on the bottum left, doesnt change to the direction modus and stages the ship.\n\nUnless there has been a big change in how the rcs control works, that i am not aware of, i dont think it should happen.\n\nLove the update btw!!\n\ngrtz"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:20:22Z","Content":"Ahh this can happen with an old settings.cfg, close KSP, delete that file and start it up, docking mode should be fine after that ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"muckratz","CreatedById":74596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T11:46:56Z","Content":"that did the trick, thank you"}]}
