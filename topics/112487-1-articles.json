It just so happened to be developed mostly in US and as such inherited the imperial system in those facets. In modern times where all controlled traffic has onboard computers and autopilots it really doesn\u0027t matter what units an autopilot uses. For example, a flight level 200 is defined as 20 000 feet, but a computer can just as easily calculate it as 6 100 m. Or a convention can be changed.\n\nThe decision to use imperial was arbitrary.

The problems that can be caused in the Real World of engineering (not just aerospace) are enormous, and sometimes very expensive. I say \u0022continue\u0022 to go metric, because in fact most engineers DO now use metric units at all stages of their work, except when sending out press releases when everything has to be converted for the press.\n\nAn example problem: A stateside engineering company prepared plans for a factory to be built in the UK, which included a spreadsheet of all the ducting, piping and cabling lengths necessary. They sent the plans to the company that would be doing the building, and stated that all measurements were metric. The builders started pre-ordering materials. Then a kid on work experience noticed that the toilet cubicles were stated to be nearly TEN METRES WIDE! The US engineers had got the conversion back-to-front for many measurements, so a lot of linear measurements, for instance, were 3.28^2, ie. 10.75 times too big.\n\nThat sharp-eyed kid saved the builders a ....load of money in over-ordered ducts, pipes and wiring. The builders had to ask for the plans in traditional measurements and do the conversions themselves.\n\nAt least there is only one non-metric system to deal with - there used to be several different versions across the world! My grandfather was an engineering consultant and he had to carry tables of conversions for the different standards of foot, yard, pound and so on that he encountered during his work (and had to use a sliderule to do the conversions, but that\u0027s a different story).\n\nNevertheless, two systems of units is one too many, and life will get a lot simpler if we ever manage to cut it down to just one."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T19:41:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And how you calculate speed without length unit?\n\nYou don\u0027t.
