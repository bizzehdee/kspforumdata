Large control surfaces and offset thrust allow the sukhoi to manoeuvre effectively when under power but also glide well without the risk of major stalling which is prevented through the balance of the centres of lift and mass. Presented here are two variants:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Its offset engines and large control surfaces allow for fast and instantaneous manoeuvres \n\n[https://mega.co.nz/#!qEknxAzI!BZQ2KkwgUDtInK9XocDDgKG5zs2pkL008_rb2H8IGgc](https://mega.co.nz/#!qEknxAzI!BZQ2KkwgUDtInK9XocDDgKG5zs2pkL008_rb2H8IGgc)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
