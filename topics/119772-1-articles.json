The fastest the object is moving the least the effect, but is there a mathematical relationship between the force and degrees/second prograde heading change?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T20:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course there is a mathematical relationship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s vector addition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you know the velocity change in normal direction, then is just a simple right angle triangle hypotenuse calculation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a more general calculation, this is how you do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://mathinsight.org/media/image/image/vector_2d_add.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vector_2d_add.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
