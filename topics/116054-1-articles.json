It consists of Miner itself and Tanker, which is hauling fuel from ground to orbit for refueling. Both have wheels for ground docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is docking these 2 vehicles on ground. As they are on wheels, their height is changing based on how much fuel \\ ore they have inside, so docking ports are not usable. I tried to use magnet and winch from KAS, but when I eject the magnet and retract the cable, even when docking mode is selected in KAS menu, vehicles won\u0027t merge into one and I cannot transfer resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible solutions other than KAS magnet:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut both vehicles on landing gear, which is not changing height and therefore docking ports would be possible - this would compromise my design, would like to avoid it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse claw - I heard it can often cause Kraken\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse pipes from KAS - this would require manned craft and I don\u0027t want to leave my poor kerbal there forever\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, any chance to get KAS connection working or other ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T09:46:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought only the connector port can do this job?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T10:30:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFly a Kerbal out there and use KAS pipes/docking ports (as mentioned, the magnet doesn\u0027t \u0022join\u0022 ships, it just lets you winch one in).. sounds like it\u0027s the most viable option there...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturning a Kerbal from Minmus doesn\u0027t take much at all, and if you want to make it \u0027feel nice\u0027, set yourself up a bit of a station out there he can hang out in.. maybe stick an MPL up there and have some scientists processing some of the masses of science that Minmus can provide to have \u0022something to do\u0022 out there...

For the docking alignment thing, I like to use aircraft wheels. But, like Dilli said, a burst of thrust, RCS, or torque will usually nudge things into place.
