At smaller bodies with relatively low gravity, it doesn\u0027t take a great deal of delta-v to raise your apoapsis. And since prograde burns are most effective at peri, and inclination changes most effective wherever velocity is least, this type of maneuver can sometimes save fuel.

When you shut down your engine *then*, you\u0027ll neither slow down nor hit the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR: \u003Cstrong\u003Evertical momentum will eventually be eaten by gravity, any horizontal momentum is yours forever.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for practical purposes you can\u0027t just lay your rocket flat on the ground and start the engines. First you have to get high enough as to not run into the next hill; but from then on, you should point as horizontal as possible, pitching only just enough as to maintain altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most fuel-efficient landing is doing just the same, but in reverse: kill your horizontal speed while pitching just enough to maintain your altitude. That pitch will be slight until you\u0027re almost there; due to the way vectors add up, fighting gravity along the way will actually cost you very little fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell you can use the hill as a boost to the orbit in minmus, doesnt it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand you all didnt answer what\u0027s the formula for the optimal waiting orbit. is it the lowest orbit possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s seems wrong because as close you are to the body you have more horizontal speed to kill \u0026amp; gain back...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T22:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JtPB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JtPB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand you all didnt answer what\u0027s the formula for the optimal waiting orbit. is it the lowest orbit possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s seems wrong because as close you are to the body you have more horizontal speed to kill \u0026amp; gain back...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no single ideal waiting orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re optimizing for delta-v and nothing else, stay in the first orbit you get -- just expend enough delta-v to stay in the SOI and be done with it. The most delta-v effective way of doing /that/ is to aim for the lowest possible periapsis in the encounter, then organize your capture from there. The resulting, highly eccentric orbit makes the eventual rendezvous more tedious to set up and execute, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re looking for comfort (ease of rendezvous), get a circular orbit that is somewhat higher than minimum, though not by too much. The lander ascents to the lowest possible orbit, and the greater the difference between their orbital periods, the shorter is your wait until the next opportunity. Though you can shorten the waiting time in orbit if you make your ascent at the right time (basically, when the target just passes overhead or a little later).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe smaller the difference between orbits, the shorter your burn needs to be. When setting up a rendezvous, burn times should be rather short for higher precision. Depends on your skills, really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, no formula. If you have delta-V to spare, use it to make your life easier.
