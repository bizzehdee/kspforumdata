In 2011 they came out with a 256 neuron, 256^2 synapses chip, so in 3 years they increase capacity by 4096 times. The human brain is ~80 billion neurons and \u0026lt;800,000 trillion synapses so if neuron equal neurons and synapses equal synapses and that rate of capacity growth holds they should have human brain equivalence in 2020-2025. Of course the human brain uses analogy synapses, these are still digital, but it should not be hard to develop an analog synapse, the synapse it self is just a transistor. The Neuromorphic chips already have a huge speed advantage over biological neural circuits, that 2011 prototype clock in at 2 million firings per second per neuron, biological neurons top out at roughly 1000 per second: an artificial brain at those firing speeds would experience half an hour for every second a biological brain experiences, that is fast enough to see bullets and dodge them, assuming the robot body could move that fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T15:03:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIBM came out with 1 million neuron, 256 million synapses, neuromorphic processor this year, that about a frogs brain.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1 million neurons-and no glial cells, which are equally vital and have much more complex behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T15:40:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t one of the problems that we are still not entirely sure of the different neuron types and what they actually do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T16:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryten\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kryten\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1 million neurons-and no glial cells, which are equally vital and have much more complex behaviour.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is speculator if Glial cells provide any computational capabilities, they may function only a supports for neurons.
