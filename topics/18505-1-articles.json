The Fragosus Project was met with many failures early on. The power required to get these stations into orbit was so immense that the lift vehicles would simply crush themselves. After many attempts to redesign the launch vehicle, and 21 fatalities during testing, the Fragosus-1 made it into orbit. Shortly after Fragosus-1 achieved orbit, the moment of truth arrived. Could these stations remain stable during crew transfer? After a half hour of deadly maneuvers, the answer arrived. Matlin Kerman of the first crew aboard the Fragosus-1 station reported from the Armstrong EPL meant to bring him home saying \u0022The new crew is safely aboard.\u0022 Matlin returned to Kerbin only a few kilometers from KSC. It was then discovered that the others on his crew had died during EVA activities. This was still counted as a success due to the original goal of the project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zpP3B.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zpP3B.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WQTPi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WQTPi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7ZEgY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227ZEgY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YBBlA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YBBlA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L8Y2p.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L8Y2p.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did create a logo for this project much like I did for Singularity a long time ago, however I can\u0027t seem to find a way to shrink the image down on this new forum.
