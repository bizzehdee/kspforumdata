I like the way it is now, ie constructing the parts first, especially as you can just ship the parts rather than using mining. I suppose you could simplify it and have one or two construction part types, PLUS some rare materials added in for certain types of ship parts. (OK, this is confusing talking about \u0027construction parts\u0027 and \u0027ship parts\u0027, ie the fuel tanks, engines etc. Too many \u0027parts!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we go that way how about having an automatic rating for a part? Say, the cost per unit weight as well as the tab it\u0027s under? So if a part costs a lot for it\u0027s weight it\u0027ll need rare materials (or more of the advanced construction parts if we just go with several types of constuction parts and no added materials), and it the cost is low per unit weight it\u0027ll need just basic construction parts for that ship part. It\u0027d be automatic enough to deal with any mod as long as they rate the cost of the ship part well enough and put it in the right tab for that part.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-23T19:28:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2013 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Patupi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnti-confusionalization\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lanceo90","CreatedById":72070,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T21:58:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I\u0027m loading the game it hangs up on the _.model file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed the folder is called MACOSX, does this mean the reason is because it\u0027s not meant for Windows?
