On my sandbox save I learned the basics of the BDArmory AI flight computer, with a fighter I\u0027d designed being piloted by the computer. I had to do takeoff manually, since when I tried letting it do that it knocked the engine off. On my career save I made a little cruddy science lab for kerbin which didn\u0027t gain much science, and then made a smaller one with a lab in it that go science from the sph, admin building, and astronaut complex and got me lots of science. I also did a tourist rocket with some science stuff from the bargain rocket mod (I could care less about the rocket and fuel and other stuff in it, but I love the science stuff) that netted me a whopping 500 or so science! Plus I put my Kerbinport in orbit with...ummm...hyperedit. I know, I feel guilty about it, but my launch systems for it weren\u0027t working, probably due to fuel drainage from the bottom making it top heavy and causing it to sway and break. So that\u0027s getting me science, which I just now realized I should use for a multihub connector so I can make a better lifting stage, and maybe a heavy lifter design that I know will work instead of having a unique lifter stage for everything I try to put into space. Also, I think I\u0027ve come up with a solution to the majority of my landships\u0027 AA armament not firing: I should use 20mm vulcan turrets instead of 30mm chainguns. The only problem is that my latest ship doesn\u0027t have any 20mm ammo, and I\u0027ll probably have to add enclosures for the ammo so it\u0027s not exposed on deck. Granted the metal plates probably don\u0027t add much more protection to the ammo and nuclear reactor and stuff than if they were in the open, but it makes me feel safer anyway. The other possible problem for the 20mms is that they have a smaller firing arc than the chainguns, which isn\u0027t much of a problem for those mounted broadside, but kind of is for those mounted on the superstructure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T22:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/EdGrM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
