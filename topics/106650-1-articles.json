I much prefer to do surveys for cash on Minmus, where I can hop around in a rover with an ion engine all day long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut your way sounds like one of the easier ways to do it. If I HAD to take a multiple location survey contract on the other side of Kerbin, I think I would put a tiny plane with rover wheels into a big-S fairing and send the whole thing over the pole like an ICBM. Re-enter, eject the fairing right before it explodes, decouple the plane and fly around. Land and drive to the surface site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
