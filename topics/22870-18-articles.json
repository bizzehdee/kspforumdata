I\u0027d say for the struts between the trihex and the connectors for radial modules go with 6-9, but for the small pipes go with 3\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-25T03:33:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2014 03:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Greys\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biotronic","CreatedById":72381,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T00:51:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s at least three of us working on replacements, then.
