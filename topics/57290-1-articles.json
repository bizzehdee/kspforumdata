As for the engines, it was never my intention to create a 1 part orbiter, I might need tweak its specifications also. It was more for returning from to Kerbin from a low orbitting station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if I made another version of the capsule, minus heatshield and engines? Would that be fine?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DevL","CreatedById":98041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T22:38:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027d be more interested in the command pod itself and less in the fairings, LES, and LKO return thrusters. I\u0027m not saying you shouldn\u0027t go ahead and work on the things you like. After all, it\u0027s your creation. However, I would suggest focusing on one part at a time and releasing often. That way you\u0027ll get much better feedback than now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
