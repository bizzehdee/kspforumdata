When initiating a stating function could MechJeb zero out control inputs for a short delay prior to and after the staging function so as to allow for those spent components to drop free without a pitch or yaw input? Normally on my launches with large parallel boosters I have to stab \u0022T\u0022 for a moment to keep the craft from a pitch or yaw moment and prevent a strike between my active stages and the spent stages as they drop away.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn to properly use Seperatrons and this would not be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy SHLV (that\u0027s SuperHeavyLaunchVehicle) is 386 parts, made of the orange rockomax tanks, and has 10 stages just for accent into LKO.
