(Well, not all of it.)\n\nAirbus A330-300: The successful competitor to the Boeing 777, the A330 is a twin-engined wide-body aircraft, capable of operating on both medium and long-haul flights respectively. After the [permission of certain aircraft by the FAA to fly long-haul routes with twin engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETOPS), It has grown beyond the short routes of domestic and regional flights.\n\n![BUkyFs6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BUkyFs6.jpg)\n\n![0HcRAim.png](http://i.imgur.com/0HcRAim.png)\n\n[**Download for craft file - MediaFire**](http://www./download/awqomctsbe5hgqu/Airbus_A330-300.craft) **(A330-300)**\n\nAirbus A340-313X: The longer-range and less fortunate sister to the A330, the A340 played an irreplaceable role before the dawn of twinjet transcontinental aircraft. While it is no longer in production (i cri ebrytaym ;-; ) the aircraft is still in use by airlines all over the world, mainly because of it\u0027s unpeakable range.\n\n![AfEjkd2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AfEjkd2.jpg)\n\n![SzVLdZ7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SzVLdZ7.jpg)\n\n![vGzeUGs.png](http://i.imgur.com/vGzeUGs.png)\n\n[**Download for craft file - Mediafire**](http://www./download/4lhkdygix1qklc8/Airbus_A340-313X.craft) **(A340-300)**\n\n**Changelog:**\n\n**Version 1.5 Released!**\n\n**Changes:**\n\n**-Center gear for A330 removed.** \n\n**-A340 is more powerful and faster.**\n\n**-Issue with aircraft yawing opposite way during rolls fixed.**\n\nThanks for viewing!

I needed to keep the cruising speed and ability similar, and I may have overdone it on the A340 (If you looked at the jets - they\u0027re 85% thrust). The A330 was pretty much adapted from the A340-300, with B747-400 engines attached.\n\nAlso explains why the center gear is still there. I should\u0027ve removed it before release.\n\nAnd I never knew that the rudder made it yaw to the opposite direction, honestly. More testing showed this pretty soon. \n\nFor backtracking with asymmetric thrust, I may have to rely on more control surfaces - It seemed unrealistic to use engines asymmetrically to turn on ground, and there\u0027s no steering ability on the nose gear. (SQUAD plz) I have to rely on more control surface input in that case.\n\nI\u0027m astonished that you were at least able to land it - My two attempts, both with the A340 were failures. My first attempt during a landing ripped an engine straight off (and I had to struggle all the way to KSC). \n\n![tCpas0u.png](http://i.imgur.com/tCpas0u.png)\n\nThe second ran over the runway and was potentially destroyed but the crew survived. Oddly, it reminded me of [Air France flight 358.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_358)\n\n![Ka6umcq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Ka6umcq.jpg)\n\nAlright, I\u0027m working on it.
