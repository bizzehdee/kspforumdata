I started playing KSP 1.9.0 recently and it is very fun to play around in! And making dogfights is not easy in stock KSP! So I have multiple mods! (Somw of them: VesselEasySwitch, VesselMover, BDArmory, and more) But VesselMover does not appear on screen and does not work! I want to spawn another plane for fighting but it is not on the toolbar... I have asked SonofSmith on YT before and he said Toolbar Controller would help but it did not... Can anyone help me? (I am new here so I hope everything ic correct here)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUPDATE! SOLVED! I was helped by someone on discord! Inside The VesselMover folder Was a VesselMover.dll which caused troubles!
