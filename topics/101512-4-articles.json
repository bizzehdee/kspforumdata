Regarding the climate change, we can just hole ourselves up somewhere. There are still two big blue yonders left to conquer, regardless of the humans thinking otherwise: That is air and sea. We can simply move some population to the higher ground and the rest to floating cities or giant blimps, let go of some unnecessary stuff like cars (We can just as well travel by electricity-powered trains, monorails and ships) and wait for the better times to come (I\u0027m pretty convinced that they will come, but not after another ice age, see history books for details). In the unlikely event of near-obliteration of life on the Earth at least some of us can hole up in closed-cycle bases similar to space colonies and wait until the planet is habitable again. So the solution exists.or FTL travel to come. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that the wannabe-sentinent species of \u003Cem\u003EHomo Sapiens Sapiens\u003C/em\u003E just can\u0027t realize that other individuals of that species are of that species as well, thus refusing to cooperate in the name of progress and evading major setbacks that collapse of the society would indeed cause. Nobody will build these cities unless they\u0027re paid for it. The problem is not the climate, it\u0027s the humanity itself. By polluting the sh*t (sorry, but had to use that word) out of our homeworld, making bigger and better and more deadly weapons and plotting against each other, we\u0027reh trying our best to destroy ourselves. Frankly, I\u0027m quite surprised we didn\u0027t succeed to do that yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in my opinion, aside from the humanity\u0027s more and more desperate attempts to suicide, the immediate concern should be mineral resources and non-renewable sources in general. If there\u0027s one thing that the humanity is good at, it\u0027s mining, drilling, scavenging, excavating and gathering resources. In fact, we\u0027re so good at that that we\u0027ve managed to nearly deplete the earth\u0027s oil supply in a little more than a century. Good job, Texaco \u0026amp; co. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with mining is that there comes a time when there is nothing to mine, and in that precise moment we\u0027ll start fighting over what\u0027s left. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecycling will help, but not solve the problem: With increasing number of people and increasing development, we need more and more resources. If we stop mining and only recycle, the progress would at best come to a grinding halt; or worse, go backwards. The solution is to mine; mine; drill and excavate some more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I say, is that we should put everything to research space travel and then follow the typical scenario of 4X strategy games, slightly edited to suit our needs: For those of you who don\u0027t know, that is \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.

That you cite outlier events as \u0022proof\u0022 shows a profound lack of understanding. Alarmism on the subject is predicated on any change being unprecedented. Within the range of change they consider critical there is simply no good data for historical climate, much less paler linage. Instead, they use proxies for climate that are not terribly accurate as they all have many confounding factors.\u003Cp\u003ERecent satellite data is actually useful, and directly of comparable to previous years with the same instrument. Even comparing to the previous sat involves complex algorithms, and involves some subjectivity. Pre satellite data is like comparing apples to... Horses (ground data with sparse coverage in space and time, etc). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClimate is is a complex system. The models depend on small changes in initial conditions making large changes in outcomes. The trouble is anything missed in the model might well be a bigger change in initial condition than changing CO2 inputs, sequestration, etc. Like the abysmal modeling of cloud cover they use, or solar inputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it is likely that humans have a measurable impact on climate, I think the magnitude is very poorly characterized. Any mitigation scheme that involves vast sums of money needs to operate with demonstrably predictive models in order to make the right decisions. I expect to be able to literally place an economic cost per 0.whatever change in average temp (a whole other can of worms), and we should be able to test it vs observations, not models. Doing something is not always better than doing nothing, or doing whatever limits pollution (universally good) at the least cost. Mitigation might well be cheaper. From an economic standpoint, the goal is not no pollution, but the right amount for optimal human wellbeing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off - I know Climate != weather.
