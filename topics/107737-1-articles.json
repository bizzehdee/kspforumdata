But not with fairings, though fairings were used on the craft. I put a small service bay on the craft, put in 2 Z-200 batteries and 8 Z-400 on a radial connection to the Z-200. They were clipping through the service bay doors a bit, but I did not care at first.\n\nAfter launching the vessel it was a bit shaky, but I thought it was just my strange construction \u002B the fairing. After reaching Orbit and releasing the fairing it still behaved somewhat strange. When I tried to do time warp it told me it\u0027s not possible when under accelleration. Then I rebuilt my design regarding the batteries and no more issues. So I filed this under: Bad design - .... happens!\n\nI hope I still got the construction saved, will try to reproduce the issue."},{"CreatedByName":"Postremus","CreatedById":135006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T06:54:36Z","Content":"Had the same problem with service bay\u0027s."},{"CreatedByName":"Grenartia","CreatedById":142469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T15:22:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Had the same problem with service bay\u0027s.\n\nI had that same issue with parts going through the service bays.
