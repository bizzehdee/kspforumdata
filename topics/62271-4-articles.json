All the engines are arranged into stages, so by pressing spacebar, the next pair of engines is activated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if something goes wrong, the abort action group is set to shut down all the engines, decouple the capsule, and deploy an emergency parachute. However, the last stage is also set to decouple and deploy the parachute if a new user isn\u0027t familiar with action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EGood for Advanced Users\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite being very easy to use, the Wernhermobile also shows off some more advanced building techniques and action group configurations that can be picked up by more seasoned users as well. The craft uses no ALT\u002BF12 part clipping - just easy-to-replicate clipping techniques using cubic octagonal struts. Some designing tricks I\u0027ve demonstrated in this craft are the use of cubic octagonal struts to mount the 47-RS engines, placing struts \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E where absolutely necessary to save on part count, and rotating radially-attachable parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent a lot of time testing each action group to make sure that you could switch from any one mode to any other mode. In other words, you can be in \u003Cstrong\u003EJet Mode\u003C/strong\u003E and switch to \u003Cstrong\u003EDriving Mode\u003C/strong\u003E, or be in \u003Cstrong\u003ERocket Only Mode\u003C/strong\u003E and switch to \u003Cstrong\u003EJet and Rocket Hybrid Mode\u003C/strong\u003E. All the engines and reaction wheels will turn on or off when needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EGood for Kerbin\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the vehicle\u0027s different operating modes, long-distance voyages are possible. You can be a jet and fly to another continent, land with rockets once you get there, and drive around as a rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, the craft\u0027s structural plate is located right above the center of mass (COM), so you can easily transport small payloads around on Kerbin. You could add a docking port and use the vehicle to transfer fuel, or stick a mini-lander on there that you can decouple and use once you arrive at your destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EGood for Space\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the Wernhermobile\u0027s structural plate is on top of the COM, you can attach a rocket to it and launch it into space. The rocket will tilt over slightly, but if you empty the jet fuel tank, you\u0027ll achieve near-perfect balance. And you likely won\u0027t be needing jet fuel unless you\u0027re going to Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I think is the greatest feature about the Wernhermobile. Whereas the stock Rocket-Power VTOL can\u0027t be transported up to space very easily and is mostly confined to Kerbin, the Wernhermobile is designed to be taken to other planets. Additionally, with 1,800 m/s of Delta-V, you can easily land and return from the Mun, or get into orbit from the surface of Duna. The craft\u0027s two efficient 47-RS engines make this possible, but of course on higher-gravity worlds you\u0027ll have to use \u003Cstrong\u003ERocket-Only Mode\u003C/strong\u003E to generate enough thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Comic Sans MS\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EHappy Flying!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/uc?authuser=0\u0026amp;id=0By0EbHUAiQ3nSl9hYU5ZTEsxUU0\u0026amp;export=download\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Download_link.png/320px-Download_link.png\u0022 alt=\u0022320px-Download_link.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-14T22:42:23Z\u0022 title=\u002202/14/2014 10:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Andrew Hansen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T17:02:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow this is what I call a presentation......and I thought I was up for something by adding a caption into the picture by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that you now have less than 24 hours left to submit your entry if you haven\u0027t yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T17:24:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve been looking at some of the previous BSC\u0027s and sometimes it looks like the voters aren\u0027t looking at the thread post and only at the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrew Hansen","CreatedById":82311,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T17:28:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022briansun1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022briansun1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I\u0027ve been looking at some of the previous BSC\u0027s and sometimes it looks like the voters aren\u0027t looking at the thread post and only at the craft.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree.
