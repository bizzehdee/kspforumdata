Is there no way, shape, or form of n-body gravity that can be utilized by the Unity engine, or is it simply a problem with implementation due to the infinitesimal forces some bodies exert? For example, to combat the implementation problem (if there were n-body gravitational forces), could there be a cut-off at a small fixed number of newtons of gravitational force felt by an object (the cutoff would be at the point when the force felt was so small that an inaccuracy due to floating point errors became incredibly pronounced) in attempt to combat the problems? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m simply trying to figure this out. So, is n-body physics a limitation of the Unity engine or simply difficult to implement? If it is indeed the latter, what problems arise in implementing it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I want to know is that I believe (as do almost everybody else) that a more accurate representation of physics is necessary in a game of KSP\u0027s caliber. The ability to utilize Lagrange points and other aspects of n-body physics would be an incredible boost to possibilities in the game (Think about an L4 station between the Mun and Kerbin).
