Then between 10,000 and 15,000 make your turn from straight up to about 45 degrees in whatever direction you plan on making your orbit. From there you can leave it until your Apoapsis is high enough for orbit (anything above 70km) but as you get better at the game you can start doing smoother turns. Once you get the apoapsis where you want it kill your throttle and wait until you are closer to it. Using a maneuver node can help you figure out exactly when to start burning. When you get close to it burn prograde until your periapsis gets at least above 70km.

Recently i\u0027ve been able to get into orbit much more fuel-efficiently by just looking at my G-force meter: I reduce/increase engine power to try to keep it at 1.5 G\u0027s.

Whenever i go to orbit i usually go for a 100 km parking orbit, from where i adjust to whatever orbit i want it in.

Around 20 km, I slowly start turning to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 tilt. At 50 km I start tilting it towards the tangent (0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m at 50 km height and my apoapsis is above 75km, I significantly lower the throttle until I\u0027m relatively close to apoapsis, or even turn it off.

That\u0027s the efficient way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe sure that, close to exiting the atmosphere, you\u0027re at couple of hundreds of m/s. Otherwise you need to burn away from the tangent to push the periapsis out of the Kerbin, and that\u0027s terribly wasteful. Scratch the design and start again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople often make the mistake when they use full throttle all the time, thinking they need to hurry up because time is running out. There\u0027s no need for that. What\u0027s important after leaving the atmosphere is staying close to the apoapsis. Lateral movement is momentum conserved, there\u0027s no drag. Be patient and balance around the apoapsis until your periapsis climbs above 70 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen extending your apoapsis, do it from the periapsis. It\u0027s the most efficient way because that\u0027s the point with the highest kinetic energy. Bottom of the hill you\u0027re rolling towards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen reducing the periapsis, do it from the apoapsis. You get the gist. Yellow prograde/retrograde markers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen changing inclination, do it at the orbital nodes (ascending/descending node) using the magenta normal/antinormal markers. If you see your orbit going out of control, correct it with yellow markers. Little bit of magenta, little bit of yellow, until you reach the desired inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI rarely use blue radial-in/radial-out markers, but they can be very useful, to me mostly on orbit insertion, to correct the maneuver and to decrease the amount of fuel.

I used to fly like MistaX8 said - straight up to 10,000 then 45 degrees at 090 until my apoapsis hit 100k, then shut down and plan a burn at apoapsis to raise the periapsis out of atmo. Nowadays, I fly more like Spyritdragon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how I like to go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Try to follow the terminal velocity curve as closely as I can manage through the first 10,000m, flying straight up (idea is to get out of the troposphere as quickly as possible). That\u0027s 130 at 3000m, 160 at 5000m, 210 at 8000m and 260 at 10,000m. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) At 10,000 or shortly thereafter, come to course 090, 45 degrees elevation. Speed matters less than gee-force at that point; watch the gee meter for the rest of the ascent. Keep it below 2 gees or you might get a telescopic RUVD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Watch the time to apoapsis. At 30,000 meters, if it\u0027s less than 30 seconds, stay at 45 degrees elevation until the time goes to 35s. If somehow it\u0027s above 45 seconds, go horizontal for a bit until it\u0027s less than 40s. Otherwise, tilt down to the prograde vector; this should usually be somewhere around 10-20 degrees elevation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) At some point, you\u0027re going to start gaining a lot of time to apoapsis; this is normal - let it happen but don\u0027t change your course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) At 50,000 tilt to 5-10 degrees elevation. Watch the gee meter and the apopasis elevation. Kill your burn if the apoapsis gets much above 100k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) If done properly, your apoapsis will stay above the atmosphere as you coast up. You may even have a periapsis above Kerbin\u0027s surface; if so, great. Wait to apoapsis and burn to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy doing the ascent this way, you shouldn\u0027t have to spend much delta-V or time to circularize. I think the shortest burn I\u0027ve had so far was four seconds or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard folks say that you should watch Mechjeb handle an ascent and try to emulate it when you\u0027re flying manually. I\u0027ve seen folks launch with Mechjeb on YouTube and I\u0027ll even recommend you watch how it does it a time or two; you can learn a lot from it (for the record, I fly manually).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curiosity7907","CreatedById":154220,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T09:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk so what you call 45 degrees at 10km I call 50 degrees at 10km and 40 degrees at 20km 30 degrees at 30km and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t like directly tipping over to 45 degrees at 10km a like to slowly turn to 45\u00A0degrees because I don\u0027t do complete kerbal gravity turn I also try to do realistic gravity turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI try doing realistic things like I make my first stage long and powerful like\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003ENasa\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eand second stage short low thrust but high specific impulse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T10:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222317761\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002243710\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449824684\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154220\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Curiosity7907\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Curiosity7907 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk so what you call 45 degrees at 10km I call 50 degrees at 10km and 40 degrees at 20km 30 degrees at 30km and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you please stop necroing old threads on a daily basis?
