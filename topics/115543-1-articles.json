For example, if you have a fuel tank, and then put it on top of another fuel tank, and then an engine: when you fly, the engine will pull fuel from the top (i.e. farthest-from-the-engine) tank until it\u0027s empty, then the tank that\u0027s right above the engine. This will work even if you have other pieces between the two tanks (e.g. \u00221.25m tank on top of conical structural adapter on top of 2.5m tank\u0022 or whatever), as long as all the parts in between are \u0022fuel crossfeed capable\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, flow will \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E flow between two tanks if one of two conditions applies:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Most KSP parts are, but some aren\u0027t. Notably, decouplers are not. If you put a tank on top of a decoupler on top of another tank on top of an engine, then the engine won\u0027t draw fuel from the top tank because there\u0027s a decoupler in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The tanks are attached in a way that doesn\u0027t establish a connection. For example, let\u0027s say you start with a cylindrical fuel tank. If you attach another tank on top or below (i.e. using the attachment nodes in the vehicle editor), then the two tanks can flow fuel to each other. However, if you attach the second tank radially, then it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ephysically\u003C/em\u003E attached, but fuel won\u0027t flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe yellow fuel ducts give you a way to add fuel flow between tanks that otherwise couldn\u0027t. The duct is directional (only flows fuel in one direction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is useful for setting things up so that, for example, engines in an upper stage can draw fuel from engines in a lower stage (which they otherwise couldn\u0027t, since decouplers prevent crossfeed), and also for asparagus setups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can also be handy in giving you some additional options for arranging the parts on your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample 1: Feed fuel from radial tanks to the center. Suppose your ship design is too tall/skinny, once you\u0027ve stacked all the tanks and engines from the various stages on top of each other, so that the ship is hard to control, or flexes too much, or whatever. You can make the ship shorter like this: if you have part X, sitting on top of a tank, sitting on top of an engine, you can take out the tank and attach the engine directly to X, then replace the tank with a couple of smaller tanks that are attached radially to the sides of X. However, if you do that, then the tanks won\u0027t flow fuel to the engine (since radial attachment doesn\u0027t establish fuel crossfeed). So you can add fuel ducts that connect the tanks to X (if it\u0027s cross-feed capable), or directly to the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample 2: The opposite: feed fuel from a central tank to radial ones. Suppose that you\u0027re making a 2.5m ship that needs 16 tons of fuel, so you\u0027re using the Rockomax tank of that size. You\u0027re considering putting a Poodle under that, but you decide that\u0027s too much engine for your purposes, and a pair of Terriers would do the trick. So you attach a couple of little fuel tanks to the sides of your big 16-ton one, and put the Terriers under those. You want them to draw fuel from the big central tank, so you attach fuel ducts from the central tank to the radial ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne really handy use for fuel ducts is lander design (e.g. for landing on the Mun). You want landers to be really low and squat, so that they don\u0027t tip over. Putting your command pod on top of a fuel tank on top of an engine tends to make for a tall, skinny ship. So what I like to do is to set the command pod directly on top of the engine (e.g. attach a Terrier directly underneath a lander can), then mount a pair of fuel tanks to the \u003Cem\u003Esides\u003C/em\u003E of the command pod. Not only does that make the lander a lot shorter, it also makes it \u003Cem\u003Ewider\u003C/em\u003E, so that I can attach my landing legs to the radial tanks to give the lander a wide stance. However, that design needs fuel ducts to work, because otherwise fuel couldn\u0027t get from the tanks to the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T00:52:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022primal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022primal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGood tip, thanks!\u003Cp\u003ESome missions ago I tried putting some batteries inside of the service bay, but when I opened it when in orbit, it wasn\u0027t there.
