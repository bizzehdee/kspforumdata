All the care about interviewing him on is walking on the moon. Neil Armstrong has a quote about the EVA, actually.\n\n\u0027Pilots have no special interest in walking. Pilots like to fly.\u0027 -Neil Armstrong.\n\nI bet if someone asked for an interview about his X-15 days or Gemini 8, he might be more willing. Being asked the same questions about walking on the moon over and over again must annoy him a lot."},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T04:27:25Z","Content":"You can see how much he likes talking about his test pilot experiences and all the problem solving he did.\n\nCompare with when he talks about Apollo 11. \n\nI can tell that Neil Armstrong (not just by his quote) prefers flying to walking."}]}
