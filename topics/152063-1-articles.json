Some time ago I tested whether it would be beneficial performance wise to replace tanks mesh colliders with i.e. a box\u002Bcapsule and it wasn\u0027t (not to mention mesh - collider inaccuracies).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"liquidhype","CreatedById":112415,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-15T10:08:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are basically reducing the complexity of the colliders and in some cases reducing the amount of colliders per part. Believe it or not, the collider polycount and the amount of colliders per part has more impact on performance than the complexity/polycount of the actual model itself, as it requires more draw-calls. People have tested this in the past by making 500k-1mill polycount parts and comparing their\u00A0performance against a part which consists of multiple high-poly colliders and\u00A0multiple parented meshes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat Squad is doing will not boost the performance significantly, but it will certainly help those with less capable computers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-16T13:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112415-liquidhype/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022112415\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112415-liquidhype/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@liquidhype\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Hmm, I have a model with 9 colliders \u0026gt;_\u0026lt;, 2 mesh colliders and 7 Unity primitives, is that bad?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that colliders are heavy on the CPU while model complexity is heavy on GPU.\u00A0I tend to join objects with the same material where I can to reduce to amount of draw-calls of my models.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"liquidhype","CreatedById":112415,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-16T13:47:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222852787\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152063\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479303398\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Enceos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, Enceos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112415-liquidhype/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022112415\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112415-liquidhype/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@liquidhype\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Hmm, I have a model with 9 colliders \u0026gt;_\u0026lt;, 2 mesh colliders and 7 Unity primitives, is that bad?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that colliders are heavy on the CPU while model complexity is heavy on GPU.\u00A0I tend to join objects with the same material where I can to reduce to amount of draw-calls of my models.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes the wise thing to do is always to join as many meshes together as possible. The only time you should ever have multiple meshes in one part is when you are making an engine, solar array\u00A0or parts which needs to move independent of each other.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never, ever use the part itself as a mesh collider. I always use the most simple low-poly shapes\u00A0possble if a part\u00A0needs more than 1 collider. Even if you are making a high-fidelity engine, you can still stick with a simple 12-sided cylinder as your collider. There is no need for separate colliders for each engine nozzle (assuming it has more than one nozzle), and a collider for the engine base, turbo-pump, etc. Keep the colliders as simple and as few as possible. And try to have your parts consists of as few independent meshes as possible. Doing that for all parts will help boost performance, especially if you have a lower-end PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
