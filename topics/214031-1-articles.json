The couplings work in the sense that they decouple from the next stage, but then the vehicle is still connected. I did it with my own construct where three siderockets (first stage) continued to be coupled to main rocket after decoupling and the couplings had flewn away.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut i got the same with the stock Kerbal-K2.
