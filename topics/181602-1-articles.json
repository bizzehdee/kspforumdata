For example: I may use two sparks instead of one terrier as it\u0027s 0.2t instead of 0.5t, but one spark doesn\u0027t have enough thrust to get me going. Or maybe I\u0027ll use a ring of 8 ants to top up my terrier thrust. That sort of thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy issue is that the game seems to use additive volume for these engines, with a single engine being roughly the same volume no matter the size. This means that when you have many engines firing the game gets disproportionatly loud. 8 ants should not make nearly as much noise as they do compared to something with over 10x the thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way to tweak this in a configuration file or the audio settings? It\u0027s really rather annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-23T00:25:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has been raised a few times over the years.\u00A0\u00A0 I believe there is a bug tracker for it too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple answer is turn down the volume on your speakers.\u00A0\u00A0 I know that sounds contrite, but that\u0027s the simple answer.\u00A0 I do not know of any patch that can fix this, but some of the modders out there may know.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
