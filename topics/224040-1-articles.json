I\u0027m having the same fatal error \u0022no tank type named supplies exist\u0022, after some research and test, I can assure (in my case) that this error is caused by Bluedog design bureau because when I remove from my game the error no longer happen. Maybe you can try to remove BDB from you game, and if you don\u0027t have BDB installed, I had no idea of what caused your Problem. I hope someone know how to solve this issue. (I think that is recent because a time ago i had no problem with BDB)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Edit : I was actually right (in my case), the problem came from the new versin of BDB, I re-installed an older version of BDB and it finally worked. Maybe you can try that.
