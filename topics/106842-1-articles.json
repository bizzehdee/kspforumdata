Some things Squad can\u0027t share, but at the moment, updating to Unity 5, x64 support, more info next week. Has U5 been tried? Yes, it shows cool stuff, but more deeperness is needed to show the KSP community what they deserve. Preliminary testing shows promise though. \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV display that was promised will probably be available in 1.1.
