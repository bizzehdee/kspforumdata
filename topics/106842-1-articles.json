Sorry if this has already been answered."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:43:04Z","Content":"I thought so, word was it\u0027s in the debug menu (like the overlays you can toggle with F10 to F12). Nothing there, though, also not mentined in patch logs."},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:57:23Z","Content":"No, those tools are not with stock KSP, not even in 1.02. \n\nFor what I got, not giving a DV indicator is a choice about how the game should work, as KSP is not a simulator and is intended to have players try different ways to build their craft towards something successful (so, giving help to build them properly since the start would go contrary to this idea).\n\nAbout tools to help building aircrafts... I\u0027m confident something may come in future."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:03:37Z","Content":"Max Maps commented on it, here from the squadcast summary:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E KSP 1.1 news! Some things Squad can\u0027t share, but at the moment, updating to Unity 5, x64 support, more info next week. Has U5 been tried? Yes, it shows cool stuff, but more deeperness is needed to show the KSP community what they deserve. Preliminary testing shows promise though. \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV display that was promised will probably be available in 1.1. Aerodynamic overlay too- it turned out be very easy to add on to and ended up eating a lot more of Squads time than desired."},{"CreatedByName":"mrmcp1","CreatedById":79657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:13:53Z","Content":"Thanks for the quote (good to know I hadn\u0027t imagined it)"},{"CreatedByName":"ManuxKerb","CreatedById":139441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:01:07Z","Content":"There is Kerbal Engeneer but it is somewhat broken at the moment.
