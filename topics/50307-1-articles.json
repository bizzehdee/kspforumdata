Maybe some seasoned math major can give me a hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m colonizing a moon of some planet \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s say, oh, Europa. Europa orbits once every 3.5 days and is tidally locked to Jupiter, which means a day on Europa is 3.5 days long from dawn to dawn, with the odd Jovian eclipse. Jupiter won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t move in the sky because Europa is tidally locked to it, so a Jovian eclipse would only happen once a Europan day. Jupiter takes up 1/15th of the Europan sky (just assume the surface is flat, not too far-fetched on Europa), and so Jovian eclipses would last about 2.8 hours ((3.5*12)/15=2.8).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s suppose, by some sort of magic, I managed to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ctidally unlock\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Europa and speed its day up to the same approximate speed of an earth day \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 this would mean making it turn 3.5 times per orbit. The sun would move across the sky once every 24 earth hours, but how fast would Jupiter move? How often would Jovian eclipses be then? How long would they be? That is my question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo help you answer it, I have made this table which better states the above data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/a2hSgkk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022a2hSgkk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive it your best shot!
