It really has helped me create a structure to my space program, since the pure sandbox environment of vanilla KSP hadn\u0027t been driving me to anything specific lately. So to you and the original mod maker: Thanks for making such an awesome mod.\u003Cp\u003EI do have another question though, which I wasn\u0027t able to find. How does the clientControlled parameter work when defined in a mission. Does it take away your ability to control the vessel when you finish the mission? I don\u0027t particularly understand what the documentation means when it states the client will take over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have in mind for a mission is one that when you complete, you will be prevented from completing any other missions in the future.

Curiously it\u0027s saying on the mission pop up during the mission that the maids in space is repeatable, but in the mission select window it says it isn\u0027t. Odd. I tried to undock and redock with a ship I had up there already. Would it be something to do with trying this with a ship I used before editing the cfg? Here\u0027s the cfg file if that helps: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Laythe%20Colony%20(Sandbox).sp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMission CFG\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-15T16:57:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2013 04:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Patupi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedievalNerd","CreatedById":84735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T19:15:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it currently possible for having mission conditions that verify if components are active? For example, to see if the scientific tools are on or off? I noticed the game checks if throttle is active in some goals, wondering if that can be applied to other components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I just thought about something. I could just edit the Flight Engineer module to store a new resource called Data. and have each scientific part generate Data. Pretty sure I can use the Kethane module to make it work. Then have a mission goal that you have to get in orbit without any Data. And only complete the orbit goal once you have X amount. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Might just work!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-15T19:32:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2013 07:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MedievalNerd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T19:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, that\u0027s clever!
