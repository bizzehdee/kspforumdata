I was about 50m/s of DeltaV from making a regular return to Kerbin (get encounter, get into orbit, land), so I just made a collision course with Kerbin, knowing that my 8 parachutes would be able to slow me down. I touched down on water at 7.4m/s when my science lab exploded, and my mysterious goos with it. So I figured I would quickload to when I was about 400m off the ground and slow myself down with my remaining fuel. But after I quickloaded, my parachutes weren\u0027t there. It said that they were there, because it gave me the option to cut them, but I couldn\u0027t see them or feel any of their effects. So I found myself 400m of Kerbin with an LV-909 engine and a little fuel. Not good. I was able to get down safely (Hyperedit\u0027s cheaty Land/drop), but does anyone know why this happens?

Quicksaved while falling on Laythe with parachutes deployed. After unsuccessful landing I decided to quickload and use some fuel to slow down and not to crash. I ended up using much more fuel to land without the parachutes that disappeared. Conclusion: quicksave before deploying parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T12:57:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a known thing.
