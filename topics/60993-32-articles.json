I could switch back to cockpit view but had no control over the ship. Also when I put the decoupler/parachute on the ship there is no stage for it. Even when I loaded up the craft file there is no parachute stage. Also my log got spammed with null exceptions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3zrzBlm.png\u0022 alt=\u00223zrzBlm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
