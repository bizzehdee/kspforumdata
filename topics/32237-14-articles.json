I haven\u0027t loaded any previous saves to 0.22 yet, so I can\u0027t say if it\u0027s repeatable...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a tip that can help when working with large, complex stations- ALWAYS make sure you have SAS off on the station when you\u0027re not flying it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, were you warping until you got close for physics to load, or just approaching it in real-time? Cause physics doesn\u0027t really agree with warp-time...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T11:09:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Montieth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Montieth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnyone having problems with FusTek based stations in .22? \u003Cp\u003EI was sending a new module to my KSS in .22 and as soon as I got near the station and physics started the thing started jiggling all over the place and came apart.

When the tanks were mostly filled they just started shaking themselves so violently that the entire station pretty much exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I have had issues where IonCross (life support) enabled vehicles suffer issues (when trying to update the mod) where the camera would no longer lock on them and/or parts of them would seem to fly off even though they were still attached. Not really the same, but in both cases they were resource enabled vehicles that had problems when something caused their mass to change suddenly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I had two stations suffer much the same as that last example after I made changes to my installed mods, did not test those changes and did not play that installation of KSP for a few weeks then came back to it and discovered that every backed up save had unusable stations. (it was actually much worse because time did note even advance. The world itself was frozen beneath the station)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, those last two examples aren\u0027t really what you\u0027re describing but the point I\u0027m making is that I\u0027ve been experiencing situations where physics goes haywire for existing craft when changes are made either to installed mods the craft depend on or changes to the installation itself. In my case, freshly launched vehicles did not suffer those problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sharpspoonful","CreatedById":83734,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T13:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a feeling (mind you, this is from someone with very minimal C# fluency) that there may be an issue in the persistence file with mods, especially ones with resources.
