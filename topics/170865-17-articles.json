mod hosting and listing and indexing is not free; and bandwidth for mod downloading is not free.\u00A0 Indeed, anyone who knows or prefers CKAN understands that Curse is\u00A0VERY CKAN-unfriendly, as CKAN is based on metadata files that presume the ability to remote-call and remote-download hosted mods -- Curse actually updated their software to affirmatively \u003Cem\u003Eprevent\u003C/em\u003E CKAN from doing it\u0027s thing, specifically to ensure that mod downloaders were forcibly exposed to Curse\u0027s banner ads.\u00A0 This is why CKAN management favored a mod that was hosted on KerbalStuff, Github, or some other miscellaneous hosting (such as Dropbox / OneDrive / GDrive / etc.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am unfamiliar as to the exact particulars of Squad\u0027s licensing, but I\u0027m fairly certain that Curse\u0027s deal is one of exclusivity -- that any other mod-hosting site is prevented by licensing restrictions from adopting any for-profit model that would compete with Curse.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EMy Proposal\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E: With someone else\u0027s help, I can act as point man in forming a non-profit corporation of some kind (my own jurisdiction of New York would offer several filing options for this, and other jurisdictions may offer different options, each with advantages and disadvantages.)\u00A0 I can even serve as a member of a corporation\u0027s managing board.\u00A0 I suggest we find a way to manage and navigate the existing licensing restrictions, or possibly even negotiate with Squad in good faith to allow some form of compromise solution, that would allow SpaceDock or some KerbalStuff-successor to operate and generate modest revenue from hosting and CKAN integration, not for the purpose of generating lasting profits, but for the exclusive purpose of strengthening the non-profit product so that it remains as available and robust as the technology could allow.\u00A0 From actually offsetting the digital costs of webhosting and bandwidth, I foresee the possibility to manage a small cohort of otherwise-volunteer programmers and other mod hobbyists by actually offering them some sort of financial incentive to donate their time.\u00A0 I\u0027m not suggesting we hire someone full time with salary and benefits, but something that would make their late nights of sacrificed personal time worthwhile.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can be reached by PM here, or by email directly at \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d591b4a3bcb1fb9fb4b6bab7a6babb95b7a7bababeb9b4a2fbb0b1a0\u0022 rel=\u0022external\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u002291d5f0e7f8f5bfdbf0f2fef3e2feffd1f3e3fefefafdf0e6bff4f5e4\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 I get a lot of emails from other sources, so to make yours stand out, please indicate \u0022KerbalStuff Successor\u0022 in the subject line.\u00A0 I am convinced that there can exist a fully-legal, fully-compliant, self-sustaining solution to this issue, and I\u0027d care to be a significant contributor to that effort.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBest,\u003Cbr\u003E\nDavid\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the offer.

I am only aware of one of the scenarios you mention actually happening (packaging errors), and it is something that CKAN makes every attempt to fix as soon as we are made aware of it (because CKAN contributors care about CKAN users).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think he want to add a policy like \u0022don\u0027t upload mod not made by you.\u0022 into spacedock\u0027s. it won\u0027t stop posting it somewhere else, but it won\u0027t\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Eviolate\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E any licence by itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"birdog357","CreatedById":150790,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T13:04:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222423863\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132186\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456132014\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002221328\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, ferram4 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am fully aware of the consequences in terms of following the license precisely and the negative consequences of it.\u00A0 However, not all the negative consequences have to be tolerated, because the terms of use for a site can forbid those.\u00A0 At this moment, there are no policies to handle behaviors that follow the license exactly but provide no actual benefit (and in some cases, harm) to users or modders, which is what I\u0027m getting at, and based on the current discussion in here, it seems a lot like there won\u0027t be any at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a simple fix to your problem. Embrace CKAN, then you have control over the package that is referenced. I have something like 40 different mods installed and I do not want to spend all the time required to manually keep them upto date. CKAN is awesome in that respect.
