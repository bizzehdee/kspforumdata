This type of game is the kind of game that rarely do good on consoles and the controls and lack of mods will also make this game very limited compared to the pc version and that is if they somehow make it even run properly on such low end hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are also skeptical because the company behind the port has absolutely no trackrecord except for very simple and shady looking mobile games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the games shown on the website even looks like they have been just reskinned and sold as a different game even though the gameplay looks the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe type of games they make is something you could easily make in gamemaker with no coding skills at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I am not saying this is proof or anything that they are not capable of porting the game, but I think it is perfectly ok to be skeptical and critical when they have no track record with advanced games like this. I think the only thing that will help us relax a bit is them showing us that the game runs and that the controller actually works with editor, UI and things like action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NoMrBond\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NoMrBond\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESony have also said that mod support is coming for FFXIV:H (shortly after launch was the timeframe), so it sounds like some kind of mod framework is coming for PS4 (I doubt it would be exclusive to FFXIV)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way it will be limited to mods that does not need any extra code/dlls to function.
