Place fins at the tail so the Center Of Lift is visibly lower then the Center of Mass at all times. With a CoL much lower then the CoM, the rocket will be very hard to steer, but that is not so bad during the ascent, because ...\n\n2) during ascent, always keep the nose of the rocket very close to the prograde direction. Sure, you want to pitch down during the ascent, but pitching too fast will make the rocket travel within the lower and denser atmosphere for longer, and drag will waste much of your DV. Not pitching enough will not provide the horizontal speed required, in the end you need a horizontal speed of about 2200 m/s for a LKO. So, you need to angle the nose of your rocket just a little at a time in the correct direction (generally, pitch down towards heading 090\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0), the smaller the angle, the more similar the ascent profile is to a true gravity turn (the most efficient profile).\n\n3) After the separation of the second stage, rocket will be much more maneuverable (due to less moment of inertia, but also due to lower aerodynamic effects on the fins). Apply some angle (never more than 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, the size of the prograde marker of the navball) if needed to start gaining horizontal speed. Start looking at the apoapsis altitude in the map view, you need to achieve 70-75 Km: so, throttle down if you are already at that value. If the profile was correct, you would have gained considerable horizontal speed already, and with a final burn when aoutside the atmosphere you\u0027ll get to the orbital speed. It always requires a bit of experience to judge the correct profile."},{"CreatedByName":"nikolay-spb","CreatedById":135182,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T15:29:00Z","Content":"give screenshot of the rocket.\n\nWhat is your second stage engine?"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T15:54:52Z","Content":"There\u0027s a lot of factors that may be at work here. The most common cause I\u0027ve seen of folks flipping out so far, however, has been CoM too far aft (i.e. the dart problem). To better diagnose problems and give you advice as to what you should do, we really do need to see a screenie. \n\nHere\u0027s another question: about what altitude are you at when you begin your turn, when do you cross 45 degrees, and what\u0027s your rough altitude when the first stage is done burning?"},{"CreatedByName":"Juicy","CreatedById":142505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T16:06:53Z","Content":"For testing (also works as a simple fix) whether it\u0027s the Center of Mass of your upper stage being too low, add another fuel to the upper stage, and disable the top fuel tank manually before take-off, wait for re-enabling it untill the bottom fuel tank of the stage is (nearly) empty.\n\nCanards also don\u0027t go well on rockets. If you add fins, always keep them below the center of mass, or they may generate enough drag to flip you as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T16:49:37Z","Content":"There\u0027s a [post here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119185-A-Simple-Guide-to-Rocket-Aerodynamics%21) that goes into the forces that cause rocket flipping.\n\nStaging can be a particularly vulnerable moment in an ascent because you\u0027re dropping a mostly-empty stage. This means that it doesn\u0027t have a lot of mass, so your center of mass isn\u0027t going to change much, but it\u0027s got all of its surface area still, which means your center of pressure is going to move more significantly."}]}
