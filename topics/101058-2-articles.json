When taking the difference in density between Kerbal and Earth into account as well as the fact that Kerbals are about half the height of humans (and presumably length and width as well) one would expect a weight of around 125 kilos per Kerbal.\n\nBut the size of the Kerbal head is very large in comparison to the height of a Kerbal. So 180 kilos could well be an accurate weight for a Kerbal."},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T17:43:11Z","Content":"Kerbals are actually present as a part.

I guess extra 20 or so kilos for personal stuff would be enough. You can round up that to 120kg I guess.

If they do have a life expectancy, are they recycled back into the resource system? I can\u0027t imagine jettisoning them makes sense if a space colony is trying to conserve their resources.
