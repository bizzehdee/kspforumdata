Looks like one can get pretty high on \u0027conventional\u0027 jets after all, though not nearly as fast as we did in 0.90. I got this very simple plane up to 24km by throttling way down to about 1/3 until I passed into the upper atmosphere, around 20km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UVeQzTO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UVeQzTO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found I can do 800m/s at 24k safely, and start to get heating effects at 1000 m/s and 24km. Seems like this would be a decent place to start rockets, just like in the old days except 1 km/s slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow is everyone else doing with this? Similar experiences?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
