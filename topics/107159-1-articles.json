Looks like one can get pretty high on \u0027conventional\u0027 jets after all, though not nearly as fast as we did in 0.90. I got this very simple plane up to 24km by throttling way down to about 1/3 until I passed into the upper atmosphere, around 20km. \n\n![UVeQzTO.png](http://i.imgur.com/UVeQzTO.png)\n\nI found I can do 800m/s at 24k safely, and start to get heating effects at 1000 m/s and 24km. Seems like this would be a decent place to start rockets, just like in the old days except 1 km/s slower.\n\nHow is everyone else doing with this? Similar experiences?"}]}
