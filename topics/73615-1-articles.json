Not one of these crazy challenges you see, I\u0027m no expert. Heck, before this all began I was little more a beginner. I\u0027m still a beginner, except that I feel like getting to EVE and back with a ship I built myself is kind of a badge of honour...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut ultimately I\u0027m here to share an experience not pretend I know what I\u0027m talking about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo. First things first, I might not have gone nuts, but I made life hard for myself. I decided right from the off that I wasn\u0027t going to build a lander that was basically a chair with 10k delta V stuck on the back of it, like this guy did:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.brentroad.com/photos/00530615.JPG\u0022 alt=\u002200530615.JPG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was going to: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Send down a Kerbal in an enclosed command module and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E get him home in a single launch - no rescue missions and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) conduct every science experiment on the surface of EVE and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) fly the whole mission in stock 0.23.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut I did allow myself some compromises:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei) I didn\u0027t feel the need to build the craft in stock.

Building a lander with a science module and a goo chamber didn\u0027t seem to figure highly on other people\u0027s priorities, so I had to go my own way to some degree, but in the end, I borrowed ideas pretty heavily from the EVE Comet mission: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78852-Want-to-go-to-Eve-and-back-Try-this\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78852-Want-to-go-to-Eve-and-back-Try-this\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas I particularly took away with me from the EVE comet:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) using aircraft wheels as landing gear, because of higher impact tolerance/better stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) using parachute stacks, to make ditching them easier\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) using 48-7S to increase efficiency on the final tank of the lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(By the way, if you\u0027re just looking for a craft to use, the EVE Comet is a better craft than mine.

A science mission. What I discovered, of course, is that by the time most people can get to EVE and back science isn\u0027t that much of a problem for them. But I devised this challenge off the back of my first successful return (with a rescue!) fom Duna, so I was still thinking the science would be nice... I was wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, I had to run a few caravan missions to different biomes on the Mun and farm science just to earn the parts I\u0027d need to pull this mission off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/klW7G\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, once the gauntlet had been thrown down, I wanted to stick to my original goals, so it was a science mission regardless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went through *so* many iterations of different crafts. I think this is the learning curve everyone goes through - the landers just got too big. And then they got rickety. And then you needed more parts to hold them together, and more parts to add delta V, and the returns just start \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edropping off really fast. And all that bloat has a significant and increasing knock-on effect on the next stage, and the next stage, so so on. And even when you think you might finally have got a solid lander, you realise that you just can\u0027t build something that will put the bugger into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so sooner or later, you go back to the drawing board and try to do it better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI toyed with doing multiple launches and docking landers to transfer stages in LKO, but that is a whole new kettle of fish. I learned a lot about what\u0027s involved with that, but the main thing I learned was that I didn\u0027t want to do it. Docking 2000 tonnes of bloated ship is a lot less satisfying than designing a better ship, and the damn thing\u0027s going to fall apart in transit if you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I redesigned again and again, and in the end I got my lander down to around 220 tonnes. And this was a decentish lander, and I flew the mission. And this is where I learned about the importance of sensible \u0027Thrust to Weight\u0027 ratios. So that was another Kerbal who was not going to see the rec rooms at the KSC again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went back and I started again on the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne time I thought I had it, but I was scuppered by a fuel lines bug that distributed the fuel unevenly and led to a lean (and eventually a crash). If it had worked, it would have been even better than my final design. But it didn\u0027t, so I needed to go back to the old drawing board. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Tip: don\u0027t go from multiple tanks, to one tank, back out to multiple tanks again. Things can get confused). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway, eventually I had something at 234 tonnes, with 10.4K delta V (9.8K Eve Atmospheric), and TWR of between 1.5 and 2\u002B at all the lower stages and I just *knew* that I had something that would work, although the altitudes were going to need to be a ways above sea level. But that was good enough for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the stats on the lander: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mmu20iV.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/mmu20iV.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mmu20iVh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mmu20iVh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the top part of the lander: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MRNvZTA.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/MRNvZTA.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MRNvZTAh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MRNvZTAh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that all of the science modules will be detached after their data has been gathered, leaving an intact docking port beneath. Note also the inverted ladder, which allows our brave pilot to climb up to the level of the science modules and gather their data, before ejecting the modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the composition of the ship: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iMjbWwv.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/iMjbWwv.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iMjbWwvh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iMjbWwvh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it\u0027s not a perfect ship. An earlier version launched more easily. I needed to make some tweaks, to correct for a poorly placed decoupler, and now it\u0027s a bit more lairy. You\u0027ll fight it a bit in the first stage, and you\u0027ll use a tiny bit of dV from the transfer stage to complete the orbit if you waste too much dV on the way up. But there\u0027s a decent-ish margin in the transfer stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how did it work? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it went pretty OK on my MechJeb dry run. Running the mission without MechJeb, the hardest thing was ensuring a landing at a decent altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out my lander is good from about 4000m. If I were going in for this again, and didn\u0027t want to challenge myself to build a sea-level lander, I\u0027d defintely try to go for something more in the region of 1.5k to 2k capable, because although there are places on EVE right up to 7000m, spots above 3K are relatively rare. And the problem with landing on peaks is that, being what they are, they\u0027re rarely flat, and don\u0027t even get me started on the trouble of landing 234 tonnes on a hill. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you want to do to land high on EVE is find a nicely dark bit of the planet, and arrange your orbital inclination so that you\u0027re travelling over it for the longest time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at this shot: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SD9MJ4G.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/SD9MJ4G.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SD9MJ4Gh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SD9MJ4Gh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee how the orbital path follows the longest line through a darker coloured mountain range. That\u0027s where I think the skill in landing on higher ground. (The luck part is finding somewhere that\u0027s flat, because there\u0027s little or no chance to correct once you\u0027re inside the atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it all came together, and I brought it home in the end, so now I can honestly say that I\u0027ve joined the ranks of the EVE returners.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an album of shots from the mission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/aeIjd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
