I\u0027ve just dumped something into the sea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve launched two probe landers, named Lem 1 and Lem 2 (named after Stanis\u00C3\u2026\u00E2\u20AC\u0161aw Lem). The first one had a purpose to reach any land, and the second one was going for any pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELem 1 landed close to one island bay near the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/r0pffwfx3/lem1_1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lem1_1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/4yz55uvfb/lem1_2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lem1_2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELem 2 was built in a more professional fashion, but lacked the Goo and science bay. It had a heat shield and fairing, drogue parachute which was jetissoned right before three main parachutes were deployed. All stock, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/6fannzyc7/lem2_1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lem2_1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was quite fun to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/84f5ibonr/lem2_2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lem2_2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe is really beautiful with Jool in its sky, especially while you\u0027re falling in the polar region.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, Laythe\u0027s north pole doesn\u0027t seem to have large anomalies. Something is visible in the texture, but no hills or cliffs or holes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELem 1 still has fuel onboard and could move around, but not far away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELem 2 is dead, its solar panels broke, probably because I\u0027ve put a drogue parachute decoupler on top of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
