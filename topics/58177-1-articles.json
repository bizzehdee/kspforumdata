Once orbit had been achieved, the booster stage was separated and after a quick EVA by Jeb to attach the winch to the spent stage. When Jeb was back on board, special laterally mounted engines were fired to spin up this un-godly contraption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings were going... okay, apart from it being an uncontrollable mess and I\u0027m sure making the crew very dizzy. The accelerometer said we were getting about 0.1G with the engines off and the spin had got a little bit less violent. But then the winch snapped off and send the boost stage off into the abyss. The maneuver had also degraded the periapsis by from 130km to 60km, so I sent the boys home for some well deserved cake and pie \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a little gif of Project Dizzy in action:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://cdn.makeagif.com/media/12-29-2013/7049fs.gif\u0022 alt=\u00227049fs.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ramnrmeul","CreatedById":48560,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T01:04:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice...

I just don\u0027t see how they can keep everything from twisting and jerking as astronauts move around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to tossing stuff around, there was actually a concept to throw things back and forth between Earth and the Moon. The system consisted of 2 long, rod-like stations rotating end-over-end, 1 each orbiting Earth and the Moon. The really bizarre part of this idea was that 1 flinger would throw a ship directly into docking with the other as it was spinning. Furthermore, the 1 at the Moon would be low enough that it could carefully set caught payloads onto the ground as it rotated around, and also pick stuff up off the ground to throw to the flinger in Earth orbit. The one at Earth was in some sort of eccentric orbit so it could get powered by crossing and rotating through different electrical potentials. I don\u0027t remember how the one at the Moon maintained its energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, back when I played Orbiter, a friend of mine actually made a mod for this whole system. IIRC he called it Ananki or some such, and even wrote several short stories set in a Cyberpunk world that used the thing. I did a lot of the testing and even with the high and realistic degree of automation and instrumentation in Orbiter, I have to say this was absolutely the most difficult thing I ever did in a space game. Timing your orbit to dock straight onto the end of a boom several kilometers long that\u0027s spinning fast enough to throw you to the Moon, then releasing at just the right point to go into the catcher\u0027s mitt at the Moon at even higher speed, and then get swung around and set on the ground before you could catch your breath, was quite a trip. It was absolutely impractical and certainly unworkable in the real world, but it was a cool mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T11:31:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, that\u0027s a crazy concept... I did some rough calculations for a catcher at the Mun, for a comfortable deceleration of ~3g you\u0027d need a 10km station rotating at a little more than 1 rpm.
