MK2 cargo bay - some structural parts, probe, science instruments, some ox-stat panels inside. The idea was to open the cargo bay to expose the panels when in space. Blows up from heating with 2x physics warp. \n\nReducing the number of panels helped a bit, but still heats up quite a lot. Makes no matter if bay is open or closed. \n\nAt normal speed heat won\u0027t build up, but the parts inside retain heat for much longer than the rest of the craft (after burning in the atmosphere for example)."},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T13:24:18Z","Content":"Check to see if any parts are clipping with any others, that might be the cause"}]}
