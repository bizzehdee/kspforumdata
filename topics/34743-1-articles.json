Kirk and Dilbert. Decided to make Kirk second in command, You\u0027d expect Kirk to be brave, but he was a screamer. And then, I kid you not, Kirk had something happen to him that I will never forget. During the mothership\u0027s shakedown cruise, it went out to orbit Minmus. By the time I had burned off enough fuel to depart Minmus (but still in it\u0027s SoI), I had used up the fuel in the HOME habitat modules, so Jeb was transfering the worst of the screamers to plant duty. Anyone remember the bug with the DSM spherical pod that when you\u0027d EVA a kerbal from that pod, they\u0027d wind up getting shot away from the ship at high speed? This is when I became aware of it. Managed to bring Kirk to a stop then bring him back into the ship, but the whole time I\u0027m already thinking of how this was going to read in the captain\u0027s log. \u0022A side note, if Kirk alleges that I tried to strand him on an ice moon, I\u0027d just like to clarify two things. First, it was an equipment malfunction. Second, we had already burned to escape Minmus, so at least initially it would have been a highly elliptical Kerbin orbit rather than a Minmus impact.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDilbert was very calm about things, and wound up becoming second in command in the wake of Kirk\u0027s demotion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"way2smrt","CreatedById":62502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T00:13:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TYRT\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TYRT\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJebediah Kerman.
