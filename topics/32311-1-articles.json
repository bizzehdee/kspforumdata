Up until now I haven\u0027t had problems with solar panels - I\u0027ve mounted them to the sides of my ships, and I mounted 3 in a row on a strut as part of a space station, and they survived launch and orbital maneuvering with no difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m building a new, bigger space station, and last night I tried to launch a component - 5 of the long trusses connected together, with a row of 9 solar panels mounted on the truss. About two seconds after liftoff, I saw a shower of black solar-panel material raining down. All the panels broke on lift-off. They\u0027re still stuck on the trusses, but now they\u0027re listed as \u0022broken\u0022. I\u0027ve never seen that before, and it\u0027s the same rocket I used to launch previous missions with the same panels mounted on the side. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas or advice?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T15:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome more info and screen shots could be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich panels are you using?
