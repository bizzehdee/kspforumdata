Time to release my Type-10 MBT.\n\nIt has a nice bearing mechanism, made specially to resist battle damage. The armor is a hybrid Chobham armor with a skirt to catch missile warheads, it has two concealed and armored crew seats to carry tank repairmen and an unmanned turret with its own light source for target acquisition and confirmation.\n\nThe tracks are durable, as long as you drive and turn at reasonable (16 m/s) speeds, and I have a BD armory version of this tank for myself (I need to use it for a RP, so no release here.).\n\nThe Type-10 will see another release in the form of a Type-10 PIP. I\u0027ll release it soon with better aesthetics for the turret, an upgraded armor module, and more general maneuverability.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/xuo1wz15k5bkluq/A%20JGSDF%20Type-10_3.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xuo1wz15k5bkluq/A%20JGSDF%20Type-10_3.craft?dl=0)\n\n![V6DLCdn.png](http://i.imgur.com/V6DLCdn.png)\n\n![ON7uyFA.png](http://i.imgur.com/ON7uyFA.png)\n\n![4r5gzXb.png](http://i.imgur.com/4r5gzXb.png)\n\n![9G7mLMO.png](http://i.imgur.com/9G7mLMO.png)\n\n![qyoWeX8.png](http://i.imgur.com/qyoWeX8.png)\n\n![9dmMMgX.png](http://i.imgur.com/9dmMMgX.png)\n\nOn a related note.\n\n![pvPU3dY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pvPU3dY.jpg)\n\n![R7BAQU9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/R7BAQU9.jpg)\n\nThe Musashi is looking like a World of Warships vessel in KSP, which I like. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) :D\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T08:30:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 08:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by andrew123**"}]}
