Once you latch on with one of them, undock the others one by one and hope they attach to the asteroid just the right way, and hope you can redock properly to the newly attached Klaws. Or the other way around, grab to asteroid with one of them and then undock that one, trying to grab asteroid again with others in a way that keeps you still aligned with the first one for redocking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, it is going to be a pain.

Once your first claw has made contact in a good spot, decouple one of the other\u0027s ports; with any luck, it\u0027s claw will immediately attach to the asteroid. Use the claw\u0027s pivot to bring it around so the docking port is facing your ship again. Then saveload; the docking port should re-attach without you having to back off first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo should be easy, but it will take a very flat surface to make it work with three or more; and that spot still has to be in the right place so it will line up with your eventual center of thrust / center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking port magnetism is strong, and claws can be quite flexible; I can imagine that things will be pulled together even when they\u0027re not perfectly aligned. However, there\u0027s a host of claw-related bugs; and what you\u0027re trying is bound to summon all of them. Save often, use named saves, and be prepared to restart KSP -- *a lot*.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T13:57:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fearless Son\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fearless Son\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wish that one could strut a craft to an asteroid after attachment, but we know that to be impossible. \u003Cp\u003EI have considered using landing legs that will (hopefully) be flush with the asteroid surface.
