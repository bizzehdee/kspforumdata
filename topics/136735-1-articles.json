How well you completed it is scored with the amount of rep (only!) you get for the completion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe strategies could influence the way you want to spend the money. For example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou activate the \u0022Tech Demonstrator\u0022 strategy. That makes a bunch\u00A0of \u0022demonstrator\u0022 missions to show up. You pick one and are given funds to perform a test of, for example, ion engine in LKO. The money goes into the research of limited amount of ion engines. If you succeed you get rep, if you don\u0027t, the money is spent on research but you get nothing (unless you somehow saved some of that money) and you are left with a bunch of poorly put together ion engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe time to develop such tech would of course vary based upon how much funding you got, the level of your R\u0026amp;D and probably some other factors. And you would have a limited amount of time to develop those technologies. If you saved a bunch of money from the previous research program you would finish faster, thus getting way more rep than if you spent more time on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would also be other strategies like \u0022The shuttle program\u0022, \u0022The sounding rockets\u0022, \u0022The Munar program\u0022, \u0022Space station research program\u0022 and probably a bunch of others. Each of them would have a set of missions bound directly to what is the goal of the strategy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T23:26:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would LOVE to see something like this as a science/career-overhaul mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T00:15:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW I\u0027ll update the OP tomorrow to make the idea clear and easy to read by listing all the discussed features and their simplified descriptions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T12:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOP edited.

I think its broadly agreed that career mode while promising still feels a bit clunky and incomplete, and I think people are right to try to imagine ways it could be improved. There are two parts to this: diagnosing where the issues are and coming up with ways to address those issues. Coming up with ideas that seem more realistic can be a good start, but at the end of the day any solution is going to be an abstraction and what ultimately matters is whether the mechanics are actually fun use.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe conflict I see in replacing science points with a series of specifically proscribed missions is twofold. At the moment one of the most common complaints I see are people who don\u0027t like having to do numerous side-quests in order to progress, and making it so unlocking each part requires doing a side quest seems to massively exacerbate this problem. It sounds fine if you\u0027re thinking about going supersonic to unlock an engine, but there are 227 of parts now. Do we have to run dozens of tedious missions to unlock\u00A0decouplers\u00A0and octagonal struts\u00A0and adapters\u00A0and fuel tanks? And like okay you could lump a bunch of things to cut that down from 227 side-quest missions, but its still basically asking players to spend a huge amount\u00A0of time doing somewhat repetitive tasks that they may or may not want to do. You could cut it down even further to just be like 12 science related side quests but then you run into problem 2: the tech tree is currently the default reward system of the game once it completes people feel like they\u0027ve \u0022beaten the game\u0022, and the more you cut down on part-tests the worse this problem becomes. Having science points might seem arbitrary, but it does have the advantage of being non-proscriptive;\u00A0allowing players to go to the mun or send a probe to Eve or fly a plane around kerbin or play as they wish and still be rewarded and progress through the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother issue I see is how to\u00A0make\u00A0time based budgets work in a game with time-warp. Sure, you can make money increase over time as rep decreases over time, but you still have to deal with game balance. The trouble is getting a monthly budget might be fine early in the game sending things to the Mun and Minmus, but what happens when a player wants to send a probe to Jool? How do you make sure that time warping that mission doesn\u0027t give you crazy amounts of money and erase all your rep? Maybe you say okay I\u0027ll launch the Jool probe and then do some smaller Kerbin SOI missions to keep things even in the mean time, but a round trip minmus mission takes a couple weeks\u00A0and a\u00A0way trip\u00A0to Jool takes almost 3 years. Thats a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of repetitive\u00A0filler missions.\u00A0What you end up with is either wild swings in funds and rep or lots and lots of repetitive missions to keep things stable. Personally, I tend to think receiving lump sum advances and rewards\u00A0is much easier to understand and balance.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThats not to say there aren\u0027t ways career mode couldn\u0027t be improved, its just that I don\u0027t think these two solutions actually make the situation better.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T20:15:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105624\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pthigrivi\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1st issue: not all of the parts would need specific experiments to be unlocked.

Being able to complete the tech tree after a few Mun visits isn\u0027t playstyle\u00A0restriction, just a balance issue. On the other side\u00A0even\u00A0limiting it to the engines means locking players into 32 specific missions they have to run to complete the game instead of just being able to fly planes or go to the Mun or do whatever they\u0027d rather do.\u00A0Another question is if science points are gone do you need to put experiments on probes anymore? Like sure maybe some missions might require a specific experiment on a specific planet to unlock a part, but proscribing specific experiments this way could really lock players into being required to do the same thing every time. Like if you make it so unlocking the aerospike requires doing an atmospheric test on Eve then you have to run that specific mission to get the aerospike, and if you don\u0027t have a part thats unlocked by doing that\u00A0test then there\u0027s no in-game reason to run this mission.\u00A0The advantage of\u00A0generic points is you really have a huge amount of freedom to do the kinds of missions you want to do and still be rewarded for it because any type\u00A0of mission that gathers science points helps you advance in the game.\u00A0I feel like what you really want is for experiments to provide players with something specific and useful and to \u003Cem\u003Efeel like doing science\u003C/em\u003E, which I agree with. To me,\u00A0instead of locking a specific experiment to a specific tech tree node, it might be better to give each experiment a reward to the player outside of the tech tree entirely. For instance including a thermometer might allow you to see heat bars in flight, or a gravoli detector might double as a biome scanner. This way not only is the experiment providing the player with valuable in-game information, but they also remain relevant even after the tech tree is complete.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTime-based budgets have been thrown out a several times and again, while I don\u0027t think its impossible to make it work time warp does complicate things. Part of it is just the mechanics of the game,\u00A0throwing together\u00A0a bunch of parts and hitting\u00A0launch\u00A0is just fundamentally different than running a government agency with thousands of employees and vendors and salaries to deal with. Within the construct of the game you really need the money up front so you know what your budget is for any given mission, otherwise you\u0027re just time-warping until you have enough money to build whatever you want to build. If the rep hit is tied to just having a probe en-route vs actually completing the mission then why even finish the mission? Why do anything but put a tiny probe core on an intercept if all\u00A0sense of risk and reward ends there? Sure, you can select \u0022Jool exploration\u0022 as a mission strategy, but what if you want to have lots of concurrent missions? Is each mission type tied to its own revenue stream or does it all go into one monthly allotment? Like can you select an Eeloo mission and then spend that money on a Duna mission? Can you spend Eeloo money on R\u002BD?\u00A0My concern generally is that it makes the risks and rewards of accepting and completing missions really difficult to understand and manage and that maybe leaving time out of it and keeping\u00A0contracts as lump-sum advances, rewards, and penalties is actually easier to understand and harder to exploit\u00A0than multi-layered\u00A0strategic time-warping.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was negative about procedural planets but I think I\u0027ve been quite supportive of most other ideas. Part of this whole thing is making a game that\u0027s structured enough to provide clear goals and rewards and flexible enough to let players conduct the type of program they like. I like to build efficient ssto\u0027s and get a minmus mining base set up and then expand deeper into the system with lots of concurrent missions. Other people like to make big mothership one-off missions and Jool-5\u0027s, or mess around with planes, or wing it with balzy caveman missions, or\u00A0send probes everywhere and then mount careful crewed missions. Even within career its tough to accommodate all these kinds of playstyles. Most of the complaints I see now are that the current contracts are too random and require a player to do a bunch of things that they aren\u0027t especially interested in to keep things going. Conducing science basically means clicking a bunch of parts and feels at once\u00A0grindy and too easy. There\u0027s no end game or sense of completion so people feel as though finishing the tech tree means finishing the game. My central interest is in addressing these issues specifically, keeping what works and making changes that are as incisive as possible to make things better.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst: the core fun of KSP is in building rockets and planes and flying them. Everybody who plays this game and has\u00A0gotten years of enjoyment like those things, and everything should focus on that. At the moment there are parts to build rovers but there\u0027s no real reason within the game to actually drive them, that can be fixed as well. Contracts are okay, the basics of getting money and rep\u00A0for going out and doing things makes sense, but making them random doesnt make them less proscriptive and a lot of players are chaffing. I think the solution to this actually pretty simple: make the World Firsts the main quest of the game. It really doesn\u0027t change much mechanically, its actually just a UI change, but when you open up Mission Control these should be up-front and visible and ready to accepted at any time. Missions should be categorized by planet, with Flyby, Reach Orbit, and Land featured up top, and various generative contracts listed below as optional side-missions. What would be locked out would be the \u003Cem\u003Eadvances\u003C/em\u003E for these missions. This means you could see that you could go to Duna at any time and be rewarded for it, but if you wanted the \u003Cem\u003Eadvance\u003C/em\u003E you would need to build up rep first. This way players could do what the like to do and understand that completing the game doesn\u0027t mean unlocking the tech tree, thats only a means to an end, but landing on each planet and moon in the game is the goal.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext is science. I\u0027ve posted this before but I think the issue with science isn\u0027t the tech tree or science points in principle, its with the in-flight experience of conducing experiments. I think each experiment should require the player to do something special that feeds into the experience of flying and receive valuable information for doing so. I posted my thoughts on this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103562-discovery-doing-actual-science/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2505109\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E if you\u0027re interested. I also think each biome should have a slightly different multiplier so that players have to think carefully about where they should land, and that the easter-eggs system should be expanded to real surface features that could be mapped and explored on the surface. This way the experience of going out into the solar system and finding new and unexpected things carries straight through from the VAB to tooling around on the surface with rovers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-24T01:17:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2016 01:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T10:29:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105624\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pthigrivi\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1st paragraph:\u00A0The experiments would help you to research the parts faster.

Your rep goes up more and you go to Duna or whatever. You can do whatever you want, and at no point yet have you accepted a contract that includes a rep penalty. In this way money and budgets don\u0027t matter at all because there\u0027s nothing forcing you to accept the risk of penalty.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf that\u0027s not the case, if you have to accept contracts to get money\u00A0then income isn\u0027t a reflection of rep, its a reflection of what contracts you accept. What\u0027s weird about this is money in KSP isn\u0027t spent over time, you make something in the VAB and hit launch and money is deducted all at once. So why does it make sense that a player would have to wait for money to trickle in rather than just getting it up front? Like say you accept a contract to go to the Mun. Its going to slowly\u00A0doll out some small amount of money that over time equals what it should cost to do a Mun mission. That means you\u00A0accept the contract and then time-warp and wait until you\u00A0have enough money to actually do the mission. Just from a pure game-play standpoint is this necessary? Why is this better than what we already have? Think about if someone is in the mid-game and wants to send probes to Minmus, Eve, Dres, and Jool. Presumably the income they\u0027re receiving for accepting these missions is dolled out over the time those missions should take, say a few weeks for Minmus, longer for Eve, longer still for Dres and Jool. This means you have to do the Minmus mission first, then Eve, then Dres, then\u00A0Jool, because thats the order in which the rep penalties are incurred and you necessarily have to time warp between each to accumulate enough money to start each mission. You cant chose which order to do these missions without incurring penalties. How does this work with transfer windows? Like if you have to sit and wait for the money to trickle in and you miss your transfer window are you just screwed? What about just plain time-warping through a mission itself? If all it takes to complete a Jool contract is to have a probe en-route then there\u0027s no reason to complete the mission, and if I have to complete the mission avoid the rep hit then I have to worry about how long Im time-warping while its en-route.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI hope you see what I mean, what seems like a sensible real-life solution actually injects a monstrously complicated and problematic mechanic to the game. Sure, maybe some people could manage it, but having to strategically pre-plan when you accept contracts and carefully time warp to build up money\u00A0while mentally keeping track of half a dozen transfer windows and penalty dates and en-route craft\u00A0just to keep your program running seems like a huge distraction from just making rockets and flying them, which is the real reason people play KSP.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T18:25:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m feeling trolled. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105624\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pthigrivi\u003C/a\u003E, do you like the current career mode?

I quite like the idea of giving players a clearer idea that they can select the main mission they want and then go do it, and the idea of making science experiments feel more relevant.\u00A0Im just not not sold on eliminating science points entirely or dolling out funds over time rather than up front as a lump sum. They\u0027re common suggestions, and again Im not saying its impossible it just means a huge amount of thought and work to make them balanced and seamless.\u00A0Im pretty so-so on the current implementation, and think there\u0027s a lot of room for improvement. To me though the best possible suggestions from our end are ones that don\u0027t require a total re-write of the game, essentially starting from scratch from a balance standpoint,\u00A0but that specifically target the deficiencies that exist and fix\u00A0them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you\u0027re right, any form of career mode is going to add tasks besides just building and flying rockets. I think the things that people want and expect are to start with a limited number of parts and slowly unlock them, and to have to worry about what different rockets cost. The real challenge that the devs have embarked on is how to make these rules of the road work and to apply constraints and challenge players to do things they might not have otherwise thought of while still giving them the freedom to set their own agenda. To my mind science does allow players to set their own agenda, in that no matter where they go they can collect generic points and spend them on the tech tree. In many ways what\u0027s missing here are some fun constraints. The only thing you need to do to make an experiment work is to click on it, and you have to do that repetitive task\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E. The challenge is to\u00A0allow people to collect science from anywhere, but to create game mechanics in which doing so intelligently gives greater rewards than just winging it. You should be able to chose where you want to go, but still have to think carefully about how to execute that mission to get the best results.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think you\u0027re right that contracts as they stand now suffer from the opposite problem. Arsonide has put a lot of very clever work into constructing a huge range of\u00A0randomized missions, but still when you look at the pool you don\u0027t get that open-world\u00A0sense that \u0022Hey, I can go anywhere!\u0022. Of course because of World Firsts you certainly can, in fact you can pretty easily run a functioning program purely by exploiting them, but when you go into Mission Control you aren\u0027t given a clear sense that this is so. So to me this is largely a presentation problem, not flaw in the basic underlying mechanics.\u00A0This is why I like your idea of being able at any time to select the specific mission you want to go on, to tell the game \u0022Hey I want to send a probe to Eve!\u0022 or \u0022I want to go see an asteroid!\u0022 Its how to carefully apply constraints to that, slowly building reputation and funds to make those missions logistically possible thats the real game-design challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-24T19:53:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2016 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T20:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I agree that the whole rewrite should be avoided even though the career mode right now is not something I enjoy.
