But with the new aerodynamic rules, you then have to make your rockets tall and slim instead of short and stubby, to get things up there in the first place. This is an Issue; the Mun is bumpy and uneven, and ladders are a pain. And with a tall, skinny rocket, you risk knocking it over as you jetpack up to the door.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, maybe a belly lander is the solution. This would, however, run into the problem that the powerful main engine would then be \u0027back\u0027 instead of \u0027down\u0027. That\u0027s where I\u0027m stuck. Do I use radial rockets the whole way down instead of the main engine? Do I eschew a \u0027main\u0027 engine in favour of radials? Do I use monopropellant engines instead?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, once again, aerodynamics for takeoff with the landing legs.
