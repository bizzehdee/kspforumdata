But that doesn\u0027t change the fact that those two movies are highly polarizing. Some people really like them while plenty of others immediately think of them when the tooic of movies that are visually stunning but otherwise flawed is raised. I am looking forward to hearing what others think about The Martian when it is released. Hopefully it manages to live up to our high expectations.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea the opinions of Gravity and Interstellar are very polarizing. The problem is a difference in people. There are essentially three types. People who love story, people who love visuals and then the most annoying people in my opinion. The people who are incapable of suspension reality for a science fiction movie. So what the movies were touted as scientifically accurate! Whoops Hollywood is trying sell a movie! Even beyond on that there are people who want any movie that is based space to be realistic. Those are the people who you just can\u0027t argue with. It\u0027s a movie and it\u0027s meant to be entertaining. Even Andy Weir who went through painstaking efforts to ensure that the Martian feels realistic admitted he had to take dramatic license with the science just to make it entertaining. Lack of scientific accuracy doesn\u0027t bother me as long as it\u0027s not too insane. It needs to have a good story and it needs to look good. What else do you need in a motion picture. Here is the truth Gravity was visually stunning and the space infrastructure was gorgeous. However you watch it once and you really can watch it again. It\u0027s just not that entertaining. In many ways it\u0027s boring. At this point I would love to watch it on mute with a great sound track. Or even the soundtrack from interstellar. Interstellar again looked fantastic and actually had a great and compelling story. I even think most people would agree 3/4 of the movie is fantastic. I think the end however no spoilers is what throws people off. Again no spoilers but the power of love is boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst sign of product placement!!
