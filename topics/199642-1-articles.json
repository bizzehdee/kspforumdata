I have added the extra ground station setting in the advance options. However, when looking for them in the tracking station I just see a little red x that tells me I need to build a ground station there. That\u0027s all well in good but I am not sure how to do that! clicking on it doesn\u0027t do anything. I am not even sure if this is default how its supposed to work. Since I have been out of the Commnet loop for a bit playing with RT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the mod that is causing this is either\u00A0Kerbalism, or Kerbal Konstructs/ Kerbinside Re.
