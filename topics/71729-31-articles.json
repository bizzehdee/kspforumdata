Here is what I asked about CONSERT \u0022A maximum of 20 complete acquisition sequences were hoped for under optimal conditions (Herique, Lasue, Rogez, Zine, Kofman 2012). It was known that less optimal conditions (not enough solar light for recharging batteries) would limit the total acquisition sequences. My first question is: Did the limited amount of power severely limit the total acquisition sequences? If so, about how many occurred? If not all have occurred yet, are acquisition sequences planned for when there is more information about the Long-Term Science Mission and power availability? My last question is if the orientation of Philae is an issue for an instrument like CONSERT?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess that 1) the engineers didn\u0027t have time to answer and or 2) they don\u0027t have a clue or are not allowed to disclose such information. I am probably asking the wrong people. I could shoot off an email the principal scientist investigators about this but I don\u0027t know French and I doubt they have time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, I\u0027m willing to bet that 20 CONSERT acquisition sequences was very optimistic. But...then I read an article saying that the majority of CONSERT data would occur during the \u0022Long-Term Science\u0022 mission. This is when Philae would be relying on solar energy to conduct science. Since a complete acquisition sequence could be perhaps equated to a complete orbit by Rosetta then it might be safe to say that CONSERT won\u0027t have much data to work unless Philae gets more sunlight... The principle scientists behind CONSERT said that it is a \u0022one shot\u0022 instrument and I\u0027m beginning to wonder if that shot was a miss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T08:11:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm... how difficult would it be to tell Rosetta to keep 67P between itself and the sun ... ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T11:28:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aningaaq\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aningaaq\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBy the way, I read in an article that Philae will officially be dead when the comet is about 2 AU away from the Sun. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was the original plan: even with Philae sitting in a well-lit spot, the sunlight wouldn\u0027t suffice anymore when the distance is greater than 2AU. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith where it\u0027s actually sitting, it should have enough sunlight to operate once it gets closer to the sun. However, for this to work the battery has to become warm enough; and without electrical heating, this, too, has to happen by sunlight. As I understand it, there\u0027s little doubt about having enough light for electricity generation in a few weeks\u0027 time; the question is whether the lander becomes warm enough so that the electricity may be used. If that happens, the probe can be powered up and will remain powered up until (duration of sunlight per day * intensity) falls below the threshold again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they can\u0027t find a way of shifting it\u0027s position, the final poweroff will happen a lot sooner than at 2AU.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T15:56:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWho knows what is possible?
