I am proficient with professional video editing software but WLMM is simple, quick and provides enough options for simple snipping, speeding up and adding simple transitions. Due to CPU bottleneck on my laptop I often use 1.5x to 4x speedup depending on part count, to approximate the expected real visual speed of the craft. The type of video editing software you use, I\u0027d say would depend on what kind of features you need. I just want simple craft showcases so WLMM is more than adequate, really.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESuggest to do a test recording on your laptop and see if real time narration is okay. For my case due to framerate issues at 1080p, I would add narration in post processing if I wanted to narrate anything (currently, I don\u0027t).

Those are really high quality, but expensive, and definitely not a requirement for a starter. If your webcam mic really sucks, you can use a headset instead. Those usually have at least half way decent mics in the middle price range. My headset for instance (Sharkoon GSone, ~45\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC) has a pretty OK mic.

Not a very popular one, since most people use Adobe Premiere or Sony Vegas, but I gotta say I haven\u0027t had any problems with Corel, and I hear people complain about Vegas crashing all the time, so yeah. It\u0027s also a lot cheaper than either vegas or premiere. As for free stuff: I really don\u0027t think that Windows Movie Maker is good, and I don\u0027t know of any other free ones, so that\u0027s that.
