The elements are connected via normal sized docks, the core, central element\u00A0is a FL-T800 fuel tank with two spokes. I attached the core element to my existing space station, added the two spokes with the starter element for the circle on the end of each spoke. After that i started attaching the parts which will form one half of the circle, but i got stuck with the last element. Ive built and tested the the whole circle as one on the launchpad and it formed a perfect loop, the unconnected dock clamped after the physics kicks in in the game. Then i dissassembled the whole thing and launched every part one by one, and assemled in orbit again with the help of small probes (monoprop \u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E \u002B probe \u002B klaw) and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Soon i figured out, that the parts wont form a circle, because the docks are connecting in a different angle than i wanted to. I\u00A0know that a clever use of subassemblies can prevent this somehow, but i\u0027ve decided to use the dock rotation mod to fix it. Back to the problem: i added the last part for the half-circle, but it connects only on one end, the other dock refused to clamp. To be honest they were clipped together (i mean, that the polygons are cut into each other). Tried to rotate the part with the mod, but still clipping. Tried to make the whole station wobble, so the parts wont cut into each other at least for a second, hoping that way they will dock. No luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that a circular station can be done this way (with docking ports), my question is how to attach the last element for the circle, that has to dock on both ends? They have to dock simultaneously somehow?\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow i am at my workplace, so i have time to phrase my question =)\u00A0but therefore i cannot provide screenshots yet, but i will if i get home and it is needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ibb.co/bS1Eb7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ibb.co/bS1Eb7\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ibb.co/j1PgpS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ibb.co/j1PgpS\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ibb.co/icr2US\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ibb.co/icr2US\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-04T19:19:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2018 07:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by mezon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gilead","CreatedById":184696,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-04T19:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027m not an expert\u003C/strong\u003E, but \u003Cem\u003EI think\u003C/em\u003E you have too much docking ports. To close the ring, you need to align all the ports perfectly. A small misalignement between 2 pieces would not mean a lot if there are not a lot of pieces. But in your case, if there\u0027s a tiny misalignement on 4 or 5 docks, that adds to a bigger misplacement at the end, big enough to not allow the last pieces to align and thus not dock to each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know the dock rotation mod, but maybe you can rotate more precisely? If you can\u0027t be more precise, I personally would reduce the number of docking ports, by making less pieces. Instead of putting a docking port at the ends of every\u00A0FL-T400, build the ring with docking ports every 3 or 4\u00A0FL-T400 instead of each one. That\u0027s my advice, but I\u0027m not very experimented, I might be wrong.

Which has to be placed on the top of a rocket. Definitely not across. Which makes a big offset in the center off mass. Don\u0027t know how to compensate for that... That\u0027s why i launched every piece separately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think i dont have a dock misalignment the way (axis) that you think. Check screenshots above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that i have to squeeze the last piece in to complete the circle. No matter how you combine the elements, there will be a point where you have to insert a piece (with two docks on each ends) into a tight space. If the docks have to connect simultaneously, well than i have no clue how to achieve that. Although the rest of the circle is pretty flexible, so my idea was to somehow tighten the gap between the\u00A0 docks and play with the undocked element until it clicks in. Dunno... Think its Kerbal\u0027s tree hierarchy problem with the two docks when they are trying to connect to the same vessel...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mission required 16 launches, so i am open

figured a work around for this, but...\u00A0 KSP ships are built in a tree.\u00A0 All parts can follow a single path back the root part.\u00A0\u00A0 IE all parts are connected to a single part, but any single part may have many parts connect to it.\u00A0\u00A0 A single part may not be connected to two parts at once.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when you have part of the ring assembled, all the parts can trace back to the root by a single path.\u00A0 But when you try to close the circle you are giving the parts 2 paths to the root.\u00A0 In essence the parts of the circle are connected to each adjacent part.\u00A0\u00A0 KSP doesn\u0027t like this, and will refuse the connection.\u00A0\u00A0 Try building it in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly

quarters.\u00A0 So I\u0027ll have four spokes from the core, then each spoke has one quarter of the ring attached.\u00A0\u00A0 The last part of each quarter has a strut that connects to the next quarter.\u00A0 If you position the parts very closely, you will barely see the strut.\u00A0 Circular structures like this in stock, I usually build entirely on the ground, and then launch as one piece, carefully.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Again, noting, this is old school KSP talking, I might be outdated here...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mark
