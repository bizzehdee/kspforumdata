Extra tanks for landing and deorbit should solve that."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:48:57Z","Content":"Some ideas:\n\nMoar struts. \n\nTurn off the attitude control of the air brakes."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:57:18Z","Content":"You could try disabling SAS once the thermal effects start.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T17:14:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You could try disabling SAS once the thermal effects start.\n\u003E Happy landings!\n\nHave tried SAS, mechjeb hold retrograde and nothing, only observation is that nothing give a bit more oscillation. \n\nI will try to use 3x symmetry on brakes and parachutes as in boosters, other option might be to use 1\u002B2\u002B2 asparagus on boosters for more dV, this might depend on landing attitude."},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T05:20:10Z","Content":"You could try with vernor engines close to the top of the rocket to correct the instability, they worked for me.\n\nTo minimize the reentry heat I burn retrograde just before reaching 90000m to decelerate under 3000 m/s (or as close as possible).\n\nTo avoid the most the overheat damages I tried to enclose as much as I could in fairings.\n\nThe lander has got a fuel converter, so it lands almost empty with just the fuel in the descent module.\n\n![pp60KVh.png](http://i.imgur.com/pp60KVh.png)\n\nThe ascent part is clearly Mesklin inspired (I certainly miss his finesse, I need a 3000t rocket to get this on Eve.
