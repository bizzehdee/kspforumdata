I am aware there are such mods as RSS (but I cannot seem to install it properly, Kerbin/Earth still has a moon called Minmus) and a mod that gives you the solar system with realistic sizes, but I wanted to give it a shot myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been playing KSP for about 500h now (thanks, Steam) and have installed a couple of mods in varying combinations, so I thought I gave myself a new challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny advice, links or encouragements are higly welcomed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the best\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etobykoby\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T11:34:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65401-WIP-PlanetFactory-CE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65401-WIP-PlanetFactory-CE\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T12:28:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHyperedit can change planets\u0027 positions (and orbits).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-05T14:36:15Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2014 02:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tery215\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eapostrophe placing\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tobykoby","CreatedById":73426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T12:55:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blizzy78\u0022 data-cite=\u0022blizzy78\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65401-WIP-PlanetFactory-CE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65401-WIP-PlanetFactory-CE\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks very much for that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E - I have started to create a Kerbal-sized solar system. I have put the real Sun (Sol) in a big orbit around Kerbol to keep an overview while building the system. But I have not yet figured out how to remove the original Kerbol system so that only the Sol system is ingame - and I have the slight feeling that this is not possible with Planet Factory, or am I wrong? Or do I need to create a KSC (somehow) on Terra in my Sol System? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for any advice on that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Avedis","CreatedById":101672,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T05:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t Hyperedit eventually resets the custom positions of the planets to their original places?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
