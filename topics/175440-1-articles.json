The only way out from that point is to close the whole game down and reload the save to try again, eventually it works normally but it usually takes 3-4 tries of reloading the save and trying to launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m on PS4- career mode, approximately year 10\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe subassembly I\u00A0am\u00A0loading is a complete rover that has been built in the SAB, I\u0027m trying to load it on the launch pad and drive it to a base pod on the runway to test being able to load/unload the rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll get a screenshot/ video once I\u0027m home from work but hopefully somebody has encountered this and can provide some advice. If not hopefully the DEV team will see this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
