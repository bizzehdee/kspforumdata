It pushed past vertical because it was just a little to far over past the target and because it was close to the barge and moving quickly it needed to do a hard correction to accomplish the adjustment.

With a sea-level thrust of 654 kN, 70% throttle gives 458 kN. The SF101 site reports that the first stage\u0027s dry mass is around 18 metric tons. If fully dry, a single Merlin at 70% throttle gives a TWR of 2.6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in reality it\u0027s carrying a residual amount of propellant; how much is hard to tell for sure, but we can ballpark it. With a sea-level Isp of 282 s, the Merlin would be consuming about 170 kg of propellant per second (at 70% thrust). Since the landing burn is a few seconds long, it would need to be carrying at least one or two tons of propellant. Let\u0027s make it 2 tons. With that, the TWR comes up as 2.3 - still pretty high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would need to be carrying 28 tons of propellant for it to have a TWR of 1, and that\u0027s 7% of its load at launch. I think it\u0027s unlikely it still has that much propellant on board (I\u0027ve heard a number as high as 15% of first stage propellant load is saved for the recovery, but I\u0027d guess a large portion of it is used up in the boostback and reentry burns - what\u0027s left for landing must be little).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T15:44:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 03:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Meithan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T16:07:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stone Blue\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stone Blue\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVideo:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://vine.co/v/euEpIVegiIx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://vine.co/v/euEpIVegiIx\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think they need a bigger barge.
