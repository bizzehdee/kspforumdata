There\u0027s 2 major factors which cause this in 0.22: 1) Chute shock force is much too harsh. 2) Parts are held together with duct tape and used chewing gum, unless you go nuts with struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some things you can try, however. You need to reduce your speed as much as possible before the chute opens fully. You can do this either by trying for a much longer aerobrake (shallower angle into the atmosphere), some judicious retro burning during descent, or opening the chutes as early as possible (trigger them as soon as you begin your descent, then let them open automatically as atmospheric pressure rises). The partly deployed state provides some useful drag, before they go to fully deployed and give you the problematic shock load. You can also try using the orange/red drogue chute on future builds, in addition to normal chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou certainly should be able to strut the connection between the decoupler and tank, but only in the VAB, not on the mission (without mods). 27t is reasonably heavy for a parachute lander, so plenty of struts, plenty of chutes, and some judicious retro burning are most likely the answers. If the radial chutes are attached lower down the stack, you could try triggering them before the capsule chute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t care about your exact landing spot, circularise your orbit just above the atmosphere, e.g. at 42x42, then drop just barely into the atmosphere, e.g. 40x42 (it starts at 41, if memory serves). Then just let it orbit, with all chutes triggered, and let the orbit drop slowly. Experts may have a better strategy, but I believe that should give you approx max aerobraking. Just before the chutes fully deploy, use retro thrust to reduce velocity to a manageable level (trial and error will be required to figure out just what that is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also want to describe your flight profile more fully, as the starting orbit for your descent will make a huge difference. E.g. if you start at a 500x500 orbit and go straight for the lower atmosphere, you going to be carrying LOTS of velocity into the aerobrake then chutes. Start the descent from as low an orbit as possible to minimise the speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T15:44:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I was going for a straight aerobrake, directly to the point... my Duna intercept ended up with an Apoapsis of around 53,000,000m if I\u0027m right, and I set the Periapsis to 7,000m... no wonder it\u0027s going really fast.

You\u0027ll need probably 6 or 8 of the bluetips and a dozen or so radials for the parachutes to do you much good, which add beaucoup weight, which means you\u0027ll have a harder time getting there and coming back. Check out the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.freeiz.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eparachute calculator\u003C/a\u003E for the bad news. Also note that you need to enter your landing site\u0027s altitude. Unless you\u0027re aiming for one of the rare depressions, the vast bulk of Duna\u0027s surface is 2000-3000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Duna\u0027s air is both thin and shallow. Thus, for even the right amount of chutes to do their thing, you have to give them the longest time possible in the air. This means you need to come in on a very long, flat trajectory, like start at 50km orbit and aim to land about 1/4 to 1/3 of the way around the planet. And even then you\u0027ll usually have to retroburn long and hard anyway. Pop the chutes at 20km so they streamer as soon as possible, slowing you down (with the retroburn) so you don\u0027t have such a severe shock when they fully open. Using 1 or 2 of the drogue chutes helps here, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then of course everything needs to be structurally sound. You can easily add struts, to, from, and bypassing decouplers and just about everything else. And because you\u0027ll have so many chutes stuck everywhere on the lander, pretty much all parts need to be heavily strutted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, check out this 18-ton Kethane lander. It had 2 bluetips, 8 radials, and 2 orangetip drogues. This was NOT enough chutes to land by themselves, just to help so it didn\u0027t need as much fuel to land.

First, of course, you need to aerocapture into a 50-ish-km orbit to lose your extra interplanetary speed. Then take a look at your fuel situation. It costs about 1400-1500m/s (using in-atmosphere ISP) to land on Duna with just engines, and about the same to take off again, starting and ending in a 50-ish-km orbit. Then it takes about 500m/s to get back to Kerbin, after which you\u0027re safe (assuming aerocapture there).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if after aerocapture, you have fuel \u0026gt; 3600, no worries. If you have 3000 \u0026lt; fuel \u0026lt; 3600, you\u0027re not getting home if you land. You can, however, land and get back into orbit to await rescue, which is much easier than having to rescue somebody off the surface. If you have 1500 \u0026lt; fuel \u0026lt; 3000, you can land but won\u0027t be able to take off again, which will make for a rather more difficult rescue. If you have 600 \u0026lt; fuel \u0026lt; 1500, you can\u0027t land but can return to Kerbin after a fly-by. If you have fuel \u0026lt; 600, you\u0027re not coming home at all and should spend what fuel you have left getting into an orbit that\u0027s easy to get rescued from.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T03:13:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I managed to land on Duna... thing is, I think my rocket has just around 860 fuel left.

I am not 100% sure if how I am doing it is right, but so far my ships have not broken on landings so that has to account for something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T03:06:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Commissioner Tadpole\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Commissioner Tadpole\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI had to sacrifice some of the fuel to reduce my rocket\u0027s speed to ~150m/s. It was a close call, I was around 650m away from the surface. And yes, I repacked the \u0027chutes, I just took the picture before I repacked them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I still feel guilty here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, in case you didn\u0027t know, repacked chutes are a major problem. They will NOT work in the spacebar-activated staging ever again after the 1st time, so if you plan on reusing repacked chutes, you need to assign \u0022deploy chutes\u0022 to an action group, which sadly has to be done back in the VAB before you launch unless you have whatever that mod is that allows action groups on the fly. And sometimes your ship explodes for no reason when you deploy repacked chutes with an action group, which leads to using right-click on each chute instead of an action group. Problem with that is when you have off-center chutes, because you can only do 1 at a time and after the 1st one, the ship starts spinning so fast it\u0027s next to impossible to ever right-click on another. But it IS doable, with luck, so if you don\u0027t mind a bunch of F5/F9 \u0022simulated\u0022 landings before the \u0022real\u0022 one, there\u0027s always that option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is all to say that if you intend to bring folks home from Duna in the same ship they landed there in, it\u0027s probably best not to use the chutes at Duna. Or, If you have to use the chutes at Duna, to leave the ship in LKO when it returns and send up a new ship with unused chutes to bring the crew back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut I\u0027m not planning to send them back to Kerbin(yet). In fact, after I landed the trio in there I think I\u0027m going to set an operational base on Duna. And I use the Kerbal Attachment System, so it\u0027s a simple matter of sending a tanker with a pipe end and a storager module containing another pipe end, have a Kerbal grab it, carry it to the main rocket, attach it, connect the pipes, and transfer fuel. ^^\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, connecting them isn\u0027t the problem. Landing them close enough together for the pipe to reach is \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. That\u0027s why it\u0027s easier to do rescues in orbit than on the surface. So unless you can do such a landing, it\u0027s probably better to send a probe ship with empty seats than it is to worry about refueling the original ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
