I enter the tracking station and select an existing ship and then fly it. But then when I return to the tracking station\u00A0I am unable to select anything. Further, I am not able to exit the tracking station and I must force close KSP 1.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Flying (some) ships causes them to spin wildly out of control and lose many parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. This one is bad. Suddenly while flying I flipped from map to ship view and the ship was invisible. \u00A0After pressing escape the pause menu did not display and I was then unable to rotate camera view. I\u00A0could still goto map view, but many things were gone and blank. I could go back and click space agency and that made the ship reappear, and able to rotate camera again, but anytime pressing Escape, it would break the game again\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not played KSP for about 6 months because the game has been completely unplayable because of soo many glitches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
