I don\u0027t wan\u0027t anything like that.\n\nI was imagining a second KSC, to autonomous missions, were you can see in realtime the vessels taking off, orbiting, docking, transferring resources, and then going back to be reutilized in other missions, using less money in that way. But if i am on another ship, near the station that is resupplying at the moment, i could see the autonomous vessel approaching and docking.\n\nBut i think that would be hard to do.\n\nThis Routine Mission Manager is cool too. I will study it a little more...\n\nThank you all for your help ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T21:20:11Z","Content":"Hi,\n\nThere is actually KOS which may be used to script everything...this idea could add more functionality to KOS...actually this would be my first thought to do this with KOS; I got the Davon MOD; create a resupply vessel; launch it; automate it and forget it; I think KOS will work from launch to dock; maybe a geo sync orbit would help.\n\nI am using it as a logisitics part not a 40ton behemoth and attaching it to various ships with whatever supplies they may need based on useage over both short and long term; as in years ! If planetary positions are different each time it will be a challenge to get the timing even right.\n\nThis may have broke KSP I could be wrong...sorry cant use DAVON MOD...gonna try kOS tho.\n\nCmdr Zeta\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T13:11:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cdr\\_Zeta**"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T13:50:15Z","Content":"That is cool too Cdr\\_Zeta (Corel Draw Zeta?) ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nBut i was thinking in one manner to do that but not in focus mission, so i can do my won flights, and still having all the resupplies happening in BG. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI think i am to dreamy."},{"CreatedByName":"PrathamK","CreatedById":176896,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-27T09:55:48Z","Content":"Nice thought."}]}
