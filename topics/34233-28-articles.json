Might be a need for fast cargoships - they might be cutting into their delta-v, but if they can simply outrun a combatant, they can get where they need that much faster.

Suffice to say, it happened by the skin of it\u0027s teeth, but it got into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Second iteration of the design is currently working name SBC Auster, also in orbit around Kerbin and docked with my fuel tug (which I will also be submitting for general use). It weighs in at a whopping 576 parts. Another thing not helping it\u0027s frame rate problem is the fact that I tried to use ladders for running lights, and that just MURDERED my frame rate, no matter how good it looked. (I will note, I have a slower machine.) Again, I do not have images of the launch, but I do have one of the entire vehicle prior to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://picturehoster.info/images/34181156757188067724.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002234181156757188067724.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me to my current position...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am willing to accept that, alone, those images may not be enough evidence to prove that I can get this thing into orbit, even if I provide evidence of my Jool transfer when I make my final submission...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER. I have one more ship I will be sending up of the general class. Slightly different. Doesn\u0027t use ladder lights, and has a slightly better nose and more reaction wheels, but is the same basic design as the first ship (which went up with full munitions of 10 weapons [the main source of part count, I\u0027ll note], wheras the second design went up without munitions but had a less efficient flight path or flight process.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis CURRENT ship that I will be sending up... I CAN take a whole bunch of images of it\u0027s launch, maybe even a full video. If I can do that... do you think Macey would accept the earlier two ships of the class?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I would like to note. The main reason I\u0027m a bit stuck up on getting the first two versions in is because... well... it really was an iterative process, designing these ships. I probably STILL won\u0027t really be done with the next design, since there\u0027s a lot more that I can do with it. I really LIKE the fact that my ships so far are, all of them, one of a kind, each one a little bit better than the last.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2 (Because I just keep adding stuff.): Just incase it helps...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://picturehoster.info/images/05635151187475190626.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002205635151187475190626.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://picturehoster.info/images/81897504743615687047.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002281897504743615687047.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome truly good screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-31T06:58:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2013 06:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by shepard1701\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mygnol","CreatedById":74949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T06:57:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shepard1701\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shepard1701\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis CURRENT ship that I will be sending up...
