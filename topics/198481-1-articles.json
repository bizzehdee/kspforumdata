What you probably meant was \u0022a smaller version number\u0022, which would indicate an older, less recent game version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless: his version was \u0022one point three\u0022. Your version is \u0022one point ten\u0022. That is seven updates newer than what was used to record that old video. The thing about version numbers is, they\u0027re not decimals that can tick over. The point is just a separation character, not a decimal point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first number is called\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003Ethe \u003Cem\u003Erelease\u003C/em\u003E. Which is 1, because the game is finished and fully released as \u0022version 1\u0022. Before KSP was fully released, it used to start with a 0 as its release version. You generally only increment the release version if you update the game to such a degree that you practically want to re-release it - for example, if it gets a major content expansion or a complete rework. But since KSP publishes its content expansions as optional downloadable addons (DLC), there was no reason to ever increment the release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second number is the \u003Cem\u003Emajor version\u003C/em\u003E, which is to say, the level of major updates. Every time an update is published, the major version increments. And yes, it can go to 10 or higher. It can go as high as you want. It is entirely independent from the release version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third number is the \u003Cem\u003Eminor version\u003C/em\u003E. This is for little fixes that need to be made after an update is released and potentially brings new bugs with it. Again, this number is completely independent from all other numbers and can go higher than 10, or even 100.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, your version number of 1.10.1 would read as \u0022one point ten point one\u0022, or in human-understandable terms, \u0022the first bugfix of the tenth update of the first release of KSP\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-02T22:36:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2020 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vv3k70r","CreatedById":208078,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-02T22:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223888841\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022198481\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221606931294\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208492\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mrsidknee\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, mrsidknee said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI try to follow along and do what they do in the tutorial or video and I don\u0027t seem to have the same parts, options, or controls.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo in game tutorials.
