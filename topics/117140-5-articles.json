The conditions for their punishment and retribution are set up accordingly. Although all the condemned are enclosed in darkness, not all of them experience it in one and the same way. Darkness differs from darkness, horror from horror, hell-fire from hell-fire. God\u0027s rule is one of justice and mercy everywhere, even in hell. Thus, those who have sinned deliberately have their particular punishment, those who have sinned out of weakness have a different one, those who are being held only because of the damage done by original sin have a different one again. While the torment of these latter consists in the lack of the beatific vision and of the light of the elect, still they come close to mercy and joy in the sense that they do not experience horrible punishments, since they bear no effects of any evil deeds of their own doing. Otherwise, if God did not ordain the number and limit of the punishments, the devil would never show any limits in tormenting them.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E The fourth city is the city of glory. Here one finds perfect love and the ordered charity that desires nothing but God or but for the sake of God. Hence, if you would reach the perfection of this city, your love needs four qualities: it must be ordered, pure, true, and perfect. Your love is ordered when you love the body only for the sake of sustaining yourself, when you love the world without superfluities, your neighbor for God\u0027s sake, your friend for the sake of purity of life, and your enemy for the sake of the reward. Love is pure when sin is not loved alongside virtue, when bad habits are scorned, when sin is not taken lightly.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Love is true when you love God with all your heart and affections, when you take the glory and fear of God into prior consideration in all your actions, when you commit not the least little sin while trusting to your good deeds, when you practice temperance prudently without growing weak from too much fervor, when you do not have an inclination to sin out of cowardice or ignorance of temptations. Love is perfect when nothing is as enjoyable to a person as God. This kind of love begins in the present but is consummated in heaven. Love, then, this perfect and true kind of love! Everyone who does not have it shall be cleansed, no matter whether he is faithful or fervent or a child or baptized. Otherwise he will go to the city of horror.\n\u003E \n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nMore on topic: BootCamped windows, downloaded Robocraft, aaand... HOLY CRAP. My processor was at 95 degrees.

It really is a huge terrible mess.\n\nBy the way, MMS is not the only vector. Any website can load malicious videos too, as can Whatsapp probably (and other apps). Currently the only known browser to have plugged the leak is Firefox, so it is probably best to use that. It still leaves the bugs unharmed though, so things like social engineering and a worm sending videos through your friends, making you think it is safe are all still feasible.\n\nLike I said, I am going to see how this plays out. If Google does not change the laissez faire attitude and actually do something (rather than just update their latest branch and call it done), I cannot image continuing using my current phone, and I can also not see myself getting another Android device knowing the same could happen at any time again.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T12:52:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 12:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T13:09:48Z","Content":"My laptop, running windows eight is starting to misbehave a little, explorer is freezing, sometimes it freezes up while booting up, or shutting down...\n\nI\u0027m hoping installing the new operating system will refresh those parts, and get it working again.If this is actually a terrible idea, please tell me.\n\nHowever, I like the 8 start screen.
