Jeb could say 50% it happens or not... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I was amazed by the bad karma of my poor kerbal and after cleaning orbit I sent another rescue pod. I managed to land it at less than a km and my kerbal was happy to come back home, there was so much snack waiting for him! So I made a classic and fast travel back to Kerbin and while I was in the upper atmosph\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8re I saw a little detail really, really annoying... When I turned the lander in unmanned rescue pod I placed the stayputnik on the top of the little pod, where you usually find... yeah, the parachute \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E The poor Dodloos knew what astero\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AFds impacting Kerbin feel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"roguelycan","CreatedById":64979,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T21:15:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fleb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fleb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI put a science lab station into orbit but forgot to fill up the crew slots. I decided to build a crew shuttle with the hitchhiker tank to rectify my mistake, only to finally dock the crew shuttle and then realise I had forgotten to fill the crew slots again. The crew resetting when I make changes to a vessel, gets me all the time.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I feel your pain. The crew slots resetting have kinda screwed me over many many times. Hopefully SQUAD can make it so the crew can be saved along with the design or something. Or atleast the crew could stay the same when you hit revert to SPH/VAB. Need to install Kerbal manifest again since it works way better than what they have implemented since you can make adjustments on the fly on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAwer","CreatedById":91122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T22:22:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI set up MechJeb rendezvous for my brother on a tiny spaceplane to get to a station.
