(Sandbox \u002B Career)","CreatedByName":"Techiastronamo","CreatedById":71992,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T00:16:55Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Techiastronamo","CreatedById":71992,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T00:16:55Z","Content":"What is this?\n\nWell, essentially, this is a server for the mod called \u0022Dark Multiplayer\u0022 which allows players to play together in KSP on servers.\n\nYou can build space stations together with friends, you can do aerobatics, you can fight each other, and do so much more with this mod.\n\nThe rules are simple for this server. You can join together with friends in your own faction, or go solo and handle your own force.\n\nAll you need is just a unique color for you or your faction, a simple idea on how to manage an effective military, and some diplomacy skills!\n\nYou don\u0027t just hop on and fight everything in sight. You make allies, declare war, and even perform scientific operations with neighbors.\n\nThis isn\u0027t your average war server, you practically are controlling a nation which can claim small plots of territory, negotiate, fight, and do many more things.\n\nWill you destroy the Kerbol system, or will you unite it? You decide as you and your allies fly into victory or defeat!\n\nRules\n\nThe rules are somewhat simple:\n\n1. **All** crafts must be labeled before the name to ensure that a, for example, satellite would be yours and not the next guy\u0027s. *(Example: KSS Eximpru; KSS Omega; FS Otsu; SOMA Doqon)*\n2. No cheats or hyper-edit. We know when a player hyper-edits. Cheaters will be **kicked.**\n3. Factions that do not want participate in any and all wars must have this label before their craft: PF-(faction label). *(Example: PF-KSS Eximpru; PF-KSS Omega; PF-FS Otsu; PF-SOMA Doqon)*\n4. The only way to claim territory is have a central base, claiming an area of **5km** around it. No defenses may be built **outside** of this **5km** zone, but any extra bases outside of this zone have a **2km** radius around them.\n5. The maximum area allowed for one base is **10km**, and the maximum number of bases for one faction is **10 bases**.\n6. Destroying an enemy vehicle without a declaration of war is automatically a declaration of war.\n\n May the greatest faction win!\n\nIf you wish to contact me for any reason relating to the server, my Skype is lolcatzco.\n\nI will likely appear as Techiastronamo in Skype. \n\nMy steam is Techiastronamo as well if you want to contact me that way.\n\nServer Info\n\n**Sandbox Mode Server**\n\nIP: 158.69.139.112 \n\nPort: 6702\n\nMaximum Players: 30\n\n***Online***\n\n**Career Mode Server**\n\nIP:158.69.139.112\n\nPort: 6703\n\nMaximum Players: 30\n\n***Online***\n\n**Hardcore Server**\n\nIP:158.69.139.112\n\nPort: 6704\n\nMaximum Players: 30\n\n***Online***\n\n**Required Mods:**\n\n1) BDArmory: **** [**http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85209-1-0-2-BDArmory-v0-8-3-%28critical-fixes-improved-AI%29-Dev-Thread-May-30**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85209-1-0-2-BDArmory-v0-8-3-%28critical-fixes-improved-AI%29-Dev-Thread-May-30) **** ***Download latest version of BDArmory.***\n\n2) BDArmory DMP Plugin: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130464-WIP-1-0-4-BDArmoury-DMP-Add-on](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130464-WIP-1-0-4-BDArmoury-DMP-Add-on) ***Download the BDDMP, replacing any and all files.***\n\n***For those moderators who don\u0027t know, yes, I did get permission to have both links up there from the developers of the mods***\n\n3) Firespitter\n\n4) KAX\n\n5) Alcubierre Warp Drive ***Hardcore server only, incompatible with other servers!*** *NOTICE: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED*\n\n6) Ferram Aerospace Research ***Hardcore server only, incompatible with other servers!*** \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-12T17:57:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2015 05:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Techiastronamo**\n  \nHardcore mode preperations."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T00:36:06Z","Content":"This looks fun.
