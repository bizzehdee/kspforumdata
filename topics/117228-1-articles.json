It\u0027s not going to save me much, but just challenging myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is basically I have to increase my maneuver nodes \u0022orbit X\u0022 to keep checking to see if the angle/timing of flying by Mun will give me an encounter with minmus. Using Precise node, and have gone through dozens of orbits, essentially days worth of time advancing the node to try and find a place where the Mun is in the right position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can easily identify number of days to reach Minmus: I can setup the gravity assist so that my path crosses the Minmus orbit, and click on my path at that crossing point to identify how many days it will take me to reach that far out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I want to see where Minmus will be in X days. So that I know where I need to aim that crossing point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, I know that with the gravity assist it will take 9 days to reach Minmus, but I am not crossing at the right point. So I want to know where Minmus will be in 9 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe usual method of dragging the node to get an encounter doesn\u0027t work, because it depends on the position of the Mun. Once I know where Minmus will be in 9 days, then it\u0027s alot easier to just wait for the Mun to move enough to adjust my angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs there a way to click on Minmus\u0027s orbit or something similar, and determine how many days it will be before Minmus reaches that point in its orbit?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T03:30:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 03:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AaronLS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nookos","CreatedById":144067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T04:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if there is a tool for that.
