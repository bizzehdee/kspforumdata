Not having slow downs. But I have noticed that when I have KSP running my internet speeds drop to almost nothing. I normally get 40 MBS download\u00A0and 10 MBS upload, When KSP is running, even when I am not focused on the KSP screen and the program\u00A0stops exicuting, my Download drops to 10MBS and upload is almost non-existent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am running the Direct Download version so I am not hitting Steam at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen watching my performance in Task Manager I don\u0027t see anything hogging\u00A0my resources and it does not increase mt WiFi usage at all (less than 5%).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe instant I get out of KSP my internet speed\u00A0jumps right back up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know my system is plenty fast. I can run World of Warcraft at highest Graphics setting and it does not slow down. I have a NVIDA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics card. My CPU is Intel Core i7-8700COU @ 3.20GHz with 12 cores. The CPU takes a heavy hit when loading but once KSP is running the usage goes back down to normal. I have 16 GB ram and when KSP is running I am using about 57% of my memory. When I exit KSP my memory usage dropped to 30%. When loading my Hard drive usage jumps but drops back to normal after loading is complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy wife can be running World of Warcraft at the same time KSP kills my Wifi and she has no issues and shows no drop in speed so I know the issue is no with our WIFI system and is isolated to inside my machine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny Ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBruce\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-24T20:22:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2020 08:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by jbdenney\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded sentence\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
