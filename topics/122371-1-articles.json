If, for example, a wing is added using the Mirror Part option and then other parts are added to the wing (say a shock cone and engine), everything is initially fine. But if II then make changes that require moving the wing, the mirrored parts forget their action group. The odd thing is that those parts still show up in the action list as normal. When you click on them however, you can see the option that was part of the action group needs re-adding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way round this? It\u0027s becoming a pain having to recheck every action group to make sure its right after any change that removes then reattaches a mirrored part.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-05T15:14:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2015 03:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clipperride\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T13:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if anything can be done about it but rest assured it has always been that way.
