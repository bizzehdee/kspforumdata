(I don\u0027t know why NecroBones chose to make them so.)  SMURFF is making them lighter, but when every other tank is so much lighter still, it makes their extra mass more obvious.\n\nIn other news, it\u0027s finally time to release **[v1.9.0: The Power of the Special!](https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/SMURFF/releases/tag/v1.9.0)**\n\nI\u0027m getting down off my high horse with this release; I\u0027ve un-exiled several mod- and part-specific patches that I had been keeping in an \u0022Extras\u0022 directory, because some of those part-specific patches are for Squad parts (the new Mk1-3, Mk2, and Mk2 Lander Can pods).  These new capsules are much lighter than their counterparts (2.6 tons for the Mk1-3 vs. 4 tons for the Mk1-2, for example), so they\u0027d be made of styrofoam if I let their masses get cut in half like the rest.\n\nHere is the full changelog:\n\n- Vintage Kerbal suit variants now excluded from patching.\n- Moved Ven\u0027s \u0022Extra\u0022 patch into the main SMURFF folder, now called \u0022Special\u0022.\n- Squad\u0027s new capsules (Mk1-3, Mk2, and Mk2 Lander Can) now have a \u0022Special\u0022 patch, since they\u0027re much lighter than their predecessors.\n- Update ZBO power requirement patch and Procedural Parts patch to adapt to CryoTanks update.\n- New \u0022Special\u0022 patch for Universal Storage II tanks.\n- New \u0022Special\u0022 patch to handle Tundra Exploration fuel tanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Craze","CreatedById":185994,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-20T08:00:43Z","Content":"As for Lithium.

I think that inclined planets also become harder to reach as you scale up.   And Jool... I can reach it, but I can never leave.\n\nIs the default setting on the mod intended for x6.4 or x10 scaled solar systems?
