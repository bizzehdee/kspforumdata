Be warned I\u0027m only 13 so yeah. I have a base on the Mun and Minmus and in the episode I\u0027m about to record I will get my next 3 crew to Minmus. Some of the episodes drag on for a LONG time my longest is a Tylo orbiter gone bad. The numbering was messed up for a while because I could only post in 15 minute segments. So come check me out on Youtube. You can call me DH for short.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
