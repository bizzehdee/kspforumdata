So I fast forward to the encounter and then begin making adjustment burns to dock my fueler to the living quarters. After a few minutes, I was doing the last burn with my main engine to close the distance between them before switching over to RCS. I got within 3 km, then 2 km, and as soon as I got within 1 km my living quarters just exploded! I then went back to the space center and then to the tracking station, switched to my \u0022living quarters\u0027, hit the \u0022Fly\u0022 button, and when it switched me to the space craft my game froze and then crashed. Which it did again when I reloaded and tried to fly it a second time. It had been in a Kerbin Orbit for about 10 in-game days and had been fine until I got within 1 km, but then it went boom. I had it secured with struts and even test landed it on Kerbin a few times; as well as driving it around the space center, being as it had wheels to make connecting it to other parts of my base easier. So I\u0027m horribly confused as to why it just exploded all of a sudden. There wasn\u0027t any debris or anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried to reproduce it, I\u0027m not sure that I could. What do you guys think, something I should report or just a one-off random thing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T14:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not just you.

If you just report it by saying \u0027this happened\u0027 all we can really do is read what you wrote and say \u0027that happened\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this reason it\u0027s good (crucial) to have backups of your savefile, and to quicksave occasionally. The other day I spent an hour to troubleshoot someone\u0027s exploding station to the point that it didn\u0027t explode, but that\u0027s pretty much all we can do at the moment. With enough information the issue can be reported though, but some issue are already known and being worked on, so a workaround to save your work is really the only doable thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FITorion","CreatedById":7606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T20:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never had this happen.

I thought it was funny when it just exploded out of no where, and it\u0027s not much work to put another into orbit. I didn\u0027t care much about my save anyway, I was more concerned with the bug in general and what might, and apparently has happened to some people with more to loose than my self; all I have to worry about is school, so I can only imagine how bad it would suck to come home from a bad day at work and then have your whole freaking space base explode. Like what happened to sapphire for example. But as long as it\u0027s a known bug then all is good. Thanks again, glad I didn\u0027t waste the developers time on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...space kraken ate my ship, hehehe. I learned of the real dangers in space today.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
