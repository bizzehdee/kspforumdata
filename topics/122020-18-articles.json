I mean by that... do you have an example?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m scrolling down the Addon Releases page looking for potential suspects, but i\u0026#39;m coming up short a bit... \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe following is a random collection of thoughts that are floating about. They may or may not make sense. All of them are intended in a tone of praise for your awesome work.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMod compatibility: I entirely appreciate that the antennas you\u0026#39;ve built have RT configs. It seems those are made of unobtainium at times... Incidentally, I also appreciate a lot that the Sienno built in omni is active from the start node; why RT devs picked such a deep node for that always on perk, I don\u0026#39;t know... poorly documented too.. Ahh, I digress.\u003Cbr\u003E\n---\u003Cbr\u003E\nPerhaps Mechjeb/KER builtins for the probe core(s)?\u003Cbr\u003E\n---\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn a similar note, there are a significant amount of AntennaRange users, I suspect. I don\u0026#39;t know how much effort that would take to re-antenna all of the ones here, though. (Plus with 1.1 coming up... eeeek.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n---\u003Cbr\u003E\nPerhaps more structural adapters to go from size-to-size? I was scratching my head trying to figure out how to load a 2.5 m payload on the Centaur. I may not have all the parts unlocked, though. I have a serious addiction for odd diameter parts it seems. (HGR came out, I was all over that thing. :D ) Lately, these tiny parts have been... well, a blast, lets say.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI mention this because having a lot of lego like pieces is half the fun of KSP to me, and your guys\u0026#39; parts are very flexible in how they go together with themselves \u002B others. Boosting that flexibility would go a long way to mod compatibility right there, without any particular target in mind.\u003Cbr\u003E\n---\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m not using realfuels at the moment, but that\u0026#39;s the one that pops to mind when dealing with an engine/tank pack.\u003Cbr\u003E\n---\u003Cbr\u003E\nLife support doesn\u0026#39;t really pop up as there are no pods here. Science parts already tie into DMagic\u0026#39;s, FASA, somewhat. I\u0026#39;m not certain who else is having a lot of science-y things to tie into. If a telescope ever happens, Cacteye would be something to look into. Science parts are generally good in my eye. (Besides: Where else are you going to find an accurate mass spec? :D )\u003Cbr\u003E\n---\u003Cbr\u003E\nGenerally, I like the attention to detail paid to the parts, descriptions, prices, etc. It adds a lot of flavor, which is rather important/gets over looked a lot of the time, I think.\u003Cbr\u003E\n---\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut mod compatibility... Hmmmm. Procedural Fairings, perhaps? Textures/Fairing Shapes/Bases? Its been a crazy week, perhaps my brain is borked as far as thinking goes :p\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT to say that the following two points are not on topic at all, but i\u0026#39;ll leave them as thought fodder; neither is expected to be taken seriously.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPie in the Sky, no pun intended, would be a set of lightweight engines/thrusters for [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61294-1-0-XT-Landertron-Smart-Retrorockets-for-Landers-and-Spaceplanes-v0-08-Oct-10\u0022]Landertron[/URL] ? I\u0026#39;ve always thought them very Kerbal/A perfect companion for probes/remotetech when diving at the surface of a faraway land. Only problem would be not so much compatibility as dependency :(\u003Cbr\u003E\n---\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also have an idea, which you may or may not render into a plan to throw a shoe at me, butttt... One thing i\u0026#39;ve often thought missing from the addon spectrum was a stock-a-like Apollo SM engine. I\u0026#39;ve never seen one, at least. KW came close, but that... Well. KW. (RLA has a monoprop engine which is close... perhaps I just ought to reconfigure that critter. Hmm...)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m enjoying the work thus far, *a lot*.
