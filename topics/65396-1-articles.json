Whilst it worked fine in the air it could barely land. It was also, frankly, ridiculous-looking. However, some important ideas were proved; namely, that Firespitter\u0027s electric propellers worked on Duna. And due to the thin atmosphere, they work pretty much indefinitely too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSP engineers eventually came up with a more worthy craft, called the Dunahopper- a kind of cross between a microlight and a dune buggy.

Then, young cadet Kenfield Kerman was launched into orbit, so that he could repair the damaged rover wheels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA while before Kenfield arrived at the rendezvous, though, mission control pulled out their party trick- and dumped the RAPIER engine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/TLAmU0m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TLAmU0m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was done because Kenfield was carrying a rather special package with him- a nuclear engine to dock to the Dunahopper. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/MJWvUGt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MJWvUGt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we see Kenfield repairing the damaged wheels:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/24e5R46.png\u0022 alt=\u002224e5R46.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce he\u0027d finished with that, he retired to a safe distance.

The countdown finished, and...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/pDfWazc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pDfWazc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!\u0022 (That was Werner, obviously. \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E said something much worse...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine refused to work, no matter what buttons were pressed from mission control. Fuel crossfeeds were disabled and re-abled. Any button that could be pushed was pushed. Tears were shed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, mission control came to the conclusion that possibly the reason they\u0027d never heard of anyone replacing just an engine in space before was that it wasn\u0027t possible. You can see their confusion though, can\u0027t you? I mean, that RAPIER engine worked fine, getting fuel and oxidiser passed to it through two clamp-o-trons, so why wouldn\u0027t the same thing work once they\u0027d replaced it with an LV-N? Now, I don\u0027t know if maybe KSP doesn\u0027t work that way, or if the docking wasn\u0027t right, or what, but it was an infuriating setback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there were options. A tug could be flown up to push the Dunahopper to its destination. Or another engine with a small fuel tank could be docked to the plane in place of the useless LV-N, and Kenfield could weld a fuel pipe from the main tanks to the little one to get it working. Maybe a replacement engine could be sent up with some RCS fuel so that it could try docking a few more times until it worked properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s pretend that I did one of those things, instead of what I\u0027m ashamed to admit I actually did- which was just hyperedit the plane into a Duna orbit. I know, I know! I\u0027m not proud of this. But, to be honest, I just didn\u0027t have the time for any of those other options. And considering that they were all perfectly feasible options, that I knew I would work, I rationalised to myself that I didn\u0027t actually need to do them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if you\u0027re still with me, let\u0027s pick up the story at Duna...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/Hs8TNUj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Hs8TNUj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we see the Dunahopper being disconnected from its spaceplane \u0027cradle\u0027, after making a de-orbit burn. The burn wouldn\u0027t really drop the plane anywhere near the Hummingbird (I could have done this better, but saw a long boring flight as my penance for the whole hyperedit faux pas), but that would just give the crew some extra time to see how the thing flew, and give them the opportunity to iron out any kinks whilst it was under remote control, instead of when someone was sat in the pilot\u0027s chair. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, those huge wings would have been gotten rid of before the craft made the long trip out to Duna, but the engineers were more concerned with keeping it structurally sound on the way out of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere than they were with a bit of extra weight on the voyage to the red planet (a voyage that didn\u0027t technically happen anyway...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I thought about what would happen after the \u0027cradle\u0027 was decoupled, but what did happen was quite shocking. After the clamp-o-tron separated, all of the magical struts holding it together broke free too, meaning that the \u0027cradle\u0027 was now just two enormous wings barely tethered together. They flapped away wildly from the Dunahopper, which was quite entertaining for a while...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/Qt4hr4k.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Qt4hr4k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then mission control had a sobering thought. The \u0027cradle\u0027 wasn\u0027t just a collection of wings and struts. It also carried a nuclear engine. Which was now hurtling toward the planet at several times the speed of sound. Back on Kerbin, an ashen faced Werner von Kerman turned to the assembled scientists and journalists crowded around mission control. \u0022Ladies and gentlemen, due to our short-sightedness, we appear to be in the process of dropping a nuclear bomb on Duna.\u0022 (I still feel a bit bad about this, to be honest...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/4gUSmSI.png\u0022 alt=\u00224gUSmSI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, the Hummingbird was pretty much round the other side of the planet when the cradle exploded into the ground, so no-one was hurt. Oddly enough, the explosion didn\u0027t even leave a crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb, from the Hummingbird, managed to guide the \u0027hopper via remote control, and pretty soon worked out its limits.

After conferring with mission control, it was decided that if the Hopper couldn\u0027t come to them, the crew would have to go to the Hopper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe maps were consulted again, and a suitable-looking Kethane field identified, almost at sea-level, in the so-called Wu Crater just over the wall that surrounded the Hummingbird (If you squint a bit at the Scansat picture and tilt your head to the side a bit, does it not kind of look like the Wu-Tang Clan logo?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kXol7Qp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kXol7Qp.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LTEDXhJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LTEDXhJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb used the Hopper to scout out the flattest landing site he could find.

The height, from what I recall, what a result of the fact that I hadn\u0027t worked out how to use fuel lines to link the Kethane tank/converter with the fuel tanks (turns out you have to use them backwards), and also because I wanted lots of room for the crew to hang out in- they were, after all, going to be cooped up for looong time.

I would just put SAS on, point the nose up about 15 degrees, speed up time-warp to 4x, and wait. After about 5 minutes, the curvature of the planet would force the nose up to about 30 degrees.

There\u0027s loooads of them, 4 pairs in all. These just about allow the Hopper to reach 6,000 meters on Duna. Having many shorter wings (rather than two long ones) and having them perched on top of an i-beam means that they are unlikely to strike the ground in the (inevitable) rough landings that you get on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover wheels were chosen over the more robust aeroplane landing gear to allow a bit of roving where the plane couldn\u0027t fly. The tyres tend to burst when the plane approaches 100m/s on the ground, but as I didn\u0027t plan on landing that fast (the thing barely flies faster than that) it wasn\u0027t a problem. When it was in its spaceplane \u0027cradle\u0027 leaving Kerbin it didn\u0027t take off until it was going over 100 m/s, which is why Kenfield needed to be sent up to fix them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve got two electric engines, mounted in-line to each other. I\u0027m not sure if that would be a help or a hindrance in the real world (I imagine that a propeller causes lot of \u0027dirty\u0027 air behind it) but KSP\u0027s aerodynamics engine doesn\u0027t seem to have a problem with this as far as I can tell. These are powered by 10 solar panels, and also 2 RTGs (I think- unless I\u0027ve hidden any more somewhere). Due to Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere, these are sufficient to power the engines indefinitely, which was a nice surprise. (Actually, at a high enough altitude on Kerbin the plane can fly indefinitely too, but it\u0027s a bit tricky to get up to that altitude in the first place...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERounding it off, we have air brakes that barely do anything in Duna\u0027s atmosphere (switching the engines to run backwards using action groups is a far more effective method of slowing down), and a pair of lights that (before I noticed that Scansat will tell you how far above ground level you are) can be used to indicate when the plane is close to the ground. If you see two pools of light on the ground, then that means you\u0027re about to crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop speed is about 110m/s, and it handles like a pig.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, back to our intrepid astronauts.

Jeb wanted to call it \u0027Enald\u0027s Big Head\u0027, but Enald felt that would somewhat lower his stock in the academic community. They also spent the night there, camped out under the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next morning, after taking breakfast through a straw (they couldn\u0027t open their space helmets, after all) they set off pretty much due south for the penultimate leg of their journey. This would be the furthest south they had gone yet. No-one had bothered [read: I hadn\u0027t bothered] comparing the latitude of the last anomaly with the latitude of the southern ice cap, so Jeb had no idea if a snow-based landing was on the cards. It wasn\u0027t long before he discovered that it was:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fCH043o.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fCH043o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnald: \u0022Wow!

Which means that the ground is over three kilometres high. And we\u0027re not even above the snow-line yet, or whatever you want to call it. I don\u0027t want to try and land us on this ice unless I absolutely have to. In fact, I\u0027m not sure we\u0027ll even be able to land near the next anomaly.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rWRW3Zz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rWRW3Zz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnald: \u0022Are we there yet?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: \u0022Very funny.

He still found no answer at all as to what made it glow though. The team took various measurements, and then decided to head back to base so they could finally take their spacesuits off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MqySCJS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MqySCJS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs they were flying east, they flew into the night, but decided to just keep going. They started off pointing directly east (as it\u0027s a quicker journey going east near the poles than it would be near the equator), but the curvature of the planet kept pushing them north- which at least kept Jeb alert through the long hours of flying. When they were almost directly south of Wu Base, they turned north again, and were soon home. After the horrors of the south pole, it was a relief to have a simple flat landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s pretty much it. The team stayed on Duna for months after this, spending their time (I would imagine) documenting the anomalies and trying to find the source of that strange glowing light (it does reflect Kerbal by the way, as the light moves as the day progresses). At the end of their mission [read: when I remembered they were still there] the crew set off for home. The Hummingbird had plenty of fuel left when it got back to Kerbin orbit- which just goes to show how much fuel I burnt up making the hop from one landing site to another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks for reading, and I hope it wasn\u0027t too painful!
