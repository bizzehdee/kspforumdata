Specifically I would like to see:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* All scientific parts having a \u0022monitor\u0022 function to allow a KAL logic tests of their particular function to be \u0022armed\u0022: e.g. if temperature \u0026gt; value then...; if pressure \u0026gt; value then... etc. This would allow interesting functionality beyond simple parachute deployment on re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Lights or solar panels having a secondary function of \u0022report value\u0022 of light shining in them, which could result in e.g. doors which open when a torch is shone on them; solar panel mounts (not just the panels themselves) which can be made to orient toward (or away from) the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Wheels or landing legs which can be used to \u0022weigh\u0022 objects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do community members here think? Is there a wider debate to be had on space engineer / Minecraft like functionality regarding part interaction? Or is that an unnecessary distraction for a team already under the kosh trying to build a project under too much time pressure...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"idamoofus","CreatedById":170167,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-22T03:23:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably a cool idea for a later feature update, maybe a couple years down the line.
