I upgraded from 2.2c to 2.7 today, and all of my ribbons were gone. I checked the halloffame.ksp file and it\u0027s fine. Tested a few different saves, all the same. I tried to force a new halloffame.ksp file by backing mine up and removing it. No file was made at all, despite the logs. I added another mod (TAC Life Support) today, so tried without that one installed. Still nothing.\u003Cp\u003EI \u0022reverted\u0022 to 2.3b to see if that worked, and it does. All the ribbons in place. I\u0027m on a Mac, which used to have the filepath bug, but the logs are pointing to the right file. I\u0027m out of ideas, and I really would like those custom ribbons!

Assigning a custom ribbon at the space center (i.e. not in a mission), may work or not. I have tested it and it works for me, but I\u0027m not quite sure if it will work in any situation. The problem is, that game time wont proceed in this state and the ribbon were assigned AFTER the last save. Loading the last save game will then revert the time and ribbons, too.
