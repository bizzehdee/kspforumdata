I didn\u0027t even plan this, it just happened as I went while testing a new computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI designed a space shuttle but my old laptop didnt have enough power to actually play it. With my new computer I finally could tweak it and make it fly right, so I did, made it kind of landable/flyable, and got it to orbit. After, I decided it would be a shame not to test its on orbit abilities - So I launched a target to use as cargo, picked it up, tangled with the Physx engine trying to spin me to death after grappling, and finally... well you\u0027ll see as you read on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShuttle in hanger\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a180/manmuppet/screenshot75.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot75.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShuttle on orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a180/manmuppet/screenshot49.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot49.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Retro\u0022 The target rocket.
