Then this is the plane for you. It flies at 50m/s with one wing missing! It uses a normal liquid fuel rocket engine, is capable of orbit with minimal effort, and might be able to get to the mun (Not tested).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo take off easily, start with ASAS on, start engines, and rapidly toggle ASAS on and off. The plane will naturally pitch up, and take off almost instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo land, put ASAS just above horizon, adjust as required. If one wing is lost, use roll and yaw in the opposite direction to maintain control. If all non delta wings are lost, land as you would with a standard c7 delta wing aircraft. Mods used are C7 aviation pack and NovaPunch 1.1\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
