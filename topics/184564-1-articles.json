The best way to get people back in the game is to make something new. Although I\u0027m loving that they are making mods like infernal robotics a supported function of the game, it doesn\u0027t change the fact that a lot of us have been using those features for years. Same with the deployable experiments. everything added since the late stages of early access have been mods with the exception of their first dlc (which felt more like a groundwork than an actual feature in my book). With that said, there is one area of the content market that hasn\u0027t been touched, career mode and science mode. Besides for the rearrangement of the tec tree and the addition of a few new missions here and there, not much has changed. I\u0027ve also thought the way these features have been implemented seemed a little shallow. What I want to suggest is a new overhaul for these two modes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first part of this is looking at how it works in the real world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Continuing the comment the next day. Thought I would post it up here to avoid confusion)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblems with science:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0 In real life, there isn\u0027t the direct correlation seen in ksp between science as we see it in the game and the advancements made in technology. The relationship in real life is 90% of the time closer to finding new problems we have to solve. This is never a problem in ksp because we are given all the information about all the star, all the planets and everything in between. what is the point of bringing a barometer to a planet where you already know everything about its atmosphere? In the real world, we had tests to see if space was a vacuum, we had to run many tests to see if we could pressurize a capsule, and we had little idea about any of the stuff we know until we sent something there to test it (Think about our recent visit of Pluto).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblems with technological advancements:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 The other problem with how career mode/science mode was made was almost systemic. I feel like what was implemented wasn\u0027t there original gameplan. I\u0027ve come to this conclusion because of how little their parts actually fit into the tec tree idea they have implemented. The tec in the game was not designed to go into a tec tree. For the most part, the \u0022tec level\u0022 is based on the size of a part and not actually how much knowledge was needed to build it. What I want to see is the implementation of iterative designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy solution:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Basically, you start out with a lot of junk parts. These parts look bad, don\u0027t work well, probably fail in environments outside of Kerbin sea level, and for good measure, have a base fail chance. Along with taking missions to study your solar system (of which you know nothing about), you would also take missions from your science team to help them improve your parts. unlike the test missions given off now. These missions would give you credits towards upgrading our parts. Along with these missions to give you credits. there would be general things like allowing engines to work in a vacuum, water, restart, throttle, etc. (All things we had to learn, and are still learning, in the field). This science would be collected by doing things like the barometric test and temperature tests we see in KSP today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA good way to think of this is the first capsule ou send to space should always be empty. It needs to be tested first. Without things like this, this game is missing out on some of the best parts of our job in exploring the world and beyond!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblems with Career \u0026amp; the suggested improvements:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 The main problem with the career is how lightweight it really is. There is very little to it, and it\u0027s hard to actually mess up. This is fine for some, but I think a lot of us were originally hoping for a bit more. A lot of what makes career modes great is the management. You need to be able to see your expenses and take risks. Squad tried to implement this before launch with that one building no one ever clicks on but it really doesn\u0027t work that well. a career mode should revolve around time and funds managment. You should see how much it costs to maintain a team of engineers as well as how long it takes to build a rocket. An alarm clock and construction time should be implemented. You should be able to speed up the construction of a craft with part failure chance going up. you should be able to fire staff to lower your costs and hire them as needed. There should be a monthly/yearly expense report. These features would go a long way to making career mode a better mode. A few more ideas would be including things like kerbal konstructs, allowing you to spend money to build more launch pads as well as just more infrastructure.\u00A0 I don\u0027t like that particular mod too much because of how messy it looks but a lighter version of it could go a long way. The main point I would say is to look at a game like X-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E. It has a solid management system that would work beautifully in a game like KSP. even the kerbal upgrade sstem could be improved along the same lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-20T04:52:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2019 04:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by kirmie44\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EContinuation of previous thought that was originally cut off when i got logged out\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kirmie44","CreatedById":73929,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-18T03:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis deleted my next comment so if people are interested, please post your ideas!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EasyAce","CreatedById":62958,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-18T07:21:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if your post has been finished?

I almost always play career and it\u0027s\u00A0a lot of fun, but for sure it could use a push. Squad\u0027s also done some great work in the last year and my list is a lot shorter than it used to be. There are a few science improvements I\u0027d love to see (agreed with 5thHorseman\u00A0on automating or at least consolidating much of the clicking and making most if not all results 100% on recovery) but I\u0027ll postpone comment on the rest until we see what Breaking Ground has in store.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I love that we\u0027ve gotten deltaV readouts, burn time and flight info improvements in vanilla.

It just feels arbitrary and contrived. As many have suggested it would be much better to put size constraints on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and weight constraints on the launchpad and leave it at that. Those size/weight numbers could also be tighter, especially in hard mode. Another thing that would help would be a series of strategies available in the Admin building that would let players directly control the types of generated contracts that come up. So for instance you could set your level of commitment to tourism contracts or satellite or base building contracts and that\u0027s what would most often pop up for you in Mission control.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) The main thing though would be to do some serious work on the Story-line contracts.\u00A0Right now the limitations on these contracts are so flaky almost all players break them and the progression ends without them even realizing it.\u00A0There needs to be a simple, persistent progression of main-line missions that lends itself to open-ended exploration. We\u00A0could probably also benefit from little bit of restructuring of the UI\u00A0in Mission control.

As you leave Kerbin and explore the Mun \u002B Minmus more tabs would open up so players could essentially go anywhere they want, get the Milestone reward, and tack on other side-quest contracts like resource extraction or conducting science in a specific place if they wished.

There is very little to it, and it\u0027s hard to actually mess up. This is fine for some, but I think a lot of us were originally hoping for a bit more. A lot of what makes career modes great is the management. You need to be able to see your expenses and take risks. Squad tried to implement this before launch with that one building no one ever clicks on but it really doesn\u0027t work that well. a career mode should revolve around time and funds managment. You should see how much it costs to maintain a team of engineers as well as how long it takes to build a rocket. An alarm clock and construction time should be implemented. You should be able to speed up the construction of a craft with part failure chance going up. you should be able to fire staff to lower your costs and hire them as needed. There should be a monthly/yearly expense report. These features would go a long way to making career mode a better mode. A few more ideas would be including things like kerbal konstructs, allowing you to spend money to build more launch pads as well as just more infrastructure. \u00A0I don\u0027t like that particular mod too much because of how messy it looks but a lighter version of it could go a long way.

What is the core experience that makes it fun and keeps players returning for hundreds if not thousands of hours? Ultimately I think the answer to this is simple: \u003Cstrong\u003Ebuilding rockets (and other contraptions) and flying them to other planets. \u003C/strong\u003EThat engineering puzzle is what keeps us all coming back over and over and everything else about the game should reenforce and dramatize that experience rather than distracting or drawing attention away from it. That\u0027s why mechanics like communications, reentry heat, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E add so much to the game, whereas science at present falls a little flat. The idea of creating biomes and gathering points that unlock more and more parts is a good incentive process, but the actual played experience in the field ends up being more repetitive clicks than thoughtful engineering or piloting. We place all the applicable experiments on our vessel and hotkey them if we\u0027re smart, then on the surface its just matter of hitting a few buttons. Worse, if we want those \u0022near above\u0022 recordings we\u0027re spending time dismissing half a dozen science readouts during landing or takeoff when we should be focusing on that core experience of flying. Hopefully some of the changes made in Breaking Ground will expand and make that experience more gratifying, but consolidating the clicky UI would be just as important. We\u0027ll have to wait and see.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI do like in principle the idea of part upgrades, but these upgrades really aught to be fairly minor, squeezing out little bits of efficiency late in the game. The reason for this is early in the game you still need parts that work. Part failure might be fun for some, but I think most folks will find it frustrating when a mission that took hours to plan and launch ends abruptly\u00A0because a dead battery bricks their lander in the middle of descent. Most people will solve this by putting redundant backup parts on their vessels which will bloat part count. In general I just think the Apollo 13 type gameplay is better left to Making History\u00A0mission builder scenarios.\u00A0I do quite like the idea that experiments could yield some other type of value to players besides science points though and maybe\u00A0upgrades could be part of that.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also quite like the idea of adding some form of KCT to the game\u00A0so long as there was some kind of scaleable backstop or counter-incentive\u00A0so players weren\u0027t just time-warping through it. The reason for this again is to keep things focused on the core fun of building and flying rockets. Having to consider trade-offs between long flight-duration, high-reward missions and quick-and-dirty ones or whether to build a low-tech rocket now or wait to build a higher-tech one later does bear directly on engineering and flight, but just clicking on the time-warp button and watching \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E flash from day to night over and over because that\u0027s what the game makes you do doesn\u0027t. It\u0027s also the reason I might caution against going too heavy on the management simulator angle. It\u0027s one thing to manage our pool of kerbalnauts and building up their skills--those are things that expand the in-flight experience and the planning that goes into it. Faceless engineers and ground\u00A0crew are little harder to get invested in and are probably better left abstracted in research and vessel costs. We do though\u00A0have other launch sites, so integrating and developing those and possibly others around kerbin could be cool. (Im not such a fan of off-world launch-sites personally. It\u0027s one thing to mine fuel on the Mun, but I don\u0027t think building rockets or machinery from raw materials on other worlds will be\u00A0realistic for a long, long time.)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-20T15:33:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2019 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-20T18:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny meaningful improvement in career mode would require a ground up replacement of science, tech tree, and the entire \u0022contract\u0022 paradigm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGut it, and start over from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, ask, then answer the question, \u0022What is the goal of career mode?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything else follows from this, and should accomplish the goal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne answer is, \u0022Provide the player with a \u003Cem\u003Estory\u003C/em\u003E of space exploration as done by their own program.\u0022 The story is just their missions, successes and failures, etc, but instead of seeming like random events, they make sense as an arc to the player.

As Pthigrivi said, such aspects of the game would serve as a distraction from the main goal of the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI love the idea of being able to slightly improve the parts that have already been researched. I too came up with this notion when I was fantasizing about the possible improvements of the game. Something along the lines of improving the heat resistance of your nose cones by something like a 3 % margin, decreasing the weight of certain parts by a percent or two or increasing the structural strength and stability of specific parts ever so slightly. These changes could be very costly - both in funds and science - to provide some attractive end-game goals while not rendering the early game unplayable nor the late game overpowered and boring. Having these features locked until the whole tech tree is done might be also taken into consideration. Otherwise, the idea of faulty parts would IMHO cause more anger and frustration than joy of excessive realism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA \u0022fog of solar system\u0022 -\u00A0generally just the idea of not knowing exactly the parameters of the other celestial bodies - is not a bad one. However people who would appreciate this feature the most are I imagine pretty much just the veterans of the game who can tell you the average temperature 5000 m above Laythe\u0027s\u00A0surface from the top of their heads (hyperbole, yay!) and to them such a concept would be pretty useless. Also, what it would mean in practice is just having to send\u00A0one more unmanned space probe to the place before you start building your space hotel and casino there (looking at you, Matt Lowne!). I cannot decide if all the effort of introducing this new feature would actually pay off in actual fun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am currently in a mid-game of my second career play through, and before I started, I decided to make things interesting. I use many mods; outer solar system to add some significant challenge for the end game, and the community tech tree to make the end game flights worth while. I use the life support mod (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E?) in conjunction with planetary base systems and deep freeze. I have plenty of new parts from OPT, Mk2 Expansion, Nuclear age by Porkjet and some other ones. What these mods have in common is they provide a ton of beautifully crafted and functional parts, while not being too overpowered (unlike for example Near Future Technologies, which is IMHO tremendously overpowered). I also took the liberty of adjusting the properties of some of the most powerful parts provided by mods, lowering their stats and make them much more balanced with the stock parts, and then I scattered these parts all over the rather large tech tree provided by CTT mod. I have turned the G-force limit on,\u00A0given up the option to revert flight OR quickload the game in case I goof up. I can tell you, with all these changes, KSP feels like a completely different game as of now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTLDR; The career mode is not too bad, and if you know how to improve and rebalance it with mods, your experience can be as fresh as playing a completely new game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-20T18:47:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2019 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aelipse\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kirmie44","CreatedById":73929,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-21T05:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223602052\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184564\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221558364962\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do like in principle the idea of part upgrades, but these upgrades really aught to be fairly minor, squeezing out little bits of efficiency late in the game. The reason for this is early in the game you still need parts that work. Part failure might be fun for some, but I think most folks will find it frustrating when a mission that took hours to plan and launch ends abruptly\u00A0because a dead battery bricks their lander in the middle of descent. Most people will solve this by putting redundant backup parts on their vessels which will bloat part count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do quite like the idea that experiments could yield some other type of value to players besides science points though and maybe\u00A0upgrades could be part of that.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also quite like the idea of adding some form of KCT to the game\u00A0so long as there was some kind of scaleable backstop or counter-incentive\u00A0so players weren\u0027t just time-warping through it. The reason for this again is to keep things focused on the core fun of building and flying rockets. Having to consider trade-offs between long flight-duration, high-reward missions and quick-and-dirty ones or whether to build a low-tech rocket now or wait to build a higher-tech one later does bear directly on engineering and flight, but just clicking on the time-warp button and watching \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E flash from day to night over and over because that\u0027s what the game makes you do doesn\u0027t. It\u0027s also the reason I might caution against going too heavy on the management simulator angle. It\u0027s one thing to manage our pool of kerbalnauts and building up their skills--those are things that expand the in-flight experience and the planning that goes into it. Faceless engineers and ground\u00A0crew are little harder to get invested in and are probably better left abstracted in research and vessel costs. We do though\u00A0have other launch sites, so integrating and developing those and possibly others around kerbin could be cool. (Im not such a fan of off-world launch-sites personally. It\u0027s one thing to mine fuel on the Mun, but I don\u0027t think building rockets or machinery from raw materials on other worlds will be\u00A0realistic for a long, long time.)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv title=\u0022Found 5 errors in text\u0022\u003E\n5\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love that you\u0027re on board!

As you rightly point out finding some kind of check\u00A0to so players have to think twice before time-warping to get rewards is kind of the devil on the tightrope here. The idea\u00A0(as with all good game mechanics) is to create forks--points for a player to make strategic decisions that effect the future of the game and spur\u00A0cost/benefit analysis. There there are two ways to implement the\u00A0cost in this equation--either on the front end with a time-based cost like monthly budgets, or on the back end with some form of reward drop-off. The trouble with the front end is that players of KSP have very different play-styles--some like to do a lot around KSOI, some like to fly around with planes, others like to send deep space probes and others like to jump as soon as they can to building bases on other planets. Monthly budgets get very difficult to scale for these players because each has a very different demand for time-warp. Its one thing to pay monthly bills if you\u0027re replenishing your coffers with lots of short-duration missions around KSOI, but a player who wants to send a probe out to Jool will find themselves quickly bankrupt. Thats why I think the time-based cost really has to come on the back-end with contract rewards so that each\u00A0can be directly scaled to the duration of the mission.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor illustration let\u0027s think about a typical career save.\u00A0First you want to get to orbit. This could take just an hour of in-game time, but perhaps this is extended a bit by construction time on your first couple of vessels. Next come\u00A0the Mun and Minmus which take a couple of days and about 20 days round-trip respectively, but again would take longer in total if you\u0027re investing time in research and construction or sneaking in some terrestrial exploration with planes.\u00A0What you\u0027d really want to do with construction and research time is scale things so that players could reasonably run a few to several crewed missions to each moon and unlock the first 3-4 tiers in the tech tree before the first Duna window opens up on day 236. If however those main Milestone missions to fly-by and land on different planets and moons\u00A0had World First bonus rewards--say \u0022Land on and return from the Mun before day 50\u0022 or \u0022Flyby Duna by day 500\u0022 for a 50% boost in funds and reputation--players would have to think more carefully about how much time to invest in research before pulling the trigger without any of the budget-busting pitfalls incurred by legit time-warping with operational costs. The dates themselves could also be scaled directly to how long those missions would take round-trip factoring transfer windows so that there was a reasonable strategic choice to send probes deep into the Kerbol system as early as possible.\u00A0The other benefit to\u00A0calling them \u0022World Firsts\u0022 is it implies some of the things Tater is looking for--a kind of space-race with an unnamed competitor. This gives the benefits of a foil while allowing\u00A0players the leeway to interpret it as they will and create their own stories as they progress.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd honestly I think all of this could be phased into Vanilla through the normal update process just as communications and delta-v redouts were.
