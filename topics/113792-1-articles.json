The top 3 most experienced Kerbals headed for Duna on a return mission utilizing resource drilling and harvesting. Alas, the Kerbin launch phase used more fuel than expected and the refueling stop at Minmus ended in a crash. The craft was a write off but our heroes survived. The rescue mission was a going smoothly. The heroes boarded the hitchiker pod headed home ready for another attempt, then suddenly 1.0.3 was released. When I went to load my game the craft was all glitched. I could not control the craft or access my crew. The command module is glitchy and offset from the rest of the craft. Please help! I need to rescue this crew!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T15:54:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi PolybiusNightmare, please see the support stickies and upload your game logs and save files to dropbox \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EArgh, again with the bugs. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3asi15/uncontrollable_craft_kraken_fix/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETry this\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecon we could sticky this somewhere?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PolybiusNightmare","CreatedById":146779,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T17:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys!

It flies like a brick, and other than invoking System Restore there\u0027s nothing I can do to get all that mind-boggling amount of productively wasted time back.

In 1.0.2 I was getting a 30% payload fraction in just propellant on a really good ascent, and the best I\u0027ve done so far in 1.0.3 is maybe 24%.
