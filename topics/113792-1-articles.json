The top 3 most experienced Kerbals headed for Duna on a return mission utilizing resource drilling and harvesting. Alas, the Kerbin launch phase used more fuel than expected and the refueling stop at Minmus ended in a crash. The craft was a write off but our heroes survived. The rescue mission was a going smoothly. The heroes boarded the hitchiker pod headed home ready for another attempt, then suddenly 1.0.3 was released. When I went to load my game the craft was all glitched. I could not control the craft or access my crew. The command module is glitchy and offset from the rest of the craft. Please help! I need to rescue this crew!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T15:54:24Z","Content":"Hi PolybiusNightmare, please see the support stickies and upload your game logs and save files to dropbox ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:00:06Z","Content":"Argh, again with the bugs.

It flies like a brick, and other than invoking System Restore there\u0027s nothing I can do to get all that mind-boggling amount of productively wasted time back. WAAAHHHH!\n\n....Also too I can\u0027t seem to make orbit now with anywhere near the same amount of fuel, even if I change the design to adapt to the new regime. In 1.0.2 I was getting a 30% payload fraction in just propellant on a really good ascent, and the best I\u0027ve done so far in 1.0.3 is maybe 24%.
