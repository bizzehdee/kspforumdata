SCANsat assumes that pixels are square (that is, if the monitor\u0027s texture is 512x256, the monitor itself is twice as wide as it is tall) which wasn\u0027t the case on my test display. While it is possible in theory to correct for this, I am getting lost in the details, so I guess that\u0027s where I write up the manual and publish it as is. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for the same reason, I\u0027m not going to do projections of orbits either, if anyone\u0027s up to it, patches welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T05:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edoes this work for the IVA of the Mk III Cockpit?

You can have one prop containing multiple monitors on different transforms that look like they\u0027re one screen, it should work. If you just want to merge information from two pages, it\u0027s best to edit the page definition file instead.
