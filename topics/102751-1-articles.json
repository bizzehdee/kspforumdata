A very simplified perspective from the ag world: until GMOs came around, no one owned a patent on a seed variety. Farmers could buy seed from a company, produce a yield, sell what they wanted to whomever wanted to buy it or keep some for reseeding. With patents on some varieties, buying seed from a company becomes a contract to not only receive the seed but to buy back all yields without retaining any for reseeding. Each year is a new contract of buy, seed, reap, sell because they own the product they sell to farmers and the yields it produces.

The hard thing about a weed killer is that you want it to kill everything that is NOT the crop plant, but leave the crop untouched. One solution is to make GMO crops that are resistant to the specific brand of weed killer, and then sell that weed killer and that crop seed together. The problem comes from the fact that the weed killer can spread to neighbors\u0027 farms, thus forcing them to also be customers of the same company, buying the same seed, to keep their own crops from getting killed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing forced to use the same product that your neighbor is using is a monopoly problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo summarize - there is no scientific problem with GMO food.

Instead of using the traditionally fertile seeds from the previous year\u0027s harvest, they have to buy new GMO seed every year from the GMO industry. These contracts are typically paired with exclusivity deals on specially-engineered fertilizers, pesticides, and weed-killers that go with the GMO seed, which prevents farmers from using alternative products from other sources. Without those extra chemicals, GMOs are more fragile than traditional crops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese GMO seed contracts replace the traditional fertile crops that farmers have been using for centuries, especially in developing countries. Once the farmers have switched to GMOs, they are hooked and become dependant on the system with no turning back, because they can\u0027t switch back to the naturally fertile seeds from the previous year\u0027s harvest because they don\u0027t have them any more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only is it bad for biodiversity, it simply puts humanity\u0027s food chain into the hands of these corporations. If farmers want to opt out or if the corporations refuse to sell seed, then entire areas can be hit by famine. Stop shipping the GMO seeds and nothing grows. Those who don\u0027t buy into the GMO scheme are bullied and forced out of the market. And if a farmer gets caught with GMO crops from his neighbor\u0027s field, he can get sued by Monsanto for licensing, because of illegal use of a patented product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, replacing the huge variety of difference species of corn or wheat with the one or two standardized GMO crops is a huge loss in terms of food variety. In countries like France or Germany, there are hundreds of different types of traditional breads based on mixes of various cereals. If those traditional cereals disappear, you end up with a limited offering of US-style plastic-wrapped bread that all tastes the same. Yuck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same is true for Africa for example, where industrial GMO corn is replacing tradional mil. Not only this forces populations to change their eating habits, it also forces farmers to use crops that aren\u0027t necessarily the best for the climate or for local irrigation systems or water supplies. It also means that they are giving up their food production independence and their money flows out of the country and into the pockets of GMO corporations, causing more poverty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole scheme is evil to the bone.
