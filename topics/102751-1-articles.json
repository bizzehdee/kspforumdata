A very simplified perspective from the ag world: until GMOs came around, no one owned a patent on a seed variety. Farmers could buy seed from a company, produce a yield, sell what they wanted to whomever wanted to buy it or keep some for reseeding. With patents on some varieties, buying seed from a company becomes a contract to not only receive the seed but to buy back all yields without retaining any for reseeding. Each year is a new contract of buy, seed, reap, sell because they own the product they sell to farmers and the yields it produces. Doing this protects the patents (among other things) but it\u0027s a different world than it used to be.\n\nNinja edit: what Kibble said ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T00:56:44Z","Content":"The last two posts are practically reason enough to let the myth survive.

Drinking it is healthy, but breathing it isn\u0027t. Rivers are necessary for life... but a temporary river running where one normally doesn\u0027t is called a flood, and that\u0027s not so good for life.\n\nThere are some people who complain about GMO\u0027s for utterly ridiculous luddite reasons, akin to the stupidity of people using the word \u0022chemical\u0022 as a generic scare word (\u0022OMG this has chemicals in it!\u0022) forgetting that ANY molecular structure is a chemical, including water. They\u0027re wrong. But there are others who raise concerns over the legal issues surrounding trying to make self-replicating life organisms fall under intellectual property law, and some of those legal concerns are quite valid. \n\nOne legal concern is how some weed killers work in conjunction with GMO crops. The hard thing about a weed killer is that you want it to kill everything that is NOT the crop plant, but leave the crop untouched. One solution is to make GMO crops that are resistant to the specific brand of weed killer, and then sell that weed killer and that crop seed together. The problem comes from the fact that the weed killer can spread to neighbors\u0027 farms, thus forcing them to also be customers of the same company, buying the same seed, to keep their own crops from getting killed.\n\nBeing forced to use the same product that your neighbor is using is a monopoly problem.\n\nTo summarize - there is no scientific problem with GMO food. There is, however, a lot of legal concerns. It centralizes control in the hands of a few."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T01:09:31Z","Content":"What\u0027s bad about GMOs are the business models behind them and the fact that they are proprietary, patented, and sterile.\n\nGMO crops are engineered to be sterile, because the business model behind them is to make farmers dependant on yearly subscription supply contracts with GMO companies (Monsanto et al...). Instead of using the traditionally fertile seeds from the previous year\u0027s harvest, they have to buy new GMO seed every year from the GMO industry. These contracts are typically paired with exclusivity deals on specially-engineered fertilizers, pesticides, and weed-killers that go with the GMO seed, which prevents farmers from using alternative products from other sources. Without those extra chemicals, GMOs are more fragile than traditional crops.\n\nThese GMO seed contracts replace the traditional fertile crops that farmers have been using for centuries, especially in developing countries. Once the farmers have switched to GMOs, they are hooked and become dependant on the system with no turning back, because they can\u0027t switch back to the naturally fertile seeds from the previous year\u0027s harvest because they don\u0027t have them any more.\n\nNot only is it bad for biodiversity, it simply puts humanity\u0027s food chain into the hands of these corporations. If farmers want to opt out or if the corporations refuse to sell seed, then entire areas can be hit by famine. Stop shipping the GMO seeds and nothing grows. Those who don\u0027t buy into the GMO scheme are bullied and forced out of the market. And if a farmer gets caught with GMO crops from his neighbor\u0027s field, he can get sued by Monsanto for licensing, because of illegal use of a patented product.\n\nAlso, replacing the huge variety of difference species of corn or wheat with the one or two standardized GMO crops is a huge loss in terms of food variety. In countries like France or Germany, there are hundreds of different types of traditional breads based on mixes of various cereals. If those traditional cereals disappear, you end up with a limited offering of US-style plastic-wrapped bread that all tastes the same. Yuck.\n\nThe same is true for Africa for example, where industrial GMO corn is replacing tradional mil. Not only this forces populations to change their eating habits, it also forces farmers to use crops that aren\u0027t necessarily the best for the climate or for local irrigation systems or water supplies. It also means that they are giving up their food production independence and their money flows out of the country and into the pockets of GMO corporations, causing more poverty.\n\nThe whole scheme is evil to the bone. It only serves interests of Monsanto et al, and the short term interests of some farmers who don\u0027t look at the big picture. In the long-term, we all submit to the GMO industry and we all lose.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T01:31:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 01:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T01:15:29Z","Content":"Anther GMO: Humans.\n\nEvery human has on average about 100 random genetic mutations.
