I don\u0027t have enough data at the moment to fully support this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why going above terminal velocity is not that bad on your delta-v budget is because it reduces your gravity drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe total drag goes up because atmospheric drag goes up faster than gravity drag goes down, but the total doesn\u0027t go up that quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe faster you get into your gravity turn, the less total gravity drag you pay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, for many engines, the Isp is worse at lower altitude.

Going 2x terminal velocity only halves gravity drag, but it quadruples air drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as air/gravity drag is concerned, its a better to go slightly under terminal velocity than slightly over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could easily make an equation to show this, gravity drag being Ksub1*1/Velocity, and air drag being Ksub2*Velocity^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(assuming a 90 degree ascent)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as you point out \u0022The faster you get out of the soup, the better that engine performs.\u0022 - althought this isn\u0027t a consideration for the aerospike - but I don\u0027t think this is valid. You can have your engine performing under a certain ISP for 30 seconds, or 45 seconds, depending on your throttle.... but the 30 seconds isn\u0027t really better if you are burning more fuel in those 30 seconds than you would during the 45 seconds. You still go from 0 to x meters in altitude with your engine at Y ISP. Halving the time at that altitude, but doubling the fuel used per unit time, doesn\u0027t save any fuel (yes it saves gravity drag, but then loses air resistance). I think the speed for optimal deltaV is best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat it could affect, is at what altitude you start your gravity turn.... you\u0027d want to spend as little deltaV as possible in the lower atmosphere spending most of it to get higher, not faster horizontally-but given the KSP aerodynamic model, by the time you start your grav turn, your engines are all nearly at vacuum ISP anyway. You spend your dV to get higher to reduce air drag, the improved ISP is insiginficant in comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother point: especially as you get higher, you need a TWR of better than 2 to maintain terminal velocity, because it increases rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA TWR of 2 can maintain a fixed terminal velocity, but if you need to accelerate 1,000 m/s in 10 seconds to maintain an increasing terminal velocity, a TWR of 2 will not cut it... so you want something slightly better than 2, so you can not only maintain terminal velocity, but also accelerate to reach ever higher speeds, as TWR increases faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt low altitudes, you may need to accelerate 1 m/s to keep up with terminal (basically .1 G), at higher altudes, its more like 100 m/s (ie, 10 Gs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, packing enough engines on your upper stage to get a 10:1 TWR also means lifting a lot more mass... which is less optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut... once you start your gravity turn, you don\u0027t actually want to follow terminal velocity. You want gravity drag to equal air resistance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity drag is not Ksub1*1/Velocity, but rather sin(theta)*Ksub1*1/Velocity - as your velocity vector gets close to perpendicular, gravity drag starts getting lower (not even accounting for the strength of gravity getting weaker as you get higher, which is more apparent in KSP than real life).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you start your turn, you want to start lagging behind terminal velocity (and that at certain altitudes, terminal velocity is higher than escap valocity, should make this apparent)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... there are a lot of variables, and the answer would change depending on what engine you are using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least... thats how I figure it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-06T09:37:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2014 09:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T09:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer really depends on staging and what you are trying to achieve with the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use asparagus staging and want to maximize the payload fraction, the traditional wisdom is that TWR should be symmetrically around 2 during each stage.

My goal has been to maximize the payload for a given set of engines, instead of trying to maximize the payload fraction.

I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s almost never a good idea to throttle down with rockets like that, even if the it\u0027s flying well beyond terminal velocity. The climb rate starts falling as soon as the rocket drops the boosters, and keeps falling until orbital velocity reaches around 2000 m/s, so the climb rate at booster separation decides whether the rocket is going to reach orbit or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lancezh","CreatedById":56881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T10:23:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if that helps you but i usually use alot of Solid Fuel Boosters paired with Normal Engines in the middle that control the Thrust towards the optimal speed i want to achieve in every given atmosphere (say kerbin for examplessake).
