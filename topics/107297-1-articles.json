I was using Mk2 to Mk3 Adapters, And Mk3 Parts. I tried to save the vessel and the game locked up. After trying to do some verifying of files and re-downloading my entire GameData folder I realized that the corrupted .craft file I was working on actually deleted my entire Ships folder out of my directory. As a result I was not able to save or launch anything until I added in an empty Ships VAB and Ships SPH folders back into my KSP directory. Although I did resolve this bug, it did delete every single one of my craft files so its a pretty bad bug."}]}
