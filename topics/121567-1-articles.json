I\u0027m having a blast and just for the heck of it I landed my 25k DV ship on the Mun, which made me realize that its totally possible to make a mega mining ship that can go anywhere in the system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut...one problem...I can\u0027t seem to figure out how to mine hydrogen. I thought there would be a way to do it in Karbonite as that seems to be a complementary mod to Near future technologies but it seems there is no way to do this, and at least so far I haven\u0027t found the right mod by searching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo friends, whats the answer?
