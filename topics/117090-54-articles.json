So... what I might end up doing is dropping the LH2 patch, and moving that balance stuff over to the RealFuels patch/setup.

It can now build meshes, and is a lot easier to work with than the previous (current) system.  The previous system was hard-coded to support only a single vertical panel segment-per-mesh; straight walls, with some very odd UV mapping.  The new system supports arbitrary arc/ring based mesh creation; specify a set of radius\u0027 and heights, and it will build the mesh to meet those specifications.  UVMapping is very simple, and will be config-adjustable.  Still need to add in pivot/rotation support (for stuff like the SC-GEN-IPA), and code to generate proper convex colliders for arbitrary meshes (yep, about as complicated as it sounds... so...might take a few weeks; thankfully, I won\u0027t need this functionality until 1.1/unity5).\n\nThis new mesh generator will replace the one currently used to generate fairings, the petal adapter, and procedural decouplers, as well as being used on the new yet-to-be-created interstage decoupler/fairing (the one with built-in ullage engines).  The old generator, while being very reliable, was just not adaptable, expandable, or easy to use.\n\nThe reasons for creating a new mesh generator were:  \n\n1.) Add ability for bi-conic/tri-conic/whatever type fairings in the future (after 1.1, needs a GUI); the petal adapter and interstage decoupler will use an early minimial implementation of this ability.  Yes, in the future you will be able to make more complex engine/etc fairings.  \n\n2.) Allow for less confusing UV mapping setup.  The old setup was \u0027ideal\u0027 insofar as maintaining a non-distorted 1:1 texture ratio at a constant pixel density, however it resulted in being unable to use anything but a flat-color texture.... which removed all usefulness from the non-distorted mapping.  This will allow for texture options for the fairings / texture switching; and allow for proper use of various patterned textures.  Additionally, the UV mapping will now be config-adjustable; to allow for even more variance in texture use/re-use and configuration.  \n\n3.) Ease of maintenance and coding.  The old system was very hard-coded for a specific use-case (the petal-adapter), and had been bashed/mangled/kicked around in order to make it work for the other parts (fairings, decoupler).  The new system is designed with all of these potential use cases in mind, as well as doing all that is possible to not limit or hard-code anything.  Also took the opportunity to abstract-out some of the more head-scratching bits of code, like triangle-winding and quad creation from an arbitrary list of vertices (previously I had to figure out what order to enter the vertices in;  now I just feed the generator a list of verts and it does the rest).  \n\n4.) Expandability -- the new system is designed in such a way that adding new mesh-generator types should be relatively easy.  Want a cube-mesh-generator?  No problem.  Pointed-cone?  Yep, could do that.  Could potentially even expand some of the generators to use config-defined setups."},{"CreatedByName":"ComatoseJedi","CreatedById":91567,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T17:36:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 53 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Fairings - Not sure what you are referring to; the stock fairings -are- procedurally built (procedural means, in this context, that the mesh is created at run-time and does not use a precompiled model; e.g. the model is built using a run-time process, thus procedurally).

That is why all this information is important, and these little details matter.   \n\nNow that I know that stack-symmetry is involved, that tells me what the general cause likely is, and should be able to get it cleaned up in short order.\n\nEdit:  Have opened up an issue ticket for it for tracking: [https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues/142](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues/142)\n\nWill work on getting this cleaned up for this weekends\u0027 update.  No guarantees, but I\u0027ll see what I can do.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-07T17:31:50Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2016 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"}]}
