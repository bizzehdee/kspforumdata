I don\u0027t know if there is currently a way to modify/create actions groups post-launch, but that would be extremely helpful. I\u0027ve been working on a \u0022carrier\u0022 of sorts that brings two fighter space planes up to space, that can land and take off pretty much everywhere but Kerbin. But it has parachutes and jet/liquid e gines that I would really like action groups for (it is a spaceplane after all) and I would really like to modify those when I launch them from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"horndgmium","CreatedById":92543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T13:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBump please?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T14:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the first one, you can use the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/rcs-build-aid-v0-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERCS build aid\u003C/a\u003E mod, as well as helping with RCS, it also adds a \u0022dry CoM\u0022 so you can plan your planes easier.
