This first topic will very likely have a better formatting over time. The inspirational thread has categories for levels of education; I figure there are no such things as \u0027levels of work\u0027, but \u003Cem\u003Esome \u003C/em\u003Ecategorization is preferred over a long list of names and professions. I\u0027m open to suggestions!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I\u0027m creating this thread is that a lot of people here come from very different backgrounds, are at or past working age, and from the little I\u0027ve seen so far professions are all over the place; you\u0027d never know, but you just might have a buddy here who\u0027s a truck driver or a medical doctor or a fighter pilot. I certainly wouldn\u0027t expect everyone here to work on space-related subjects (if only for the reason that space-related jobs aren\u0027t so common), but it surely surprised me how many work on subjects entirely apart from science or technology!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, without further ado, I\u0027ll start: I\u0027m a data analyst, and I work for a healthcare provider. I\u0027ve been in this job for four years now, just recently moved to a different company, and I really like what I do. I develop indicators, figure trends, find problematic spots in annual price negotiations, and many specific odd reports, for which I enjoy a) discovering what data I have available on the subject, b) how do I get to process it into something meaningful and c) how do I present it in an engaging way, if possible with interaction. I\u0027ve also enjoyed learning about healthcare in the process, and working for a different company but in the same sector was a little joy I had this year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T22:25:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t want to fill the original post with my story, but rather keep it as a summary of the replies. So, here\u0027s the long version (for those interested; if you just want to reply with what you do that\u0027s perfectly fine!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve begun working on web design/database management, around 2004. It wasn\u0027t very satisfying, I worked mainly developing the website of a company that made pictures for events, and got some odd jobs from my boss\u0027s friends and such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne day, after having quit this position, a friend of my uncle (who\u0027s a video producer) asked me if I was available for some help, and then I got into video. It started small, I was at first helping him with the dirty work of digitizing tapes, but eventually I got to edit small scenes and he saw potential in me; over very little time I was the main editor of this documentary he was making, doing TV commercials, another documentary and some institutional videos (I\u0027m still really proud of the documentaries).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWork conditions and pay, however, weren\u0027t so great. In particular, my social life was suffering \u003Cem\u003Ea lot \u003C/em\u003Efrom my very erratic working hours, and I was at danger of failing my MSc (which happened eventually, anyway), so I had to drop it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring all this time, from time to time I did some odd illustrations. Some leaflets, some art for some videos I edited, ultimately for an \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.chaosium.com/terror-from-the-skies/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERPG book\u003C/a\u003E. I\u0027ve always enjoyed doing artistic work, but I felt underachieved for all the time I spent learning mathematics at the university.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, I landed at my current job, and have enjoyed it ever since. It\u0027s stressful at times, but that\u0027s grown-up life. I do math, I read a lot, I code a little, and I learn new things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T22:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a teenager, so I have none, but I\u0027d like to be a Aerospace engineer \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-20T00:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck coming up with a short (or even long, really) list of categories.
