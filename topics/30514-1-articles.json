Transiting b/w moons is another 8150 dv. I think the challenge is making the lander small enough that it can be moved and refueled by one transit/refueling vessel. Transiting, landing, and taking off from the other moons means you can\u0027t really stage the thing until Tylo. Oh, and I never fly less than 3 kerbals. Sending them solo brings the Space Madness, and if you\u0027re already at 2, why not 3? I like the added twist of mapping each moon, and bringing a rover too. There\u0027s a lot of ways to do it, I just wanted to know if it had been done before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-RanZ-","CreatedById":51892,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T20:26:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enot sure and unfortunately the forums were mostly nuked a few months back so any mission reports may be gone.

Vall, Bop, and Pol are all low enough gravity that you won\u0027t spend much fuel on the landings and ascents, and Laythe\u0027s descent will use very little fuel if you\u0027ve got wings and/or chutes. If you have something in orbit to refuel the lander for its transfer to the next body, the only real problems boil down to two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; Enough delta-V and TWR to land on and take off from Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; The ability to ascend on Laythe, as well as land on a good, stable point. Do NOT underestimate this one; if your design doesn\u0027t have wings, it\u0027s hard to pick a flat landing site, and the drag on ascent is not negligible. My Grand Tour had a horrible time ascending from Laythe, because it was just so hard to stay stable at the low speeds that the thick atmosphere required. (Well, Eve was worse, but that\u0027s hardly a shock.) It\u0027s for this reason that I design my spaceplanes to be capable of landing vertically, on their tails, in a vacuum; that way, I can make landers that can function on all the airless moons, as well as landing smoothly on Laythe, without having to maintain multiple designs. (The extra mass for jet engines and wings is fairly small.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that being said, you shouldn\u0027t be afraid to use the Kethane mod for this. Yes, it\u0027s a mod, which\u0027d offend purists, but it\u0027s a mod that\u0027s currently standing in for the stock resource system which\u0027ll be added within the next couple major revisions. The upcoming system is going to be much more complex than what the mod includes, with a half-dozen raw resources to manage and an additional refined fuel type (nuclear), but the basic principles will still hold: you\u0027ll be able to land on Laythe, extract hydrogen and oxygen from the ocean water and/or from the rocks, make rocket fuel, and take off with a full tank. You won\u0027t need much raw resource storage, if you\u0027re refining on-site, so the only real questions with the upcoming system will boil down to the specifics of the refining equipment (like are the modules small enough to mount on a lander, or are they so big that only orbital stations will be able to actually make the fuel?). So in a few versions, a grand tour (or Jool tour, in this case) using only \u0022stock\u0022 components is likely to be no different than doing it now using certain mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, upcoming versions are going to drastically change some relevant things, like the aerodynamics model used or the type of fuel nuclear engines consume. Some current stock designs will function VERY differently once those changes go in, so being wedded to a pure stock philosophy might cause you some serious problems down the road.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T21:28:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA Tylo-capable lander is ridiculous overkill for the other Julian moons, and also really difficult to do as a single-stage craft. My suggestion is to do a two-stage lander, with the upper stage able to operate independently to land on Laythe and return to orbit (meaning it can also handle all the smaller moons). Dock it to the \u0022Tylo descent stage\u0022 whenever you\u0027re ready for that landing and jettison it on the way back up, when it\u0027s empty, returning to the interplanetary craft with just the upper section, which can then continue on to any of the smaller moons you haven\u0027t visited yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-31T21:31:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2013 09:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tada","CreatedById":57283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T21:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly way how to do Laythe with style is an SSTO shuttle \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Some designs are so compact, that they don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t weight much more than equal lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T22:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to do Tylo is probably to abandon the idea of \u0022one ship\u0022 and have a smaller lander which you can undock/uncouple in orbit.
