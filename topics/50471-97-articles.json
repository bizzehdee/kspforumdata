I did finally get around to trying the output.png you derived from the MOLA data I sent over and I\u0027m disappointed to say that even with your enhancements, the area around Valles Marineris just refuses to gain any real definition. Sure the thing is huge and the slopes are not that steep on average, but an elevation gain of 10km, even across a distance of 20km, would be noticeable and significant. Unfortunately, all I get out of it is rolling, if large, hills. I\u0027ve been poking around in the in-game editor with your file as a base, but I just can\u0027t seem to get the desired result.

The way you have that text written, I\u0027m under the impression that the former defines the overall deformity imposed on the vertex multiplied by the simplex evaluations. Are those evaluations handled by other PQS mods, or is that something much simpler added as a basic noise?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the variation from black to white, I did go back and do a histogram stretch to use the full spectrum from 0-255 and it generally improved my output results. At this point, I really think you\u0027re right that KSP just takes the data at face value and then applies some kind of simple math to produce the PQS. After all, Squad are only really interested in high detail in a few specific areas (e.g. KSP), and they are responsible for generating the map anyway, so trying to account for a lack of variation in the input map doesn\u0027t seem like it would be high on their list of concerns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question for the ModifierRequirements line is less about whether all of the requirements are met for each of the stock PQS mods, but rather more about whether or not some part of the stock PQS system might be interfering with what we\u0027re trying to do because we haven\u0027t gotten around to supplying an alternative. What\u0027s got me curious is three lines I\u0027m seeing in the in-game PQS editor that seem like they have something to do with the terrain generation, but making changes to them doesn\u0027t seem to have an effect. Those lines are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EmapFilername = Duna3_\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EmapFilesize = 4096\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EmapMaxHeight = 10500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may be completely off base, but I have a theory that the issues I\u0027ve been having getting low-level terrain features to appear might be related to something like these (though not necessarily these) which has defined something specifically for Duna, but when you try to apply Mars information to something that\u0027s affected by them, they or overriding it somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m definitely excited to get at that new loader when its ready as I feel like it will definitely give us the tools to get all of this looking really good. I wonder if I could make a request about that if it\u0027s not going to be too hard. The Planet Factory CE has the ability to reload the config file from within the game, allowing you to make any edit and then view it in real time. I much prefer this to the in-game editor we\u0027re currently using as it allows you to modify multiple mods at once without having to rebuild before switching and also, I don\u0027t think the loading function of the in-game editor works at all. That all being said, if it\u0027s not something you\u0027re interested in doing, or if it would just be too hard or time intensive, don\u0027t worry about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T10:36:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpacedInvader\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpacedInvader\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question for the ModifierRequirements line is less about whether all of the requirements are met for each of the stock PQS mods, but rather more about whether or not some part of the stock PQS system might be interfering with what we\u0027re trying to do because we haven\u0027t gotten around to supplying an alternative.
