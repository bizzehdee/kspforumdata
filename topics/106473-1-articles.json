The dual engine setup overheats between 1:30 and 2:00, almost 100% of the time, regardless of whether I add smaller 1m fuel tanks in front or the precooler module, and even wings that should help cool it doesn\u0027t help either.\n\nI\u0027m at an end, and I can\u0027t figure out a solution while still using two engines for higher acceleration.\n\nI\u0027ve included pictures of the engine layout that I currently use.\n\n![screenshot551.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mooS3eYwmMA/VULuEYNdv2I/AAAAAAABP8o/S_Fl8wqY1AU/w1008-h567-no/screenshot551.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T03:14:54Z","Content":"This has been a problem with LV-Ns in general ever since 1.0. Current solutions include using a massive fuel tank as a heat sink, surrounding the engines with wings (the wings act as radiators), and/or bugging Squad to reduce the amount of heat generated by LV-Ns."}]}
