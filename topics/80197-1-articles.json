When an item of theirs is bought, the money goes in to their account. This account is used in conjunction with an algorithm to decide what parts and such they want tested. The test money is withdrawn from their account. Each part has a certain checklist of what speed and altitude it wants tested, and works these three values to find the ideal testing they want to ask you to do. I feel as if I explained this poorly but perhaps you will be able to understand what I am trying to suggest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yoha","CreatedById":108392,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T09:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI get the point, but I feel this is unnecessarily complicating things.

What about the Record Keeping Society, Sean\u0027s Cannery, Winterowl, ...? You then don\u0027t only have to manage your own bank account, but theirs too by buying stuff you don\u0027t need to give them money to do contracts for them again. Doesn\u0027t sound like a good idea to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T12:37:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe something a bit more abstract, like a stock market graph that just breaks down who you buy most of your parts from. Like Rockomax has a 43% market share of the space industry because you buy 43% of your parts from them. But recovered parts dont count towards it since if you recover it you arnt buying a new one. It doesnt make it finite but just adds a small layer or immersion. Not really going to change gameplay so its more of a late stage polish type thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T12:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t need to turn KSP into German economical strategy game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T13:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022biohazard15\u0022 data-cite=\u0022biohazard15\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe don\u0027t need to turn KSP into German economical strategy game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love that term - It actually fills me with some sort of pride, knowing I do like to play those games quite a lot too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yoha","CreatedById":108392,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T13:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022biohazard15\u0022 data-cite=\u0022biohazard15\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe don\u0027t need to turn KSP into German economical strategy game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou aroused my curiosity.
