What I mean by that is the forward part of the part is counted orientation wise as up, not forward, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help me fix this??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T11:08:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to General Addon Affairs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amphiprion","CreatedById":66426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T16:19:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is a version of the craft on the runway.. if the navball was in this picture, it would be indicating that I am facing vertically instead of facing just above the horizon...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ogc8x4p.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ogc8x4p.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Talisar","CreatedById":62035,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T16:32:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not certain, but I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be able to adjust that in the config. The \u0022forward direction\u0022 is along the direction that the y-axis is pointing when you export the model from unity. You may be able to use the \u0022rotate\u0022 options to change it, but that may just affect the orientation it appears in the hangar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other thing that I can think of is for you to try and incorporate a small probe core or docking port aligned in the direction that you want the forward vector to be, and use the \u0022control from here\u0022 right click option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
