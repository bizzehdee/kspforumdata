We are trying to get rest and you whippersnappers always go about ruining that day in and day out. Especially when they randomly EXPLODE right over our home. From what we hear, there are quieter (and less explosive) engines out there. I don\u0027t care if they ARE some form of voodoo witchcraft, anything is better then waking up to giant orange shards of metal splitting our building in half! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe thusly submit to you a challenge that even if difficult, should be possible. Create an aircraft capable of flying as far and/or high as possible, using ion engines only. Aside from initial boosts which may be provided by other sources up to 1km (rockets, carrier craft, rover wheels, whatever). I mean, it may just be impossible to actually do the take-off itself with ion alone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor rules/challenge points, lets see. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs said, you may use any power source to get the thing into the air to begin with, as long as that source is out of the equation before you get up to 1k height. You may use mod parts (a better electrical power source comes to mind, like a bigger nuclear generator or wings that have solar panels built into them), so long as they are balanced. Try to minimize whatever effects are involved with that glide glitch too, if that is still present. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther challenges if you want extra kudos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100 pts: Use only stock parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1-50 pts: Get to 1k altitude (stacks). So basically, if you reach 23k, you get 23 points. Yeah, that means you can get a point for just boosting yourself up to 1k as allowed, but its easier this way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E25 pts: Get into stable circular orbit of some sort. \u002B25 more pts if you can actually bring some sort of \u0022useful\u0022 payload with you and deploy it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50 pts: Actually take off from the runway using nothing but ion (I mean, it probably is impossible but may as well make it a challenge). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do we think its possible? Because of this scrapheap we threw together, which is capable of ALMOST doing it. And by scrapheap I mean a \u0022wow, I stopped making planes that noobish and inefficient after a half dozen or so designs\u0022 level of unrefined scrapful wonder. So basically, its an unrefined, likely inefficient scrapheap that also only uses stock parts to boot, and yet it is ALMOST able to stay straight level at low altitudes. And while I don\u0027t know the deal with the \u0022infiniglide\u0022 glitch or whether it still exists, the design doesn\u0027t use any of those canards people always mention, nor am I spinning the thing around or anything during the flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design as shown below basically is: batteries, ion engines, a LOT of those 45/min nuclear generators, a \u0022first stage\u0022 of a small tank, rocket and some sepetrons (a stage that reminds me of a wasp\u0027s abdomen section), a pair of pairs of wings, a lot of small 6-way cubes that are a pain to deal with, and a bunch of connector struts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P9MZ1mw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022P9MZ1mw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3Q4sd61.png\u0022 alt=\u00223Q4sd61.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, not the prettiest bird out there.
