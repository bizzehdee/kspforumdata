Since the RP is officially shut down forever on this forum, I figured I\\\u0027d better redirect my creative juices into a new aspect. And, seeing as I love to write and consider myself a decent author, I\\\u0027ve decided to type up a KSP-related short story. So, without further ado:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EJust a Day in the Life\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELaunch commencing in five, four, three, two, one...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027WAHOOOO!\u0027 Jebediah Kerman, known more commonly as Jeb, yelled enthusiastically as the shuttle rocketed into the air. All three of the ship\\\u0027s crewmembers were glued to their seats due to the high speeds they were travelling. Bill was desperately attempting to keep the rocket steady, while Bob was passed out and snoring in his seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027For the record, this was a \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E bad idea,\u0027 Bill muttered, punching flashing buttons with one hand while controlling the rocket with the other. \u0027I mean seriously, Jeb, what made you think a rocket made entirely out of solid boosters was a good idea?\u0027 Bob snored in agreement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I still stand by my choice,\u0027 Jeb responded, donning the sunglasses he always kept in his spacesuit. \u0027What could be better than flying through the air at hundreds of meters per second with no control whatsoever over your thrust? Just sounds like a good time to me.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Just come help me with this thing,\u0027 Bill said, exasperated. \u0027I need you to steer while I keep it from overheating.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Whatever.\u0027 Jeb lazily reached over and pressed a random button. Immediately a decoupler activated, pinning the command module to a now un-steerable hunk of randomly placed rocket boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Wrong button!\u0027 Bill screamed. \u0027That was the emergency ejector! We were only supposed to use it \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E the boosters ran out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob finally woke up. \u0027Where the heck am I?\u0027 he asked, then looked out the window and saw that he was in an uncontrollable rocket hurtling through the air at breakneck speed. \u0027Oh, right, it\\\u0027s Tuesday.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Ah, Tuesday,\u0027 Jeb reminisced. \u0027The only day those boring scientists let me make my own shuttles. I love Tuesdays.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Hello!\u0027 Bill yelled. \u0027Trying to keep us alive over here! A little help would be appreciated!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yeah, yeah, yeah,\u0027 Jeb responded. \u0027Just relax. Even if we die, they\\\u0027ll just clone us and we\\\u0027ll be right back where we started.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust then, the rocket\\\u0027s SRBs finally depleted, and the shuttle began to decelerate. Bob looked over to the altitude meter and gasped. \u0027Hey guys, look, we made it out of the lower atmosphere this time!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Woo!\u0027 Jeb punched his fists in the air. \u0027New record!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Now, how are we going to get back \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E?\u0027 Bill said. \u0027I hope you didn\\\u0027t \\\u0027forget\\\u0027 the parachute again like last time.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027No, I didn\\\u0027t forget it,\u0027 Jeb said, looking annoyed. \u0027Have a little bit more faith in me, will you? I knew you\\\u0027d be worried, so I took the parachute off the top of the pod and set it inside for safekeeping.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Jeb?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yeah?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027THE PARACHUTE NEEDS TO BE ON TOP TO ACTIVATE, YOU IDIOT!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Whoa, Bill,\u0027 Jeb replied. \u0027I don\\\u0027t know where this new angry side is coming from, but I don\\\u0027t like your attitude. We\\\u0027ll be \u003Cem\u003Efine\u003C/em\u003E.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027It\\\u0027s a good thing I installed a backup parachute when Jeb wasn\\\u0027t looking!\u0027 Bob pulled a remote out of his spacesuit. It only had one button on it, labeled \u0027open parachute.\u0027 There was also a warning label, stating to keep the remote out of reach of toddlers and Jebediah at all times. Bob pushed the button, and just as the shuttle began to fall back to earth the parachute deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027We\\\u0027re saved!\u0027 Bill rejoiced, smiling. \u0027We\\\u0027ll live after all!\u0027 He began to prepare the pod for landing, steadying it and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Fine,\u0027 Jeb said, \u0027But Bob, I\\\u0027m going to have a serious talk with you after we land.\u0027 He looked thoughtful for a moment, then sprang up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I almost forgot!\u0027 Jeb told the others. \u0027I installed an experimental engine on the command module!\u0027 He reached for a large red button with the word \u0027DANGER\u0027 above it. Immediately after he pressed it, there was a \u003Cem\u003EBOOM\u003C/em\u003E and everything went black.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo hours later, Jeb, Bill and Bob stepped out of the cloning vats, looking refreshed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yeah, let\\\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E do that again,\u0027 Bill said, and Bob nodded agreement. \u0027Maybe leave shuttle design to the professionals, Jeb?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Are you kidding?\u0027 Jeb replied. \u0027That was the most awesome time ever! In fact, I have a few more ideas, most of them involving moar boosters. Believe me, next Tuesday is going to be awesome!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that, he bounded off towards the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EJust Another \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMun\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Edane Mission\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Oh, you\\\u0027ve got to be kidding me...\u0027 Bill Kerman rubbed his fingers against his temples, fighting off a headache as he viewed the speed gauge. \u0027Jeb, what the heck did you get us into?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb, Bill and Bob were currently flying at thousands of meters per second, hurtling towards the Mun at extremely dangerous speeds. They were on a Mun landing mission, but at this point it seemed more likely that they\\\u0027d become a new crater on the Mun\\\u0027s surface. Bob was screaming his head off, Bill was desperately attempting to steer the craft, and Jeb was relaxing in his seat and drinking a milkshake he had snuck onboard. So just an average expedition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I don\\\u0027t get why you guys don\\\u0027t see the genius behind my ideas,\u0027 Jeb countered. \u0027Turning an old fuel tank into a decoupler worked perfectly; the tank exploded, separating us from the other stages, just like it was supposed to.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Except for the part where it caught on fire too early,\u0027 Bill retorted. \u0027And then blew up our orbit stage, as well as mangling our landing stage. What are we supposed to do now?!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\u0027 Bob said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Exactly, Bob,\u0027 Jeb replied. \u0027I\\\u0027m glad you see it my way. All we have to do is slingshot around the Mun, then around Minmus, launching us into an orbit around Kerbol until we ultimately end up back in an extremely high orbit around Kerbin, at which point we\\\u0027ll just deorbit until we end up back in a sub-orbital trajectory towards the Mun.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Wouldn\\\u0027t that just leave us where we started?\u0027 Bill asked. \u0027We\\\u0027re already in - Oh my god, only fifty thousand meters above the Mun and still going nearly five kilometers per second.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob passed out from fright, collapsing onto his chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Look, just give me the controls,\u0027 Jeb said. \u0027I hid some miniature rocket boosters in the rocket just in case of this issue.\u0027 He reached under the control panel and pressed a small, inconspicuous button. Immediately, windshield wipers began to sweep across the windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Wrong button!\u0027 Bill yelled. \u0027Forty thousand meters, and our speed\\\u0027s still increasing!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yeah, yeah,\u0027 Jeb muttered. He pressed a huge, extremely conspicuous button, and immediately a few tiny SRBs began to fire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027How did that solve our problem?\u0027 Bill asked, annoyed. \u0027We\\\u0027re just going faster towards our deaths!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb pulled down on the pitch, slowly moving the navball\\\u0027s indicator upwards. \u0027See? No problemo. We\\\u0027ll just fly low around the Mun until the SRBs run out, and then hit the ground on the wheels I installed while the engineers were sleeping.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA crackly voice emanated from the communications radio. \u003Cem\u003E\u0027Bzzt... You did what?\u0027\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Erm, nothing,\u0027 Jeb said. \u0027Definitely not wheels to ride around the Mun\\\u0027s surface or anything.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Mission control!\u0027 Bill yelled. \u0027We could use some help!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0027Bzzt... Oh, relax, Bill. We\\\u0027re getting the cloning vats ready as we speak.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Nice to see you have a lot of faith in us,\u0027 Bill muttered, then his eyes widened as he viewed the altitude meter. \u0027Ten thousand meters! Jeb, how\\\u0027s that idea of yours coming?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Got it!\u0027 The nose suddenly pitched upwards, barely missing a giant arch that the rocket passed. The SRBs finally died down, and the craft began to fall towards the Munar surface. \u0027Now THIS is what I\\\u0027m talking about!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe broken landing engine suddenly broke off the main body of the craft, and wires and pieces of small debris began to make a trail of sparks and metal. It also woke Bob up, who groaned as he looked out the window\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027We\\\u0027re not going to last much longer in this state,\u0027 Bill said. \u0027Soon this whole thing\\\u0027s going to fall apart.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Relax, I\\\u0027m landing...\u0027 The craft had leveled out, but it was still going at an extreme speed. \u0027You all need to relax. We\\\u0027ll be \u003Cem\u003Efine\u003C/em\u003E.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Hey, guys...?\u0027 Bob was rummaging at the back of the command module. \u0027I think I found a remote for a retro rocket back here.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Really? Activate it!\u0027 Bill said excitedly. \u0027We might have a chance of living!\u0027 He lunged for the button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Aw, come on, Bill,\u0027 Jeb said. \u0027Why do you have to be such a killjoy? I can land this thing myself, thank you very much.\u0027 And with that, the craft rumbled onto the Mun\\\u0027s surface. There was a huge jolt, and Bill and Bob were thrown against the floor of the command module. The craft flipped over multiple times, before finally coming to rest on its side in a crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027WAY too close, Jeb,\u0027 Bill muttered angrily. \u0027And how are we supposed to get home?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027That is a good question,\u0027 Jeb said, although he didn\\\u0027t look very worried. \u0027But don\\\u0027t worry, I brought plenty of Mountain Dew for everyone!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAtmosfear\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I can\\\u0027t believe \u003Cem\u003Ewe\u003C/em\u003E got stuck testing a plane while the recruits are in orbit and on the Mun,\u0027 Bill grumbled. \u0027We\\\u0027re the most experienced team the space center has!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yeah, most experienced at blowing up,\u0027 Bob joked as he climbed into the cockpit of a new spaceplane design. \u0027Jeb makes sure of that.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I, for one, think this flight is going to be awesome,\u0027 Jeb said. \u0027I installed a few, um, \u003Cem\u003Especial\u003C/em\u003E surprises, to make our jobs more interesting.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I swear, Jeb, if you mess this up \u003Cem\u003Eagain\u003C/em\u003E, I\\\u0027m going to kill you,\u0027 Bill replied angrily. \u0027Eight launches in the last two weeks, and only two of them were successful.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Loosen up, will you?\u0027 Jeb responded, then started the plane\\\u0027s engines. It began to move forward down the runway, steadily gaining speed until it lifted off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I guess that wasn\\\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E bad,\u0027 Bob said. \u0027We haven\\\u0027t exploded yet, at least.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Oh, you just wait,\u0027 Jeb said, grinning. He suddenly pulled the roll to the side, and the plane did several corkscrews through the air as it flew upwards. Bob screamed, and Bill desperately attempted to keep the nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Stop that, Jeb!\u0027 Bill yelled, shoving Jeb\\\u0027s hands away from the controls and steadying the plane. Just then, something kicked in and the plane began to shoot straight upwards at an extremely high speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027What was that?!\u0027 Bob said as they flew up higher and higher. \u0027Jeb...\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Well, you know how you said you didn\\\u0027t want to fly a plane?\u0027 Jeb looked like he was barely holding back laughter. \u0027I installed rocket engines instead of atmospheric ones, as a joke Who knows, maybe we\\\u0027ll get into orbit!\u0027 He burst out laughing, then pressed a button on the control panel. Immediately there was a \u003Cem\u003Eclick\u003C/em\u003E sound as the wings and outer hull detached from the plane, revealing a small rocket inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Not funny, Jeb!\u0027 Bill yelled, trying to level out the rocket and avoid going any higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I dunno, it is \u003Cem\u003Ekind of\u003C/em\u003E funny,\u0027 Bob remarked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027See? Even Bob\\\u0027s enjoying it,\u0027 Jeb said, donning his sunglasses and taking the controls. \u0027We\\\u0027ll just shoot into orbit for a bit, and then return when our engines run out. No harm done.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Except for the fact that the plane\\\u0027s body just crashed down to the ground,\u0027 Bill retorted. \u0027And that we\\\u0027re almost out of fuel, and that we\\\u0027re going nearly a kilometer per second.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I don\\\u0027t see the problem with any of those things,\u0027 Jeb replied. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0027Bzzt... Jeb, WHAT THE HECK did you do?\u0027\u003C/em\u003E A voice said out of the transmitter. \u003Cem\u003E\u0027Get back down here, now!\u0027\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Fine,\u0027 Jeb muttered, and swung the nose of the rocket completely downward. They lost control over it, and the shuttle flew randomly through the air. \u0027Happy?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Give me that!\u0027 Bill grabbed the controls, steadying the rocket pointing slightly downward. \u0027Jeb, did you happen to remember to install a \u003Cem\u003Eparachute\u003C/em\u003E when you made this rocket?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027How was I supposed to put a parachute on the nose of a cone-shaped cockpit?\u0027 Jeb replied. Bill had passed out, and was asleep in his chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Ugh, whatever. Did you remember a decoupler, at least?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027A what?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027A decoupler, Jeb! Did you remember to put in a decoupler!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Nope.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Great.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket finally ran out of fuel, and began to sink like a rock towards the ground. Bob snored, Bill screamed, and Jeb smiled as they fell closer and closer to a large mountain range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Ooh, I nearly forgot!\u0027 Jeb reached out onto the control panel and pressed a small button.

It\\\u0027s amazing!\u0027 Bill screamed and passed out again, slumping backwards in his seat. Jeb hit the afterburner one last time, and the rocket slammed head-on into the asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few hours later, all three Kerbonauts stepped out of the cloning vats and sighed in relief. Apart from a few smaller meteorites scattered around the area of the KSC, there were no damages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027You know, Bob, I see where you\\\u0027re coming from,\u0027 Jeb said. \u0027Those cloning vats \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E kind of gross.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Does that mean you\\\u0027re going to try a bit harder \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E to blow us up?\u0027 Bill asked hopefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Are you kidding?\u0027 Jeb laughed. \u0027Tomorrow\\\u0027s Tuesday!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ping111","CreatedById":8679,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-03T20:09:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther \u003Cstrong\u003Eado\u003C/strong\u003E, my friend.
