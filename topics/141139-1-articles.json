This would allow it to go in warp around the planet automatically so many times and then stop. This could be useful for mining/ISRUs or aerobraking or anything else you can think of. To allow aerobreaking It could not permit\u00A0 warp when it hits atmosphere to allow non physics warped entry time. This could be done by not permitting the counter mode to not use any physics warps and only use railed version of warp, but always go max permissable warp per given the situation(like the current warp. The difference being it would pick back up the rails warp when it can again until the given rotations have ticked down. Then it automatically goes max given the ships specific situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-03T18:34:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2016 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
