(tl;dr at bottom)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter starting a new game last week with RemoteTech added to my usual slew of mods I got to the point of having a rather large number of relays for the various planets I was visiting, plus some interplanetary relays. I had perfectly uninterrupted coverage set up for Kerbin, Duna, and Eve, as well as all their respective moons, which left me with 22 satellites scattered around the system, plus a handful of ships and probes floating around bouncing signals somewhat incidentally. This started to have a noticeable impact on the game\u0027s performance (whenever I went into the map I got the yellow \u0022slowing down time\u0022 clock in the corner), and it\u0027s finally reached the point where upon visiting the tracking station the game just freezes. I\u0027m not sure if the issue was simply the number of ships, or the large number of hops some connections required, but editing my save file to chop a few unnecessary ships out did get me playing again. I\u0027m hesitant to launch any new ships or set up relays at any new planets for fear of breaking things though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I was thinking, I really like the game mechanics RemoteTech adds, but I was wondering if there\u0027s something in the settings that could be tweaked or added to allow communications to ignore planetary interference (no line-of-sight checks). I know this would abandon a fair bit of realism, kinda making it a \u0022RemoteTech Lite\u0022, but being able to get away with one relay per planet sounds like a nice intermediate step and would allow me to drastically downsize my fleet of satellites...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr: Can RemoteTech be tweaked to ignore line of sight checking for connections?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T06:45:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does the Reflectron GX-128 have 22MB worth of textures?
