As nice of a form profile as these parts have, it seems a shame to have to break them up using 1.25m tubes.\n\nA cross section for the base profile was asked before and i will add at least this part.

I noticed the \u0027KPBS Settings\u0027 cfg that seems to have something to do with the filtering, but looking at the part configs, I can\u0027t see what places the wedges into the LS category vs. the greenhouse itself staying with Utilities. It\u0027d be nice to have the greenhouse and my other LS containers all fall into that tab.\n\nIt is like JPLRepo said. It is done via my plugin code. Unfortunately it is not possible to create custom sections for the function filter with stock config files.\n\nTo achieve this the names of the ls-containers my mod adds start with a special string sequence (which is \u0022KKAOSS\\_LS\u0022). The code searches for this sequence in the part names and puts all parts which start with that sequence into the life-support category. Unfortunately it would be much harder to put the ls parts from other mods into that category.

My universal base modules look really cool so far, I can\u0027t wait to use them on my Duna mission. Sadly I encountered a couple stupid bugs with the landing foot and foot/wheel parts. Firstly, even in mirror symmetry the second part always faces the opposite direction. Say, I put the foot in 2x symmetry on a base module and rotate it down, the counterpart faces up. The second problem is with the wheels. They tend to be very strange. Firstly, I can only move forwards with the wheels. If I try moving backwards, it crawls forwards. Very problematic, especially when you try to dock two modules. Second, the steering is broken. The base steers very slowly, thats a big problem if you are docking two bases. Also, sometimes steering doesn\u0027t work at all in one direction, but always rotates in the other if you are trying to move. Its not a center of mass issue, my base is very well balanced. Okay, that where all of my problems, I hope you fix them soon.

That\u0027d be cool. Another part, strictly roleplaying, really, would be a large hub, perhaps with a greenhouse roof.\n\nMake a 3.75m (5m?) part that is basically a dome (glass can be flat panes with a lot of structure to fit the glass/frame ratio of your greenhouse). Like a giant Cupola part. 2X the height (or more) than your current parts. When you hit deploy, full-sized gangways pop out (ready to accept your normal, inline parts/docking sections, etc.\n\nHere ya go:\n\nUsing a 3.75m part:\n\n![3.75%20Base%20Hub.jpg](http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/KSP/3.75%20Base%20Hub.jpg)\n\nUsing a 5m fuel tank dome:\n\n![5m%20Base%20Hub.jpg](http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/KSP/5m%20Base%20Hub.jpg)\n\nThe command pod parts are the ones touching the 3.75/5m tank parts in both images. In this idea those would be hallways/whatever, and would be entirely inside the 3.75/5m part until deployed. They would need integral docking stuff.\n\nIf it was the 2d image, there is actually room (in IVA) for a balcony high up in the space. Imagine the blue part is window, there might be a ladder to a \u0022view lounge\u0022 with seats looking out (a grate for a floor, just below the blue to let the view into the large, common area below. Hotel-lobby like IVA (potted plants, mixture of comfy chairs and dining tables), perhaps with a small kitchen area on one wall. Would make for some stunning screenshots ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T19:04:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 07:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"}]}
