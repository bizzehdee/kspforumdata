My universal base modules look really cool so far, I can\u0027t wait to use them on my Duna mission. Sadly I encountered a couple stupid bugs with the landing foot and foot/wheel parts. Firstly, even in mirror symmetry the second part always faces the opposite direction. Say, I put the foot in 2x symmetry on a base module and rotate it down, the counterpart faces up. The second problem is with the wheels. They tend to be very strange. Firstly, I can only move forwards with the wheels. If I try moving backwards, it crawls forwards. Very problematic, especially when you try to dock two modules. Second, the steering is broken. The base steers very slowly, thats a big problem if you are docking two bases. Also, sometimes steering doesn\u0027t work at all in one direction, but always rotates in the other if you are trying to move. Its not a center of mass issue, my base is very well balanced.

When you adjust the greenhouse waste amount (yeah, 500 sounds like too much) you might also consider changing the resource definition to allow excess O2 to be dumped. Right now, if your oxygen tanks fill up, your plants stop growing and everyone starves. Learned that the hard way!
