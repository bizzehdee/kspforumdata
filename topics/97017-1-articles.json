If anything else, the part must cost at a minimal 20 units, if you have a mod that has parts for less than 20 units, it is okay to use as long as you change the price on the part to 20 funds. Also, you may not change Mass values of stock parts, or of that of any mod. You may have the price of structural parts (not engines/fuel/electrical/science/aero) this means decouplers only can have lower prices than 20 funds, however, the force they must exert has to be less than 5 (kilo newtons? Or newtons?). Use tweakable everything to make things easier for you. They can be parts that are strut/frame related parts.

Also, Procedural parts is the only Exception for this mod. Any other part less than 20 funds needs to be priced to at least 20 funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do decide to re-do this, then you may need to post pics as well.
