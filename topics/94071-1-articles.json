We put them up there and leave them behind without using them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFineprint asked me to place a station around duna that can be manned by 9 Kerbals allthough I have no intend of putting kerbals there at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for the Money and the Science?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like I am the slave to Gene Kerman\u0027s Randomness and I think it would enhance the fun of this game if the offered contracts would be more inline with actions that you are about to perform instead of offering you completely random contracts that clutter your screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first set of contracts at least give you some sort of guide to escape the atmosphere and to reach space but beyond that point, I am getting overwhelmed by this sheer randomness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this criticism is not ruining someones Christmas but I am curious if you guys are experiencing the same with Stock-KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T02:32:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe contract system definitely needs a bit of refinement, yes. I shouldn\u0027t have to spend 5 to 15 minutes declining contracts I don\u0027t care about just to get one I\u0027m looking for to spawn. It would be nice if we had some way to specify what kinds of contracts we wish to take, so we could exclude ones we will never do.

I\u0027d like to see the contracts serve as some sort of mission progression. The contracts feel like a separate thing that randomly tie into the game. I get contracts for parts I haven\u0027t unlocked yet or 10 contracts to test the same parachute. It would be great if the contracts aligned to a mission progression. Put wheels first. Make a rover. Then a glider. Then a plane. Then a rocket. Then satellite. Then orbit. Then mun. Space station. Etc. The contracts should be supporting this progression. And I think these should be tied together in a progression. Ksp doesn\u0027t make sense in a lot of ways. Why wheels so late? Why satellites long after orbiting kerbonauts? If they could tie this all together, career mode would be great. Right now, it seems like a sandbox game with restrictions placed on it, illogical part unlocking order, lack of progression objectives, and random contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would also be great if kerbal knowledge of the world started out small. Use \u0022fog\u0022 to hide unexplored parts of world. Then as you explore, your map of the planet expands. You unlock technology to discover moons, planets, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-22T02:42:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2014 02:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sledgeweb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnV","CreatedById":79006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T05:05:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah!
