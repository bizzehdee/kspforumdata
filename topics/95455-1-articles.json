I\u0027ve only recently started coming to the forums. seems like there are a lot of people out there that are just like me that have had the same trial and failures as I have. that\u0027s all that makes this a great game. you can come up with a concept and take it to an audience for help or just to share something cool you created. this plane looks great and I can tell you spent a fair ammount of time tweaking it to get it to actually fly. the last time I tried making a plane I got it into space achieved an orbit and then realized I didn\u0027t have enough mono propellant to get home. I leave that plane in space around Kerbin as a reminder. always have an escape plan. keep looking up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
