Is this a thing? I mean from a ballistic transfer straight from Kerbin and not just catching up to Jool from a more or less resonant orbit. I figured that since Tylo is as massive as Kerbin with none of that atmosphere, I might be able to get a gravity assist from it to slow myself down enough for a capture. My alternative is to just go for a Laythe aerobrake, but my only experience with that and Laythe in general was the time when my early game probe that somehow got to Jool got tossed around a bit by the meanie moons before Tylo decided they had enough fun and launched it straight at Laythe with a 90 degree angle of attack. Poor thing got instantly vaporized at the upper atmosphere. :D\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zolotiyeruki","CreatedById":150224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T18:19:31Z","Content":"\nYes, and that\u0026#39;s generally the most common way to do it.

If you\u0026#39;re not lucky, no biggie. Just (again, use a maneuver node.

Tylo orbits Jool at about 2 km/s, moving counterclockwise when viewed from the north (all bodies in the Kerbol system have parallel axes, so we can define a universal north for the whole system). Your encounter trajectory passes by Jool moving clockwise. This means you encounter Tylo going 2 * 2 km/s = 4 km/s faster relative to Tylo than you would if you passed by Jool on the opposite side (because you\u0026#39;re meeting Tylo head-on instead of catching up from behind). Tylo\u0026#39;s escape velocity at the surface is only about 3 km/s, so a 4 km/s difference in your encounter speed will make a *huge* difference in how much deflection Tylo can give you (as a given ratio of incoming velocity to escape velocity at periapsis altitude will give your flyby trajectory a unique deflection angle).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T12:07:58Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Geschosskopf\u0027] So once I get in Jool\u0026#39;s SOI, I have to speed up or slow down a tiny bit to get the actual encounter with Laythe or Tylo.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes, that\u0026#39;s what my 34.4 m/s node is about.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PLAD","CreatedById":104158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T22:04:10Z","Content":"\nThere was an [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117415-SSTO-to-laythe-and-beyond\u0022]SSTO to Laythe and beyond [/URL]challenge a while ago in which we used lots of flyby tricks to get from LKO to a Laythe encounter.

My method (pretty much requires a node editor for fine adjustments and viewing the Jool system from angles where the node is not visible):\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Just get a Jool encounter with the ejection burn from LKO, don\u0026#39;t try to be super precise. That will come later in the correction maneuver.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Exit Kerbin\u0026#39;s SoI.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Set a node for an hour or more in the future, so you have no time pressure while adjusting the node.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Focus on Jool and view the system from \u0022above\u0022. Target Tylo.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Adjust the node so that the path touches Tylo\u0026#39;s orbit tangentially in the same direction as Tylo\u0026#39;s orbit. \u003Cbr\u003E\n6. Now adjust your arrival time so that Tylo is in the right place for an encounter. Make small prograde/retrograde adjustments for timing, then use radial\u002B/- and normal\u002B/- to get the path back at Tylo\u0026#39;s orbit. This is the fiddliest part, very small adjustments make significant differences.\u003Cbr\u003E\n7. Once the Tylo encounter is set, refine the resultant orbit. Use normal\u002B/- in small amounts to adjust the inclination, and fine tuning the periapsis will adjust the Ap/Pe of the final orbit. If your destination is another Joolian moon, it\u0026#39;s useful to target that moon and see if you can arrange a \u0022free\u0022 encounter.\u003Cbr\u003E\n8. Now it\u0026#39;s time to execute. This is a precise burn, so I find it useful to dial the main engine\u0026#39;s thrust limiter as low as it will go. It doesn\u0026#39;t make much difference if the burn takes a long time, but having it change the trajectory slowly lets you prevent overshooting. Focus on Jool in map mode during the burn and watch carefully.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T13:18:23Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Red Iron Crown\u0027]-snip-[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs shown in my pictures I did a ballistic transfer during a transfer window but I still don\u0026#39;t get a closed orbit like the one you are showing up there after passing very close to Tylo.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T13:30:30Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027More Boosters\u0027]As shown in my pictures I did a ballistic transfer during a transfer window but I still don\u0026#39;t get a closed orbit like the one you are showing up there after passing very close to Tylo.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou\u0026#39;re encountering it almost perpendicular to its direction of travel and from the retrograde direction, you\u0026#39;ll get very little in the way of a useful slingshot that way.
