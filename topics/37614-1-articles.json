The regular clamp-o-tron has been ok for the small stuff, but as soon as the structures get big it gets too wobbly. I thought I\u0027d try out the Clamp-o-Tron Sr. for my newest project. Unfortunately, as soon as I turn on the main engines the whole thing bucks around like a bull. And that\u0027s with mostly empty fuel tanks and half the ship unfinished. So, I need something more stable for on-orbit assembly. Normally I\u0027d break out the docking struts, but I\u0027m trying to keep this stock. So, what can I do to make a stronger connection with the parts that I have? My ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Multi-port regular clamp-o-tron: is this better or worse than CoT Sr?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Multi-port clamp-o-tron sr: Holy %#$@ this would get heavy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Single clamp-o-tron sr with shock absorbers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thinking with the shock absorbers is that a central port surrounded by structural fuselages or something would help to keep the whole thing more stable. I\u0027m not sure how well it would work with the KSP physics simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and it has to allow fuel flow somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have a better idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zerotwo","CreatedById":60799,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T19:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne option for moving huge objects into orbit is to build a scaffolding system around it using the lightweight \u0022structural\u0022 segments made of bars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild the object you want to put in orbit, find a way to surround it with 4 equal sides of scaffolding, and then use struts to hold up the various parts of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, things like housings, docking sections, and separator items are not structurally sound, you\u0027ll need to use structural pieces to transfer the thrust around the part and into the pieces above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom of your rocket is accelerating as fast as the thrusters can push it, the top is not moving as fast (it has to accelerate slightly after your bottom stages) and thus \u0022crushes\u0022 the sections in-between, if you can increase the structurally sound points of contact between the bottom stage and upper-stages, you can start those upper sections accelerating sooner; which results in less flex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this is helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wronkiew","CreatedById":60802,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T20:48:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zerotwo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zerotwo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne option for moving huge objects into orbit is to build a scaffolding system around it using the lightweight \u0022structural\u0022 segments made of bars.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting idea!
