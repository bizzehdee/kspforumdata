As for IVA, we can\u0027t figure out how to put a panel inside IVA view since I had no experience with IVA whatsoever, but BobCat is trying to resolve that issue as we speak. And he is also doing all the balancing work, to make sure all vessels won\u0027t kill their crew right after they leave atmosphere, but at the same time there will be no \u0022magic part\u0022 that you need to put on and forget about that problem. All resources will eventually end, and you\u0027ll have to replenish them sooner or later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also plans to add collision damage with oxygen leaks that follows, solar radiation, and many other things - but that will follow after we release initial version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso some parts of that mod will be released separately as well as frameworks so other mod devs could use it to implement other things that should happen even when vessel is inactive. Imagine Kethane scanner sats that work all the time, or multiple science sats beaming data to your main research vessel which processes it and displays some sort of summary. Hell, even real GPS analogue could be created - the possibilities are endless!
