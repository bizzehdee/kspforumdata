(I\u0027m using RO, here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, I\u0027ve had to resort to opening massive drogue chutes at ~100 km, which fully deploy at a radar altitude of 70 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd... Well, it works beautifully. The craft never even encounters significant heating, and come down to 7 km, I\u0027m going at a leisurely \u0026lt;200 m/s speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I remember reading somewhere that if ribbon chutes open above about mach 1.3, that they start encountering some unwanted effects... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m wondering, what kind of problems would I face if I tried doing this IRL? Why doesn\u0027t NASA just open a parachute in the upper atmosphere and descend without any significant heating? There\u0027s an altitude, there, where dragging effects are very much observable, but there\u0027s no significant heating. Open a parachute there, and it seems like it\u0027d work very well.

Big chutes means lots of mass. Something you don\u0027t want in spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you have too much drag in the upper atmosphere you steepen your trajectory, making you hit the lower layers of the atmosphere with faster speeds and thus increasing the G load and making your landing zone less accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shania_L","CreatedById":58975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T00:10:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBig heat shields are also heavy. I suppose the difference comes from entering Martian atmosphere from a direct entry interplanetry speed, and from a Mars orbit. I believe most if not all Martian landers IRL are direct entry so do not spend a significant amount of time in thin upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have the tradeoff between a potentially lighter parachute based aerobreaker, but with the added mass and complexity of having to perform a capture to orbit then a (Re-)Entry.

I\u0027m not 100% sure why this hasn\u0027t been attempted on previous mars missions, but I suspect that intended delivery mass is a factor - the less you weigh, the easier it is to enter the atmosphere, so it may have just been that it was easier to engineer an effective lightweight heat shield than a parachute for the relatively light payloads we\u0027ve sent to the surface so far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
