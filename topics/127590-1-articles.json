The difference between Haswell and Skylake is mostly efficiency (and right now availability). If you are looking for a cheap i7 you might also want to look for the Xeon 1231 which is basically an i7 without the graphics core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as Speeding Mullet said: an i5 might be the better option because next to no game uses hyper-threading and even Unity 5 KSP probably won\u0027t. So apart from clock speed the performance gains will be marginal. Note that the i5 4690k and i7 4790k are both overclockable and both have the same TDP allotment which means both are able to reach about the same clock speed under the same circumstances (i.e. you can close the 500MHz gap between them fairly easy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-13T12:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy budget is around 800$ including Windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-13T16:05:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor games, typically an i7 isn\u0027t worth it - an i5 will give you similar performance for less money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, this is KSP we are talking about.
