If you sweep the wings backwards, it\u0027ll loose a lot of its lift, as the airspeed perpendicular to the wing is what counts. In other words, a wing turned 90 degrees before attaching will generate no lift in stock, while still having all of its drag, despite it\u0027l clearly exposed to the airstream. FAR, however, models this correctly, as stated by others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvWzB81vXgM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Huntn","CreatedById":139751,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T17:26:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThis is probably more of a rant but please bear with me. I\u0027ve flown airplanes and flight sims for years but KSP is lousy from a space plane perspective. I realize a physics update is in work. First off I\u0027ve seen some KSP planes that look fantastic. I\u0027ve downloaded and they really fly, but I\u0027ve not tested them extensively.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EIf I look at the purpose of a space plane, it seems that vertical launch is the most realistic way to go because aircraft are not built as a barrel of rocket fuel with a cockpit, wings, and stability added. That\u0027s how rockets are built. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E However in my endeavor to build a simple space plane that can take off with a horizontal takeoff roll, I make sure that the center of lift and center of mass are close to one another. I can find a configuration that will fly, but not fly well, and then sometimes my aircraft flips end over end while flying, no problem. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E I\u0027m definitely to scared at this point to install FAR. I have completed several survey missions where you have to fly over an area below a specific altitude. I\u0027ve equipped my airplane with parachutes so I don\u0027t have to worry about crashing at the end of a mission, lol. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ETypically I build a fuselage with a delta or straight wing, but most of the time the basic aileron/elevator tabs are not efficient enough for rotating the aircraft. I\u0027ve adjusted landing gear location to change the AoA of the airplane when it\u0027s sitting on the runway I\u0027ve put a movable canard on the front, and it\u0027s not usual for my plane to flip over on it\u0027s back.

At the lower science levels, there simply is not enough good airplane parts, which if you use logic, there should be, as in airplanes developed before space flight.
