An anhedral angle (wings pointing toward the ground) increases maneuverability while making your craft less table.

Increasing the angle on a wing (say, dihedral design, port side wing, aircraft rolling to starboard) will decrease its lift generated. The other wing (now more parallel to the ground) will produce greater lift, and this differential naturally corrects the roll of the aircraft (up to a point).

All lift and drag are generated at the attachment point, so if you have (for example) a parasol wing with anhedral you won\u0027t notice any effect beyond the loss of lift.\n\n Bonus: If you add dihedral to outboard panels and set them behind the center of mass, they will also add yaw stability.\n\n Best,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Huntn","CreatedById":139751,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T13:45:22Z","Content":"I assume the following is true, but would appreciate confirmation. As a space plane designer, this is very important to realize! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I watched a Scott Manley Youtube Video on Space planes where he said all of the airfoils in the game are symmetrical and produce no lift at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 [angle of attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack) (AOA). These are the kinds of airfoils you\u0027d see on a rocket for stability, but not on a plane designed to fly in the atmosphere. Instead they rely on \u0022barn door effect\u0022, wind hitting the bottom or top side of the airfoil at something more than 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA to produce some amount of lift. How much I don\u0027t know, but is it safe to say from a design standpoint that all/most of the lift being produced is based on thrust from the engine?\n\nThe description of a [dihedral wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_%28aeronautics%29) adding to stability means there is some amount of atmospheric physics, but I\u0027ve always thought the effect had to do with a lifting wing. I just don\u0027t know how much. But based on the videos I\u0027ve watched there appears to be enough barn door lift to glide a plane to a landing. It\u0027s just that from a realistic aviation standpoint, flying through the air, I don\u0027t think barn door effect cuts it. For most airplanes a lifting wing is required. For KSP, think about this, for all those [fancy space planes](https://www.google.com/search?q=kerbal\u002Bspace\u002Bprogram\u002Bbest\u002Bspace\u002Bplane\u0026tbm=isch\u0026tbo=u\u0026source=univ\u0026sa=X\u0026ei=-LUSVdqmCMGINtqbgqAM\u0026ved=0CB4QsAQ\u0026biw=1312\u0026bih=731) with fancy cool looking wings, they may serve little purpose except to look cool and add weight. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIf this is true (there are no lifting airfoils) I assume it is because KSP physics don\u0027t correctly model wing lift as you would see in a traditional flight sim. I realize this game is primarily about space, but being so physics inclined, it\u0027s a shame if they can\u0027t model a regular wing. After all the Space Shuttle wing produces lift...

I\u0027ve not thought about it previously, but if you look at the Space Shuttle, relatively small wings, steep glide ratio, but those wings do produce some lift. I assume on launch that the rockets had to counter that lift to some degree to keep it going in the desired direction and/or they used that lift to help point the desired flight path.

I am no astronaut, but the mechanics of raising and lowering orbit feel right. I\u0027ve done the transfer orbit in the tutorial and it feels acceptable, the maneuver node adds calculations which makes the game seem more realistic than just eye balling it. This simulation is very ambitious and I want it to feel somewhat realistic. Having to eyeball flying over a waypoint for a contract feels very unreal. Maybe the Kerbals don\u0027t have GPS, but they certainly should have some fairly sophisticated instrumentation besides looking out the window. The Waypoint Mod, came to my rescue for Kirbin surveys. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Now I have to get up to speed with the scriptable auto-pilot. I don\u0027t want to be hand flying, not because I don\u0027t like the challenge, but because (my impression) it reminds me of how unrealistic that is. There maybe times when manual adjustments might be made, and in emergencies with equipment degredation, but I believe something along the lines of computers/autopilots is how astronauts really fly, not Kentucky wind-age. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T17:28:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 05:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Huntn**"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain H@dock","CreatedById":139017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T17:58:15Z","Content":"To be fair, this could really change with 1.0 and it still is fun to fly in the medium speed regime.

I\u0027ve downloaded and they really fly, but I\u0027ve not tested them extensively.\n\nIf I look at the purpose of a space plane, it seems that vertical launch is the most realistic way to go because aircraft are not built as a barrel of rocket fuel with a cockpit, wings, and stability added.

I can find a configuration that will fly, but not fly well, and then sometimes my aircraft flips end over end while flying, no problem. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif) I\u0027m definitely to scared at this point to install FAR.

I\u0027ve adjusted landing gear location to change the AoA of the airplane when it\u0027s sitting on the runway I\u0027ve put a movable canard on the front, and it\u0027s not usual for my plane to flip over on it\u0027s back.
