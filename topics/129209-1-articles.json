I\u0027m pretty new to KSP and just made my first Mun landing. I\u0027m afraid, however, that I may have made a bit of a mistake here. I\u0027m playing career mode and have been really starved for science points. My lander module was equipped with a lot of instruments and I took readings when I landed. I have a good deal of science stored however transmitting it only offers me 25-30% of its potential value.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lander itself is not designed for reentry to Kerbin. I sent it to the moon and am taking it back on a payload, which is just a large engine with a lot of fuel tanks with which I dock. This is not designed for reentry either. However the payload does have additional docking ports, and I planned to launch an escape pod module to dock with the payload and bring my crew back home. From what I\u0027ve read, however, I won\u0027t be able to transmit all this scientific data to the escape pod. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I have ~200 science worth of points sitting on the lander module and no way to get anything from it without transmitting and surrendering 150 of those points.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way for me to retrieve these science points? I looked into the mobile processing lab but I\u0027m not 100% sure if it will do what I\u0027d like here. I can however launch one and dock with the lander/payload module if that would help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T05:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have kerbal space EVA capability? If you do then it\u0027s easy - just EVA your kerbal close to the scientific instruments and you will get a \u0022Collect Data\u0022 option where he/she takes the data out of the instrument and on their person. You can collect all the data from different instruments in one go and return to your capsule and all the experiment data will then be stored in your (heat shielded) capsule.
