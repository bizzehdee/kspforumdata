Thanks.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Ihave a certain level of experience with this. I\u0027ll start out by saying \u0022it\u0027s not exactly easy\u0022 \u003Cem\u003Ebut... \u003C/em\u003Eit\u0027s not exactly hard either. There are two ways to achieve the results depending on the reason you want to remove the objects. I had an issue with the memory requirements for some of the really detailed models, and so my procedure was doing a search (via Notepad\u002B\u002B) using \u0022find in files\u0022 to locate the model references and remove either the entire configuration file or just the parts that were relevant to the object in question. If, however, you have no issue loading the models/textures into your game and want them to continue to load elsewhere in the world, then you can actually clear the objects in-game by launching a craft and entering the mod\u0027s edit mode \u0022Ctrl\u002BK\u0022 (I think?) and locating the object in question in the editor followed by clicking whatever is necessary to delete the object. Alternatively, if the object in \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E ever spawned in and around the KSC (if it\u0027s that obvious) you can simply remove the configuration file that corresponds to that object. So, it\u0027s like I said above. It\u0027s both easy \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E difficult at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T17:11:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having an issue with tracking station icons in the map view.
