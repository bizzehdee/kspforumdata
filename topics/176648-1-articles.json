It\u0027s a part (a 1,25m ring) that you could stack atop a Mk2 command pod (the Apollo-like one) and say a docking port. Or maybe it was a 1,25m docking port including chutes/drogues. Using the stock radial ones is really ugly and often end up blocking a porthole or a door. Thanks in advance, searched around but unable to find it !
