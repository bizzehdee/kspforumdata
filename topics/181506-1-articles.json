Currently, my glow config looks pretty from the surface and orbit, but doesn\u0027t have any fade. This results in a very nasty looking border appearing high in the atmosphere:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Q0Z794K.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Q0Z794K.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using a modified version of the Para-Sci atmosphere pack, and decided to remove the fade because the glow wasn\u0027t visible from low orbit. I\u0027m fine if the view from the surface stays the same as stock, a good low orbit view is all I really need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
