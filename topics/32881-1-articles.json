I\u0027d love to dock a mega-station together in orbit out of smaller launchers, but unfortunately my mere quad-core machine squeals and complains if I get more than a few station parts within 2.5km of each other. Not sure if that\u0027s because of the parts count or because of it being multiple command pods, but in any case, the 350-370 ton Jool Rover escape/cruise stage runs at least acceptably well for me on this machine. I don\u0027t want to have to buy a whole new computer just to dock the same weight of stuff together out of multiple parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, asparagus staging \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E more efficient than serial staging. Reducing engine power would just make asparagus staging \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E attractive. That or make struts weak to the point of pointlessness, in which case people will just add MOAR STRUTS anyway. That and the amount of intakes to jets needed to get anything like a spaceplane is already a bit ridiculous. I don\u0027t think they need nerfing at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
