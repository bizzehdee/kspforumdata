If you can just hyperedit (the mod that does that) everywhere it takes away all the satisfaction of exploring a new place. I understand your point though sometimes you just need to test a design in space or in low gravity. But the key element of ksp is the learning by doing approach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like to have is an additional debug menu option to turn off the atmosphere. Although all those suggestion about simulations could be absolete with redesign of the editor. I hope that it will finally give more info on twr, delta v and rcs placement among others\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T21:23:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat would make more sense would be (assuming someone could make the models without too much effort) a few extra planetary base designs, with a flat, marked launch space. Fuel tanks, etc could be extant tank designs, landed as base facilities (some \u0022out buildings\u0022 can be \u0022bases\u0022 as we would build them right now in KSP). Have a game start setting that adds extra-kerbin facilities. 1. KSC, 2. KSC plus Munbase, 3. KSC, Munbase, and Dunabase, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you pick any setting above 1 (current KSP), it assumes a certain fund/tech level, and fills the tree accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T00:19:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to start everywhere in the solar system kinda takes the whole point out of space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rover test track would be nice though\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T07:15:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah the exploration should be the motivation and I am also pretty sure that construction facilities not located on kerbin were ruled out more than a year ago.
