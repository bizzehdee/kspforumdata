One paid you for science, and one was basically an unlimited allowance. I\u0027m requesting that there be a government funding mod that based your total funds on reputation. The key elements are as such:\n\n- Reputation defines funding **value**.\n- Highest tech level defines funding **multiplier** (to allow for more ambitious projects as you progress)\n- **Value \\*** M**ultiplier = Max Funding**\n- Per Interval, ***IF*** **Funding \u003C Max funding** ***THEN*** **Funding = Max Funding**\n- Reputation decays to neutral over time (They used to be cool, but they haven\u0027t done anything worthwhile in ages.)\n\nFor added effect contracts should be available with no funding reward but higher forwarded funds (individually funded projects approximation), Heavier reputation penalties, but reputation boost on acceptance (Wasted government money perception, exciting new project undertaken). You should also be able to request more funding for a reputation penalty that gets worse as your reputation goes down (They want *more* money? ***Again??****)*\n\nFor added difficulty, add reputation penalty on payment period depending on how much money is left over from last time, with a bit of wiggle room. (They get so much money, but where does it all go?)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T17:36:34Z","Content":"I like this idea (and in fact have written some thoughts on the matter [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101656-Alternate-contract-funding-system)), but be careful with the rep penalty for sitting on funds -- there may have to be some kind of \u0022big upcoming expense\u0022 fudge factor, so you don\u0027t get hit with a penalty while saving up for the Level 3 VAB or a Jool-5 mission."},{"CreatedByName":"aquilux","CreatedById":23859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:39:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E hit with a penalty while saving up for the Level 3 VAB or a Jool-5 mission.\n\nHmmm. I forgot about upgrading large buildings but big expenses like that should be coverable with the money request (they want to upgrade their facilities? What\u0027s wrong with the buildings they have?). Unfortunately you have completely missed the point of the mod. In the real world, if you don\u0027t use funds you effectively loose them. Let\u0027s explore this concept.\n\nYou are the proud director of the new XYZ branch. You have estimated that you will need $100,000 yearly to run, and kongress approves your proposal. Congrats. You now have $100,000. Use it wisely.\n\nOne year goes by and you are happy that you stayed under budget, even if you got rather close, having used $99,000. At the appropriate time kongress looks at your funds, sees that you have $1,000 left and gives you $99,000 to bring your current funding back to $100,000 because they still feel that\u0027s a reasonable amount.\n\nAnother year goes by and you used much less money this time because you don\u0027t have start up costs. You only used $60,000 this time. At the appropriate time kongress looks at your funds, sees that you have $40,000 left. They think that you have a much larger budget than you really need, and are rather disappointed that you have been getting this much to work with. So they reduce your budget to $65,000 and give you $25,000, leaving you with said $65,000 to work with this year. \n\nUnfortunately this year sees the launch of your new initiative AlphaBett, and you wind up not having enough money to continue operations to the end of the year.\n\nSo you go back to kongress and ask them for more money. Reluctantly they give you more, but not as much as you would have wanted due to their lowered opinion of you from earlier. In fact, your asking for more leads them to question your abilities to manage your branch, further lowering your reputation with them.\n\nAt this point you must do something to raise their opinion of you or else you will keep sliding down this slippery hill. Staying in budget winds up being just a stalling mechanism because they wind up asking more and more why they\u0027re paying you at all if you don\u0027t get anything done. Either find a way to get things done with what little money you have, bring them all sorts of new technology, start working on things they particularly want you to do (contracts) and don\u0027t screw up, or burn all the reputation you have left with them to secure the funding for you coup de gr\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A2s in the hopes of finally proving yourself.\n\nLike I said, -rep per leftover = hardmode.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T01:40:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 01:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by aquilux**\n  \nTypo fix."}]}
