On the one hand it takes \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of a few hundred m/s less to achieve orbit, which means that you can build your ascent stage smaller if you are trying to optimize. Also, for rockets, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on laythe is higher (since less gravity and less atmospheric pressure), so you can have a higher fuel/engine mass ratio (again, if you want to optimize). \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t mean spaceplane, and doesn\u0027t mean airbreathing, so he could be using rockets for ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf one uses airbreathers, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E may be a bit lower, because jet thrust decreases with air pressure, and 0.6 Atms vs 0.8 Gs mean that you could have only 3/4 the jet \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on Laythe -but this depends on the engine, some deviate quite a lot from a 1:1 ratio of air pressure to thrust in particular the rapiers and whiplash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a plot of the date points for the engines:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022THsiqdx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022522\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/THsiqdx.png\u0022 width=\u0022988\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalthough note that its really curves, not straight lines connecting the points, so the 0.6 atm value for the rapier in particular will be closer to 1 than it appears on the graph... the Juno to a lesser extent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was possible to build a micro \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E and get to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E with a Juno and spark in the past (but with very very small margins), but such a design easily gets to orbit on Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample... this failed to make orbit, it would have on laythe:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022E5ktWT7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022643\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/E5ktWT7.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis did make orbit, but barely... it would have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of hundreds of m/s left over if it was done on laythe, whihc would have allowed for actual landing gear (it had to use a launch trolley on kerbin, and land in the water, on laythe it could launch and land from the water, or it could use landing gear without becoming too heavy to make orbit)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022c6NgHss.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/c6NgHss.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince he mentioned a mini-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, when you try to go really mini, the differences between Laythe and Kerbin start to matter a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LoSBoL","CreatedById":174038,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-04T07:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you got the Making History expansion?\u00A0 If you do you can spawn a built (or build a) vehicle with a few clicks anywhere you want to.
