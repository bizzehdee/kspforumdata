Maybe it would be a good idea for squad to keep the part in as an easter egg or something similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KeranoKerman","CreatedById":192437,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-23T18:22:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe it should have a similar revamp to the mk1 tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-23T19:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it should be revamped, yes.
