You can even change with MM, so that the setting survives a TweakScale update. To make crew pods scaleable via MM just add the following into a .cfg file anywhere inside GameDate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@TWEAKSCALESETTINGS:BEFORE[TweakScale]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    @noScaledCrewPods = 0\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zengei","CreatedById":75233,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:12:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pellinor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pellinor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt already should be on CKAN, I\u0027ll look into it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN-support/issues/125\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eissue\u003C/a\u003E I created.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zengei\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zengei\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESee this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN-support/issues/125\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eissue\u003C/a\u003E I created.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help.

Since scaled crew pods will look weird in any case I\u0027d consider this as an edge case of an already dubious scaling support, and prefer not to complicate the plugin with hardcoded special treatment. This is also why scaling of crewed parts is now switchable and disabled per default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dazpoet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dazpoet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECKAN currently lacks a good way of solving this without a lot of trickery so I would like to humbly suggest \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN-support/issues/125#issuecomment-98156962\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN-support/issues/125#issuecomment-98156962\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAAh, so this was a problem on my side!
