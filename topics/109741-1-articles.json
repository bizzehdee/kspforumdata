To clarify, you want us to build a rocket plane and take off and fly for 15 seconds? What about FAR? 0.90? 1.0? 1.0.1? NEAR? aerodynamics are different. You may want to check the rules for posting challenges. Your entry is missing.\n\nNo scoring?\n\nAntbin, your structural intake is located in the Aerodynamics tab. All air intakes are located in aerodynamics tab, at least in my minimally modded copy.\n\nJust trying to be helpful. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"}]}
