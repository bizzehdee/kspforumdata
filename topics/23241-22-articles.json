I have descent computer but such plane would start to lag me out when we talk about physics frame rate and if you warp such plane and then dewarp just wait for trouble.. I had dewarp problems on stock game with no mods when I make something ~200 parts that would be most complex and biggest what I do. So I suggest you to try and make that plane with 2X less parts you know.. like change fuel tanks with bigger alternatives, instead of bunch of small wing parts use bigger ones and so on.. This game has problems when part count goes boom and that does not depend on mods. And as Taverius said it is likely because of how velocity is calculated on parts. Maybe just try to use step down dewarp? Like you go for 50X then less, less up to 0 not just 50X and full stop, and I bet that when you try even 2X physics acceleration your ship just wobble out of control into parts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-29T08:25:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2013 08:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by BASKABAS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wrench Head","CreatedById":175503,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T00:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat Parts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1240.photobucket.com/user/BHS2012x/media/VTOL/1b0750f4-b14d-4fbf-88d7-0f06a467d3c6_zpsfd06538c.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1240.photobucket.com/albums/gg484/BHS2012x/VTOL/1b0750f4-b14d-4fbf-88d7-0f06a467d3c6_zpsfd06538c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221b0750f4-b14d-4fbf-88d7-0f06a467d3c6_zpsfd06538c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taverius","CreatedById":11815,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T01:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frostiken\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Frostiken\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYour example crafts seem just as uncontrollable, at least with FAR.The BLV4 Heinlien for example, gets off the runway, but all it does is want to roll over and explode, like I\u0027m balancing the entire aerodynamics directly on the centerline, and if I tip it just a little, it loses balance and begins spinning wildly.

REALLY?! 364?! For what reason you have so.. many parts in it? in older KSP versions that would be limit of game itself \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E now it is bigger I think but still.. I have descent computer but such plane would start to lag me out when we talk about physics frame rate and if you warp such plane and then dewarp just wait for trouble.. I had dewarp problems on stock game with no mods when I make something ~200 parts that would be most complex and biggest what I do. So I suggest you to try and make that plane with 2X less parts you know.. like change fuel tanks with bigger alternatives, instead of bunch of small wing parts use bigger ones and so on.. This game has problems when part count goes boom and that does not depend on mods. And as Taverius said it is likely because of how velocity is calculated on parts. Maybe just try to use step down dewarp? Like you go for 50X then less, less up to 0 not just 50X and full stop, and I bet that when you try even 2X physics acceleration your ship just wobble out of control into parts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do bring that plane in orbit many times (successfully unless you start warping around), the same ship on R3 was a good one (also warping around): is not a part count problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
