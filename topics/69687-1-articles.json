We thought high-courage, low-stupidity kerbals might be better pilots and scientists, respectively, but cost more to hire. This would require contracts/currency/reputation to be complete, but essentially you\u0027d start with pretty crappy astronauts. Only as your program gained reputation and money could you court better astronauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gem of our idea is that each kerbal can gain courage, lose stupidity as you use them for certain things. For instance, if you had one dumb kerbal in a mobile processing lab, the more experiments he ran, the lower his stupidity would drop. Another example would be a weak-kneed pilot becoming better after performing multiple maneuvers or achieving various low and high orbits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would do three things: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Encourage thoughtful selection of individual kerbals based on mission requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Encourage the development of individual kerbals based on goals within your space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Specialize the abilities and thus priorities of your space program over time, making balancing the types of kerbals you employ (and the type of missions you accept) a game unto itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe also thought it would be helpful/interesting to create a new class of kerbals: Engineers, with the same courage/stupidity metrics. High-courage engineers would speed the development of aerodynamic/propulsion/control parts. Low-stupidity engineers would speed the development of pods/structural/utility/science parts. The intensity of each metric would determine the speed at which their research completes and parts become available. So for instance, a low-courage/low-stupidity would go beast-mode on science parts, but hardly contribute to the development of new engines. When you conduct experiments and transmit or return results, the science points are divided among your engineers and their talents, resulting in varied progress towards the unlocking of new parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Add new value and gameplay dynamics to science research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Specialize your space program based on science research and subsequent part acquisition. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Affect the scope of missions you can accept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry this was long, didn\u0027t mean to thread-jack, just wanted expand on the great point you raised.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federally","CreatedById":105086,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T18:04:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo thanks.

Kerbals with low stupidity would level up faster, and those with high stupidity would get smarter over time, while leveling slowly at first. Similarly courage would have some effect on performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy leveling up your crew they would gain new abilities. For instance you could get a Kerbal that would be able to process goo canister research more efficiently if you constantly use them to do that task (they get better at it). Or a kerbal that has flown many missions may gain the ability to handle simple piloting tasks like keeping the ship pointed at a node, or triggering a stage when the fuel in a certain tank runs out. OR perhaps you could have a kerbal gain skills to repair things, so they can not only fix tires but solar panels and struts as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also love to see them grouped into Science, engineering, and piloting. So only a pilot can fly a ship, only a scientist can be assigned to the space lab, and only an engineer can repair things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for why would you ever send a dumb kerbal on a mission? Well for one you might run out of smart ones and need to train a new guy, or perhaps you just need someone to keep an eye on the orbital module while the others land and take samples.
