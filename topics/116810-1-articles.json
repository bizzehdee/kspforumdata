It doesn\u0027t advance the debate around that hypothesis in any way and for that reason is completely unscientific.\n\nTo use your unicorn example, we might reasonably have a discussion about the fossil record and how it presents no evidence for unicorns. We might then conclude the fossil record is too unreliable to rule out unicorns. We might point to other creatures with similar physiologies (for example narwhals) and speculate that unicorns might have evolved from a common ancestor. We might have an interesting discussion about how useful a single horn would be from an evolutionary point of view. From all this, we might eventually arrive at some idea about the likelihood of unicorns existing.\n\nA meaningful discussion in other words.
