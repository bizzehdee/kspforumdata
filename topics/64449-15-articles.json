Not being able to dock should definitely lose some points, but it seems like Matt\u0027s scoring might be a little too heavily weighted upon docking capabilites. My own scoring system has a docking category with a minimum possible score of zero, but there is a penalties section which deducts a set amount of points if the design has no docking capabilities. This helps to avoid cascading point deductions for a category that really isn\u0027t a major part of SSTO design (and is something that is easily remedied \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah it is very harsh on non-dockers. Whilst docking might not necessarily be a major part of SSTO design, I did consider it a very major part of the Aeries 4a design. The craft, as I see it, has three functions - get to space, dock, return to kerbin. Of these docking is widely considered the hardest manoeuvre in KSP to learn and as such I wanted to weight it heavily. Slapping a docking port underside a craft goes a long way to remedying; the points system I cobbled together does largely fail to distinguish between docking as an afterthought and craft built from the ground up with docking ease at the forefront.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cruzan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cruzan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne of my engineering courses covered this type of grading/scoring when doing design selection for a project. Assigning weights (or point multipliers) to individual categories is extremely important, otherwise you\u0027ll have one category that has a very large effect on the outcome when you might not want it to. This is also important if one category has more smaller components to it, like maybe docking has 6 things that are being tested and scored, but Range/Performance only has one thing.\u003Cp\u003E....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d recommend any judges using a point based system to consider adding a weighting system to their scoring!

I\u0027m still ok with the weight I\u0027ve given docking, but halfway through I\u0027m aware that some points are too easy to lose, some points too easy to gain. By and large it seems to be doing a reasonable job (in my mind) of creating bands of great/good/average/iffy but every now and again when something scores particularly high or low I find myself comparing it to other entries gaining similar scores and being a tad disappointed that (eg) this low scoring craft which my gut instinct quite likes has scored much worse than another craft which hit the right buttons on the points system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrouble is, as you allude to, whilst the points system is an attempt to be objective (and more importantly in this instance, an attempt to assess a huge number of craft in a reasonable time frame) - it\u0027s been created by me and betrays the same priorities I had in building my own entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MiniMatt","CreatedById":78749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T12:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rhomphaia\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rhomphaia\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo instead, anyone else having a strange problem with the version of the Gecko from the save file where the name box is missing from the SPH (downloading separately is OK, just the save file version.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep - had exactly the same.
