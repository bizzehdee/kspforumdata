Make sure that before you launch yourself in this, you know exactly where you\u0027re going, why, and what exactly you want to achieve, else you might end in some other mod\u0027s shadow. It\u0027s also much much safer to start small. If you have some coding experience, that\u0027s a good start. Otherwise, start learning C#,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eoutside\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of KSP. It\u0027s far from the best learning environment. The addon development forum has a lot of links and info that can help you regardless of your situation. Start small and progressively work up the complexity of the things you\u0027re trying. It\u0027s definitely not impossible, but it sounds like a pretty large scale project that would take a lot of time and effort. If you throw yourself into it too fast, you\u0027ll discourage and likely drop the idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-03T11:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222391802\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131261\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454493775\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002262017\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, stupid_chris said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...

That\u0027s why overlaying sounds better. And yes it has been done, but not in the way you\u0027re thinking. FAR is essentially overlaying over the stock aero system. It nullifies the stock system, and pushes it\u0027s own forward. It\u0027s the same idea. Deactivate the original, add your own over. For major changes to how the tech tree would work, that\u0027s likely easier than modifying the original tree\u0027s mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222392105\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131261\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454515151\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022149951\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yorou\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Yorou said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for all your input.
