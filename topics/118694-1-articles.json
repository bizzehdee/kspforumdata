I thought that it was a bit expensive so I went about adapting a lifter I had designed \u0027back in the day\u0027. The original lifter, the Socrates was semi reusable; the lower stage was completely normal but the upper stage could deorbit and land at KSC. I updated it and now both stages are recoverable. It can lift around 20t to LKO (100km) and return to KSC for about 690 funds per ton. Surprisingly it was cheaper, faster and more fun to fly than the Raven. Yey!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut bigger is always better and more boosterz is always a good thing, so I decided to build a heavy version of the Socrates. It ended up being able to lift about 60t to LKO and return both it\u0027s stages to KSC for around 660 funds per ton!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m amazed that building bigger can actually be cheaper!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I was curious what kind of per ton cost you guys are getting out of your SSTOs what with the new update causing all sorts of havoc for spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T17:49:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy best SSTO can do about 15t to Minimus for about 400 kredits/t.
