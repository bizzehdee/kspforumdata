Plant a flag from an unmanned landing probe. I don\u0027t play career, so maybe there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this not being in game, but often I launch probes back into orbit and there is currently no way to mark the spot unless I stage like the moon lander. Another use ties in with my other request, marking a landing spot for future resource mining without sending a crew. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When running a survey scan for resources, the stock game doesn\u0027t give an option to mark the best spots. When I switch back to the orbiting lander it is difficult to recall the resource locations. There needs to be a way to set a marker or copy and paste coordinates from the scanner to the lander. What we have now is a good start but not complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Divico","CreatedById":119955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T17:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104758-1-0-4-Waypoint-Manager-v2-4-2-2015-07-31\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWaypoint Manager\u003C/a\u003E lets you create custom markers (see last pic in the album).
