It\u0027s actually really simple to see them, I\u0027ve seen a lot in my short life. Of course, I never used some of the electronic DIY gadgets that we have today that can help a lot. What you want to do is you need to look up at the sky at night, when it\u0027s totally clear. Of course, before this you want to prepare your video camera, and a tip is that the lower the resolution, the higher the chance you\u0027ll see a UFO. Now, you just watch, and you repeat until you find a UFO. Of course, you\u0027ll want to walk around, especially on a road, as aliens and UFO\u0027s are interested in these patterns. If you look long enough, especially on Interstate highways, then you\u0027re sure to find one, if not tens or hundreds of UFO\u0027s. Now, a great way to see if you have a UFO is if the object is very big, looks heavy, and has two or four very bright lights surrounded by a lot of orange ones, with some red ones turning on randomly, occasionally, and for short, 2-10 second intervals. Also, you don\u0027t want to give up, as UFO\u0027s pass by every day and night, and it may be fruitful to look for them in the daytime too now that I\u0027m thinking about it. If you can\u0027t then that\u0027s alright, there are still plenty of UFO\u0027s at night. Another defining characteristic of UFOs is that they all have radios and they speak in codes with the number \u002210\u0022 in them. They can also sound like anything, and some of the speak in broken English and even in other languages. Now, if you\u0027ve followed all the steps, and especially looked straight up while on a road at night, then you\u0027re almost guaranteed to find a Unionized Freightliner Operator, but most people know them as Union Truck Drivers. Although, the UFO will most likely find and hit \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eyou\u003C/span\u003E, but that\u0027s a given in the world of UFO hunting. You may also be tempted to find a Universally-slow Filesystem Operator, but you can find a load of them at any government office, and they are not real UFO\u0027s anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T19:19:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 07:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:19:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was raised in the 60\u0027s in the country right close to 4 AFB so I\u0027ve seen lots of UFO\u0027s.
