The procedural mesh generation is working pretty well, and fairings now also implement the same CargoBay module used in the cargo bay parts to handle shielding the payload inside. Payload handling itself was rewritten (just today in fact) to prevent cases where multiple cargo bays would enclose the same part. This is an expected case, the most easily explained version being a ship where a small bay is nested inside a larger one, with the smaller containing a part. This payload is then shielded by two parts, and opening just one doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t necessarily mean it would be exposed. To solve this, the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153shieldedFromAirstream\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 flag we had before was replaced by a more comprehensive system where parts are aware of shielding components which contain them, and are only considered unshielded when all airstream shields are removed.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Still on the subject of CargoBays, there was an open issue before I got into fairings about how they would handle their open fore and aft sections. Cargo bays can be extended, which means the CargoBay module must also be able to handle these properly. Without any special treatment, the open ends of the bays would cause edge cases where parts placed outside the bay in just the right places would be incorrectly flagged as being shielded. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been fixed now, and the solution works not just to allow multiple cargo bays, it also supports nested bays, and allows fairings to be \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153closed\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 on to arbitrary surfaces, using that surface\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s colliders as part of its own enclosure.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That last bit means that interstage fairings are now fully supported. When building a fairing, you can close it either by placing a cross-section of minimum radius, which will close the fairing with a tip section, or you can place a cross section at the surface of a part. If the part is flush with the fairing (i.e. you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not trying to plug a round hole with a square peg), the fairing will allow you to close it off at any point mid-ship. This should allow you to build Apollo-like designs, where the LEM was housed inside the interstage fairing, among many other possibilities.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The placeholder part I was using has now given way to not one but three new fairing parts: 1.25m, 2.5m and 3m fairing bases, to allow as many different designs as possible, without putting too much \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153responsibility\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 onto a single part. And worry not about memory usage, all three parts share the same textures.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Oh, and in response to a discussion that flared out from the last notes: \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;procedural \u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;means a mesh that is created by code, as opposed to one that is imported from file. Not to be confused with random or pseudo-random (seeded) generation, which is a separate subject entirely, although frequently used together with proc meshes, which I guess is where the confusion might stem from. The fairings aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t random in any way, but their meshes (with exception of the base piece) are generated \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;procedurally\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; based on the input they are given (the list of cross-sections you placed).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Alex (aLeXmOrA):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Last week I have a discussion with the guys at TeacherGaming in order to set the new requirements for the KerbalEdu license system. There are still some issues to improve and small things to add that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to be working on. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Mike (Mu): \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been ploughing on with the re-entry and aerodynamic heating effects. As a byproduct of this I have rewritten the thermal management of vessels so that heat is transferred more realistically and evenly throughout. Rather than temperature being a driving factor, the system is based on energy transfer and the thermal mass of parts. A full fuel tank will have a much higher thermal mass than an empty one and, of course, different fuels have different specific heat capacities. Energy is also transferred to/from the environment via both conduction and radiation.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In some down time, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also put some time into a small optimization pass. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve fixed some big memory leaks with the scatter system and the part action menus. Managed to push some more performance from a variety of core systems. I also added a simple performance monitor into the debug menu.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Marco (Samssonart):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nice to finally be able to talk about that secret project, you may have already caught that \u0026lt;a href=\u0022http://\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;EUCL3D AMA\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; last Friday, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working with the Eucl3d guys to have a .craft file parser so you can have your favorite ships 3d printed for you to have on your desk, or hang from your ceiling. Apart from the help to get that system running I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m working on the game side of the 3d printing process, the idea is to give you options, you can request a print directly from the game or you can just upload the .craft file to Eucl3d\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s website for they to take care of it. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re still deciding on a few implementation details, but my work on that part is almost done. Phew, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nice to get that off my chest.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been also continuing with the tutorials, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m taking care of a bug in the asteroid tutorials where fuel lines aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t working correctly and also working on implementing the docking tutorial. The patcher is gone to the bench for this week, there hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t been enough time to test it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Daniel (danRosas):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been full speed ahead on the new animation.

For the most part this work has been involving fixing non critical ui related issues and spelling errors. I also haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seen any real programming exceptions with the ui yet, which is a good thing, because those tend to crash the game for silly reasons. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The hardest part of writing tests for this system is to figure out what constitutes a design concern. It gets tricky fast because whether it is an error or not depends on what you intend to use the rocket for. Consider missing parachutes. There is no way to determine whether a vessel is never supposed to land (ie. no parachute required in the first place). Or the case where you use a single docking port on your vessel to release a probe Not an error in itself, but the released probe will likely not have docking capabilities. Still not an error because it could be a satellite. And what if you intended to land that \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cthing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.

I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also been coordinating with our fantastic team of modmaker cooperators (need a flashier name for that) and have seen some magnificent progress on all areas. Frizzank is working on killer IVAs, Porkjet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s parts are at the usual level of extreme quality we have come to expect, and Arsonide\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ideas for the contract system and its growth just make me think that if that dude ever makes a game, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be first in line to buy it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On a not particularly similar topic, we are thrilled to see the release of Unity 5, and look forward to digging into it once we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve released 1.0, as development on the next update is far too advanced now to throw something as complex as an engine update on top of it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Ted (Ted):\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; It has been a very busy day here, if not a very busy week! We\u2019ve taken a hold on testing the Engineer App to begin QA on Resources today. Engineer App QA was going excellently with the issue count being high, but severity very low - which is always a nice sign that it\u2019s really only tweaking and refinement that it needed. Overall things in QA are going nicely, we\u2019ve had a look over the aerodynamics overhaul refinements that a number of the members of the QA Team have expertly worked on and refined and we\u2019re hopeful that we can implement a number of them, if not all.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Additionally, it was pretty awesome to see the craft files I sent the Eucl3d guys (via Marco) appear in reality!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Lastly, work on the Patcher with Marco has taken a little break as things get busier here and we need to be more careful with how we spend our time (no going down rabbit holes of Python library dependency issues on OSX just yet).

As a byproduct of this I have rewritten the thermal management of vessels so that heat is transferred more realistically and evenly throughout. Rather than temperature being a driving factor, the system is based on energy transfer and the thermal mass of parts. A full fuel tank will have a much higher thermal mass than an empty one and, of course, different fuels have different specific heat capacities. Energy is also transferred to/from the environment via both conduction and radiation.\u003Cp\u003EIn some down time, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also put some time into a small optimization pass.
