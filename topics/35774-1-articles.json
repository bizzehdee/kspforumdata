I have not yet got a copy of Kerbal Space Program, but hopefully I will have very soon. I just have a few questions before I purchase it. I live in the UK, and I noticed that the game price is set in $ and not in \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3, will this effect me in anyway when I purchase the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I am going to pay be using the \u0027Paysafecard\u0027 option, and not the Paypal option because I don\u0027t have an account for that. All I want to know is if \u0027Paysafecard\u0027 is safe to use. I have never tried it, that\u0027s why I am a bit nervous and unsure whether to use it or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for the help.

With the latest Alpha version, you will have many more rocket parts available, the ability to build aircraft, and a rather extensive solar system to explore. Start out with probes to build up your flight and construction experience, then send the Kerbals out to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T19:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xiphos","CreatedById":60680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T20:03:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!
