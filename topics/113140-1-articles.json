I downloaded it, and stupidly just copy/pasted the three subfolders (Icons, etc) into GameData separately, instead of copying the folder. I booted up KSP, and it said MechJeb had been installed incorrectly. A quick Google search later and I was hitting myself, and I deleted those three folders, then copy/pasted in the folder \u0022MechJeb2\u0022 from my downloads into GameData, with those three folders installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game then booted up fine, and I went to hit \u0022Resume Saved Game\u0022, and absolutely nothing happened. It just doesn\u0027t do anything (starting a new game works fine). OK, I thought, let\u0027s just uninstall the bugger. So I deleted the MechJeb2 folder, and booted up the game again - exact same problem. I can\u0027t even get to the menu of current games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like my saved games, and want to play them more. Do you guys have any tips on how to fix this? Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
