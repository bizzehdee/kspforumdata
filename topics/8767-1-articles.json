I\\\u0027ve been playing Kerbal Space Program for quite some time now (not sure which version I played first) and have finally decided to join the community and I have recently purchased the newest update. I come from the Blockland Forums as with several others that I know/have seen (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8381.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGadgethm\u003C/a\u003E \u0026amp; Gojira). I am actually Russian but I moved to the US (specifically California) at six years old and unfortunately, as a result, reading and writing in Russian is a bit tough. On top of that, I don\\\u0027t know any of the modern slang used by Russians nowadays. I\\\u0027m mentioning this because I noticed that there is what seems like an extensive Russian community on these forums. I think KSP is absolutely brilliant and hope the devs keep up the great work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, picture:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/25445465/screenshot0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-28T00:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gadgethm","CreatedById":18243,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-28T01:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHe has arrived!
