(I understand that I must use it when I press the IJKL keys.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS has 2 primary uses: rotating huge, long ships and lifters, and translating small-ish ships for docking. Often, the same ship needs to do both at different points in its flight. In use, RCS draws fuel from all tanks equally so the issue is always making sure the payload keeps its RCS tanks full despite RCS use during ascent to rotate the lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several ways to do this, all of which require some intervention on your part. But all methods require additional RCS tanks on the lifter, which supply the fuel for pre-docking RCS use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMethod 1: Tweakables\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis method is stock. In the VAB, right-click on the payload\u0027s RCS tanks and turn them off. During flight, these tanks won\u0027t be used so the payload will have full RCS tanks upon separation of the final ascent stage. However, you\u0027ll now have to turn these tanks back on, either by right-clicking them or assigning that to an action group. NOTE: in the VAB, tweaking follows symmetry so if you have multiple tanks installed via symmetry, 1 tweak will turn them all off. But in flight, you have to turn on each tank individually with right-clicks unless you assign them all to the same action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMethod 2: MOAR Boosters\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis method is also stock. Make your lifter a bit over-powered so the last ascent stage is still attached to the payload after the circularization burn. Then, prior to jettisoning this stage, manually pump mono from the ascent tanks to the payload tanks. Has to be done individually for each payload tank. But OTOH, you can also put a probe core in the ascent stage, so that after separation, it can use its remaining fuel to deorbit, thus eliminating debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMethod 3: Pumping During Ascent--STOCK\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can only be done stock if both the payload and the ascent stage have only 1 mono tank each, which normally means using the in-line tanks, which are way overkill for most purposes. Anyway, before launch, use ALT-right-click to set up mono to flow into the payload tank, then launch. The drawback here is, not only are you having to lift more weight than you need, but you\u0027ll have the ugly right-click menus on top of your rocket during the whole ascent, and you can\u0027t move the camera without stopping the process and having to restart it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMethod 4: Pumping During Ascent--Modded\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, you have TAC Fuel Balancer or something similar. Before launch, set the payload\u0027s tanks to transfer in, then launch. The advantages over Method 3 are that this works regardless of the number of RCS tanks involved so you can use little ones, you don\u0027t have right-click menus visible the whole time, and can freely move the camera without stopping the pumping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that in general, even mondo lifters won\u0027t need more than 2, maybe 4, of the small, roundified RCS tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
