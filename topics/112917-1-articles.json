After trying everything else I decided Jeb would fix it via EVA. After exiting the part of the craft outside the fairing suddenly there was a shudder and When I blinked it was just Jeb (no ship) and he was dropping like a rock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought well hey I get to try landing a Kerbal by themselves in the ocean I was so convienantly above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell it turned out his tragetory was a little steeper than it should have been. At about 55k the flames starting showing and by 30k he was positively glowing something similar to an old air brake around Jool. This unfortunately ended with a puff of smoke at 25km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody else unintentionally (or intentionally) try the heat resistance of a lone Kerbal?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s I vote that the badass characteristic should include heat invulnerability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaurdsman111","CreatedById":104162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T09:16:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI myself had a massive scare with Jeb during two of my space flights. On the first, i thought i\u0027d be clever and get an EVA report at 7\u0027000M, and of course, Jeb got sucked off the ladder and into the air. As he plummeted towards the ground (grinning all the way) i desperately tried to find a way to keep him alive. I came to the decision that all i could do was slow his descent with his rcs to make his impact lighter so be able to recover more of him. Amazingly, when he impacted with the water he sank 10 meters, but didn\u0027t explode, and was recoverable!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second time, i opened the parachute too early in the descent and it was torn off by the G forces, leaving the craft wildly tumbling towards the sea. I remembered what happened last time, and tried the same thing, climbing Jeb out at a safer 3\u0027000M and using his pack, manage to slow him down enough to repeat the first incident. Of course, both times the shuttle (and science gatherings) were destroyed, but Jeb is far more important, right?
