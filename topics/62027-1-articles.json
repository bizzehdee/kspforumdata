I haven\u0027t seen any sign of awareness of it here, though, so I thought I\u0027d bring it up for discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem with space travel is taking that first step into orbit- between gravity and atmosphere, earth is one of the hardest celestial bodies in our solar system to lift off from, and one of the most expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been various ideas for how to reduce the cost of getting to orbit, the most commonly known of which is the Clark Elevator. But JP aerospace is working on what I believe to be a much more practical option than dangling a cable from geosynch- instead of fighting atmo and gravity both, use one against the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Airship to Orbit program is a tiered set of airships, each designed for a different level of the atmosphere. The Ascender takes cargo through the turbulent atmosphere near the surface to the edge of the atmosphere, almost entirely by buoyancy control- the mass of the cargo is almost irrelevant, except as it requires a larger gasbag that may be more difficult to control going through, for instance, the jet stream and other currents. Once at the edge of space (100,000 to 120,000 feet, I believe), it transfers cargo (by a dedicated high atmosphere rig they call the Dark Sky Station) to another airship- the Orbital Airship. Built at 100,000 feet and never intended to operate below that height, concerns of turbulence and gas pressure can be thrown out the window. A multi-kilometer aerodynamic lifting body filled with just enough hydrogen or helium to equalize the miniscule pressures at that altitude, the airship once again makes the mass of the cargo almost irrelevant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the orbital airship launches, it works something like this- it\u0027s propelled by high ISP, low thrust motors (they\u0027re testing MHD rigs now). As the airship moves, the huge gasbag interacts with the thin atmosphere, generating aerodynamic lift to carry the airship higher than buoyancy alone could manage. As the airship gets higher, the atmosphere thins, reducing drag and enabling the airship to go even faster, which loops back to more altitude and still more speed. After about a week, near orbital velocity is generating as much lift as the remaining atmosphere, and in a few more days, the airship is solidly in low earth orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not fast, but compared to lifting into orbit aboard a stack of high explosive, it\u0027s incredibly cheap, reliable, and as reusable as a semi truck, able to conduct multiple launches and landings between routine maintenance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the theory. Apparently the math checks out. All that remains are the engineering details- which the JP Aerospace team have been working out as they\u0027ve got the funding to work on it. Their current projects are MHD testing, working out how the upper atmosphere rig will maneuver, and building a submarine to test life support and buoyancy control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and while they\u0027re sending tests to the edge of space anyway, they rent advertizing space and set aside experimental payload volume to schools and colleges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.facebook.com/jpaerospace?sk=wall\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.facebook.com/jpaerospace?sk=wall\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://jpaerospace.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://jpaerospace.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T08:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont think that would work, hydrogen (or helium) loss would be a huge problem.

However, even if the final stage orbital ascender can achieve a true air speed that is a significant fraction of orbital velocity before it hits a \u0022max q\u0022 barrier, it could be useful as a rocketoon solution. At 250,000 feet a true air speed of 3km/s or ~10000km/h would probably give you a heat stress \u0026lt; mach 4 at sea level, I think. That may be achievable, in which case the orbital ascender could be used as a sub-orbital rendezvous platform. A rocket powered craft can aerobrake down from orbit, pick up fuel and payload and accelerate back into orbit. Aerobrake will be relatively easy for a small light craft that only descends with at most the same payload it takes up, ie no fuel. In the case of a missed rendezvous, it could drop its payload and have enough shielding to fully deorbit for a surface landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think at 250,000ft and 3k/ms, delta v budget for orbit would be about 5km/s. In that case a 1 ton craft with fuel and almost 1 ton payload would weigh about 6 tons fully fueled. This assumes LH2/L0X rocket with Isp 450, which is maybe a bit ambitious, but BlueOrigin are already done serious and successful research into affordable multiple firing LH2/LOX rockets, which should give an Isp well over 400 at 250,000 feet and higher. Hence, it seems that the maths might just stack up if the logistics can be realistically made to pay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, that current research into flyback boosters and air launch rockets tends to suggest that it should be easier to make these systems work and be much cheaper than previous generation launch systems. That may be true but a viable space economy will require a lot of \u0022dumb mass\u0022, much of which will be in the form of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon etc (probably at least 75%). Sending thousands of tons of that up to orbit from the surface, using rockets or even using skytrams or ram accelerators involves a certain amount of \u0022violence\u0022 that tends to preclude 100% re-usability of these systems. Using airships to get to 250,000 ft and 3km/s doesn\u0027t seem like much of a gain for the logistical headache involved, but on reflection, I think it could be well worth it., and perhaps the only economically viable solution available any time soon. For a pipeline to space that can continually supply thousands of tons per year or more there is the possibility to harvest water and volatiles from the stratosphere and miss out the lower steps of the pipeline.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-22T20:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat to see that there\u0027s already a thread on this, even though it\u0027s old.

Even if it ends up not working, I am already entertained and inspired by the mere thought of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, he described their engines as \u0022chemical-electric hybrid linear accelerators\u0022. Wut? It\u0027s an engine with a solid fuel, and a liquid oxidizer, and an elongated electric plasma acceleration stage after the combustion chamber. Around 1000s specific impulse, but with much better thrust output than pure electric engines. How cool is that? It\u0027s the kind of mad scientist engineering that makes me grin really wide. And they\u0027re doing it in a shed, with material from the hardware store.
