Yet, in KSP 1 there was never a real purpose to do anything (although this is maybe an interesting comment on real-life spaceflight ;D). You can land on planetary bodies or put stuff in orbit, but there is almost nothing to explore, there is no purpose in bringing stuff and kerbals there.

To the contrary, currently it allows even less gameplay possibilities than the original and reproduces bugs that are well known to probably all ambitious KSP 1 players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me this means that a true successor is further away than ever as there seems to have been no development on the foundation of the game (at least none, that lead to a true improvement of the issues of KSP 1) and there probably won\u0027t be any true successor for many years to come after this, so far, lost opportunity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T17:16:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know all you mentioned is planned to be added?

Usually when gamers mean they should switch engines, they mean to switch to UE5 since there was a lot of marketing targeted specifically at gamers for that release, so I assume this is the engine you are alluding to. But considering UE5 wasn\u0027t production ready when KSP2 was originally going to launch, it would have likely been on UE4 if they did change anyways. This would give you the same Nvidia Physx Engine (minus custom code from KSP1 - which may or may not work or be needed in UE) and the same 32 bit world space issue, and problems with KSP sized worlds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if for some reason (especially looking at how release went) they did switch to UE5 mid-production for something like 64bit world space, that feature only came out of experimental with 5.1 a couple months ago so there would\u00A0likely be extensive teething issues during development. They would also need to learn and get Chaos Physics working from scratch as both Unity and UE4 use(d) Nvidia PhysX but UE5 uses Epics new engine (or port their custom one if there was). Not to mention they would still need to do everything that was done already for KSP2 in a new editor and language.

KSP2 looks perfectly fine for an alpha. It just needs work, and most of that work is perfectly straightforward -- optimize the assets here, replace a stinky algorithm there, tune this bunch of parameters until they feel right, put tech art to work on the cloud cover, and fix a mountain of bugs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSave the heartbreak for later if they never manage to get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-02T18:41:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2023 06:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Periple\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Manul","CreatedById":189366,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T18:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224250026\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214216\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677779912\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022116848\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SimonTheSkink\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n36 minutes ago, SimonTheSkink said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you underestimate the difficulty of making a game engine from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommercial developers do have a source access to the engine, that\u0027s why using Unity doesn\u0027s necessarily mean using PhysX as is.
