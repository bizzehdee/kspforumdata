First was the LH2-fueled SWERV-powered transfer stage, and then the methalox-fueled lander. Docked in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, transferred to Duna system and made orbit around Ike. Undocked and landed on Ike, then took off, rendezvoused and docked again, and after messing around in Duna space, headed back to Kerbin. I made orbit around Kerbin and separated the lander from the transfer stage. After undocking the staging was all confused and showing no available \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E despite the propellant tanks having plenty. I fiddled around by creating and deleting some dummy stages, dragging the engine into one of them along the way. Somehow, the engine ended\u00A0 up being duplicated in the staging list even though there\u0027s only one engine on the lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Esoj7gU.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Esoj7gU.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
