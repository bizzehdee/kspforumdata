I did this by pushing the Kerbal up with the jetpack thrusters, he lifted his feet a little (guess that\u0027s intended), but when I stopped pushing, he didn\u0027t get back down to the ground and stood a couple of centimeters above ground, this could be repeated several times and in the end he was about half a meter up or so. It does not work further, as he kind of hits a hard level when meeting a certain hight and falls back down to his half a meter standing point. This effect also eliminates itself when he starts to walk, he slowly comes down to ground, like he\u0027s going down some stairs.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022502\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079052487157362699/1079052539061862500/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stoup","CreatedById":2804,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T03:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes he stomp around in a somewhat goofy manner?
