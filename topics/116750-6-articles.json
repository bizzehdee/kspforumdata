To implement this they could say attitude control is removed but throttle control remains (or vice versa), but that doesn\u0027t make much logical sense. So, the most reasonable solution seems to be some form of \u0022programming\u0022 of the probe. Allowing it to execute maneuver nodes is likely the best way as tater most recently mentioned, and for the reasons he gave. But given that the current probe control mechanics limit which can be used for SAS functions, it could end up that only some probes can be \u0022programmed\u0022 at all. If that\u0027s the case, I hope it\u0027s only the very early one or two probe cores which lack that functionality.\n\nFor science transmissions, the solution\u0027s probably obvious to anyone: No transmissions without line of sight to Kerbin or another probe which itself has line of sight to Kerbin.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What I am saying is that there are other ways to simulate partial control other than \u0027signal delay and a flight computer\u0027, simple as that.\n\nCare to elaborate on those other ways?

Consider a few aspects of how real space flight and communications issues are dealt with.\n\nGround based communications is really very good and very extensive. I can buy a satellite dish that can receive signals from a satellite in geosynchronous orbit for a price that is affordable to your average consumer. The ability to get signals to and from Earth\u0027s surface to low orbit satellites is, frankly, trivial.\n\nGround based communications are also able to get signals to and from probes a very long way away is possible without space-based communications relays. The Voyager probes are both far beyond the height of aphelion of Pluto, and we are able to send commands to them and receive data back from them using ground based communications facilities. \n\nSpace probes can be programmed with complex manoeuvres in advance, and execute complex flight profiles autonomously without direct command from mission control. For example the atmospheric entry, parachute descent and sky-crane landing of the Curiosity rover on Mars was all executed based on flight programs uploaded to the craft in advance. The signal delay between Earth and Mars made direct control impossible anyway.\n\nIf you want to impose \u0022realistic\u0022 constraints on KSP, therefore, if you are going to be able to execute the kinds of missions we see happening in the real solar system, we also need \u0022realistic\u0022 tools to overcome those constraints. That means something probably more complex than kOS, and the ability to simulate missions in advance of executing them. While that is definitely realistic, I\u0027m not sure it is fun.\n\nThe question, then, is where is the right balance between realism and fun?"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T17:33:01Z","Content":"The game already has a mechanism for locking you out of using maneuver nodes. Right now you need at least one upgrade in the tracking station and one upgrade in the mission control. So there must be code for this already.\n\nA pseudo-realistic way of dealing with occlusion, signal delay, etc. would simply be that you can\u0027t make a maneuver node for a probe unless you A) have a signal path back to mission control, and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) have enough time to get the message from mission control to the ship before the node. (It\u0027s silly to ignore B, but it sounds like Roverdude is going to insist on doing that. But A could still be implemented.)\n\nThe other aspect of this could be that you can only control probes with maneuver nodes. Also, you could go a step further and say all hand-flying of probe engines is disallowed. Give all probes the \u0022point to node\u0022 SAS mode, give all probes a very simple autopilot that only executes node burns, and require all probe maneuvering to be by use of nodes. That would simulate remote control from the ground pretty well without requiring any special flight computers. You just use the same maneuver node system players already know, but robot probes would fly the nodes robotically. That makes sense to me!\n\nYou could still allow probes to be launched by hand if you made a sphere around Kerbin (say 100 km) where probes were allowed to be flown by hand.\n\nThis would make soft-landing probes on distant bodies very difficult, however. But there would be mods for that.

Bingo, you effectively have full perfect autopilot everywhere, something Squad has been against since forever. I also can\u0027t think of any good in-game justification why it would ONLY work while probes are occluded. Furthermore, the maneuver node system as-is is insufficient for landing burns.\n\u003E Such a system would also prevent things from going hilariously wrong. When the player performs a burn there\u0027s always the chance the burn isn\u0027t perfect. Hitting the wrong key, drifting off course, getting the timing wrong, etc. And this is, arguably, what a lot of KSP is about. Sure, a lot of people play KSP closer to a Sim, but for those people there\u0027s mods.\n\nAdd in communications delay. The simplest way is to disallow making a node any closer to the present position of the craft than 2X the time delay (1 delay time interval for the craft to report exact last status, etc, the next for the program to be sent). \n\nThe skill in \u0022piloting\u0022 in KSP is making the maneuver nodes, not executing them, IMO. I\u0027ve always found it absurd that you can\u0027t order a modern craft to point in direction x, and burn for precisely XX seconds. Note that the engines can have a spool up/down time that would create some gray area around node execution. Assume the auto-execution uses ONLY full throttle, perhaps.
