Kerbal 4 ran through almost all the basic maneuvers for a Munar mission - travelling to the Mun, separating the lander from the booster stage, Munar orbit insertion. Everything worked perfectly. I left the Mun Lander in a 30 km equatorial orbit around the Mun and returned the Kerbal 4 crew back to Kerbin. Kerbal 5 - either tomorrow or Friday, not sure when I\u0027ll have the time - will be the big event!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cesarcurado","CreatedById":60073,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T01:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETried docking again, no success \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso set up my new \u0022 Kerbal Orbital Lab \u0026amp; Base (K.O.L.B.)\u0022 which is basically a space station in a fancy name.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T04:01:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToday I decided to send a Kerbal \u002B rover combo to pretty much the only planet/moon I haven\u0027t yet, Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/eeloo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eeloo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Bob Kerman was feeling more cheerful than usual.
