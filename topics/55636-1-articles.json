You want to always be staying around the local terminal velocity (note for your next ship -- if you can exceed terminal velocity, that means you have too much thrust). Then you pitch over, and thenceforth follow a gravity turn. The atmosphere stops just before 97km, so make that your apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T03:20:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving taken off from Eve sea level -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to add SRBs.
