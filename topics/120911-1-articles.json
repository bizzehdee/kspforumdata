This means that there\u0027s no way of predicting an object\u0027s position at a given time without calculating all the intermediate steps. This rules out trajectory prediction and warp.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EFrom what I\u0027ve heard Principia does it OK. True problems will arise if you want to predict an encounter with Eeloo after going round the Sun five times but for reasonable duration journeys I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s an issue. The Principia folks state that timewarp above 100,000x, such as in RSS, is slow, but the stock game tops out at 100,000x anyway.\n"}]}
