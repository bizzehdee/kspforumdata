I\u0027ve listened to pretty much all of them until the last couple years (I\u0027d say certainly all, but I might have missed one). The storytelling is still good (I like This American Life, as well), but when I see \u0022radiolab\u0022 I think \u0022science,\u0022 (the Sloan Foundation blurb about supporting science and technology in the modern world every episode reinforces this) and when it turns out to be another political rant, I get POed. If they want to do non-science, fine, spin it off (don\u0027t play the SCOTUS ones as radiolab, for example), or make a TAL sort of show for those topics. I know what I\u0027m in for with TAL, I just don\u0027t like the bait and switch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-30T12:42:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2018 12:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-01T06:56:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223367751\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174396\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221525092048\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndon\u0027t play the SCOTUS ones as radiolab\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really enjoy the SCOTUS ones, but on their own.\u00A0 I understand they are playing them to give you a taste, but they may do it too often.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
