Other ships just follow the orbit path perfectly (\u0027on rails\u0027), even if that path takes it through the atmosphere. They will normally stop if they fly directly into a planet (though on high warp I have seen a vessel manage to go right through Kerbin, it must have been on one side in the 1st frame, and had enough velocity to be calculated on the other side the next frame, resulting in no collision).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo aerobrake two vessels at once they would need to be flying close formation, and to be honest I think it would be quite hard since differences in mass or orbit would quickly compound any difference in velocity, moving them apart. I deal with the same issue when returning my science samples as seperate craft - I need to wait until I\u0027m low enough that I can deploy all the chutes around the same time, so that differences in descent velocity don\u0027t pull the ships more then 2.5km apart (in the atmosphere any ship that goes 2.5km away from the active vessel just vanishes from existence)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sorcie","CreatedById":61164,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T14:29:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks I had assumed just a limitation of physics calculations for the active ship.
