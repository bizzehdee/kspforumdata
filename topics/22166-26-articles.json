I also don\u0027t know the methods you\u0027re using to calculate the inefficiencies. But working on my theory and numbers, the converter can only do so much work in total, but, each conversion process \u0022probably\u0022 doesn\u0027t chew 100% of the work load the converter is capable of handling, which means that only a certain volume of Kethane is going to get converted per work cycle. So if we say that converting Kethane to Liquid Fuel or Oxidizer individually uses 95% of the available work load, that 5% becomes idle and a loss for that cycle. In order to keep the converter from over heating running multiple jobs, you have to reduce the amount of work each conversion process outputs in order to maintain the 100% efficiency. So work done for each would be 50% output. Now you\u0027re using 100% of processing capabilities, which means that each process gets an additional 2.5% of work. (Taking that extra 5% idle time and splitting it between the two processes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words you have 95% of the work load for a single job. When you introduce a second job, you half the 95% which becomes 47.5%. Since one full conversion cycle of Kethane can take more than 47.5% of the work load, we\u0027d get an additional 2.5% work to bring that up to 50%, which means a net bonus to BOTH conversion jobs time wise. The converter is working now working at 100%, you\u0027re converting as much Kethane as possible running multiple jobs since now you\u0027re not idling the converter. You don\u0027t get more or less for your money, but, you do get it faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes that make sense?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-09T10:47:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2013 10:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Pontiac\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T10:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pontiac\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pontiac\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe author specifically stated that the current version is a Dev Build and NOT to be put on SpacePort until he\u0027s decided that this version is a completed version.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re thinking of a different author.
