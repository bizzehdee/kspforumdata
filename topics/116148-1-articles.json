However, playing the game, launching one or two small ships (career, so we\u0027re talking 30 part count type ships here, nothing major), the ram usage creeps up. My last test I\u0027ve timed it for 12 min to go from 2.6gb to 3.1 gb used.

I was afraid that the answer was going to be something along those lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you said scene changes I tried flipping between ships by use of the map and switching from vessel to vessel rather than going back to the space center, then to tracking, then to the ship. That seems to have helped somewhat since I\u0027m not changing the scene quite so frequently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo because of that I\u0027m going to call this as a workaround. If you want to swap between ships, try and use the map view to do so as much as possible. I would also say that you should try to find a way to monitor your memory usage, and save and restart the game once you get close to the limit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T13:39:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92907\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGraphic Memory Monitor\u003C/a\u003E \u002B \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105399-0-90-S-A-V-E-automatic-backup-system-0-9-9-281\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESAVE\u003C/a\u003E is my preferred solution.
