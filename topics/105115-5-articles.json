That\u0027s been the whole point of the complaints of going to 1.0 and introducing so many new things without playtesting in the first place.\n\nI don\u0027t know about Das, but someone above mentioned that Scott might have run into mod-related bugs, which isn\u0027t really Squad\u0027s problem per se if he was using mods not actually designed for 1.0 yet. Also, experimentals is meant to be a play test. And let\u0027s be honest - KSP has gotten a heck of a lot more playtesting generally than I imagine a lot of AAA games get before release.\n\nAlso, **there will always be bugs**. Fixing bugs is, of course, always nice. But expecting a game devoid of bugs is just plain ridiculous. I mean, I find bugs in GTA V all the time and I\u0027m not in a rage yelling at them that it wasn\u0027t ready. I think most people who play games expect some minimal level of bugs. The larger concern is if they are bugs that seriously affect game play or not.\n\nAnd from a marketing perspective, let\u0027s be honest - would we really get this much hype out of a 1.0 release that was little more than a bugfix release?

But it\u0027s been an awesome game since 1.0 and the patching did not hurt it\u0027s reputation.\n\nKSP has been awesome since alpha. Eventually Suqad would have to bite the bullet and push 1.0 out. That was kinda my whole point, that no matter how hard you try to eliminate bugs, you will allways have some once you reach 1.0 because it will have by far the largest player base so far (though KSP is an anomaly in this case because it already has a large base and a long alpha period), and it\u0027s better to get it out of the way rather than go through several incremental bugfix releases. Such releases lack the momentum of a major release and can sometimes delay the problems rather than help.\n\nWhat was unfortunate about this release was that all excited KSP fans got to watch the bugs on streams but Squad had already put KSP in code-lock. But they\u0027re only human, and humans miss bugs in the code. A month from now everybody should have happy memories of finding new ways to crash new parts, and not the release issues.\n\nSquad could have helped themselves by reminding the fanbase that critical or numerous bugs were likely given what a major release this was going to be."},{"CreatedByName":"FleetAdmiralJ","CreatedById":73364,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T11:21:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Being critical and vocal about some issues is a good thing (like Round-8 case).\n\nI would add that the above case and the thing with Kerbal experiences were things that the community as a whole largely spoke up about, not just a few nay-sayers that Squad suddenly decided to listen to."},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T11:21:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I will have fun with the release client, and as long as squad is hurrying up fixing the bugs, i\u0027m fine with a buggy client.\n\u003E But, that being said: this is because i think KSP is one of the very, VERY few gems of the concept of early access. They got some credit in my book, that\u0027s why. To argue \u0022when was the last time you got a perfect release\u0022.. uhm, what? It\u0027s absolutely stupid to argue \u0022well, EA and other cashgrabbers throw crap into the market, so it\u0027s fine for others too - that\u0027s just how it is\u0022. No it\u0027s not how it is.

The wild variety of hardware we run our games on, the wild variety of software running underneath, the complexity of the code itself, you just can\u0027t expect a bug free game. So it is definitely how it is, not a result of giving up but because we humans have limits when it comes to analyzing every single aspect of a game in any of a myriad different software/hardware environments.\n\n\u003E Finally, someone who feels like I do.
