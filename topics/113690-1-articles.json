There was an interesting concept in there, the MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle): It lands empty and creates its fuel while on the surface waiting for the astronauts wanting to get back up into orbit (they land in a different vehicle). \n\nSo I tried it out. Turns out, my \u003E200 ton Eve return vehicle weighs only a little more than 100 tons after emptying it and slapping a refinery and drill on there. This makes getting it into space from Kerbin easier. It reduces dV requirements for transfer burns and it reduces risk during Eve descent. I am pretty sure you can use this concept on other planets with big dV requirements as well (Laythe comes to mind - or Tylo).\n\nSo here\u0027s my attempt of utilizing this concept for an Eve vehicle:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJByFCzNdlw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T10:24:17Z","Content":"When I get a better computer, I\u0027m gonna do the Jool-5 challenge in a single stage.\n\nLugging the refinery with me.
