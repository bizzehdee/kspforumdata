I finally tried my hand at making a plugin, even if I feel really in deep water without a manual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to start by introducing a little feature that I always wanted in KSP; the ability to turn SAS on and off separately for all the axes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe included plugin and part (an ASAS model tinted red... have mercy) do just that and nothing more; it replaces ASAS, allowing to toggle its action with the number keys (1=Pitch, 2=Roll, 3=Yaw)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have many ideas for further features and improvements, but it\\\u0027s probably not even worth talking about those until I learn how to code better... The GUI handling part is the one I know NOTHING about, and for now it\\\u0027s a mindless cut and paste job. The rest is pretty basic, repetitive, but I hope somewhat better (and extensible in the future).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t need you telling me how bad the code is: I\\\u0027m aware of that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I hope that somebody can give me pointers for improving. For example, I don\\\u0027t understand why the little status window is sometimes destroyed (correctly) when the part explodes, and sometimes not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe GUI drawing code looks really inefficient to me, like it\\\u0027s creating useless copies of some GUI types at every frame... but I cribbed it straight from MechJeb or the code snippets page in the Wiki. Is there a better way, or it\\\u0027s just that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough blabber; here it is, for whoever is interested, and after streamlining the GUI code I\\\u0027ll start thinking about improvements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA1:\u003C/strong\u003E split-axes ASAS, proof of concept, no GUI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003EA2:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E added a small talkback panel\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA3: better GUI (tbd)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.wuala.com/georgij.petrovich/Web/plugin%20KSP/?key=S4mBcnlphx2A\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.wuala.com/georgij.petrovich/Web/plugin%20KSP/?key=S4mBcnlphx2A\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evolution","CreatedById":19942,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-04T03:56:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a good idea for spaceplanes, or planes in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing as you could disable roll SAS and manually roll while your craft is kept straight, then engage it and disable pitch SAS and do wide turns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would need to get used to disabling/enabling the separate functions of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgtblazing","CreatedById":18265,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-04T20:22:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wish mechjeb had something like that for orbiter landings, pain in the ass to get a hope shuttle from orbit to the runway safely. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duke-49th","CreatedById":200569,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-05T00:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I try it out tomorrow...now I go to bed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goosey145","CreatedById":7969,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-10T07:29:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to tie in the qwe asd keys to toggle?
