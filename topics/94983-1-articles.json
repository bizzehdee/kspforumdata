Jet pack bug: Noticed right from the get go that once my plucky Kerbal got into orbit, upon EVA at anytime, the Jetpak does NOT work. If the Kerbal lets go, there\u0027s no way to jet back to the craft. He dies, she* dies; they all die. Any Kerbonaught CAN walk around on the ground and jump etc. Just in space, they have no jetpack activation despite showing a full load of mono.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Any science discovered and then TRANSMITTED does NOT (see note below) show up at the end of the mission. In other words, my career does not get credit for it. The only science values that I\u0027ve been able to keep are those that I save until a SAFE landing, then recover the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Noticed just tonight that after several successful missions, attempting to fly the Stayputnik into orbit failed twice, the third time I went by the numbers (I use a checklist for my launch platforms when I\u0027m trying to do something more precise) and it still failed. Why? Because it seems that Kerbal stopped rotating. Flying east, my orbit speed continually dropped. I tried a fourth time to fly west and got the same degrading effect -- a slowing down instead of speeding up, despite max throttle. After shutting the game down, it appears to have fixed whatever it was -- I can orbit once again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: #2 - After shutting the game down and starting up again, I did get science points for my items, but FAR from what was advertised at the time. While in orbit around the MUN, my green goop experiment showed \u002B15 for the experiment and \u002B9 for transmitting. The SC-9001 jr showed \u002B75 and \u002B30 respectively in the same orbit. According to these numbers, I should have picked up \u002B39 for the goop and \u002B90 for the science box for an expected total of \u002B129. At arrival after splashdown, I got \u002B62.8 for everything. The numbers aren\u0027t adding up anyway I slice it. (Pondering: Hope the Dev\u0027s aren\u0027t using Common Core to figure the totals... ) I noticed early in playing the game that the expected totals and actuals were off...but now after playing several hours, they\u0027re either way off or I\u0027m misreading what I\u0027m seeing on the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I don\u0027t see a reply that \u0022these are known bugs\u0022 (and please, show me the place where all the KNOWN bugs are, because it always just takes me to the submit a new bug page.) -- Hearing nothing, I\u0027ll run a couple missions and capture some screens and some game logs to post a follow-up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* She -- I\u0027m surprised that all of the Kerbonaughts look distinctly male and are named with male names.

(Again, NO MODS.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience is one of those things that, if you are going to make an example, you really need to give the exact numbers and situations. There are several complicating factors in calculating science, to include biome, conditions, science experiment, transmission, and the introduction of scientist modifiers. Also, the \u0022science lab\u0022 is a very specific part that doesn\u0027t actually do any science, so I think you\u0027re probably talking about the Science Jr. I\u0027m only bringing this up not to nitpick, but because with science, the details are very important when sorting out your question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo first, around the Mun in high or low orbit, Science Jr is worth 75 points and Mystery Goo is worth 30. And the more times you do the experiment, the less science you receive each time you do it. However, it won\u0027t necessarily tell you that until after you\u0027ve returned with your science. So if you run two Mystery Goo experiments in high orbit around Mun, it will tell you they are both worth 30 points, even though they really aren\u0027t worth \u002B60 total when you recover them. As an easily repeatable example, EVA Surface Samples on the KSC launch pad will give 9 science the first time you recover it, then 2.3 science the second time you recover it. If you do both surface samples on the same flight (before the first is returned) both samples will say \u00229 science\u0022 but you will only be awarded 11.3 for recovering them both (9 \u002B 2.3).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you transmit either of these, you will NOT get that many science points. There are only a few experiments that transmit for full value (and they are the \u0022report\u0022 kind of experiments). Any \u0022transmit\u0022 numbers you see (such as the \u002B9 and the \u002B30 that you listed) will be all that you get, but you get that science immediately (you don\u0027t have to wait until the craft returns). Additionally, any science you transmit will not show up in the recovery dialogue. Also, any science data you transmit also becomes unrecoverable unless you run the experiment again. So you can\u0027t take a single Goo container experiment, transmit the results for some science, then recover it for the rest. (Goo is another special case, because you can only run it once \u0022for keeps\u0022 without cleaning.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is even more to science than this, but I didn\u0027t want to create a giant wall of text about how science labs interact with sci jr and mystery goo. Plus there are ways to pull and store science in different places. Some experiments you can run, transmit, run again, then store to collect even more points. Some experiments (like mystery goo and sci jr) can only be done one time \u0022for keeps\u0022 before the part becomes unusable (unless cleaned by a science lab).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully that clears some of it up, though I\u0027m sure it also opened more questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Redgum\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Redgum\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

In some respects, my intimate familiarity with some of these things actually puts me at a disadvantage when it comes to playing with them in a game.

My failing here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that when you transmit, despite the misleading text in the pop-up, it is only giving you a percentage of the real science value, and NOT as a kind of bonus.

BZZZT! Wrong! It\u0027s penalizing you for being astute and careful and cognizant of the massive tax-payer burden these programs cost. Poor Kerballians. And there\u0027s the rub. Real scientists and engineers in these types of programs will tell you that remote telemetry on manned or unmanned vehicles is somewhat mission critical. One never knows what will happen, so data is collected and almost immediately transmitted back to a ground station. (Like Pine Gap in Alice Springs, NT Australia...) That\u0027s just the way it is. Going into the game with this mindset and life experience cost me a WHOLE lot of science points.
