I think it\u0027s much less likely to be cancelled currently than Constellation was, mainly because it\u0027s mostly on schedule and on budget, unlike the latter program. Congress is also a huge supporter of SLS/Orion, probably more than in Constellation, because it\u0027s one of the few ways they can to recover the same Shuttle jobs lost when the Space Shuttle died.
