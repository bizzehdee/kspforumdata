As you might expect, I was switching between the three using the square brackets quite frequently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, one of my pods vanished from existence! The events log showed that the Kerbal inside had been killed, but there was no mention of the pod colliding with the surface, overheating, or anything else. On both occasions the vanished pod was high in the air (Maybe around 8000m) with chutes deployed and showing no signs of distress. The other craft , which was lower and always going to land first, landed perfectly and there was no sight or sound of a crashed ship anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal who disappeared from the space/time continuum was listed as being dead in the Astronaut Centre afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:26:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is whats called, a vanishment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a piece of debris exceeds 2.5km, the game will remove it from existence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s done to remove lag from game and improve performance, so sorry for your kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RavvickHipnot","CreatedById":142412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T18:12:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply and sorry for the slow response.

Debris might be dissapear closer, so make sure you dont actually mark vessels as debris (they shouldnt be debris by default if they ahve any command pod/units availeable). Anyways, if this happens thats what reverts are for, no need to throw away the kerbals (even if im playing without reverts i always keep revert option availeable to fix game bugs and kraken attacks. While i accept losses if they are my own stupid fault, i refuse to allow my kerbals to be sacrificed to teh kraken (or any other game bug).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grek","CreatedById":68831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eits really sucks:mad: i hope devs will fix it asap\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
