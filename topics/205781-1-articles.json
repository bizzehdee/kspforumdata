My thought was to have a good sized (semi-permanent)\u00A0mining ship that contained the mining excavator, ore storage tank, ore processing unit, and fuel tanks. To transfer the resulting fuel to an orbiting tanker, I was considering a separate ship whose function was to simply carry fuel from the ore miner to the orbiting tanker, then return and repeat. Finally, some. sort of mechanism to transfer the fuel from the \u2018miner\u2019 to the transfer ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had thought about a fairly simplistic rover with a large fuel tank that could be used to carry the fuel from the miner to the transfer ship, but I\u2019m not sure about how to connect to the miner to \u2018get\u2019 the fuel and then to the transfer ship to \u2018put\u2019 the fuel in. Docking ports seem to be an ideal solution, but how and I ensure that they will all match up? That is, making sure that the rover (if that is indeed the best solution) can mate to the docking ports on both the mining ship and the transfer ship. Easy to do in space where you can maneuver in all directions, but I\u2019m not sure how to do it on the ground where you can\u2019t maneuver vertically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas about how to do this? Or am I making it harder on myself than needed and there\u2019s an easier way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stamp20","CreatedById":202020,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-28T19:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have Breaking Ground, you could try putting the docking port on a robotic arm to adjust its position to match the other port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, if your mining rover or transfer ship is crewed you can install \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142594-minimum-ksp-version-111-kerbal-attachment-system-kas-v110/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbal Attachment System\u003C/a\u003E and use the resource transfer pipe to transfer the ore without doing any docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith some practice, you could land the transfer ship right next to the base and cut out the rover entirely, putting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E port or robotic arm on the base instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-11-28T19:56:11Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2021 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Stamp20\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-28T21:10:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/108704-18x-dmagics-modlets-most-ksp-18-updates-10-29-2019/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EEVA Transfer from DMagics\u003C/a\u003E lovely pile of little mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt allows you to let a Kerbal on EVA to drag a fuel hose from one vehicle to another (it\u0027s a little fuel gadget that you have to add to at least one of them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce connected to you can transfer any resource between the vehicles (even in orbit if you\u0027re good at parallel parking).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe advantage to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is that it\u0027s much smaller and only does one thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"macbates","CreatedById":212503,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-29T01:04:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the suggestions.
