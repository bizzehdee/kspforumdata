I hear that KSP is Single-Threaded, so I was considering getting a dual core processor. However, I also hear that it will be moving to Unity 5 somewhat soon, which will allow it to be Multi-Threaded? So I am curious, would KSP still run fine off a dual core CPU after the transition?"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T02:20:23Z","Content":"I heard the multithreading isn\u0027t magic (last time I heard was like vessel-level multithreading).

The most common speculation is \u0022one thread per ship\u0022, meaning more cores only really helps in multi-ship situations. But that\u0027s just educated guesswork.\n\nWhat is definite though is that while more cores helps some programs, better single-threaded performance helps *all* programs. So with KSP as a primary interest I would still recommend a modern Intel processor, they have better single-threaded performance than AMD ones. On a low budget the Pentium G3258 is a lot of performance for the money if you\u0027re willing to overclock, if you have a bit more money consider a fast-clocked Core i3."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T13:29:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You don\u0027t want a dual core processor in a gaming machine, period.\n\nThe dual core G3258 cantab mentions is a fantastic gaming processor for the money, especially when overclocked."},{"CreatedByName":"Cryova","CreatedById":147379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T03:25:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The dual core G3258 cantab mentions is a fantastic gaming processor for the money, especially when overclocked.\n\nWhen combined with something like the R9 280 or R9 280X, how well could it run KSP?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T03:38:38Z","Content":"Moved to Space Lounge, since this is not about the game itself."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T11:38:55Z","Content":"Multithreading **is** magic, *under set of conditions*. \\* (see fine print) (extra charges apply)\n\nI mean, if you have 1024 core CPU or 1024 processor mainframe.

So they need to lock it before modification and keep it locked while they do something dependant on it\u0027s current value. And don\u0027t forget to unlock.\n\nThreads should not lock variables for too long and be designed to not be dependent on shared conditions for too long.\n\nThreads should not lock variables in that way that leaves two or more threads waiting for each other indefinitely. Aka lockup.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning.\n\nSo: multithreading and multi-core CPUs are magic - under condition: programmers know how to use them.
