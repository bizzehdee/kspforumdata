I hear that KSP is Single-Threaded, so I was considering getting a dual core processor. However, I also hear that it will be moving to Unity 5 somewhat soon, which will allow it to be Multi-Threaded? So I am curious, would KSP still run fine off a dual core CPU after the transition?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T02:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI heard the multithreading isn\u0027t magic (last time I heard was like vessel-level multithreading).
