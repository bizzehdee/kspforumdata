I am finding FSanimateThrottle module causes FAR to update voxels constantly while it is performing it\u0027s animation. I.e. Ven stock revamp of the TRJ has animated flaps on the exhaust. I understand why and know you have stated in the past about playing animations and subsequently triggering FAR voxel updates, and that you can\u0027t change much or anything on your end for risk of insufficient voxelization in other perfectly reasonable situations, so I am not here to ask for changes in your code unless you know what\u0027s what is needed. I am here to ask what solutions/ideas you see outside FAR that maybe FS could use to alleviate this issue.
