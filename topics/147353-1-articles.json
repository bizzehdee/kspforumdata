Attaching the fairing with a set of four struts to the (3.75m) tank below solved the issue in true Kerbal (\u003Cem\u003Emoar struts\u003C/em\u003E) fashion. Of your mod list, the only overlap I have is Kerbal Engineer but I find it hard to believe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E is to blame for this problem, so it\u0027s likely more a \u0022stock\u0022 problem. Also, 1.2 is supposed to have \u0022gravity easing\u0022 when a new craft is instanciated on the launch, hopefully that\u0027ll fix it.
