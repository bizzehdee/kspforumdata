Anyways, phase one of my plan is to have a base set up on Minimus, which I\u0027ve gotten to a self-sufficient state now. The reason I wanted to do Minimus is because of it\u0027s low gravity, low escape velocity, and close proximity to the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\n\nThat being said, Bop shares a lot of these same characteristics, making it a prime candidate for another launch base. Thing is, I\u0027ve looked through Youtube, read about other people\u0027s bases, and I have yet to hear from anyone who\u0027s set up a permanent base on Bop, Laythe? Sure, plenty of those, in fact, I plan to make one myself, but Bop? Nada.\n\nSo has anyone built a base on Bop before? What are the challenges to overcome there? I imagine the uneven terrain must be difficult to work with, but I\u0027m fairly new to the game and have only ever been in the Joolian System once, so I don\u0027t really know what to expect going there.\n\nI don\u0027t mind if you don\u0027t play with the same mods or even mods at all, I\u0027d just love to hear from anyone who\u0027s attempted or done this. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T01:07:38Z","Content":"Looks like an advice request for a gameplay matter.

The problems on Bop should be similar. I\u0027ve found that tethering the base to the ground via KAS pipes or grappling hooks works wonders. Also, the uneven ground means that anything with 0 degree flatness will likely not actually be flat.\n\nBoth of my bases were Extraplanetary Launchpad bases (because there\u0027s no reason to make a base if it has no use, and that\u0027s a pretty good use) so step one was to get a starter base there, and step 2 was to design a second base that was tilted in the VAB with the same degree tilt as the slope of the land, so the resultant base would be flat."},{"CreatedByName":"Markelius","CreatedById":140335,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T05:26:55Z","Content":"I thought of KAS grappling hooks and ground pylons, just recently figured how to use them right. Luckily on Minimus I picked a nice flat plateau to build on, with only a couple degree slope. Problem is, on Bop, flat area is much tougher to find.\n\nThat being said, I imagine magic lift rams would be useful, only that those, along with Infernal Robotics haven\u0027t been working for me for some reason despite having the right versions of both IR and toolbar installed. But that\u0027s not a problem I need solved in this thread.\n\nWhat my main concern is is the distance. I play with a semi-RP mindset, and that being said, I don\u0027t like keeping my Kerbals onsite for long durations of time. I don\u0027t play with any life support focused mods, but it\u0027s still something I have fun focusing on. Minimus has been easy, it only takes a short time to get there and I can send a two way shuttle to bring new Kerbals and take the old ones back. With the Joolian System though, it\u0027s a lot different. It takes about a year for an efficient trip, one way. Once there, sending them supplies won\u0027t be easy, so I\u0027ll have to try and do everything on site.\n\nI didn\u0027t have that barrier with Minimus, it took me I think 6 flights to get the base set up and self-sufficient. With Joolian satelites, I have to do it all in one go.\n\nI have a plan though, I created a large cargo tug with over 20k m/s of interplanetary delta-v, an OKS hab ring for artificial gravity, and two Extraplanetary Launchpads workshops,filled with rockeparts, complete with de-orbiting and landing gear, side mounted ore and karbonite drills, a recycler for repurposing debris, metal smelters, and an orbital construction dock for building stuff.\n\nAlong with that, I\u0027m going to be doing a concurrent launch of a similar cargo tug with payload of twelve scan satellites to determine where the various ore and karbonite on each terrestrial body is.\n\nMy main fear is simply that things won\u0027t work out in some way, that my workshops won\u0027t be able to get ore, that they won\u0027t be able to land safely, any number of things could go wrong even with quicksaves to help me out, and I\u0027d have to launch a rescue or support mission which would take another year to get there. I don\u0027t even like having my kerbals out for a month, let alone a year, it scares me. I just want to make sure the mission goes exactly as planned.\n\nI must say, playing this game has really given me a new found appreciation of what space agencies do. It\u0027s really amazing stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T05:42:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I just want to make sure the mission goes exactly as planned.\n\nI can pretty much guarantee that THAT won\u0027t happen. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) But if it did, where would be the fun?\n\nThe best part of this game is that no matter how ready you think you are, you never are ready.\n\nAll I can say is go for it.

I could barely function with a limit on parts, sandbox mode with hangar extender and editor extensions makes it so easy to build massive crafts. You should see the tugs I made for going to Jool.\n\nAnyways, I\u0027ll let you all know how it goes and hopefully post some screenshots. Tonight I mostly finished getting the recycler set up on my Minimus base, the workshop hasn\u0027t been producing rocketparts even though there are kerbals inside and metal to work with, don\u0027t know what that\u0027s about, but considering I have enough spare rocketparts to build a small craft, and I\u0027m collecting plenty of metal (from ore) and karbonite, I think it\u0027s high time I did some exploring past Kerbin\u0027s SOI."}]}
