This never occurs with any of the other axes, just pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheTony360PRO","CreatedById":226593,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-19T22:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon further investigation it appears as though this happens more often with wings that cover the whole side of the craft, so likely the software thinks that the control surface should be controlled like one placed on the front of the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
