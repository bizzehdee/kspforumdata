My first name idea was Federation of United Kerbals but that had a very unfortunate acronym. Then I thought Federation of Savage Kerbals, the acronym is much less unfortunate, but the name implies my Kerbals are Savages, and a savage couldn\u0027t build a rocket, so I threw that out. I then thought Icarus Space Agency, but Icarus is used as a fable to teach people to not reach beyond their means and if my Kerbals did that they would never get off the ground, also I want it to be a world government, not an agency.
