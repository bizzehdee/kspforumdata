It\u0027ll take a bit of work to get it working on modern computers, but it sounds like the same sort of game. You build factories/mines/mills/farms/etc and you set up a transport network to transport the raw material to the factories and transport products and goods to stores that you also build. You can also set up a passenger service if you want. Economy might be a bit lacking but it\u0027s alright for such and old game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
