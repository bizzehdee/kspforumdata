You can also turn off certain axes on individual control surfaces to, for example, restrict your tail fins to only deploy for yaw control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you\u2019re seeing is probably related to wheels rather than aerodynamics- turn on advanced tweakables in the main menu settings, then override the friction control on your front wheel(s) and set them very low (\u0026lt;0.5), which should stop most incidents of veering off to one side during takeoff and landing and the inevitable fiery explosions that follow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
