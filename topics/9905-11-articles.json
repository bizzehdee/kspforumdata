Thank you for your work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not seen what you have prepared for us, but I feel that it is as always great! I have a bunch of proposals for LazorSystem but I do not know how you describe them correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecial thanks for lazorvizion now landing at night no problem =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m glad to hear that. And even if you don\\\u0027t know how to describe the proposals \u0027correctly\u0027 i really would like to hear it anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taverius","CreatedById":11815,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T00:51:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA little wing copying and .cfg editing later - thank you Harv for the per-cfg item scaling! - I got this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/GOn6t\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GOn6tl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GOn6tl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice the difference between set altitude and actual :3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts not all fun and games - low altitude (\u0026lt;6km) at speeds over 100m/s is a violent up/down overcorrection flutter, but still, pretty awesome 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zoher","CreatedById":5441,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T10:11:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if I understood paravilno lidar, it can build a map of the surface and in conjunction with the airborne autopilot to fly the aircraft to assist the relief of the surface of the skirting \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Or is it already implemented?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Romfarer","CreatedById":20387,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T12:26:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taverius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taverius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice the difference between set altitude and actual :3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts not all fun and games - low altitude (\u0026lt;6km) at speeds over 100m/s is a violent up/down overcorrection flutter, but still, pretty awesome 8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the fluttering occuring with or without the altitude system on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m currently working on ironing out some more serious issues related to moving in and out of eva and having multiple evas active.

I have been thinking about adding a system like this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could be a system that paints a grid on the surface to better indicate its elevations etc. Imagine a wireframe that is painted directly on the surface. I believe it is possible to do, however it may have some limitations. Right now the game removes and adds the surface colliders on the fly, based on your altidude so for example above a certain height, like 10km\u002B the lazors will not actually hit the surface and then i can\\\u0027t actually calculate the positions for the grid anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
