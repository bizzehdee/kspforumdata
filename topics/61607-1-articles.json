Any larger, and aircraft/rockets are required to stave off the incredible boredom of getting around. In a normal sandbox, at maximum I would like an area the size of a large city to move around in. Any larger is unusable and tedious. Minecraft is somewhat of an exception to this, because of natural resources and biomes. If I can teleport/fast travel, that greatly increases my tolerance for excessive world size.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T11:06:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the key is - the map needs to be big enough - minecraft is great because its only as big as you need it to be - yes you may need to go venturing off for a specific resource, but that is the cost of the resource. in ksp the further you go the more science you get. gta 5 is odd - and it does suffer from map bloat, but only in some situations. in some missions you race the length of the map or what have you, and that really adds to the game, the story uses practically all locations, so they are needed. but in free roam, driving from a) to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E might feel excessive. there is no benifit, and this is why you see most online players hanging round the city.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has the added benefit of having different modes of transport - you wanna go a long way, make a powerful rocket, you want to go 1km? bring a rover, you just wanna go from one side of the ship to the other, use EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummary: so long as there is a reason for the extra bit of map, a gameplay reason that adds to the enjoyment, go for it. but make sure there are adequate travel methods for it, tedium sets in if you have to commute from a) to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E just because.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
