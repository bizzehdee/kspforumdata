Im thinking one at 2.5m that makes parts up to 1.85m, one at 5m that makes parts up to 3.7m, and a huge one that does everything. This could act as a nice progression mechanic for expanding base and station capacity, but in a funny way the one Id be most interested in is the 2.5m factory because it could make small replacement parts. Early in the progression or even on deep exploration missions you could add one to vessels or stations to make things like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E ports, fuel ducts, lights, wheels, solar panels/ etc. that engineers could install if those parts were forgotten or broken.
