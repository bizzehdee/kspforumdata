The new game play mechanics totally add to the game. I just found the computer control screen and I can\u0027t wait until my probe gets near Moho to see if I can get it inserted into orbit. It\u0027ll be even better when I have a Jool mission and I try to program controlled descents. I predict much litho-breaking and it will be magnificent, I am sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed, though, that the control of the craft, if you leave RCS enabled, is rather inefficient and tends to burn monopropellant really quickly. I think I read that you had implemented a proportional controller to for flight computer. For a proportional control on the rotation angle, though, I can see how the flight computer will start fighting itself to keep on a specified path. I would like to suggest that you instead, provide a control signal based on rotation rate with a decent dead-band around the set-point. I think this could help avoid the RCS system fighting itself all the way through a turn and burning off way too much monoprop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOVE the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T02:58:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mrpersonman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mrpersonman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHelp!

My Player.log (Linux, non-steam) contains no errors or exceptions (besides a few Kethane ones well documented as harmless ). If anyone finds a fix it would be great to hear.
