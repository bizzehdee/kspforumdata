I\u0027ve seen at least one player get home from Laythe with only 700 m/s of delta-v by getting double gravity assists from Vall and Tylo. Yet I haven\u0027t seen any cases of people getting gravity assists from Tylo by swinging back around after departing from that same gravity well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I have a massive tug in orbit around Tylo that has barely enough fuel to do the Hohmann transfer from Jool to Kerbin, but it doesn\u0027t have enough fuel to leave Tylo\u0027s SOI and get back to Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard to predict a swing-back around maneuver because the maneuver nodes can\u0027t show an encounter with a body when you\u0027re still in the SOI.
