They\u0027re sometimes so finicky to add and once you finally can place them, you can\u0027t move it (circle turns red and it deletes). And if what you\u0027re doing isn\u0027t working out right, you can\u0027t reset them to 0 easily, you have to manually remove each component until you reach 0. Either that or delete it and try to place them again.

It\u0027s adding velocity to one reference frame using input from another reference frame, resulting in a very annoying and unintuitive system. Also, I hate that the scroll wheel input for them isn\u0027t configurable or consistent. Also, I hate that for interplanetary transfers, I have to zoom out to see what the orbit\u0027s doing, but then zoom right in to move it round a tiny fraction, zoom right out to see if it\u0027s an improvement.. Basically, I hate there\u0027s no digital input for them, like PreciseNode or MechJebs Node Editor. Also, I hate that clicking the tiny button to move it to the next orbit sometimes closes the node if you click it too fast. Yeah.. I don\u0027t like the manoeuvre nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I hate how many bugs there are with the game and things that should be optimised, but they\u0027re only noticeable when they\u0027re triggered by mods. For example, how opening a window with many entries slows down FPS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jSRjMRy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jSRjMRy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see the same thing with something like B9 Procedural Wings and all it\u0027s tweakables or having a contract with lots of prerequisites. These bog the game down but they\u0027re not the ones doing it, the game just isn\u0027t running well there. It\u0027s like hiring someone who doesn\u0027t work well under stress. Give them an easy job and they\u0027re fine, they do it great. Start giving them actual work to do that needs to be done quickly and correctly and they start messing up. Do you blame the workload and say \u0027well, don\u0027t give them so much work to do, they work fine when they have an easy job\u0027? No, you hire a better person. Now granted, I don\u0027t kow much if anything about coding so I guess it\u0027s not like hiring staff in the slightest, but I just don\u0027t like it when people blame mods for problems with the stock game that are triggered by mods (the editor infinizoom parts bug is one such bug).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don\u0027t like having to choose between either part wobble and 100 struts all over the place.
