I was able to fix the fuel lines in one of my old Tugs by editing the sfs file. The reason that this didn\u0027t work when I tried it last night was because the parts on my old ships don\u0027t have cid numbers, which are apparently what the tgt parameter in the PARTDATA needs. So I just made up some cid numbers for the necessary tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my old Laythe Tug 5, the two fuel line parts contain a line that looks like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF8C00;\u0022\u003EcData = tgt: fuelTank_26; pos: 0.04052366,-0.6179092,0.07171666; dir: 0.01843925,-0.9997801,0.009987026; rot: 0.7071069,1.373519E-06,2.235174E-08,-0.7071066\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis indicates that the line targets the fuel tank that is part 26 of the ship.

Then the six kerbals were refueled during a party that couldn\u0027t be beat -- all of them were back together for the first time since Aldner and Nelemy had gone off to explore Tylo, and Emilynn and Hellou had returned to Vall to finish their interrupted exploration there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mQbdmbO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mQbdmbO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the Grey Haven Express had more than enough fuel for return to Kerbin (assuming all the calculations were correct), Thompbles decided that the Pol Fidos would also brought back up to orbit for refueling to maximize the options of any future explorers who would re-use the hardware.

Well.

Maybe it had to do with moving at a faster speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe surface bugginess seems to be limited to (or at least most severe on) the half of Pol that is East of the 180 degree longitude line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut game bugs are a valid excuse to call up a quicksave, so I did that. On the next attempt, I boosted the Fido into a steeper trajectory to get it higher before it passed over the Land of the Explosive Bugs.

My reason for docking the ships together was mainly to lower the number of separate ships that need to be tracked in my Save game. And, of course, this equipment and store of yummy fuel will also await potential use by future explorers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rAPYF4d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rAPYF4d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK! Now that the missions were finished and all of the Old Crew were together again, it was time to balance the propellants on the Grey Haven Express to ready it for the flight back to Kerbin. (See explanations and image below.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the orientations of the nuclear engines, only the two Tugs in the bottom tier and the two Tugs in the third tier would be fired for the boost homeward. So, the propellants in the X200-32 center tanks of the second and fourth tier Tugs were moved to the first (bottom) and third tier Tugs. The FL-T400 tanks in the side nacelles of the inactive Tugs were left with some fuel (less than half full) for when they need to be maneuvered separately later in Kerbin orbit. The side nacelle tanks of the active Tugs were filled up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropellant was also moved into some of the FL-T400 tanks around the Vall Orbital Hab and Tylo Orbital Hab modules. This propellant would be kept in reserve to act as radiation shielding against the possibility of any large Kerbol flares during the long trip home. Also, to balance the extra mass of the Laythe Transfer Hab on the one side of the ship, the X200-8 tank below the Vall Hab and an additional FL-T400 tank on the side of the Vall Hab were filled with propellant. All this propellant would also help shield the crew against the higher-than-normal neutron backscatter expected from the operation of the third tier nukes with lots of Tug mass below them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: The final propellant inventory of the Grey Haven Express. All of this fuel balancing would have been much easier in the new KSP version 0.90, with its feature that allows you to select multiple tanks for simultaneous fuel transfer. I had the TAC Fuel Balancer mod installed when I did this in version 0.25, but with a ship that has as many tanks as the Grey Haven Express, even using TAC Fuel Balancer was not simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5RTCOBA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225RTCOBA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EBroken By Beta!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, I was planning on sending the Grey Haven Express on its way to Kerbin.

The weird fuel level readings from the nukes are apparently caused by them only reading the fuel levels in the side tanks...not the center tanks.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Maybe the pulse selectively caused damage to only certain control circuits, like the OKTO2 reaction wheels and the fuel transfer ducts.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022DUDES!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022What is it, Nelemy?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Um... Why are you guys all acting so strange?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh. It seems that when Squad decided to implement kerbal roles (pilot, engineer, scientist), they didn\u0027t just add a parameter to the Save game file to specify each kerbal\u0027s role -- instead, the role is determined by the kerbal\u0027s NAME...somehow. So now Jebediah is a pilot...Bob is a scientist...and Bill is an engineer. Pilots have skills in flying ships that improve as they level up by gaining experience. Engineers can repack parachutes, and fix landing legs and rover wheels. Scientists increase the amount of science you gather with their bonus multipliers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what does all this mean for my venerable Save game? Well...by whatever arcane method Squad chose to determine roles from names, Hellou turns out to be a pilot (as does Nelemy). Aldner and Kurt turn out to be scientists. Thompbles and Emilynn are engineers. BUT this is NOT a good thing. Totally unacceptable. My kerbals have roles they\u0027ve been serving for a long time now. AND in many cases my pilot kerbals have been doing things that are now the purview of engineers (like packing chutes and fixing rover wheels).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...I made changes. After some experimentation I found out that changing Hellou\u0027s name to \u0022Hellou{alt-space} Kerman\u0022 makes her a scientist...and the alt-space character in her name does not distract me. Kurt Kerman was changed to \u0022Kurtj Kerman\u0022 and he is now an engineer (the \u0022j\u0022 is silent, of course, as are all trailing j\u0027s in the kerbal language). Aldner was also made into an engineer by changing his name to \u0022Aldner. Kerman\u0022 So now he\u0027s Aldner...Period! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out that Squad stores the kerbalnaut role definitions in a file named Traits.cfg inside the GameData/Squad/Experience folder. (Thank you, Cydonian Monk, for pointing this out to me.) I decided to copy and paste the piloting and engineering skills into both the Pilot and Engineer classes in that cfg file, making all my kerbals pilot/engineers unless they are Scientists. I\u0027m fine with scientists just getting science bonuses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...a second, less-violent shock wave passed through the Grey Haven Express... and Hellou, Aldner, and Kurt looked momentarily confused about the displays they were viewing...and changed them over to Science display (Hellou), ship control display (Aldner), and ship engineering display (Kurt)...and got back to work. And so we carry on with only Nelemy being a bit confused about what had happened. But he\u0027s used to being a little confused.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pxJnsAK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pxJnsAK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022What\u0027s going on? Is everybody OK? What\u0027s the status of the ship?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Some sort of wave hit us. All OKTO2 probe reaction wheels are dead, but the rest of the OKTO2 circuits are working. All other reaction wheels on the ship are OK, and we are holding attitude. All external fuel ducts are nonoperational. All nukes are in cold shutdown.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022This is Kurt. All tanks and hab modules show steady pressure. Environmental systems green. Electrical power bus at 100%. Aldner, Nelemy, Hellou and I are in Tylo Hab. Last I knew, Emilynn was in the Vall Hab.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Hey, you pudknockers should keep it down when a lady is trying to get some shut eye. I\u0027m in the Vall Control module now. I\u0027ll start running system checks.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022The snack cabinets seem to be OK, Dude. The Trash and Rubbish compartments still contain trash and rubbish...except for what floated out when I was checking. The Board Games cabinet is OK, but we\u0027re probably still missing the robber piece from Settlers of Katan, and the...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Fine, Nelemy. We\u0027ll get a full inventory later. Contact Laythe Base and see if they are OK.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022I was trying to contact Laythe Base, but there was lots of static and then I lost the signal.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Have you tried switching comsats?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Won\u0027t do any good, Bossman. We have links to the comsats via our omni antennas, but the engineering data from the comsats indicate that they are slowly tumbling, so their high gain antennas can\u0027t keep a lock.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022All of the comsats use OKTO2 probe bodies for attitude control. Looks like whatever took out our OKTO2 probe reaction wheels also hit them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Check them all, including the Vall, Tylo, and Bop constellations. Use our own high gain antennas to make contact with Laythe Base.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022I\u0027m trying that now, but all the comsats in the Laythe constellation are dead, too...and Laythe Base is on the far side of Laythe for another six hours.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022OK. Point a high gain at Kerbin and send a full status report to them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: One of the many now-useless comsats I have in orbits around Joolian moons. Not that I actually use them. But, still, Squad: Please give the OKTO2 probe cores back at least some small amount of reaction wheel torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IH3F0tp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IH3F0tp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK...Enough story for today...but let\u0027s discuss the biggest problem that the KSP Beta 0.90 upgrade threw at me: The change to the external fuel ducts. This change (while I\u0027m sure it\u0027s a happy and wonderful thing because it makes ducts and struts use a common code format, and hopefully will resolve some fuel-flow irregularities I\u0027ve encountered in building ships) means that fuel ducts in old Save files no longer transfer fuel when those Saves are opened in 0.90. And I have hundreds of fuel lines on the various ships that inhabit the Kerbol system of my Save game file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow don\u0027t get me wrong... KSP was an Alpha game (and now a Beta game), so changes like this are to be expected, and I\u0027m not complaining. BUT...one of the ways I have FUN in KSP is seeing how long I can keep my ancient Save game universe (which was started in version 0.18) working. So I delved into the Save file to see if I could fix the problem. The fuel must flow! He who controls the fuel, controls the universe!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turned out that the old fuel ducts stored their connection data in a \u0022cData\u0022 line...and all that information now resides in a \u0022PARTDATA\u0022 child of the fuelline part...and there were also \u0022CModuleLinkedMesh\u0022 and \u0022CModuleFuelLine\u0022 modules that needed to be added...and lots of parts needed to get \u0022cid\u0022 numbers assigned, since that\u0027s apparently how the fuel flow code identifies the parts. I was able to figure out how to hand-edit all this into place, and I fixed one of my Tugs as a test...which worked! But I didn\u0027t fancy having to edit the monstrosity of fuel lines that is the Grey Haven Express...nor did I relish the thought of finding and fixing all the other fuel lines on all the other ships in my Save game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, happily, KSP Forums member JumpsterG offered to try to write a VB script to automate my procedure, if I would send him the example files. So I did. And he did. And there was much rejoicing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever the strange Beta wavefront did to discombobulate the fuel ducts, one of the steely-eyed missile kerbals back at the KSC (one JumpsterG Kerman by name) was able to figure out a software workaround that was sent up to the Grey Haven Express to get its fuel lines operational again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, next time, I really WILL get around to sending the Old Crew back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-30T05:32:49Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2014 05:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"19chickens","CreatedById":121179,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T10:45:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.
