I suppose I should elaborate.\n\nI\\\u0027d first used the program to generate a map off of the CSV in the first post of this thread and was a little dissapointed with the quality as it only had 100 horizontal datapoints and 50 vertical datapoints. I thought this was a result of the data collected so I wanted to get my own and generate a map from that. As I was learning how to do that, my friend came over and politely smacked me in the back of the head reminding me that Surfer defaults to the 100x50 dataset and I had to change that myself. I went back and recalculated it for 1000x1000 and the result was the picture you see before you ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI\\\u0027m still planning on collecting my own data, but I won\\\u0027t be able to do that for a couple weeks for various reasons, and well ... ....
