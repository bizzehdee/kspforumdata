The British Army has a high speed variant of the Scimitar chassis with hugely upgraded suspension for maniac cross country driving that I have personally drove at over 70mph on the A1. The look on peoples face when you cruise pass them in the fast lane is priceless. The important thing to understand is that there are two main types of tracks. Dead tracks and live tracks. Dead tracks are what you see on tractors and bulldozers. Live tracks on armoured vehicles. The main difference is that if you were to lay a dead track and a live track on the ground having been removed from the vehicle, the dead track would just lay flat on the ground while the live track would make a huge curve, they are designed to be naturally curved you see so are used in high speed applications, but this also increases their cost and makes then a real pain to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rdfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rdfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBesides, the whole point of tracks is to reduce the ground pressure compared to wheels; this implies a rather heavy vehicle for its footprint.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not the purpose of tracked vehicles.

The fact that many tracked vehicles have 10-14 wheels each resting on the width of an individual link of track instead of just the contact point on the circumference of the wheel reduces the ground pressure, not the tracks themselves. Usually when a vehicle wants to reduce it\u0027s footprint, it uses huge, lightly inflated rubber wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETracks do help spread out the weight of the vehicle yes, but that it not the main purpose of a track, more like an added bonus to an already useful method of locomotion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E the M1 doesn\u0027t stop on a dime and if you were to lock the brakes at those speeds it would tear the road up and cause serious damage and strain on the driveline. \u003Cp\u003EOld \u0022Christy\u0022 suspension designs from the 1930s were capable of 100km/h or more with ease, but again they were unreliable and prone to throwing tracks under load of changing directions or quick stops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s interesting. British Army armoured vehicle drivers are taught not to brake too hard because they can literally tip the whole vehicle over the vehicles stop so fast. Also, when any armoured vehicles are taken on civilian roads either in the UK or Germany, it has to have a sign on the back that literally says \u0022KEEP YOUR DISTANCE, THIS VEHICLE CAN STOP EXTREMELY QUICKLY\u0022 (much faster than a car at the same speed).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-18T23:14:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2013 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kass\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T00:15:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kass\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kass\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is not the purpose of tracked vehicles.

The usefulness of taking the road with you is that you get stuck less easily, because you are spreading the load across a larger area. It is doing the same as the semi-deflated wheels you talk about, but on an even larger scale.
