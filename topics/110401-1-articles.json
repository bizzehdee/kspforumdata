I scammed him by merely tagging him onto a rescue mission.\n\nSo, the rocket has two pods, one passenger on launch. The pilot is a probe core.\n\nI also use Kerbal Construction Time - when I launched it asked if I\u0027d like to load tourists. I said yes. Launch was good, and Tito rendezvoused with the stranded kerbal.\n\nRichly grabbed the pod, and tried to board, but BOTH pods contain Tito Kerman!! I think KCT loaded the same tourist that was already loaded.\n\nI\u0027ve tried editing the persistent.sfs but the game breaks if you just delete the passenger\u0027s name from a pod.\n\nAny advice please? I don\u0027t have any other suitable saves to revert to.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T19:39:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 07:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Matt77**"},{"CreatedByName":"Matt77","CreatedById":69015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:39:29Z","Content":"Sorry, sorted it.\n\nYou have to delete the entire line, including \u0022crew = \u0022.\n\nIf you leave it blank, the game crashes.
