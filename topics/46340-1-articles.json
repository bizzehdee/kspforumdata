I currently have an extendable docking port in the works but it is meant for space station assembly and to be compact while still being able to provide clearance from solar panels when necessary. It wouldn\u0027t do exactly this though. Right now, a person can improvise using MSI but with these types of things, it would become a lot easier as on Kerbin, we can\u0027t test under these circumstances.
