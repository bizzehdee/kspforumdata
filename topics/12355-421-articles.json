My current launcher uses a Skipper on an orange tank as it\u0027s primary booster, but since the payload uses radial engines, it fores those off at the same time with fuel pipes to them from the orange tank. I recall that previous versions of MechJeb would handle this correctly, showing the first stage with the combined thrust and delta-v of all the engines, and then the next stage, after the booster and orange tank are decoupled, with the thrust and delta-v of the payload running off its own internal fuel.
