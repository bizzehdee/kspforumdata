I just altered the color and added a few details to it...but i need the game to load it onto the model in place of the original.. I know there is an argument i can use in the Part CFG to direct it to load my custom texture...but I\u0027m not sure what that argument is. Appreciate any help! And as a side note .. I would gladly use Texture Replacer if need be ...in that case what would the argument be in the CFG to direct it to my custom texture. I just need an example of how to write it into the CFG...thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T17:19:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eadd a line after mesh = blahblah.mu\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etexture = partPathinGamedata/newTexture\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat should work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor remove mesh = blablah\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadd\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EMODEL\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E     model = muPathinGamedata/muFileName  //no need for dot MU extension\u003Cbr\u003E     texture = originalTextureName, newTexturePathinGameData/newTextureName   // no need for texture format extension.
