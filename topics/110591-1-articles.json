Also, don\u0027t try to be clever and try to clip a normal port into the middle of a large port, it doesn\u0027t work. You just need to design docking nodes that have both sizes."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T05:07:39Z","Content":"Yes... if you build an adapter. But really the answer is no.\n\nIf you do want to send up that adapter, it is real simple. A Rockomax Brand Adapter or Rockomax Brand Adapter 02 with docking ports on either side. You should be able to get something that light up to orbit real cheap and it definitely beats bringing the fuel hauler back for no reason. Plus, leave the adapter at the station for later use.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T05:10:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 05:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Jet","CreatedById":99880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T06:10:22Z","Content":"Size must match, unless you install [this](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74064)."},{"CreatedByName":"RandomRyan","CreatedById":142844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T06:57:00Z","Content":"thanks for the answers guys! seriously thanks!\n\n(although the tanker went on a collision course and broke the panels, meh.)"}]}
