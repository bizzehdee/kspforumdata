But that just makes it much more rewarding when you do find it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume you have landed at one of the poles on Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so, don\u0027t bother looking straight up. Magic Boulder is in a polar orbit, but still inclined. Basically, you zoom out from your craft, and swivel around. ... then be patient and observe, and use low-level time warp. Not sure there is much else that can help. I also recommend using quicksave a lot, and you probably want to at least know it\u0027s altitude as well (before the chase), but that is up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you keep at it. Visiting this easter egg is one of the most challenging experiences in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8499/8388827901_a54031ecae_c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228388827901_a54031ecae_c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InSani7y","CreatedById":60193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T17:49:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell i read all the tutorials i have found with google and watched some youtube vids but ive never seen it by myself.

Land on a high point near one of the poles and watch the sky in 10x acceleration. It will look like a little speck of light moving along. You don\u0027t want to spend much time looking straight up, since it will spend relatively little, if any, of its orbit directly above you, but you can watch a fair section of sky by picking a horizon and simply staring southward and up at about 45 degrees. It\u0027s incredibly boring to do this, but sooner or later you should see it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InSani7y","CreatedById":60193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T09:02:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd should I use special graphic settings to see it ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T09:13:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jason Patterson\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jason Patterson\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E It\u0027s incredibly boring to do this, but sooner or later you should see it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how real astronomy works!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InSani7y","CreatedById":60193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T18:23:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes somebody have got more information ? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have got this: 15km orbit, inclination 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got a ship in this orbit and landed another on the northpole but the ship has passed by several times now and noo flickering \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InSani7y","CreatedById":60193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T14:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHELP !!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
