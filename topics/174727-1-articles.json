The AREE rover\u00A0would fix that by being built with durable but\u00A0unconventional, and to an extent outdated, technologies. The build of the AREE rover would be mostly mechanical with few electronic components; making it able to withstand the intense atmospheric pressure and temperature of Venus. So, to emulate that in KSP, I would like to request for someone to make an AREE-esque probe core.

As for communication, they proposed using a reflector to bounce radar signals back to a main orbiter, using Morse code to transmit data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
