The navball seems to be fibrillating, and apoapsis/periapsis is all over the place even when there is 10k distance between them. I had a Minmus intercept that fluctuated 400km. My current Mun interception periapsis is 21-36km. I\u0027ve been away from the forum for a few weeks, so I don\u0027t know if this is a known issue with 1.04 or it\u0027s just me."}]}
