The ModuleKISInventory class however would need to be slightly modified to accomplish what I need, essentially adding in a pair of virtual methods that would allow a subclass of ModuleKISInventory to determine if it would allow a part to be added.  The additional code to support this is fairly small.\n\nMy KIS Items would be completely compatible with and operate exactly like all other parts when used in the inventory of an existing ModuleKISInventory.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. If I create a new Part Module that sub-classes ModuleKISItem, can I redistribute my new Part Module?\n\n2. If I modify ModuleKISInventory to accomplish what I need -- can I redistribute the new Part Module?  The new module would clearly have a different name (probably something like ModuleEquipmentBay)  - it would still require KIS to be installed. I would be happy to provide attribution to KospY and include a link to the KIS repository \u0026 license (and if KospY thought the additions would be helpful for others, I\u0027d be happy to submit it as a PR on github to be added to the core.)\n\nSpoiler\n\nTwo new virtual functions for ModuleKISInventory:\n\n            public virtual bool AllowedToContainItem(KIS_Item item)\n            {\n                return true;\n            }\n    \n            public virtual bool AllowedToContainPart(Part p)\n            {\n                return true;\n            }\n\nAnd then the bottom of GuiInventory() would need to be modified slightly to incorporate calling those methods and displaying messages (if appropriate):\n\n    ~1620:\n    if (VolumeAvailableFor(KISAddonPickup.draggedItem))\n    {\n        if (AllowedToContainItem(KISAddonPickup.draggedItem)){\n        \tMoveItem(KISAddonPickup.draggedItem, this, i);} else {\tScreenMessages.PostScreenMessage(\u0022Item cannot be placed in this inventory.\u0022, 5, ScreenMessageStyle.UPPER_CENTER);\n    }\n    }\n    \n    ~1638\n    if (VolumeAvailableFor(KISAddonPickup.draggedPart))\n    {\n        if( AllowedToContainPart(KISAddonPickup.draggedPart ) \n        {\n            KIS_Shared.SendKISMessage(KISAddonPickup.draggedPart, KIS_Shared.MessageAction.Store);\n            AddItem(KISAddonPickup.draggedPart, 1, i);\n            if (HighLogic.LoadedSceneIsEditor == false)\n            {\n                KISAddonPickup.draggedPart.Die();\n            }} else {\tScreenMessages.PostScreenMessage(\u0022Item cannot be placed in this inventory.\u0022, 5, ScreenMessageStyle.UPPER_CENTER);}\n    }\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Patayyyyyto","CreatedById":157392,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T20:22:58Z","Content":"For the next update for KIS, you should be able to combine storage inventories.
