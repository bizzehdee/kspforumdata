Today, launching the game again, there is no save file. Thinking I made a mistake, I started a new career. While doing the first Mun mission I save the game, but when trying to reload, there is no save file. I\u0027m not talking about quick-save and quick-load (I quickly learned they aint working). I press esc, press save, give it a logical name (now that I write this I realize I used spaces) and press save.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly there is no game to load, neither a career to continue playing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy apologies if there is an elaborate thread somewhere.
