(to counter this i could cheat into kerbins orbit, from that the game works normally)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- cheating/teleporting into an orbit works only on kerbin - not eg. duna or any other planet, while cheating to another planets surface works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, I tested the same stuff within a new sandbox savegame and voila: no problems there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I assume that my savegame file just got corrupted somehow. I digged into it and learned a lot of that but of course manual editing is kinda time consuming and errors may happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any tools out there to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- validate / debug savegames\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- merge vehicles into savegames\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny hint is highly appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
