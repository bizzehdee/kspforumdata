I\u0027m not sure what causes it, but it\u0027s been happening every time I try and fly. It appears that after staging, specifically after rapidly staging due to a failure of somekind, the camera is not focusing on the controlled vehicle. I\u0027ve tried to hit home to recenter the camera, but it focuses off of the main part. I\u0027m not sure what is going on. I\u0027m going to try and uninstall and reinstall the game to see if that fixes it, but this is\u00A0 very frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
