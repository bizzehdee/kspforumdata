On one monitor I will have the loading screen and on the main screen I will get the home screen of the game. There is no way that I have found to resolve this issue, I just have to quit the game and try again. I have 3 monitors incase you wanted to test it. This doesnt happen every single time it happens probably 90% of the time right now.\u00A0 This was happening since launch and after the update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
