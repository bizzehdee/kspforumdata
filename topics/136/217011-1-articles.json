I started in the training center. When I completed the first 2 courses it was time to head into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. But, as soon as the loading finished my Pc would lock up/freeze. I need to do a forced reboot in order to get my Pc working again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday I tried it again, same issue, same situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther games are running fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone know anything I can do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreetings Erik!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
