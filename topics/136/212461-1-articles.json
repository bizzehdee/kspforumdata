It defaults to 4k windowed but when I change the settings and click apply, nothing happens. The same happens with the graphics settings, which are stuck on high, my computer can\u0027t really handle these settings so it my game never gets above 20 fps during flight. After relaunching the game, the settings don\u0027t keep my changes and are still have no effect. Also I can\u0027t load into saves, it just puts me on the main menu, without the menu or logo, only the background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing to try reinstalling\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Baleine","CreatedById":131757,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T23:42:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems like your user don\u0027t have the rights to write in the folder \u0022%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Intercept Games\\Kerbal Space Program 2\u0022 (or something like that, since it\u0027s in this folder that the configuration is saved).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTry to delete that folder and restart the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf the issue persists, check that your user has the rights to read / write that folder\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TomKerbal","CreatedById":222333,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T00:08:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022226055\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3917007173\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/212349-no-1920x1200-resolution-on-rtx3070/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:194px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaberFin","CreatedById":225784,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T06:18:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224240972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212461\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677282137\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022131757\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Baleine\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Baleine said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems like your user don\u0027t have the rights to write in the folder \u0022%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Intercept Games\\Kerbal Space Program 2\u0022 (or something like that, since it\u0027s in this folder that the configuration is saved).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTry to delete that folder and restart the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf the issue persists, check that your user has the rights to read / write that folder\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks that fixed the problem, I also ran the game as admin and it seems to be working.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
