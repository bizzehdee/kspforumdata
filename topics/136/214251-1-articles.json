However, every time I quickload something bad happens to my spacecraft. Some parts just fly away even though the game still considers them to be attached; When I stage a decoupler, the camera won\u0027t focus on the cockpit anymore, which flies away from the camera and now I am stuck focusing on the void. Is this normal (as in, is this a known issue)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
