I had to shut down the PC by the main powerbutton or even the PSU directly. Taskmanager was impossible to open up via the windows button/taskbar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looks like i solved this issue by tuning down the graphics to medium and the waterspecs to low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce i encountered a freeze in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E but i was still able to open the taskmananger with the following message that the application (KSP2) has overused the system RAM (16Gb) and must be closed, which worked out by closing the app in taskmanager.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then lowered the shadow specs for the game to low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame runs now fine without any major issues aside the known bugs, but not at all so many. Landing on the mun and returning without saving is bugfree and smooth, no docking issues, no crash , no freeze. Nice gaming overall, very good framerate and no graphic issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: the game uses now around 8.3 Gb of RAM according to taskmanager, 5.3 Gb free.
