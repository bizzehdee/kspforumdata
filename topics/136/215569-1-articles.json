It tried to start up a few times but now it\u2019s on a screen that says \u201C preparing automatic repair\u201D but it\u2019s frozen. I\u2019ve tried to reboot it manually but the same thing happens. My pc should 100% be able to run this game. It ran the old version before the patch. I think the patch might have broken something and now my pc refuses to work. Any help would be super appreciated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Madishmike","CreatedById":226241,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-21T14:19:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, I have had similar before when a windows update screwed it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried safe mode with networking ?
