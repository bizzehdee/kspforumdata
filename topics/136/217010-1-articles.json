It stinks because longstanding missions are a bust, but vehicle testing and one-off missions are still a go this way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember that Early Access is the same as putting the game difficulty on \u0022Insane\u0022 mode, which is generally enjoyable for a small subset of players, and even then only in managed doses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kellerlk4","CreatedById":225332,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-04T15:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLOL. I agree about the early access. I\u0027ve tried all the above and then some. Unfortunately, the only thing I\u0027ve found that works is deleting my campaigns. I\u0027ve had to do this before. On the upside I can now build a rocket to Duna in under five minutes. Thanks for the response.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
