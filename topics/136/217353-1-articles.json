It has to do with the weight and size of the parts, loading into physics, and unbalanced part attachment strength, and probably some other issues, as well as the mass of a craft loading onto the runway, wobbly parts, kraken type bugs, etc etc. The best solution might be to make a bunch of smaller wings instead of large wings. These will be less likely to fall off and should still give you the same lift overall. Alternatives are to use a lot of struts to strengthen the attachment of the wings so they dont fall off. Whether you think this should be the case or not is not relevant. Another thing you could try would be to turn on unbreakable joints before loading the craft onto the runway. Then, once the plane is loaded onto the runway, turn it off again and proceed as normal. Your wings will probably still fall off when you try to lift off the ground or the forces become to strong but maybe not. Finally, some parts are better for attaching things to than others. They have stronger attachments. You could play around attaching wings to different parts to see which ones hold them the strongest.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Madishmike","CreatedById":226241,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-25T18:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething I have found that helps is when in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, place craft on ground (not in the ground).
