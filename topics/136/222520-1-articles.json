I have a 1-year old Windows 11 PC with 16GB of RAM. Since the For Science update I have noticed with increased frequency that KSP2 will crash my entire PC (ie other programs such as Spotify will crash first, then Windows itself hangs, forcing a hard restart). Inspecting task manager immediately before a crash shows KSP2 utilising 90% of available RAM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am playing on Exploration mode. The crashes happen almost exclusively in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (but I have had it happen once on Duna\u2019s surface). They first started when building larger interplanetary craft with multiple deployable satellites and landers in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. But now I am getting crashes even when assembling a simple craft such as just a recoverable booster - and these crashes happen after only 10 minutes in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have already reduced the graphics settings to medium overall with AA turned off. I have deleted debris and unused crafts. I have deleted old workspaces so I only have 8 now. I have also almost-entirely cleared the saves folder (so just a handful of saves). These haven\u2019t had a noticeable impact on frequency of crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u2019t tried restarting a new game as I am still playing through Exploration mode. I don\u2019t think this is a singular identifiable bug so I haven\u2019t posted this in the bugs subforum. Any tips to deal with this which don\u2019t involve starting a game all over again? Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-03T11:41:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi there, i have a similar issue since the update...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst for reference i use an 1\u00A0 1/2 year Windows 11pro PC with i7 11700F (2.5 gh base clock) and RTX 3060 with 16 gb ram and 20 gb vram.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen i start KSP2 offline from exe. it uses about 4 gb ram ( This goes up to max 8 gb) and 6 gb vram on the RTX with \u0022medium pc\u0022 setting. I noticed a performance decrease after the update in december, and i have not found any solution myself. My system throttles down the CPU speed and the framerates go down aswell, i updated every driver\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E even intel chipset\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E but nothing helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EI am suspecting an issue from the update along certain multicore cpus, because my cpu never surpasses overall 15% load while running the game.
