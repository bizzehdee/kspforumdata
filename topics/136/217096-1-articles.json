While doing a long burn, I\u0027m able to time warp up to 100x and everything seems to be working correctly. If you exceed 100x, the burn does continue to change the orbit however all of the staging gauges (fuel remaining, delta-V remaining, etc), all go to 0. Additionally it does not seem to be calculating fuel consumption correctly and I end up using way less fuel that I would have expected during the burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also have a suggestion that would make using ion engines easier. While time warping, the ship\u0027s orientation gets locked in space rather than locked to the navball (ie prograde/retrograde). It would be great to have an option to either lock it to space or lock it relative to the ship\u0027s orbit. This would also be useful for other ships to just stay oriented in the same direction while orbiting a planet like a real space station would do. But if you are trying to use a small ion engine to grow or shrink the orbit over multiple consecutive orbits, you need to be able to maintain prograde/retrograde for the entire burn so that the orbit spirals smaller/bigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep up the great work. So glad 0.1.2 has better performance :)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
