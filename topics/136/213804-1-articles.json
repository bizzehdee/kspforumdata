The week before release youtubers like Matt Lowne and a whole bunch of others started making videos of the games features and I am convinced that these videos that functioned as ads to generate hype for the game we\u0027re made with a developer build that was a better product than the version of the game we got at release. Because the game looks better in every way shape and form in these videos and ads than the way the game looked for me on release day. My pc specs are as follows: CPU-Ryzen 6-3600, GPU- Nvidia gtx3060 super, RAM-16gb high-speed DDR4, and I\u0027m running Samsung solid state drives. I want to be clear my pc is perfectly capable of running this game at it\u0027s maximum graphics, this isn\u0027t simply a case of an under-powered system trying to run this. I believe that Private Division engaged in false advertisement, if anyone has any proof that the build handed out to these youtubers the week before release to make videos to generate hype around the game was a different one to the build we received on release day please email me with the evidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sitting Duck","CreatedById":200432,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T02:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ERight...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you paid attention to Matt Lowne\u0027s videos before and after the Early Access release, you\u0027d note two things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHis system at ESA and at home are spec\u0027d much higher than yours, and he still had issues, but none of those were about visual quality.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running a 5900X CPU, 3090Ti GPU, 32GB of RAM, 1TB NVME, 2TB SSD game drive, blah blah.
