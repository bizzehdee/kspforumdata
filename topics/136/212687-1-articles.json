Almost every time I alt-tab to a different screen/window/whatever while the game loads or reverts to launch or whatever has a loading bar, the game will freeze and continuously remain in loading state. Requires restart of game and on one occasion restart of computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Additionally, I couldn\u0027t find any other bug report feature in game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple fix for 1: I don\u0027t switch to another window while loading. Okay, but there are a lot of games in which switching screens while loading works fine, and I\u0027m not going to sit around and do nothing while the game is loading.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComplex fix for 1: Devs come up with a super clever fix that continues to load the game while the game is not in focus.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEntertaining fix for 1: I don\u0027t play the game at all and I go outside and practice juggling while walking down the sidewalk until I try to cross the street and get run over by an amazon delivery truck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple fix for 2: I come here and report bugs. If this is the way, then this is the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComplex fix for 2: A bug report option is added to the game that let\u0027s us identify bugs and collect relevant information on the system and action being done. This is on my bucket wishlist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEntertaining fix for 2: I come here and report bugs and add in pics of cats and dogs doing stupid things in the back of amazon delivery trucks that just ran over wandering jugglers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOB\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
