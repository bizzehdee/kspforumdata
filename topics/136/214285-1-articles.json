I had just built a rocket and pressed launch and both my left and right monitors went black and had random red and blue text all over it, it looked a lot like some sort of graphics card crash. That screen stayed for a few seconds then my computer restarted. The next time I launched the game I had the overhead shot of the launch complex just like normal, I then click on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and load into it, it loaded in just fine but I immediately realized that I couldn\u2019t move the camera or build, their is no build UI, the location screen that is normally only visible during the overhead view of the complex is still there, and I can time warp using the meter in the bottom of the screen which is usually only there while flying a craft or inside the tracking station. \u00A0I have tried reverting the save, deleting the campaign, deleting all campaigns, game restart, pc restart, and even a fresh instal (not in that order) nothing works. *Side note on a fresh campaign I realized that every other location works fine but the moment I click on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E the glitch is permanent and if I click on any other location using the location menu I can hear the different music and background noise as if I\u2019m in the location but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is stuck in front of the screen. \u00A0If anyone has had the same issue please respond.
