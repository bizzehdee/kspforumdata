Made a fighter jet tried bridge challenge and launched one of the stock rockets into orbit did a successful orbit and then built an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E managing to get that into an orbit. I had closed and reopened the game between these points and it worked fine. However, once I started building a rocket to refuel my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, my game crashed shortly after launch. Since then, I\u0027ve only been able to play about 5 10 minutes at a time before it crashes sometimes in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E in the tracking centre and often right after take off. I don\u0027t know if this is a common issue people are having. I am running it off a laptop. I have a 3070 laptop graphics card with a Ryzen 5900 so my computer is comfortably above minimum and I\u0027m running the game on medium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foxybingotz","CreatedById":226208,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T05:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother piece of information that might help.
