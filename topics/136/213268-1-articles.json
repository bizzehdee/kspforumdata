I go into map view and when I come out the camera is wayy zoomed out and centered 20m off the ship once I do zoom in making docking impossible. Ive tried switching ships then switching back,\u00A0 exiting my kerbal from the ship then reboarding but once the camera breaks it always defaults to broken. I checked through the forums but no one else has posted about this yet. has anyone else had this problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T17:50:26Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by 1an\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
