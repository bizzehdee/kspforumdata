Then when I started it, all I was getting was the music and a black screen, so then I closed it and reset my computer and tried again which then gave me a picture and eventually got to the point where I could start a campaign, however, once I set it up it just kept playing the music and a black screen for nearly an hour....just nothing at all, even at lower settings, and even when bypassing steam and launching from the .exe file in folder.\u00A0 I\u0027ve got an AMD Radeon 6700XT 12GB VRAM, 16 GB RAM, AMD Ryzen 5 3600X.
