It appeared that some kind of rotational force builds up in time warp and is all applied when you come out. Iv had it with any vessel. Doing a very short time warp just gives it a jolt but warping through half an orbit puts it into a spin that cause the vessel to fly apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miri99","CreatedById":226669,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T19:24:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a similar issue with a craft entering kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and then getting completely separated and parts being flung out of the kerbin system after exiting time warp\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazooka","CreatedById":226666,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T22:32:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame issue, happened to me on the Mun and Kerbin\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
