Everything is fine until I circularize around the Mun. At that point, my PE starts to steadily drop. No \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on the craft, does it with engines enabled or disabled. Reloading a save or changing to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or Tracking Station doesn\u0027t help either. If I quit the game and come back in, I will usually have a VASTLY different set of orbit numbers than when I quit (i.e. initial circularization to a 15 x 15 km orbit, but when I reload I get 32 x 3 km or something equally whacked). I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s happening but it seems to be the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E change from Kerbin to the Mun that triggers it, as any maneuver I\u0027ve made around Kerbin doesn\u0027t cause the PE to start dropping once I finish the maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has happened through multiple campaigns and multiple ships. I have even uninstalled and reinstalled the game, but no dice.
