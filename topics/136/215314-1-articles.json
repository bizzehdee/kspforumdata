Additionally I can only save one vessel at a time, trying to save another deletes the first saved vessel. After the update the game also randomly crashes and closes out. A red box appears before it closes. Thanks for reading this and have a great day.\u00A0 My system is a Zenbook pro\u00A0 Intel I7 with 16 gig ram.\u00A0 This happens about 50 percent of the time.\u00A0 The other 50 it runs great and is a lot of fun.\u00A0\u00A0I love KSP and KSP 2.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Mike\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
