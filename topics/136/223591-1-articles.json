I\u0027ve had a crashing to desktop problems since the beginning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings I\u0027ve tried:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. I\u0027ve looked over the forums, reading other peoples problems, tried most of them. - No Change\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Emailed the KSP2 team. We went back and forth awhile, i sent them my log files. They told me they didn\u0027t have a solution for me and told me they were stopping communications.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Reinstalled drivers - No change\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Reinstalled windows(complete format) - No change\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Deleted registry items (Found in another post) - No Change\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Reinstalled graphics drivers (Removed them first) - No Change\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Deleted save files(only to have it happen again).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. Tried running in admin - No Change\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crashes seem to happen at different times. Sometimes they happen when it\u0027s loading. Most of the time it\u0027s within the first 5 mins of gameplay. No one action seems to make it crash. Sometimes, it\u0027s when i get out to EVA. It can happen when my lander touches a surface.

Just seem very random.\u00A0 I will add that i have also verified game files and reinstalled the game 4\u002B times with no changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst i thought it was memory leaks, because my ram would be crazy high usuage. The last update said they fixed that....so i gave it another try, and no, still crashing within 5 mins of starting the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext i monitored my temps. Nothing too high at all. Very normal values.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy pc is pretty good:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOS: Windows 10 \u00A0(10.0.19045) 64bit\u003Cbr\u003E\nCPU: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900KS (32)\u003Cbr\u003E\nRAM: 32525\u003Cbr\u003E\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (10053MB)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLink to the player.log and save file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vz9zspH5tR5TsZxfQoOcCIilXf-bXVBG?usp=drive_link\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vz9zspH5tR5TsZxfQoOcCIilXf-bXVBG?usp=drive_link\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to play the game so bad!!

And in none of these cases am I hitting a low memory condition, with it using at most 50% of my RAM.\u00A0 Very frustrating and always results an me shutting it down and swearing I am not playing KSP2 until next release.\u00A0 But, then the urge to accomplish something creeps back in and I grit my teeth and deal with several crashes (and maybe make some progress) before I get a ship designed and ready to fly somewhere, then deal with more crashes while trying to load at my destination.\u00A0 Then, I finally run into a particular build that seems to crash right away, so after about 5 crashes in \u0026lt; 15 minutes, I get frustrated and shut it down and swear I am not playing it again until next release\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blue Horizon","CreatedById":233315,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-19T02:19:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy solution has been to regularly purging outdated save files not necessary to my current save from previous versions as well as the current version so long as logged saves for one game doesn\u0027t exceed 25 you should be good.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceNerd221","CreatedById":228856,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-26T04:46:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-04-26T04:47:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2024 04:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Apr 26\u0022\u003EApril 26\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceNerd221\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eposted by accident\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spectre89","CreatedById":233908,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-09T22:24:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you ever sort this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
