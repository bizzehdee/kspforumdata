And I am running at 4k.\u00A0 The rocket audio! MY GOD it\u0027s AWESOME! And the some of the quality of life features that are in the base game are pretty nice (namely the warp to maneuver).\u00A0 I know its early access, but man there are some great bones in the background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow onto the bad so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug: Repeatable:-Cannot control satellites if launched from a crewed vessel. The probe says there is no connection to network.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug: Keybinds do not stay\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug: Keybinds are overlapping (D for yaw right and for some reason View zoom were on the same key. No changes were made in the keybinds)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug: Heavy rockets and fueled boosters do not like to attach. I tried a couple different configurations.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug: Landing gear on heavy planes wheel sets like to fall off on the runway at around 200 m/s. tried with large and XL parts to help fix this issue. Didn\u0027t help. Just added a second set of rear wheels to help keep the plane moving\u00A0straight-ish down the runway\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug?: Planes are very bouncy at the start of the runway. But this could be a user error on my end.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug: Rockets are falling apart on the launch pad, strutted or not.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug: I am having issues with stuff exiting the\u00A0 cargo bays of my planes. This may have to do with the satellites bug. I need to do more testing on my end\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug: CANNOT LOCKOUT TANKS FROM MAIN STAGE!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug: Cannot deselect items in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E if trying to edit ship. i put the item over the trash and it doesn\u0027t get rid of it. (edit1)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug: When driving rover across the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E area, more specifically the hills to the south weath, the paint of the rover becomes the ground texture. (edit2)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBug: When driving through the trees , the sprite, if we want to call it that, becomes smaller and eventually goes into the ground like its folding away from you, but the tree is still there? Its a bit confusing, but I\u00A0 can recreate it. (edit 2)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings I would like to see soon-ish:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe able to split groups for staging purposes. (think asparagus staging) It is currently very difficult to do so.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSatcom networks\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nParts manager needs to be cleaned up quite a bit. IMO it should only have the parts that are interfaceable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlease add adjustable power setting for rover wheels. Cannot drive to the top of the mountains by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and I want to post Radar guidance vehicles! haha (edit2)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, not bad for an early access, but it is VERY early access in some ways. Keep up the good work.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit 1: added another bug\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit 2: added bugs and feature request\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T20:01:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Fallenak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded bugs and feature request\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
