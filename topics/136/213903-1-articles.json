This place is the same as it was when the time warp started, causing unnecessary crashes. I\u0027m not sure how to report bugs here, but I have included an image to hopefully help explain it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is a space station I decided to launch in orbit of Kerbin. The grey orbit is the booster stage, supposed to circularise the orbit so it doesn\u0027t fall back to Kerbin. I started timewarping to see if the orbit was stable enough, but it\u00A0 seemed as if the orbit of the booster stage did not move with the planet. Eventually, it crashed into the planet. Here, it isn\u0027t an issue, but for coupling the station, I would need to do it without timewarping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/388416491319721995/1080138595635048458/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
