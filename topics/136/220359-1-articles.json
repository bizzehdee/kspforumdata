It looks like maybe all the fuel was consumed by the lower stage before separation, even though nothing connects them except the decoupler. I didn\u0027t fiddle with the decoupler settings at all, so there\u0027s no way I could have enabled cross-feed (if that\u0027s even possible with decouplers).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J6FWpABndMI?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Six reasons KSP2 is still not ready (yet)\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
