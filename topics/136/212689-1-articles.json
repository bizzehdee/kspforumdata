Haven\u2019t figured out a workaround. It occurs every time the thing loads after recovery. When I load it at the launch pad it works fine for flight, but when it loads in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, even on a revert from flight. I get a bunch of detached parts under the floor. Attempting to rotate the camera or move some of the parts can lock the camera in place or even change the color scheme. My uneducated guess is from the lighting engine interacting with what should be an out of bounds area. Your picture is pretty representative. My craft was a squat lander I was testing. Vessel height may be relevant. I also moved the vertical position of the workspace upward before building originally, so that may have something to do with it also. This did not happen to me until I actually recovered the vessel after flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T23:21:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Belshee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
