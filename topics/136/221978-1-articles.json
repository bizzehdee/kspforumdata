I wanted to bring a probe (stayputnik pod) back to Kerbin. I entered the atmopshere in a pretty shallow angle (PE set to ~50km; AP set to ~80km). At the pod I had a small battery, 4 antennas and the small heat shield and 4 small drogue chuts attached. After going down the 70 km threshold I saw my AP and PE slowly decreasing due drag. I decoupled the probe fully form the last stage (consisted of the 2nd smallest fuel tank with the terrier (?) engine and right after decoupling my AP and PE started to increase slowly (about a meter per second) and drag didn\u0027t seem to have any influence anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease fix this bug asap. Thanks. =)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"8han","CreatedById":231972,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-02T16:15:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have had this issue too. The workaround is to go above 3x time warp the moment the game allows you (once you leave kerbin atmosphere) and then warp at 4x until you are about to re-enter the atmosphere for another pass. When above 3x time warp the ap and pe stop increasing. This minimises the increase. I had an eve orbiter that almost didn\u0027t make it home due to this issue before I figured out the workaround.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
