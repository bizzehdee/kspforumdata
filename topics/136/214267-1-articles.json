This seems really bad to me but I don\u0027t see anyone posting about this with my type of hardware. I took a video and this is exactly how laggy I get when I crash a ship or plane.\u00A0 Is there something really wrong with my system or is this what others experience as well?

Everything was great until it hit the ground, and then LAG as my Rapid Planned Disassembly took over the game. It wasn\u0027t as bad as yours, but I\u0027m running a 5900X\u00A0 | 32GB RAM @ 3600 | 3090Ti GPU which is a little more power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had Task Mangler and HWiNFO running at the same time, and didn\u0027t really see my CPU cores spike more than they were already (not that I could tell, anyway, but only 4 out of 12 were working hard).

The way the game is written/optimized right now, it\u0027s probably just something we\u0027ll need to wait for a fix on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might try testing out something smaller (build / launch / crash) and see what your results are.

I feel better knowing that the same experience occurs with other folks. I looked at GPU performance and I didn\u0027t see any real spikes during that time.
