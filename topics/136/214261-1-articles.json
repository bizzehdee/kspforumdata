I then built 3 segments to a space station on them, one crew segment, one solar panel segment, and one structural segment for expansion. This then had an XL tank (the middle one) and L/XL orbital engine on it for the 2nd stage. The first stage was the XL long tank with a mammoth engine and 4 of the Medium Long SRBs (because this was heavy and I am horrible when it comes to fuel efficiency).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003EThe Problem:\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E (100km circular orbit), I attempted to undock the parts to reconfigure them in their less symmetrical form.

Then the segment will rubber band back to its original housing on the docking port, I will get a message saying the ship is out of fuel (each segment has a near full monoprop tank), the flight log will appear as if I just ended the flight, and everything still reports operational in the parts manager.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ETroubleshooting:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI can keep trying this process over and over on the same flight to no avail\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nQuick loading or restarting the game also didn\u0027t help.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf I have the setting for requiring comms on, then the probes and their antennae will not have an option to connect them to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E even when directly above it and a Kerbal is onboard the crew section.
