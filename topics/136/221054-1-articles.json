Is this a common bug that anyone else has encountered. The craft was using the new grid fins, 4 on the body of the launch vehicle to provide control during launch. There is no apparent explosion, and no clear reason as to why the vehicle is destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, PAIGE is not a helpful tool, and only adds frustration to situations like this.
