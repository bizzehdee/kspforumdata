I saved and then quit for the night. Upon returning I couldn\u0027t load that save, or any save in the last 30 minutes tht included the ship most recently used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would click the load button, then the most recent save (or save with said ship), it would show the loading splash screen, make it to \u0022Creating Vessel\u0022 and then never progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAttempts to Fix:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI followed the guide for posting here and verified steam integrity, as well as getting the player log and zip of save folder. I then deleted the save folder and ran the game (it worked of course), then re-added the save to see if the problem persisted and it did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIdea:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing the ship file became courrupted or something similar to that. I double I\u0027m the first person with this problem but can\u0027t find another post using the search so I thought it would be a good idea to post this information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
