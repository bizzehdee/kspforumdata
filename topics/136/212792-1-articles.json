The landing was a success, but an unrelated mission-ending bug forced him to be stranded there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I decided to go rescue Bill with Tim C, but an unrelated mission-ending bug forced the mission to also strand itself near Bill\u0027s ship as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt some point during the approach, though, Bill and his ship sunk into the terrain while I was landing Tim C, and he ended up 2 or 3km below the surface by the time I noticed. Tim C would\u0027ve landed about 200 meters away from Bill\u0027s ship otherwise. Either I didn\u0027t attempt to switch to Bill, or I was unable to (I don\u0027t remember which), because I didn\u0027t focus on Bill\u0027s craft. Similarly, a spent stage from Bill\u0027s craft that landed near Bill is also missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy next mission was a Minmus rover with Valentina, which successfully landed, but due to another unrelated mission-ending bug, the rover was unusable on the surface. After kicking it around in the low Minmus gravity with Val on EVA, the rover blipped out of existence on contact with the ground. I don\u0027t think I tried to search for it in the tracking station. An interesting effect with this specific bug though, was that the distance indicator stayed fixed on screenspace at 17m, instead of moving around the screen when you move around the camera or Val as expected. Val\u0027s still on the surface in EVA, but the rover is gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis type of bug is probably the biggest deal, because although the other mission ending bugs were mission ending, those were at least fun to try and work around, whereas this kind of bug presumably just deletes your chances of survival. Otherwise, in my opinion, the game\u0027s bugs have been fine (charming and enjoyable, even).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shalfar","CreatedById":135028,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T16:23:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had the same problem with a lander that didn\u0027t have enough fuel to return to orbit.\u00A0 I sent a rescue mission just to find the first lander had sunk into the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T17:02:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, colonies are coming someday, and the scientists always told us that colonies on other worlds would have to be underground to shield from radiation...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
