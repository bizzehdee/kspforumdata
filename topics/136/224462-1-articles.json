I fully tested all parts of the rover at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E runway, including the sample grabber, to ensure that everything functioned before sending it out. All of the parts functioned properly at the runway. However, once landed on Duna the Sample Grabber no longer functions. The button to run the experiment comes up in the parts manager window, but when pressed it only says Invalid Research Location. Help please if anyone has any ideas. Oh, and v 0.2.1.0 for referance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevermind, I solved this issue! Always remember folks to check and adjust your suspension settings when under a different gravity effect than your test environment!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-21T15:39:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2024 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 21\u0022\u003EMay 21\u003C/time\u003E by Blue Horizon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
