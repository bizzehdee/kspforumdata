A lot. And .24.2 just works with all the mods the server uses. Anyone else play multiplayer KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\u0027ve repurposed an SSI Neutron H (see link in my sig below) to be compatible with Remote Tech - after all, you never know when you\u0027ll need an autonomous flying VTOL SSTO to rescue a downed Kerbal anywhere on Kerbin or at 120km altitude...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O4HqUXy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022O4HqUXy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2OEWX3V.png\u0022 alt=\u00222OEWX3V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only major change is in shifting a few fuel lines, RCS tanks, and reverse snapping on a K7 Remote Tech dish. It eats up power when parked, but when flying, it\u0027s able to accomplish its missions autonomously. Anyone interested? I also have a .25 compatible version as well, but I don\u0027t play .25... not yet anyways, at least not until DMP comes out with version 1.6 on Oct 31.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T20:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E.25 looks even neater. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ill post a pic shortly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
