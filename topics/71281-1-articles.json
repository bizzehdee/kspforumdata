This has been resolved by adding the Skipper to same same node as the poodle. Getting the the science lab a tier prior to docking ports, and on a separate research line. There are other examples as well. But overall, IMO there feels like there are \u003Cem\u003Eright\u003C/em\u003E ways to advance through the tech tree, and very very \u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E ways to advance through the tree, and wrong ways aren\u0027t clear at the points where the decisions are made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, it looks like they they created the tech tree, gave the nodes names, \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E assigned the parts to the locations that best fit the names. This is totally back@$$ward from how a tech tree \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be designed. The order that parts become useful should be determined first, then the nodes should be arranged in a way that unlocks the parts in that order. Maybe that\u0027s what actually happened, and I tend to progress through the tree in an odd way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, this is a balance issue, and therefore just needs to be addressed prior to the final release. But the fact that it exists in this state currently seems, to me, further evidence that the devs just didn\u0027t understand some fundamental concepts of game system design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever the reason of it, there are plenty of places where the tech tree as it stands feels awkard in cumbersome. Again, I just hope it gets fixed before the final release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more time, everything above is personal opinion.
