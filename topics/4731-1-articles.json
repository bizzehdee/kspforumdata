It was amazingly stable, so I added another.. And another. And another. Now, at four on each side it gets a little bit less stable; some spin gets thrown in. It\\\u0027s nothing I can\\\u0027t fix at altitude, but it probably messes up my flight path some. At five, the spin becomes ridiculous. I\\\u0027ve tried adding struts to these outside rockets, adding tail fins (both kinds) and nothing seems to work.
