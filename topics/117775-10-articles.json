I havent worked on it. But she is not forgotten. I am still working with her in blender yesterday as a matter of fact. But not for KSP but for cough ARMA3 cough. It will be \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E. Scrams will be replaced with a internal weapons bay. And rocket engines with jet engines. A high altitude bomber. Some would say why put it in arma? I say simply \u0022because I want to\u0022. And if and when squad ever gets done with this dev cycle I will work on her for KSP. The model is pretty much chopped up and ready for unity.
