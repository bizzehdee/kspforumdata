The rocketcarrier is flying good until it reaches ca. 9000-10000 m and then I get a terrible stall. \u003E![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nThe Carrier starts spining around etc. If I am lucky I can get control of the craft at 2000 m but the mission is failed either way. ???\n\nHere is a pic of my carrier. \n\n![Rocketplane1.jpg](http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii556/BLSPBlackDeath/Rocketplane1.jpg)\n\nPlease help.

Once you detach the Munar rocket, you would still be controlling the carrier. Unless that\\\u0027s what you intend, I would reconstruct the craft to have the command pod on the Munar rocket with the carrier attached."},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T19:51:11Z","Content":"I can\\\u0027t find the nosecone in [NovaPunch](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=4180.0) parts.

Tomorrow I will redesign the craft with your suggestions.\n\nThe thing on top of the carrier is an rocketengine, because I thought the stall would be there because of to little speed.\n\nThanks again. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nUpdate: Now it is looking like UmbralRaptor\\\u0027s with RCS and it works.
