I had tried some Snr Docking ports so I could manually let my payload off, but the joints swayed like a helicopter rotor and snapped off all the attempts to strut the bugger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt makes no sense, the ship barely lifts off with 50% throttle but does reach decent heights with good fuel but then... a decoupler will simply break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could understand it if it broke at launch when all the boosters suddenly kick in, but at nearly 10k km , just thinking of doing my turn and ... what?!? Wheres MechJech ? What ? Why has all my ASAS gone ? Check flight data and sure enough the decoupler broke squashing the ASAS ring and Mechjeb at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENO, I am not using time warp, or physics warp (if that is indeed something different) I am just press T - CapsLock - and throttling to 50% - hitting launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYES , I has launch stabilisers to hold the rocket, and have some Canards for atmosphere control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I need that Farams mod to sort out the atmosphere simulation, or what ? I have watched a lot of videos, tutorials etc etc and really wanted to try some of the things... do orbits gets dull after a few launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some bugs with the structures (I heard something about the orange tanks breaking unless you buffered them with grey tanks for some reason) ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I perhaps putting the ASAS , Probe , RCS fuel, Battery Ring and Decoupler in the wrong order ? There was some difficulty in getting some of the parts to attach to the probe ring and it does seem hollow... so does the decoupler to the fuel tank, perhaps it needs a engine to work as a decoupler ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am pretty sure the launcher is solid, I got the design from a picture of one of the fancy launchers with the multiple engines underneath the tank (similar to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35856-Launch-Vehicles-Other-Than-Asparagus\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35856-Launch-Vehicles-Other-Than-Asparagus\u003C/a\u003E - first pic), but went for 1 mainsail and lots of LT45 with a ring of droppable LT35 (no gimbals)...

As the saying goes, MOAR STRUTS. Red tanks have a bug that make engines overheat when attached straight to it, which is why a lot of people put a white tank between the red and engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut back to your main issue, structural failures. I\u0027ve found that once you get to heavy stuff you need to \u0027stitch\u0027 everything together with struts. Each piece needs a few struts connecting it to the next piece, or as some do it every other piece (and then alternate). Payload strutted to top tank, top tank strutted to tank/decoupler below, decoupler strutted to next tank, etc. Once you do really heavy stuff even that\u0027s not enough, at which point to spread the load I normally attach cubic octagonal struts (or girders) radially onto the tanks near the bottom/top and connect a bunch of struts to the other side\u0027s girder. From the girders I spread out strut connections onto the tank it\u0027s on. And in extreme cases, diagonally to another tank\u0027s girders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a demonstration picture from my latest heavy lifter (124 tons to orbit).
