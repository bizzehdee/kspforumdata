Plenty of power etc but after a lot of observing\u00A0all I\u0027ve seen is\u00A0one massive asteroid. Most of the time there is nothing. I had hoped to find a medium sized asteroid to capture and bring into Duna orbit as the basis of a refuelling station (through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E). So far I\u0027ve found 1 massive object way too far from Duna to even think about grabbing. I was hoping for a selection more like what is around Kerbin (both in numbers, size variation and range).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this is as good as it gets in the game or can I somehow coax the Sentinel to be more productive? I\u0027ve even tried pointing the telescope lens directly at Duna! ;-)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-12T08:42:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsn\u0027t the sentinel supposed to look \u003Cem\u003Eaway\u003C/em\u003E from the sun? If you put yours in an orit above Duna, it will be lookin inwards instead. That may be why it finds next to nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut your telescope in an orbit in between Kerbin and Duna. That should allow it to find asteroids around Duna\u0027s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xerogravity","CreatedById":138388,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-12T10:12:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the reply but that is how it is set up at the moment; \u0022\u003Cem\u003Ein\u00A0solar orbit just inside the Duna orbit\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould it be better to have it well inside the Duna orbit? My thinking was that I want asteroids close to Duna, not on the far side of the orbit so I didn\u0027t want the telescope to start racing away from Duna by being too far inside the Duna/Kerbol orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the telescope is set up to function in such a way that, wherever it is relative to Duna, so long as it\u0027s between Kerbin and Duna on a solar orbit, it only finds asteroids close(ish) to Duna? If so, I\u0027ll move it into a solar orbit half way between Kerbin and Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
