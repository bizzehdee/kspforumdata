I\u0027ve got a quick question for you- How much of an impact does caustics have on game performance?

It uses the depth buffer to inject the caustics into the shadowmask (essentially a texture where the shadows are as they should look on your screen, all shaders then read the corresponding pixel on the shadowmask to check if they are in shadow or not, I just add the caustics there). The caustics are basically two layers of the same texture mixed with some different scales and speeds.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So no rendering meshes, no re-rendering objects, basically a few texture fetches so it\u0027s fast.\n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Not a Spy","CreatedById":205528,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-23T07:50:03Z","Content":"ok, so i looked it up, here is an updated link\n\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11yf5w2EapaAxD90aMwG1WRFxBK4VVY6T?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11yf5w2EapaAxD90aMwG1WRFxBK4VVY6T?usp=sharing)"},{"CreatedByName":"Not a Spy","CreatedById":205528,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-24T09:01:41Z","Content":"Can someone please respond?"},{"CreatedByName":"DJ Reonic","CreatedById":161437,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-24T11:56:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Not a Spy said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Can someone please respond?\n\u003E \n\nPeople have lives outside of KSP.
