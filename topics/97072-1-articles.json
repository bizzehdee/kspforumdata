First, and the most frustrating, is that it stutters in VAB, but only at certain camera rotation directions. Particularly at the default direction facing launchpad, the one that you can\u0027t change until you place your cockpit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E Stutter diminishes when you point your camera at the wall of VAB opposite of the entrance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the second thing is that in tutorals game stutters as well when some messages are popped which you can\u0027t close until you satisfy some condition. Particularly, at the asteroid rendezvous (thanks KSP for teaching me that fancy word) mission part 1, when you are asked to set your orbit to \u0026lt; 10 km to asteroid rendezvous point. As soon as you set the right orbit, \u0022Next\u0022 button becomes available, and as you click it, stutter vanishes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
