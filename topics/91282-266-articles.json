It\u0027s that it\u0027s less efficient than a bunch of other, simpler options. There is nothing wrong with the concept on the fundamental level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately, what you\u0027re trying to do is making propellant depart your ship as rapidly as possible. You have two principal ways of achieving this. You can either make propellant really hot and let thermodynamics do its thing or you can apply electromagnetic forces to accelerate propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are going with any kind of thermal engine, the limiting factors are temperature of the chamber and how light the particles of propellant are. The lighter the particles, the more velocity they\u0027ll have at the same temperature. With water exhaust, a LH2\u002BLOX engine is already really, really close to the limit before your combustion chamber starts to melt. There are some clever ideas for afterburners, but they\u0027re more about augmenting thrust than I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E. So the only way to get better efficiency is to have exhaust that\u0027s lighter than water. Realistically, that\u0027s helium or hydrogen. And there are few reasons not to go hydrogen at this point. At this point, you\u0027ll have to start adding heat from external source. How you do this is kind of irrelevant. An electric arc is fine, but you can also just use a nuclear reactor. That\u0027s all that NTR is. You pipe hydrogen through core of a reactor and use the heat to drive the rocket. And the thing is, the I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0of an NTR is also just limited by temperature at which components start to melt. And you can\u0027t go much past that. Even if you decided to recombine atomic hydrogen into molecular, you are still temperature-limited, so you aren\u0027t getting a better I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two ways to circumvent it. First, you go even lighter. Don\u0027t recombine hydrogen and use atomic hydrogen for propulsion. This can let you get more I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0at the same temperature. This is where I thought you were going with all of this. It is, however, very energy-inefficient. Your other option is to have other means of confinement. Basically, instead of working with a gas, you start working with plasma. VASIMR rockets do precisely that. They are essentially thermal rockets with a plasma bottle for a chamber. Here, instead of wasting energy on splitting hydrogen, just increase the energy you put into plasma and get more thrust. There is just no reason to deal with atomic hydrogen once you are working with plasma until you get into absolutely absurd energy ranges, but then the question becomes what your power plant is?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in the end, there just isn\u0027t a niche for atomic hydrogen in anything remotely like modern rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-08T21:49:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust like how deforestation affect the change on Earth\u0027s climate, could (over)-reforestation (I don\u0027t know the term, but essentially too much trees on the planet) push the Oxygen level on Earth\u0027s atmosphere to a deadly concentration?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-08T23:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224063265\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221639000155\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168061\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ARS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, ARS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust like how deforestation affect the change on Earth\u0027s climate, could (over)-reforestation (I don\u0027t know the term, but essentially too much trees on the planet) push the Oxygen level on Earth\u0027s atmosphere to a deadly concentration?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems unlikely.
