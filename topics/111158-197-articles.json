(Grow)\n\u003E \n\nGood question. It\u0027s because since the early days of the forum, the very beginning of the forum was to be supportive of those who play Kerbal Space Program. Sal once told me that he preferred it this way because this game has a steep learning curve. And he had the vision this forum needed to be there to help people get the most out of the game. Since then, this forum has been described as a \u0022giant hug box\u0022 and this, I believe, has fed the expansion of the forum.\n\nYou\u0027ll still find people coming here to get advice and answers on how to get stuff into orbit or how to get it back down - and everything in between. There are also those who may no longer play the game yet still come here because of friendships developed over the years (I\u0027ve been here since 2012). Again, this isn\u0027t surprising because of the supportive nature of the forum. I just hope the forum will continue to live up to the dreams and hopes of Sal and Harvester.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, Arco123 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E And, (Slightly off topic.) how did you guys become mods?
