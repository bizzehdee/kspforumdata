I have spent the last year looking for work to no avail so thought it\u0027s time to think outside the box!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a BEng in Aerospace engineering with astronautics and space technology from Kingston University London. After that I spent a year looking for work. I sent out hudreds of applications, got one interview but no job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo back to school for me! I went back to University to get my masters. Which I recieved in Space Technology and Planetary exploration from Surrey University Guildford. So off searching I go again. This time I got a job in retail as I needed the money to stay with my fiance. That was a year ago...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI send off applications on a nearly daily baisis and get rejections just as often. If any of you are in an engineering firm and know of a position or know someone who knows someone any help would be greatly appreciated. My main interests are in the mission design side, phase 0 studies would be awesome, but pretty much any engineering foothold in a space company would be wecome. I am more than happy to relocate should the right job (meaning any job) come along.
