I can just about reach 20k \u00A0in height before loosing speed and flipping out. The propellers don\u2019t rotate the craft and are at the com. They are constantly getting fed power so I don\u2019t see what I\u2019m doing wrong. I want to be able to reach 30k or higher to save vessel mass but I was wondering if anyone has help for this issue. Also the launcher can go into orbit. It just needs props that can go that height.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimera Industries","CreatedById":216952,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-05T20:09:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell there is an altitude limit for propellers, they are basically tiny wings after all. The general rule of thumb is the higher altitude flight, the faster you have to go. On Eve this is made much easier by the dense atmosphere, but there is still a limit.\u00A0 If you are trying to get a contract on Eve at an altitude above 20km (which is my exact scenario lol) then all you need is a temporary boost in speed to get to the proper altitude and maintain flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry some twitch engines (small, radially mounted to save node attachments) and some small fuel tanks. Pros: high thrust Cons: horrible fuel efficiency, dead weight when fuel runs out. This will work if it\u0027s only like 4 contracts, but not if you want sustained flight for extended durations. If you want that, you could try...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore propellers. At a higher altitude, with less air, they won\u0027t work as well, so if you add more, they might make up for the loss in efficiency. If you haven\u0027t, try adding solar panels on the wings (the OX-STAT non-deployable kind) to fill the electrical requirements and try finding ways to fit in more wing area. Pros: sustainable flight might be possible, goes much faster at a lower altitude Cons: higher launch mass \u002B payload size\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps, at least it\u0027s not like my earlier attempts at Eve planes before there was a DLC and it all had to be rocket powered...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, I just reread that and I see you\u0027re trying to do a launch assist plane to get to a low orbit. (Not sure if that\u0027s the actual name for it but it works)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t have mods for that you\u0027ll lose the plane when you switch to the craft that gets into orbit. Unless the rocket itself has propellers on it? Can you describe your launch vehicle or post a picture, that would help a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-05T20:13:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2023 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by chimera industries\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
