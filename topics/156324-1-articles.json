I was inspired by some picture of cute characters redone to be big epic characters, and I figured I might try my hand at a Kerbal. I kept in some strange Kerbal proportions like extra long arms and the uneven proportion of upper/lower leg bones. I gave him the half-EVA-half-IVA space suit from my old MultiColorSpaceSuits texture replacer pack, so he keeps his orange suit but also has jetpack, EVA-rated boots and gloves, and a control box on the front. It appears that Jeb is disappointed in being changed, maybe he liked being a cute little blob after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-12T01:29:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2017 01:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
