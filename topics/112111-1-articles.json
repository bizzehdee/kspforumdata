As for the the NFT tank mass/volume issue I don\u0027t really have a solution either. Personally for me I tend to mix in the tanks as needed for various configurations but it tends to be when I need less dV that I use the NFT tanks since I get so much more out of other tanks. When I don\u0027t need as much, I go for the NFT tanks to conserve mass as a result of lower fuel weight.

This may not apply to some people but does to those of us who are heavy career players (all I play actually). The Kerbodyne tank is only 5166.2 whereas the Mondo-30 is 18194.4. That\u0027s a significant difference you pay for simply saving 2.39t. The height difference between the two is nearly negligible too with the Mondo-30 saving you .1m of height. Where I see there are inconsistencies in a number of other tanks, what I\u0027m seeing on the 3.75m formats seem to be very well balanced. The other size 3 NFP tanks are a little more complicated to simulate and I would never fly those kinds of configurations with size 1,2 and 3 stock tanks mixed together but when I put them on just to balance out weights/fuel totals I see pretty much the same thing as I do between the Mondo-30 and Kerbo 7200 in the 3.75m lines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T09:21:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I posted in the NFP thread.

As long as I stuck with using tanks for roughly their intended purpose (NFP tanks for LH2 only, stock tanks for fuel/oxidizer combinations), things seem pretty balanced, at least for this size of ship. Stock LF/OX engines get high TWR and low delta-v, hydrogen nukes get low TWR and high delta-v, cryo rockets ended up about halfway in-between, which is pretty much (in my non-engineer\u0027s mind at least) the way it should be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only suggestion would be (if this is possible) to disable Interstellar Fuel Switch for the NFP tanks, keep them restricted to LH2-only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just for the sake of argument, here are the values for the same ship with LF/O propulsion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoodle \u002B LF/O stock tanks: wet mass 27.8t, dry mass 6.6t, TWR 0.92, 4361 m/s delta-v. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkipper \u002B LF/O stock tanks: wet mass 29.1t, dry mass 7.8t, TWR 2.28, 3659 m/s delta-v. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is interesting because the Poodle option actually compares favorably to the Tunguska option (and is a bit cheaper to boot, for us career-mode people).

On the other hand, the LH2 Nerv gets more delta V per mass than the cryo engines. The Chelyabinsk \u0026amp; HM21 tank give 9,940 delta V with a total mass of 24,865 kg. The LH2 Nerv \u0026amp; HM21 tank has only 4,261 delta V, but only weighs in at 7,909kg. The cryo engine gives 0.40m/s dV/kg whereas the Nerv gives 0.54 m/s dV/kg. For additional comparison, the LH2 Nerv gives 0.39m/s dV/kg when placed on a Jumbo 64. Conversely, the LF Nerv gives 0.35m/s dV/kg. As a final reference point, the Chelyabinsk gives 0.32m/s dV/kg. Those number speak for themselves. If we, however, put this in context that the cryo engine gets almost twice the dV per jumbo 64 that the LH2 Nerv does, and that the LF Nerv gets three and a half times the dV per tank (assuming tank is set to engine\u0027s fuel only), the convenience of having to take three and a half times less tankage for the same dV, even at a significantly lower TWR, becomes the higher concern for the player. The gains in efficiency are not significant enough over the losses in convenience to make this appealing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, the NFP LH2 tanks have a bit of wierdness going on when they\u0027re filled with LH2/Ox. This can be seen in the table above as their masses are \u003Cstrong\u003Egreater\u003C/strong\u003E than stock tanks with the same fuel composition even though their dry masses are lower and their volumes are roughly the same. What I gather is that the fudge factor on fuel volumes is applied to the NFP tanks but not the stock tanks when using the fuel switcher. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(As a random sidenote, I had an idea on alternate meshes. Perhaps the LH2 section could shrink down to about 90% of the tank\u0027s length and the other 10% became four small white cylinders for the LOX.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe NFP tanks have a measurable advantage for mass and dV however they are currently at a \u003Cstrong\u003Edisadvantage\u003C/strong\u003E for sheer volume. I presume this is because stock tanks assume the entire tank mesh is usable volume, whereas Nertea calculates his tank volumes based on the actual gold pill tank inside the structural framework. The Jumbo 64 holds ~13.5% \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E LH2 than the HM21, which is the Near Future equivalent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EWhere do we go from here?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease keep in mind that KSP is a game first, simulator second.

An alternative proposal would be to remove the fudge factor from stock tanks, but again, this only exaggerates the problem when using certain parts, rather than fixing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELH2/Ox is in a solid place right now, even if there is mass wierdness with the NFP tanks. Cryo engines gain a measurable and often significant boost in dV from using the NFP tanks than using stock tanks, as one would expect given their intent to be more efficient, yet not suitable for launch vehicles (boosting their drag coefficient slightly would be a great motivator here).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELH2 is definitely in a bit of a bind. I feel the best solution would be to adjust the fudge factor slightly. To affect maximum noticeable difference for minimum value adjustment, I would change both the stock and NFP fudge factors to make them farther apart, while reducing the amount you need to change either. I think increasing the NFP tank FF by 10% (to 1.6 from 1.5) and decreasing the stock FF by 10% (to 1.4 from 1.5) would create enough of a measurable difference in delta V while creating a relatively modest change in tank capacity all around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s probably a LOT I didn\u0027t touch on that I should have, but this post was getting long enough and has eaten almost two hours to extract the data, analyze, make determinations, validate my logic, and write the post.

Right now, it takes the total volume in liters for the tank, it finds how much liquid hydrogen it needs for the fuel mix (1:10), then it fills the rest of the tank with oxidizer. This would work fine if the liquid hydrogen and oxidizer had the same units of measure. Unfortunately, oxidizer is measured in fuel units (which are 5.5 liters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As of right now, a LH tank converted to OX only holds 3.6 times more volume in fuel units (even after the 1.5 rescale factor is applied). A mixed LH\u002BOX tank holds 1.4 times more volume in fuel units. In theory, the total volume available for a mixed tank should decrease as some space is taken up by the intertank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we want to keep the NF tanks in line with the stock fuel-switched tanks, we modify the fudge factors for OX only tanks to 3 (from the current 1.5).
