I have been play a lot of career mode since I bought the game. A couple of things have popped into my head over and over as I\u0027m gaining research. I don\u0027t know if this is meant to be close to historically accurate but, I keep thinking that aircraft parts should be coming earlier in the tech tree than they are. My reason for this is that a lot of the early rocket construction came out of the early aeronautical engineering. We had large cargo planes long before we were sending rockets into orbit. It just seems odd that a lot of the aircraft parts are coming a couple of tiers after rockets. Also that most of the in atmosphere research points are achieved while learning to build rockets, there isn\u0027t really anything left for aircraft (unless I\u0027m missing something).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk so on to my suggestions (or wish list). I apologize if this has come up before. I did a quick search and didn\u0027t find anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals should be able to fly their own craft or at least a laid out flight plan/way point. Accuracy and ability should change through experience to improve how well they follow the flight plan/orbital way point. Career mode only. Perhaps a training center for kerbals could be on the base as well later in career mode. Early kerbal pilots would be 50% accurate but would gain a lot of experience if they fly the mission. If the player flies the mission, only a quarter of the experience would be awarded. Missions flown under computer control would only give 50% of experience. Kerbals coming from the training center would be 80% accurate at start. Max accuracy would be 95%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy reasoning behind this was to give the player more reason to keep their kerbals alive. It would also allow for more missions to be flown at once without worrying as much about keeping tabs on the kerbals. It would also feel as though we are really helping the kerbals with their space program, not doing it all ourselves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may not be as well though out but I\u0027m in a bit of a hurry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T16:33:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/58887-Upgrades-%28Kerbal-training-buildings%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/58887-Upgrades-%28Kerbal-training-buildings%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis thread pretty much covers the second part of your suggestin.
