So if you want to be going supersonic a lot, it\u0027s a worthwhile trade. The mechanism is from a special kind of drag in supersonic flight called \u0027bow shock\u0027 where the plane is going so fast that molecules can\u0027t flow around the plane nicely and instead ricochet off the nose (and other leading surfaces) creating high pressure shocks waves going backwards in a cone shape. If the edges of that cone line up on another part of the plane, you get silly amounts of drag (as I understand it), and the cone gets narrower the faster you go. So! If you have a more triangularly shaped plane that can fit entirely within the cone, you have less drag = better flight performance. And, the narrower (more swept) you can get it, the faster you can go before those shockwaves cause you trouble. The same applies to the wings themselves, that they should be more swept back than this bowshock cone starting where they attach to the plane.

So if you want to be going supersonic a lot, it\u0027s a worthwhile trade. The mechanism is from a special kind of drag in supersonic flight called \u0027bow shock\u0027 where the plane is going so fast that molecules can\u0027t flow around the plane nicely and instead ricochet off the nose (and other leading surfaces) creating high pressure shocks waves going backwards in a cone shape. If the edges of that cone line up on another part of the plane, you get silly amounts of drag (as I understand it), and the cone gets narrower the faster you go. So! If you have a more triangularly shaped plane that can fit entirely within the cone, you have less drag = better flight performance. And, the narrower (more swept) you can get it, the faster you can go before those shockwaves cause you trouble. The same applies to the wings themselves, that they should be more swept back than this bowshock cone starting where they attach to the plane.
