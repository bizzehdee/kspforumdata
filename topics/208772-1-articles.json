Most of us would probably agree its a \u0022Building and Flying game\u0022 and this means solving the engineering puzzle of making working, efficient rockets, navigating space and landing them. Thats all true! But it\u0027s also true of sandbox KSP1. I would personally argue that while KSP1 offered a wonderful sandbox experience which I loved for a decade and fulfilled the task of \u0022building and flying\u0022 it\u00A0never really became a good \u003Cem\u003Egame\u003C/em\u003E. Contracts, progression, science, resource prospecting, making bases all kind of fell a bit flat. Im happy that KSP2 will be adding new systems and better graphics and multiplayer but I don\u0027t actually even care about any of those things as much as I do that KSP2 can make KSP into a \u003Cem\u003Egood game.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EAnd that means solving all those really hard problems that no mod even has ever been able to solve.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut without going into a bunch of ad hoc suggestions that have been thrown around over the years (and are probably too late at this point) what do people really actually want KSP2 to be? There will be resources and those resources will need to be processed, but I don\u0027t think KSP2 will be like Factorio, which is mainly a pathing puzzle with belts and gates and lots of converters. KSP2 will also have lots of Kerbals, but it wouldn\u0027t likely be like Cities Skylines where your main task is managing economics and traffic. You\u0027re also harvesting resources and upgrading tech but its not like Starcraft where you\u0027re competitively outwitting and outpacing opponent\u0027s build. It\u0027s also in many ways a vehicle for creative expression, but unlike Townscaper its not JUST about aesthetics, there are inputs and outputs to balance and exploit and rewards for exploring new places and that challenge is what the game is all about.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo what kind of game is it?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-06-29T17:15:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2022 05:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-29T17:39:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224149886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208772\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221656520371\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what kind of game is it?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy reply it\u0027s probably granted since I\u0027ve written it a dozen of times in different threads over the months, but since this is the topic dedicated to this discussion I\u0027ll write it here too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll your premises considered I still say: mainly a \u0022building and flying\u0022 game, one that is very laser focused on that when considering every other feature and its implementation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat doesn\u0027t mean that other system have to be simple, or basic, just that \u003Cstrong\u003Emost problems should have a new rocket to design and fly somewhere as the solution\u003C/strong\u003E, and most gameplay loops should revolve around being able to design or fly the right craft for the challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nResource extraction and management?

There are other potential incentives though.

Thats the beauty of good city builders. You can just keep growing and growing and making cooler and cooler things and thats what the game is about. If the game is just about the tech tree the fun only lasts until you get that last crazy engine. You\u2019ll try it out a few times for funzies and that\u2019ll be it. Thats part of the reason so few players ever even go interplanetary in KSP1. There are no deeper mechanics to the game so most players complete the tech tree and start over, never bothering to explore further.\u00A0Or they just skip the grind and goof off in sandbox.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is part of what has been irking me the last couple of weeks and its the reason Im asking \u003Ci\u003Ewhat is this game about?\u003C/i\u003E Nate and gang have noted that KSP players have sunk thousands of hours into it (like me!) and want to see new players enjoy thousands more. But to do that you really have to bring something new to the table, and you definitely need colonies to be a part of that. It can be relatively simple, but Kerbals need to have an active function, and some tasks should require a lot of them. Maybe you need your colony to hit 100 before you can build a fusion generator. Maybe each fuel production plant you add requires more kerbals to operate so it scales more linearly. Maybe you need to staff science labs to increase your upgrade rate.

Adding ground and space telescopes to unveil celestial bodies and other artifacts that would remain hidden until finally discovered, slowly gaining more and more resolution with probing and attention, both visually and understandably. Basically, for instance, as time progresses and more is discovered about a planet that may have peaked a players curiosity it would become more and more crisp in a map view. In regions that are more heavily investigated the model of the planet or region would have greater resolution like a fog of war of understanding while also showing other signs through data or even coloration attributing properties to the whole planet or regions of that planet. Stellaris, for example, begins simply showing a neighbor star that you can send a scout to investigate. Once the investigation is complete it is revealed how many planets are in the system. The scout then investigates each planet and upon completion the planets properties are revealed and from there a player makes the decision of whether or not to focus on extracting resource or utilizing the capacity of that planet for the overall civilization. What a cool mechanic, why not build on that? We\u0027ve talked a lot on the forums about systems of LoD largely with regard to things like rigid body mechanics of vessels to maintain performance, or of orbits to more accurately represent them, or of terrain to more beautify and believably immerse us in believing the word we\u0027re discovering is real.

And if there\u0027s enough motivating factors to get to those other planets, whether the reasons be utilitarian, aesthetic, or simple curiosity I think people would happily explore a plethora of other game mechanics along the way both as entertainment and learning opportunities. So long as the mechanics are well thought out and built with performance and creativity in mind, mechanics that add to one another to enhance the overall experience as opposed to combat with one another for attention at the games detriment, this game will be great. If you want players to play for 1,000s of hours give us something that takes 1,000s of hours to fully enjoy and discover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-08T08:45:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224152784\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208772\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221657240564\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180102\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mcwaffles2003\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, mcwaffles2003 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally like how you put all that together and couldn\u0027t agree more whole heartedly.

But what makes building and flying rockets fun in KSP is the engineering challenge--each component having a clear function and requirements and combining those into something that accomplishes a specific task--and I think the building and engineering of colonies and stations should have that same character. That doesn\u0027t mean the game becomes Factorio, just that most of the colony modules themselves should have specific functions, and if you\u0027re adding more habitation modules or science labs it should be for a \u003Cem\u003Ereason\u003C/em\u003E. Like if you\u0027re building a simple satellite you\u0027re adding panels to generate enough power to keep your probe core fed, you\u0027re adding batteries as a buffer so you can maneuver on the night side, etc. It\u0027s not Factorio because the resources just go into a pool. You\u0027re not routing the wires and 10 small batteries are the same is one big one. All that matters is you\u0027ve managed your inputs and outputs. Engineering colonies and resource processing should work on those same principles.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of the big deficiencies in KSP1 was the kerbals themselves. The perks were a little clunky and way grindy to upgrade because you were leveling up each Kerbal individually. Fine if you\u0027ve got a total roster of 5 or 10, but given the size of the colonies they\u0027ve shown you\u0027d expect populations of dozens or hundreds. They also just weren\u0027t that important. You never actually needed pilots, scientists were only important for running labs and resetting experiments (which was tedious), engineers were occasionally useful if you broke a wheel or something. None of that really needs to be kept, but there should be SOME reason why you\u0027re carting all these little green dudes around, some structural reason why growing a colony\u0027s population is advantageous. Kerbals themselves also should have some basic needs that must be met to keep them productive at whatever it is they\u0027re doing. The rules don\u0027t need or want to be complicated--just clear, consistent, and efficient. It could just be meter of workforce vs jobs. Adding a monoprop factory adds 1 job, adding a methalox factory adds 3 jobs, a nuclear reactor adds 5, science lab 3, and so you need a crew of 12 to keep everything running at 100%. Each crew member requires a habitation value of 1 and needs 1 snack per day, so you\u0027ve got to build a certain number of hab modules and a greenhouse to keep them happy and productive. Those then require more power and add new jobs that must be filled, so you\u0027ve got to keep exploring to increase population and add new capabilities and keep everything balanced along the way. It could be that simple. You don\u0027t need pipes or pathing or AI (though the latter would be cute for aesthetics), just a simple UI table to check that your outputs are all in the black before you move onto the next thing. Its the dynamics between producers and consumers and building a self-sustaining system that matters.

This same system could be used to distribute manpower, maybe, but it doesn\u0027t have to be.\u00A0I stick by the instinct that if there\u0027s a choice between making a system more complex or more simple for the player it is almost always best to simplify. You don\u0027t really need kerbal classes, nor do you need to manually distribute each kerbal to a specific job.

Each module whether its a methalox factory or greenhouse should just have a production slider you can adjust up or down to fine-tune and optimize your resource chain. If you reduce a MH factory that would otherwise employ 10 kerbals to 70% it would only demand 7 jobs. If a colony had 100 open jobs and 97 working kerbals each facility would operate at 97%. This would allow easy standard defaults AND the flexibility to fine tune your production priorities without requiring manually assigning and managing crew.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-13T22:42:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2022 10:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-14T03:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EWhat kind of game will KSP2 be?\u003C/span\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelayed a couple more times, released buggy and unfinished, probably.
