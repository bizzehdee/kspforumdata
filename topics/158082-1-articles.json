Even if the game check the age of the craft, the age the station have when the contract is generated need to be valid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Two vessels docked together become one vessel with the age of the older vessel. A module newer than the station will preserve the age, which is valid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to clarify the situation I\u0027m considering may not complete the contract:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have two station in orbit: Mir is 2yo and support 5 kerbals, ISS is 1yo and support 10 kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA contract is generated asking to expand ISS to support 15 kerbals. What happens if I dock Mir and ISS together?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy supposition is that the resulting craft will have be considered Mir, so it will not complete the contract. However I think the game keep track of the\u00A0 ISS ID, if nothing else to reassign the correct ID when undocking, so the contract will not end in failure when docking Mir and ISS together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-24T02:26:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with your reasoning. That sounds like a very interesting experiment to try sometime. I wasn\u0027t thinking about the \u0022expand\u0022 contracts when I wrote that, so yes, that certainly might work. It might be possible to complete multiple \u0022expand\u0022 contracts in that way, I suppose. Undocking and redocking to create different combinations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
