Although it is rather unfortunate that every single human being interested in KSP is more absorbed in playing the game rather than documenting it. \n\nThis could be the very definition of success in video game design. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAlas, the wiki is a dessicated, frozen tumbleweed bouncing across the surface of eeloo, someone must retrieve it and return it to Kerbin, that is why we\u0027re here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T17:29:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 05:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wossname**"},{"CreatedByName":"Doconicus","CreatedById":41764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T22:25:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think that there is any manual for this game right now.
