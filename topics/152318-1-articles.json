Recently, I upgraded my OS to Sierra 10.12.2 Public Beta, and KSP ran fine still, but only for a while. I had several mods installed at the time, MechJeb2 (which was installed incorrectly, being one folder level too deep, and would not load any required packages), \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E 1.2.12, NearFutureSolar 0.6.2 (also installed incorrectly because I had not removed the contents from the internal gamedata folder), \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E 0.5.9, Kerbal Alarm Clock 3.7.1.0 (not installed correctly) , DockingPortAlignment 6.4 , and ModuleManager 2.6.25, and MiniAVC which was included with the packs. The reason I installed so many of these incorrectly is because I didn\u0027t know to remove the other folder sublevels (Shame on me for not reading the readme\u0027s) But since \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E seemed to work I didn\u0027t try to mess with it anymore. Since then I have correctly installed all my modpacks and have resolved the issue, because launching the game from the folder through the launcher without using the steam launcher seems to work completely fine, and I would imagine this is fairly similar to this issue.

I tried running 1.2 without any mods, and deleting the entire folder and reinstalling from clean install, Didn\u0027t work through steam. I tried validating all the files, and checked out. If you have any idea what the issue is, please let me know. I would like to run KSP through steam again to log hours and get achievements.
