The Wiki has not been updated since 0.13 and so is lacking many items that have been added. Specifically i am interested in the performance characteristics of the new engines and the air intake parts. \n\nWhat are the ideal altitudes of the engines and how do the air intake parts effect their performance at various altitudes? How do the wings work in the game? How does lift affect their performance? Things like that. \n\nIs there any place that has information like that?\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T06:01:40Z","Content":"[The temporary wiki has 0.14 parts](http://kspwiki.nexisonline.net/wiki/Parts).

If you find detailed operational information about the parts/physics model, please share."}]}
