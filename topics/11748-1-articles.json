The Wiki has not been updated since 0.13 and so is lacking many items that have been added. Specifically i am interested in the performance characteristics of the new engines and the air intake parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the ideal altitudes of the engines and how do the air intake parts effect their performance at various altitudes? How do the wings work in the game? How does lift affect their performance? Things like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any place that has information like that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T06:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kspwiki.nexisonline.net/wiki/Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe temporary wiki has 0.14 parts\u003C/a\u003E.
