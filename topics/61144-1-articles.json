And it\u0027s entirely possible that the way we\u0027ve been making new elements using particle colliders is a poor way to go about it and isotopes of those may exist that are more stable but we don\u0027t know enough to even know if that\u0027s true. I know that current methods cannot supply enough neutrons to use as glue to make super large nuclei they think might be in the island of stability, so that gets into the alternate ways of nuclear fusion. Keep in mind too that the island of stability is wholly theoretical and may not actually be a thing. The periodic table as we know it might be it, lead might be the heaviest stable element period. So, start a project to prove the island of stability is non-existent because trying to disprove a theory as written is when you start to find new physics. Science is about using observation and to find out about where we are wrong about our understanding and where our models fail - so we need to make new models that work. Its not about proving how smart we are.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Top8","CreatedById":79933,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T07:54:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of massive particle accelerators in space - where hard vacuum and cold temps are easier to generate.
