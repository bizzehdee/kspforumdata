I have tried lifting off and then cutting the thrust again and it hasn\u0027t helped at all. Its with both karbonite engines and the stock small engine as shown in the picture. It really doesn\u0027t effect anything other than it pulling unneeded power to render from my gpu and annoying me but I would love to get it fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T06:39:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you using real fuels alongside another engine pack?
