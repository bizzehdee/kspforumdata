Though I am assured by HR that could change (the Misapplied Sciences Division says the timescale of such a leap would be in the millions of years).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is why the Board has unanimously decided to begin an outsourcing project in order to meet public demands for \u0022cooler looking\u0022 products. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny modellers applying for the position will be employed on a freelance basis. Payment will be made in bananas due to Financial Branch reluctance to spend on two resource pools when it comes to remuneration. Freelance modellers will also be mentioned in product manuals and advertisements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModellers will work closely with Cabana Corp. engineers in order to provide the best balance between technical functionality and design, and are encouraged to voice their opinions whenever they feel necessary. However, I take this opportunity to advise against trying to feed Cabana Corp. monkeys peanuts. Reasons classified. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould any questions arise, I shall be fully available to answer them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am instructed by both HR and PR to say that the following is indeed fact: Cabana Corp employed monkeys are here under their own volition and are paid in kind, in a form of their choosing- as it happens it\u0027s bananas. Employed monkeys are in no way a threat to any person and are indeed quite friendly unless provoked, provided with peanuts, or if someone forgets to refill the coffee machine on a slow Monday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Off microphone*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that all? Yes? Good. What? No, I\u0027m not reading \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhem... Ban-Anad, out!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
