Such a exploit wouldn\u0027t be only possible via DLLs, as it\u0027s a flaw in the Hardware or Hypervisor software itself that would allow the DLL to break out of the Hypervisor and begin corrupting memory in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there\u0027s no reason except stubbornness on the part of the Console Manufacturers that they can\u0027t have mods, along with the fact that the limited memory and CPU on the Xbox One and PS4 would get absolutely creamed by even a light batch of mods. PS5 and Xbox Series X wouldn\u0027t have this same issue, but the PS5 is E-waste after 3 years because the OS drive is soldered (There\u0027s a separate space for an \u0022Expansion drive\u0022, but it won\u0027t boot without the original OS drive), and the Xbox Sex is using 230 USD 1TB flash carts for storage....so i doubt they want anyone to be able to flash Linux on these things and actually get around their planned obsolescence, which allowing people to mod would eventually lead to.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso Skyrim mods are loaded into local memory (RAM) before hitting the Papyrus compiler, so they have plenty of access to resources outside the game if someone wanted to code it. There\u0027s just way easier ways to get Malware on someone\u0027s machine, and if you go the \u0022Malicious M0DZ\u0022 route nobody will ever take you or your work seriously again. Where as using a Javascript attack, or just plain \u0022Social Engineering\u0022 (Trickery) is anonymous and can often be done without the user even realizing what\u0027s happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut your overall point is correct; it\u0027s up to Sony and Micro$oft in the end.
