My entire motivation is a \u0022proper\u0022 mission to Duna mostly using parts that I engineer. The Raider represents step 4 of 7.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

Orbit of Kerbin to the ground (???)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem I\u0027m having is each of these steps relate to the other in some way so a change in any one tends to cascade to the others quickly and I\u0027ve struggled to find a \u0022starting point\u0022. The Raider, being firmly in the middle of the problem has compelled me to leave it be for now. Compounding matters is the promise of a very significant revision on how rover wheels work in the next KSP update which has me utterly paralyzed with fear. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I am here I might as well update everyone else on what\u0027s going on at CORE. I\u0027ve been flying the First Light around and I\u0027m a little disappointed with it. For example, on my first fly-by of Duna I imagined myself riding along in this, relatively, cramped ship for 2 years and immediately began searching for the nearest airlock. Then there\u0027s the cargo bay (which is cool) but in hindsight is completely useless for a ship intended to live its entire life in deep space. I suppose one could stow some sensitive equipment in there but the reality hasn\u0027t matched up with my imagination. I figured that\u0027s where the Fire Hawk would go on round trips between \u0022A\u0022 and \u0022B\u0022 but the cargo space isn\u0027t big enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot that I consider the First Light a failure by any stretch of the imagination but I am now\u00A0viewing it more as a mobile laboratory for short duration trips like between a host planet and its moons or an orbital command post for ground missions. Anything but a primary means of moving through deep space. For that role I have something else in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore information as it becomes available!

Stardew Valley is a very enjoyable game; look it up!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuh, I will check out that game!\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 Hopefully it\u0027s available on Steam, but if not... well, actually, it doesn\u0027t matter, I\u0027m currently unemployed, so it\u0027s not like I could afford to buy it anyway.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u00A0 I\u0027m so broke right now that I couldn\u0027t get across the street if it cost a dime to go around the world!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, no worries about not \u0027sharing my vision\u0027, lol, like I said, I figured out what works for me, and I\u0027ll probably end up making changes and tweaks to the NEXT version of the ship as well.\u00A0 That\u0027s why I really like KSP, it\u0027s one of the few games EVER that lets players, modders, anyone make changes and add stuff so easily.\u00A0 Another one is Left 4 Dead 2, which is the only other game I\u0027m playing right now. But you keep doin\u0027 your thing\u0027, Bubba, I LIKE what you\u0027ve created so far, and it\u0027s not like I could do any better, so like I said, keep up the great work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, anyhow, back to topic.\u00A0 Yes, I think that would be an excellent idea, creating a set of conformal boosters or something like that.\u00A0 I know you specifically designed it to fit INSIDE your Anvil IX rocket, but, again In My Humble Opinion, I feel that the game is already too much about \u0027Rockets and Capsules and Parachutes\u0027 (Oh My!), so that\u0027s why I build a lot of horizontally-oriented-and-launched kinds of VTOL ships.\u00A0 In fact, I don\u0027t even have any of your CORE Solutions \u0027rocket\u0027 parts installed, just the First Light components.\u00A0 Oh, on the docking ports, I kind of like the way they LOOK now, with the inset \u0027door\u0027 and all.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 I had just happened to notice that, in game, they\u0027re exactly 2 meters in diameter, so I had the thought to scale EVERYTHING up by 25%, both so that, yes, now the docking ports are 2.5m, but also just so that the cargo bay could actually HOLD 2.5m diameter parts with \u003Cem\u003Ejuuuust \u003C/em\u003Eenough room left over to have a few small things bolted on to, say, a space station component.\u00A0 In fact, since I scaled it up, the First Light has carried a good 90% plus of my (work in progress)\u00A0space station modules into orbit, and most of those parts are from\u00A0FusTek, along with some hubs and trusses from the StockAlike Station Parts Expansion mod as well as DSEV, and they\u0027re all 2.5 meters \u0027plus\u0027 just a little bit more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, Abs, enjoy your new game.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 There\u0027s no real rush from my standpoint for you to get super busy reworking the First Light, but you know a lot of other folks are eagerly awaiting the updated Dune Raider /\u00A0FireHawk system... well, okay, I\u0027ll admit I\u0027m pretty eager to see that get updated too, not so much the \u0027Ariel Atom\u0027 sports-car looking thingy, but a real honest-to-Kerbol UTILITY rover version.\u00A0 Something with an actual cockpit that can carry stuff and has an IVA and everything.\u00A0 Again, requests, you understand.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater, and again, looking forward to what develops!\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Wait, what the H-E-double hockey sticks?!? \u0022Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG...\u0022\u00A0 LOL, okay, from the name I thought it was at least some sort of space-oriented game!\u00A0 Heh, okay man, that\u0027s not REMOTELY my kind of game, but hey, whatever turns your crank, you know?\u00A0 I\u0027m glad you\u0027re enjoying it, though, I used to know someone who really enjoyed that type of game, so more power to you, my friend!\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u00A0 Later!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-23T11:59:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2016 11:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Neutrinovore\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Absolution","CreatedById":4156,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T03:42:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving downloaded KSP 1.1 and tested my rockets a little I am glad I never bothered to upload CORE to SpaceDock because although my rockets appear to be fundamentally compatible with 1.1 they can\u0027t fly worth a damn. I need to go back to basics and try to get my rockets flying right. The first thing I need to look into is making my fairings protect their contents from aero forces which I suspect is the root of the issue (rockets are back flipping in flight). The second thing is I need to tweak the gimbals. Currently they are set to about 0.6 which is what KSP used to interpret as \u00226 degrees\u0022 (iirc)\u00A0but at some point I think they changed the interpretation to now see 0.6 as \u00220.6 degrees\u0022 which would make sense. Lastly, I need to take a hard look at all the other attributes to make sure they still make sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, it goes without saying that after Harvester rebuilt the wheel mechanics from the ground up that my Dune Raider is now completely broken. I have no idea what it will take to fix it. However, first things first: the rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
