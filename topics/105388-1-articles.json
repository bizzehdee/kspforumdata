I learned how to make planes and SSTOs in vanilla KSP (pre 1.0) and in Ferram, now I have to learn how to make these in new KSP. So that\u0027s fun! I decided to make this thread so we can share our discoveries on how the system works.\n\nAt the moment I see the potential for this new system to allow even more powerful SSTOs, but it does seem harder. It seems harder than Ferram as well, but I don\u0027t know for sure yet, as Ferram had an entire panel of information that helped design stable planes and here we have nothing.\n\nFirst thing I noticed is that my planes tend to flip. The center of mass has to be as close to the nose as possible, which is hard if you have all your engines at the back."},{"CreatedByName":"locustgate","CreatedById":81277,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:31:23Z","Content":"I\u0027ve only launched 1 plane (mk1) to test aerodynamics.......my tail fin(avr8 winglit) exploded when I hit 1k at 5-10km, both of my wing control surfaces(fat-445) exploded when I hit 1.5k at the same height range, my plane did manage to get to space.

On only 100%, heat is very low, but on 120%, it is dangerous, so you need a heatshield.\n\nallow me to clafiry: it seems that the MkI pod has an extremely high temperature tolerance when coming in with the rear end facing forward. If it comes in nose-first, it burns up and dies. So while no, it doesn\u0027t have an ablative heatshield built in, it does seem to have a high tolerance on the bottom. This is mostly empirical evidence though: every time I tried to bring down a MkI with some science equipment or fuel tanks and engine below it, descent went fine until it flipped over, pod-first. After that, the pod (and the rest of the craft) had about 5 seconds to live. If I use only the pod \u002B chute on exactly the same descent, everything is perfectly dandy and pod comes down without any overheat at all. I have yet to try sending in a pod alone, nose first, but it\u0027s late now and I have work in the morning.
