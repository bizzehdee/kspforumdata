The goal for the past week has been to design a mother-class ship that can land on Laythe VTOL style, so far i haven\u0027t even managed to get it of the landing strip in the regular way. It\u0027s a 180-200 ton monstrosity that just won\u0027t lift of for some reason, I\u0027ve managed to get 200 tons into orbit if I\u0027m not mistaken from the landing pad but my big VTOL ships always starts rolling for some reason or they stall even though I\u0027ve centered my COL, COM and COT (only the vertical thrusters that is)\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E.

I\u0027d done a test but it has gotten purged. The function varies from 0 at 0 degrees and at 90 degrees, to a maximum (whose value I don\u0027t remember) at about 35 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the lift rating\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the air density\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s basically airdensity * speed * liftrating * f(AoA).
