That \u0022poof\u0022 you see is actually their atoms being ripped apart. Said atoms are sent back to kerbin via the monolith network. (Really think about it, there are monoliths on about every planet)However the atom reassembly takes time,this is why they don\u0027t come back instantly. Then if you decide to mark them \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 instead of being teleported back their atoms are spread across the kerbal system, killing them permanently. Such a theory explains why monoliths appear near major locations such as the old/new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, they serve as that areas drop off point. The reason kerbals don\u0027t use this system to teleport themselves to other planets is that the exit point needs a special receiver that uses a lot of power. Now i don\u0027t know how to explain how the kerbals tap into the system. Or who put the monoliths there in the first place. But you know...in due time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s just uhhh a little theory that i thought up at school.....As one could expect i have very little things of interest to do there. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Piatzin","CreatedById":166940,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-03T05:46:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPOOF\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdk why I like that word so much.
