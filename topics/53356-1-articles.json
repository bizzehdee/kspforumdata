My question, do you think that Squad will one day implement large (5m) parts? Or stick to the 2m max right now? Also do you prefer to use larger launches with 3.75m and 5m parts because it has a higher lifting capability? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I think one day squad will give us 5m parts and 2nd I like using the larger parts with the reinforcements mod of course to launch larger station pieces at a time!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T23:16:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just another of those features that Squad may or may not think about adding when the game is more completed; I\u0027d rather they spend time on making the core game as good as it can be than making parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact is that right now we don\u0027t actually NEED anything bigger than the \u00272m\u0027 parts we already have; we don\u0027t actually need 2m parts at all, 1m are fine, but part count is much friendlier when trying to launch small craft when using 2m tanks and engines.

At that point, they\u0027d probably need to invest in bigger sizes of hardware for balance reasons. They\u0027ll also have to fix a few outstanding issues with the engine to facilitate that, which I very much would like to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gravitated to modded parts pretty soon after I found KSP, mostly because I didn\u0027t enjoy the propect of making towers of tanks when building -its far less of an issue now that we have the 2.5m parts but one of the things I like least about the game are the weird, huge conglomerations of parts-as-launchers (outside of the \u0027wow, whoever did that is crazy\u0027 factor anyway)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if they don\u0027t ever do it, I very much like providing bigger launcher parts in my mods, and would gladly continue to do so. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T23:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WLmBzlC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WLmBzlC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey should add (at least) 3.75m parts.

Bigger tanks and bigger engines aren\u0027t any more efficient than multiple smaller ones; in fact, they\u0027ll usually be a little LESS efficient in KSP. But they allow you to do with a small number of parts what previously would use far more, which lets us keep part counts low until Unity gets proper multithreading support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, you can still asparagus a 3.75m design for truly monstrous designs. Even without an asparagus setup, you can get tremendous lift capability by going away from a Saturn V-style candle stack. I posted this picture in another thread a few minutes ago:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sFYuzHX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sFYuzHX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat booster you see receding into the background is a set of linked 3.75m stacks (not asparagus), mass of around 5500 tons, in almost a pure SSTO design. The 700-ton station itself has some 3.75m parts, as well. And yet, the whole enchilada only has 1114 parts, with 735 on the station, so it won\u0027t completely shut down my CPU to fly. A big part of that part savings is the 3.75m tanks; it\u0027s not just that each is as big as three 2.5m tanks, it\u0027s also that I don\u0027t need as many struts to keep the parts rigid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T02:24:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00227499275\u0022 data-cite=\u00227499275\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes yes the gravity turn people have already told me about that, I waited to do so because I have FAR and I\u0027m not 100% used to flying with FAR.
