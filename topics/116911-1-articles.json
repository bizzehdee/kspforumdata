What the additional configs will do, is reduce parameters like amount of fuel, thrust, mass etc so that the vehicles will have the proper amount of deltaV and so on in relation to the scale of Kerbin. That way both people who play in 3.7x, 6.4x, RSS and stock-size can use this mod without having to go into the config files themselves.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T15:39:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by liquidhype**"},{"CreatedByName":"liquidhype","CreatedById":112415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T23:35:11Z","Content":"***Small update released:*** *Introducing \u0022Vega Stock\u0022.* \n\nYou can now choose between the launcher for either Stock or RSS.
