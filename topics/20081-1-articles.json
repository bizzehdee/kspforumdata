It\u0027s in human nature to share things. And yes, it really goddamn sucks to see your hard work pirated, but really, those sales were already lost. (Not so much \u0022lost\u0022 as \u0022never existed in the first place\u0022.) Adjust your projections accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more compelling reason to avoid torrents is the requirement of specialized software (no one-click from the browser and BAM! spacy-awesomeness), and as mentioned, that some ISPs (idiotically) block P2P traffic. (I say idiotically because the user\u0027s behavior is their own business. A phone company isn\u0027t liable for when someone uses a phone to order a murder, robbery, riot, or otherwise, so why should an ISP be liable for a client using their cables to nab software? That and BitTorrent is one of the most progressive and efficient means of disseminating large amounts of data to many people at very low cost. Our networks would probably collapse if all those TBs of data were sent from server-client.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, the \u0022easier to pirate\u0022 argument is invalid, as the increased difficulty of getting the software via more conventional means is trivial, at best. DRM is similarly trivial in it\u0027s application, unless you go balls-to-the-wall with it like Ubisoft does, and at that point, you\u0027re degrading the experience of your customers, so it shows a rather strong lack of regard for the people paying one\u0027s salary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite part of KSP: When I got my hands on it (and I won\u0027t say how), I \u003Cstrong\u003Ewanted\u003C/strong\u003E to pay for it.

As has been stated above, torrents are not a secure way of sharing files that should be paid for. Granted one can use the argument that many can be trusted with it, it has already been shown that there are many who can not. Whether or not piracy is theft(it is), that is a lot of potential revenue that Squad is not collecting, and therefore not able to put towards improving to their servers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is nothing good about taking premium files without any proper compensation.

For one, I had plenty of other things to keep me distracted, and another, the fact the forums went kaput as well kept me from getting any spoilers about the update. I would actually suggest to the fine people who maintain the KSP forum servers take the opportunity to go ahead and do maintenance on them whenever a new update is released. It will save on the stress of dealing with all the \u0027OMG where is update OMG\u0027 posts, and those who end up eating their own face through their impatience might actually find something else to do with their time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheUnknownPoet","CreatedById":49625,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T03:08:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBetter yet, could I somehow become a mirror?

As already stated here, there are already unofficial torrents of KSP out there.. but you don\u0027t have to go and use the Pirate Bay as your tracker: You can run your own, and only people with KSP store logins (and a purchase on their accounts) can get access to it. Whether Squad run their own official tracker is going to have little to no effect on the amount of unofficial seeds out there.
