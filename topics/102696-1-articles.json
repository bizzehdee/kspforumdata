I\u0027m not sure this would be the most helpful - are you imagining adjusting a maneuver by magnitude and direction, as in you say I want to burn x dv and then use a rotation tool to point that vector? (and of course you could iterate between adjusting the magnitude and direction until you find the desired result)\n\nAlthough it is true that ultimately you just want the magnitude and direction, it is often helpful to consider if your primary goal is to change the altitude of your orbit, adjust the location of apogee/perigee, or change your inclination.

It would be nice to be able to go from an equatorial orbit to a polar one with a single adjustment keeping the same Ap and Pe.\n\nI currently use precise node and mechjeb to make my nodes. This means I can make a node far in the future or many orbits away easily and then adjust either the time of burn in micro increments to get the exact result I require.

No. Kind of ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) See below.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Although it is true that ultimately you just want the magnitude and direction, it is often helpful to consider if your primary goal is to change the altitude of your orbit, adjust the location of apogee/perigee, or change your inclination.

But not when you\u0027re making major changes of inclination which is specifically what I\u0027m dealing with when I want this tool. Note: I\u0027m not asking to replace the current maneuver node, but enhance it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe we play differently, how often do you know the magnitude of your maneuver before you know the direction? I find that I know I want to adjust apogee/perigee or inclination or both in some way and I need to discover the required vector and magnitude.\n\nMy imagined use of this tool does not need me to know the magnitude or direction of the burn. Here\u0027s what I want (maybe I should update the first post with this):\n\nYou want to align with Gilly. Your orbit after your aerobrake at Eve is nowhere near Gilly\u0027s. Tilted about 45 degrees (hey at least you\u0027re not retrograde) and quite a ways around Eve. You\u0027re lucky (or you planned it this way) though that you\u0027ve got an ascending node out near your apoapsis, so the burn will be relatively cheap to align. And while you\u0027re out there, you could also with the same burn (to save fuel) bring up your periapsis to encounter Gilly on a tangent so you can actually plan the encounter part of your mission.\n\nI would consider the above to be a typical experience for me.\n\nNow, with the normal maneuver node editor, the SECOND part of this (the burn at your closest point) is a breeze while the first is a nightmare. With my proposed node, both are easy.\n\nMy proposed node would drop a rotation gizmo on the orbit. What this gizmo says is that you want to leave it at the same speed you were going when you went in TO START WITH, at the direction vector you were going when you went in ALSO TO START. You rotate it around (it could even have a snap to the plane of the target button) and then drag it so your direction vector is now coplanar with Gilly. Likely, the speed you\u0027re going isn\u0027t correct so then you can drag the speed vector arrow (that is not on the VAB\u0027s rotation gizmo, this would be an addition). Now you have told the game what direction and speed you want to be going AFTER THE BURN. The game, then, kindly figures out what that burn should be and tells you where to burn. **In short, you\u0027re not using the gizmo to tell the game where you want to BURN, you\u0027re telling it where you want to go AFTER the burn.**\n\nFor the slowdown or speedup to meet Gilly in the second node, you can use that speed arrow to just slow down or speed up. It\u0027s the same as the prograde/retrograde markers so long as you don\u0027t rotate the gizmo at all.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Of course you\u0027d expect play styles or ways of thinking to adapt to the tools available which may not be the best case. I just think direction magnitude would best case take some getting used to and worst case be less helpful than the current 3 orthogonal vector system.\n\nAgain, that\u0027s why I specified that this should be an option in addition to the current node.\n\nI do not deny that this proposal is a very fundamental change in the way maneuver nodes work. Currently, you are telling the game how you want to burn and it\u0027s telling you what will happen. With my proposal, you tell the game what you want to happen and it tells you how to make the burn.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think this suggestion has merit but I\u0027d rather that the maneuver node just stayed stationary relative to where you whacked it on the orbit instead of rotating when adjusted. That way you could adjust relative to your orbit rather than the expected orbit. A few more quality of life adjustments would make the widget much more useful; for one, a modifier key that would stop mouse wheel acceleration for fine adjustment would go a long way. I\u0027ve noticed recently that nodes now retain their current orbit when the time is being adjusted, which is a big thing.\n\nI agree here, I\u0027d like this too. Either make the tuggy nodes do what they look like they\u0027ll do while they\u0027re moving, or leave them there relative to the orbit. I\u0027d prefer the latter (like you would) but would still like my proposed tool as an addition to this."}]}
