each other and can pass through one another if they happen come into contact. Enabling \u0022same vessel interaction\u0022 on two parts that you want to interact with each other will cause them to physically collide if they come into contact. It was introduced primarily to allow players to create articulated assemblies of gears, manipulating arms, etc. with the robotic parts in the Breaking Ground DLC without having to split them up into decoupled craft linked together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst hop distance: In a communications network, it shows you the distance between your ship and the first comm-net relay being used to make a path between you and Kerbin. It\u0027s not terribly useful in flight, but since the strength of your connection depends on what antenna you are using and how far you are from the next relay or ground station it gives you more exact numerical information about the capable range of your current antenna combination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-23T04:46:20Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2020 04:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-23T09:58:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have much to add, but here are my 0.05\u20AC to this topic:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223745734\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191868\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221582432338\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179753\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geonovast\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Geonovast said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERigid Attachment: \u003C/strong\u003ESomething about the strength of the attachment between the part and its parent.\u00A0 Can make it stronger, but can also make it more brittle in certain situations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormal connections between two parts are a bit \u0022bendy\u0022, i.e. they can move against each other when the forces become large before breaking off. If you set this to true, then the connection to its parent part will not move but will just break when the force becomes too large. As in real life, this movement acts like a spring during an impact (e.g. a plane landing) and usually reduces the maximum force between two parts by spreading out the acceleration over a longer time. So rigidly attached parts tend to break apart on even lesser impacts. But they don\u0027t shift around during lower accelerations.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(I never use that option in my craft.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223745734\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191868\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221582432338\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179753\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geonovast\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Geonovast said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESides:\u003C/strong\u003E Exactly as it seems, sets the number of sides, or slices of the fairing.\u00A0 This, in my experience, is mostly and aesthetic thing, although upping the number of sides can be helpful if the fairing pieces hit your payload on deploy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo things about the sides of a fairing: one is that the number of sides only actually gets changed if you edit (or create) the fairing \u003Cstrong\u003Eafter\u003C/strong\u003E changing the number of sides in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E. (So, yes, if you just change it in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E nothing will happen immediately.) The other is that the fairing pieces can collide with your payload after deploying the fairing. (This is even more of a problem when you use \u0022clamshell deploy\u0022.) If your payload is not cylindrical but e.g. has a 4-way symmetry then setting the fairing up so that the pieces are on the sides and not the corners - and thus are ejected away from the corners - can keep your payload safe from collision. (I figured that out the hard way when a fairing kept damaging two tires on one of my rovers when it had three sides.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
