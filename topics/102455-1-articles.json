With FAR, most of my more agile planes correctly explode due to aerodynamic stresses if I turn at low speeds due to high control authority. On the other hand this level of control authority is required to perform maneuvers at higher speeds. I\u0027d need to dynamically lower the control input as speed decreases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T13:46:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed we need something like that!
