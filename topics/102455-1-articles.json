With FAR, most of my more agile planes correctly explode due to aerodynamic stresses if I turn at low speeds due to high control authority. On the other hand this level of control authority is required to perform maneuvers at higher speeds. I\u0027d need to dynamically lower the control input as speed decreases.\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T13:46:26Z","Content":"Agreed we need something like that!

Is there a trick to reverse the scaling?"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T07:53:53Z","Content":"You know about pressing CapsLock to switch to fine-tune controls right?

I\u0027d need to limit the maximum to a set percentage depending on speed - exactly like the DCA mentioned above but with reverse scaling."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T20:11:51Z","Content":"Wow, I totally misread the OP.
