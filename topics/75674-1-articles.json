Has a loong story to it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first, I was trying to design a ship that could get me to the mun, and was not very successful with it. 3 fails in succession, and I quit trying. My friend, at the time, was into designing robots/drones to go around Kerbal. So I got into it, and designed a \u0022Hover drone\u0022 which I used to get the the abandoned airport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a while, drone designing really did not suit me, and my friend was always able to be more successful that me. So, I got back into Mun expedition, however this time, I asked my friend to design a compact drone to suit a small rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second i looked at it, I knew it was it. It was a tiny, drone, suited for many different things. 4 wheels, a battery backpack, and solar panels diagonally attached to the back ram of the wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI immediately got to designing a landing craft for the drone, and it worked out great, and for once, I beat my friend at the design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, came the rocket design, and that\u0027s really when my friend wanted to challenge me in the race to the mun. Neither of us ever got there, however he was the closest to getting to it (Crashed at 4000m/s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rocket was a fancy, drone carrier, and consisted of 4 drone slots. I planned to get close to the muns orbit, and deploy the \u0022Hover drone\u0022 to mark out the landing area; however it failed miserably due to the lack of power. So, all I had left at the time, is 1 landing drone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy friend at the time, was designing a carrier for a rather huge drone. However, due to the carrying problems, he had to abandon the idea and focus on getting a Kerbal on to the mun. This gave me an even bigger time advantage over him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he was designing the Mun Lander, I was launching my last drone into space. I took it very slowly, and eventually, got a feeling that I might actually make it. Eventually, after 15 minutes of slow approach, I managed to land the Drone Carrier, deploy the Scout Drone, and for once, beat my friend at KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe made it the next day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the \u0022Scout Drone\u0022 was the first operational thing I managed to get onto Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T18:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJeb, then Jeb in another save, then Jeb, then Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heagar","CreatedById":67859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T19:18:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe original three, Jeb, Bob and Bill in the demo from the game (Mun was introduced at that time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to have an rocket similar to the R7-design.
