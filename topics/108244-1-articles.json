As far as i see, only Deadly Reentry features new parts from your list. Most mods integrate themselves in the tech tree so their parts are not available from the start, but have to unlocked one after another. Also, the parts costs funds. Mods also feature contracts, or at least there\u0027s another mod that includes contracts for a mod (say mod one more time, i dare you!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, i remember seeing a mod that adds contracts to feature the parts and function from ScanSat, but this is certainly not available for everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend CKAN which is more of an external tool, but for me, it made managing the whole update stuff a lot easier and way more comfortable. Many mods are included in CKAN, so from the popular ones there just a few left that have to managed manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStuff i find interesting is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScanSat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDmagic Orbital Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStation Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Inventory System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHullcam VDS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer Window Planner\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERasterpropmonitor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDockingPort Alignment Indicator\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T17:53:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90841-0-90-Snacks!-Kerbal-simplified-life-support-v0-3-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESnacks!\u003C/a\u003E is a good life support mod where if you run out of snacks, your Kerbals will start to lose XP.
