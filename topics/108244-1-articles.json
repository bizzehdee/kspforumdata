As far as i see, only Deadly Reentry features new parts from your list. Most mods integrate themselves in the tech tree so their parts are not available from the start, but have to unlocked one after another. Also, the parts costs funds. Mods also feature contracts, or at least there\u0027s another mod that includes contracts for a mod (say mod one more time, i dare you!)\n\nPersonally, i remember seeing a mod that adds contracts to feature the parts and function from ScanSat, but this is certainly not available for everything.\n\nI recommend CKAN which is more of an external tool, but for me, it made managing the whole update stuff a lot easier and way more comfortable. Many mods are included in CKAN, so from the popular ones there just a few left that have to managed manually.\n\nStuff i find interesting is:\n\nScanSat\n\nDmagic Orbital Science\n\nStation Science\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nKerbal Inventory System\n\nHullcam VDS\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nTransfer Window Planner\n\nRasterpropmonitor\n\nKerbal Engineer\n\nDockingPort Alignment Indicator"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T17:53:34Z","Content":"[Snacks!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90841-0-90-Snacks!-Kerbal-simplified-life-support-v0-3-3) is a good life support mod where if you run out of snacks, your Kerbals will start to lose XP. I suppose this is what you are looking for in terms of a life support that doesn\u0027t kill Kerbals thus allowing for rescue missions. It\u0027s still for version 0.9 though. I don\u0027t know when it\u0027ll be updated for 1.0\u002B"}]}
