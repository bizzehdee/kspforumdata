(Who doesn\u0027t?)\n\nI did it the propper way (I assume). Modded it step by step. So one mod install one quick peak if it is works.\n\nI use the -force-opengl -popupwindow parameters (to not run out of memory and finaly borderles fullscreen fullHD it is awesome)\n\nAnd deleted unused parts from the most of the partheavy mods. Outdated dll-s too. Just to punch in the face the dependencies (so here might lies the error)\n\nIn this process I didn\u0027t noticed when was that point where the right click menus on parts lost their interactivity inside VAB/SHP.\n\nNOT all of them.\n\nFor example deploy/retract Landing gears work but turn on and of the lamp don\u0027t. I mean It works only once per menu opened.\n\nIt do plays the animation but don\u0027t change menu contexts this way I must click away and back to turn of that lamp and therefore save electricity... \n\nAntennas can\u0027t change back and forth deployed status as well the same thing as with the lights. Ladders also do it.\n\nMy latest test jubject is the remottech 32\u0027s antena. It can deployed only once. I simply cannot retract it (menu not showing the correct action after rightclick fresshing it) clicking the button and nothing happens.\n\nI just testing stock shielded docking port.\n\nThis one even more strange It plays the animation open/close as intended. But still the menu say \u0022open shield\u0022 only. After another right click on the part the menu say the correct one.\n\nAs far as I can remember this isn\u0027t the intended work of those menus. \n\nI\u0027d like to ask if some of you had the same issue or anything suspectably related to menus: Which mod can cause this? Or which mod\u0027s deleted parts/dll-s? ( For sure I know I get rid of rasterprop because it was outdated in the b9 pack according to kspAWC)\n\nRight now I also got another (forum related) question: How can I upload the directory.txt? ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif) (Sorry I am a Newb on forums ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif))\n\n(I try to upload it onto my server and link it.) [Here it is](https://sikerprogram.net/notrelated/modslist.txt)\n\nThank you in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"Ricardo79","CreatedById":128863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T11:51:23Z","Content":"I just deleted every mod one by one between checking and reinstalling each. \n\nI don\u0027t know Why am I left N.E.A.R. Last. But that was the cause for sure.\n\nThis issue is solved. I go to NEAR-s and report it."}]}
