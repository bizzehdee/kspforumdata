(Who doesn\u0027t?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did it the propper way (I assume). Modded it step by step. So one mod install one quick peak if it is works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the -force-opengl -popupwindow parameters (to not run out of memory and finaly borderles fullscreen fullHD it is awesome)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd deleted unused parts from the most of the partheavy mods. Outdated dll-s too. Just to punch in the face the dependencies (so here might lies the error)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this process I didn\u0027t noticed when was that point where the right click menus on parts lost their interactivity inside VAB/SHP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOT all of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example deploy/retract Landing gears work but turn on and of the lamp don\u0027t. I mean It works only once per menu opened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt do plays the animation but don\u0027t change menu contexts this way I must click away and back to turn of that lamp and therefore save electricity... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntennas can\u0027t change back and forth deployed status as well the same thing as with the lights. Ladders also do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy latest test jubject is the remottech 32\u0027s antena. It can deployed only once. I simply cannot retract it (menu not showing the correct action after rightclick fresshing it) clicking the button and nothing happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just testing stock shielded docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one even more strange It plays the animation open/close as intended. But still the menu say \u0022open shield\u0022 only. After another right click on the part the menu say the correct one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I can remember this isn\u0027t the intended work of those menus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to ask if some of you had the same issue or anything suspectably related to menus: Which mod can cause this? Or which mod\u0027s deleted parts/dll-s? ( For sure I know I get rid of rasterprop because it was outdated in the b9 pack according to kspAWC)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I also got another (forum related) question: How can I upload the directory.txt? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E (Sorry I am a Newb on forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I try to upload it onto my server and link it.) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://sikerprogram.net/notrelated/modslist.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere it is\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ricardo79","CreatedById":128863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T11:51:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just deleted every mod one by one between checking and reinstalling each. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know Why am I left N.E.A.R.
