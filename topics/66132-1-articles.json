It\u0027s a case of you deciding where you want those nodes to go. The nodes them selves are setup in the config file. As far as I know, you can also define config nodes in Unity but I have never done it that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Die_Kartoffel","CreatedById":102794,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T14:18:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI want the coordinates for the Top node and for the node at the end of the part.
