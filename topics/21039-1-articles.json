I don\u0027t really fancy mods that add parts or extra bit since the original provides enough already. I used mechjeb once and I hated it. I only likes to burn at full trust are which it adds to much velocity and the karken gets me. I threw it way with 0.17. Getting to planets is hard and now I am really only using one mod. It is that protractor mod which give you the information on the right time to burn to another planet. It isn\u0027t really a cheat since it would be the same information you get if you had use the oxly interplanetary calculator. It just beats using a onscreen protractor and eyeballing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvilotionCR2","CreatedById":27754,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-11T09:19:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enever!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(VBulletin is very bad at this)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-11T09:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only mods I use regularly are the Cart mod and DEMV for rovers, Crew Tank to let me carry more than 3 kerbonauts in one rocket and the AdamKSP protractor mod (to plot my course to the planets).
