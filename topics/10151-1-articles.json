What possibilities would this open up for Kerbonauts? What, for instance, would be different about lining up a Mun shot, transferring orbits, or even orbiting Kerbin itself?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T15:22:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELagrangian points for one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T15:39:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the orbits around Kerbin and the Mun would be disrupted by the other body and Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"krakken232","CreatedById":23190,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T15:42:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the orbits around Kerbin and the Mun would be disrupted by the other body and Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how would you account for this or offset it using the game\\\u0027s ship controls?
