I used its automatic recording feature to store the radiation level in the plane every 5 minutes. \n\nNOTE that all takeoff/landing times below are Mountain Daylight Time (since that\u0027s the time set in the RADEX). The zero time for each recording was before takeoff so that a couple data points could be gathered on the ground. Similarly, the recording was not turned off until I left the plane so that ground level readings could be collected after landing.\n\nFlight 1 was Southwest Airlines Flight 718 Albuquerque (ABQ) to Houston Hobby (HOBBY), May-25-2015, takeoff 11:35 AM.\n\nThe pilot made no announcement about the cruising altitude, but he did say that the flight detoured way south of its intended flight path to avoid thunderstorms over Texas, so we landed 10 minutes late.\n\n![xzvj0nc.png](http://i.imgur.com/xzvj0nc.png)\n\nFlight 2 was Southwest Flight 3976 from Houston Hobby (HOBBY) to Nashville, TN (BNA), May-25-2015, actual takeoff time 3:13:30 PM MDT.\n\nThe pilot announced that the expected cruising altitude would be 35,000 feet. This flight experienced two very sharp turbulence bumps (largest I\u0027ve ever felt) out of nowhere, three minutes apart at 32 minutes into the flight.\n\n![qtaJ7mj.png](http://i.imgur.com/qtaJ7mj.png)\n\nFlight 3 was Southwest Flight 826 Nashville, TN (BNA) to Kansas City, MO (MCI), on May-29-2015, takeoff around 9:35 AM MDT.\n\nPilot announced cruising allude as 38,000 feet. Landed at 11:02 AM MDT.\n\n![lcfYhNU.png](http://i.imgur.com/lcfYhNU.png)\n\nFlight 4 was Southwest Flight 1017 Kansas City (MCI) to Albuquerque (ABQ), on May-29-2015, listed takeoff time was 2:20 PM MDT but was 10 minutes late.\n\nPilot did not specify cruising altitude.\n\n![3KBfCHP.png](http://i.imgur.com/3KBfCHP.png)\n\nOf particular note is that the radiation levels measured on these flights were considerably lower than what I measured on my flight to Seattle back in February ([see old thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111617?p=1755220\u0026viewfull=1#post1755220))\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T19:02:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 07:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T19:00:07Z","Content":"The friend I was visiting had some Fiestaware plates, bowls, cups, etc. from the 1930s that has the orange pigment made from Uranium.
