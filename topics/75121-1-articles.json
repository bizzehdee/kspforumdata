Mods, save files, etc. Most mods come with a readme that tells you how to install it, but i\u0027m looking for more of an overview of how it all fits together. People seem to be very good at manipulating all the files and folders to make their ksp experiences easier, but I get nervous about moving things around and such. Just a basic overview would be amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T16:46:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be easy to write-up but I can\u0027t think of any videos about it. What \u0027all\u0027 are you unsure about? Mods\u0027 folders live inside KSP\u0027s \u0022gamedata\u0022 folder - apart from putting them there I don\u0027t know of anything else you have to fit together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T17:19:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike Pecan says, nearly every mod has been updated to go in the GameData folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain Game Folder - Has the config file, version file, and executable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameData - Contains all the stock parts, graphics, sonds, etc in the Squad and NASAmission folders. Stores just about all mods too. So...most of the game\u0027s data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInside each of the GameData sub-folders there are more folders. Most of these are self explanitory, such as \u0022Parts\u0022 or \u0022Sounds\u0022. Inside the Parts are more directories with all the parts models, textures, and each part\u0027s \u0022part.cfg\u0022 which defines how it acts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esaves - Your save games stored in directories. Each directory has the save files, an SPH directory with your SPH ships, and a VAB directory with VAB ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Escreenshots - Where in-game tanken screen shots are written.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP_Data/Launcher_Data - some more internal game resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShips - A folder containing sub-folders (SPH \u0026amp; VAB) with all the stock ships. Copy your craft files into here if you have something you want available to all your saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the rest of the directories are old holdovers from previous versions. For the most part, they are empty and the contents have been moved into the GameData folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if that\u0027s what you\u0027re looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
