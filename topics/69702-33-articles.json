I\u0027m always enhancing my work, so expect improvements, but keep this in mind: you only could see a type of flare like in your pic when you look directly o near to directly to the light source. Using that type of flare right now in KSP is not the most realistic option. That could be possible only if the KSP lens flare had an extra layer for the light source. But the KSP lens flare texture only have 3 points for the lenses flares and two for the light source (one for the main light point and one \u0022surrounding\u0022 that light point).

I will explain as best as I can. A much better answer could be said (or shown) if I could find time to upload an example video to Youtube for you to see. If you want, I could do that in about 12-15 hours. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway! In astronomer\u0027s Interstellar pack, there is an option to add \u0027lightning\u0027. As far as I know, it is essentially another layer in the atmosphere that blinks off and on in some spots that creates the illusion of lightning in the clouds. As you can see from the pic below (courtesy of Astronomer on the EVE release thread), there are some parts of the night side of Kerbin that are illuminated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dG4lja0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dG4lja0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WJn9P48.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WJn9P48.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow! For the cloud part. The clouds themselves aren\u0027t blurry (from orbit), however have you noticed that from ground level or close to the cloud layer that clouds in the distance are relatively blurry while the close clouds are detailed? I\u0027ll upload a pic to this post in the morning to show you compared to Astronomer\u0027s pack. The close clouds and clouds from orbit look perfect (believe me, the KSPRC clouds are unparalleled if you ask me), however from ground level the distant clouds look distorted/blurry. I have no idea how he does it, but he does. Anyway, I\u0027m sorry to put all of this and bug you heaps, as I know your English isn\u0027t the best (You\u0027re Spanish, if I\u0027m not mistaken| You\u0027re actually speaking pretty great!), but as I\u0027ve heard across the forum; \u0022Feedback is welcome!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also to anyone who reads this: Would you consider it copying if Proot were to implement similar features?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: The \u0027blurry clouds\u0027 comparison (somewhat):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAstronomer\u0027s pack second, KSPRC first.
