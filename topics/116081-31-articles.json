They are not as efficient as the Whiplash and have lower thrust at medium Mach numbers, but will keep thrusting well several kilometers higher than the Whiplash before flaming out.\n\nI was as surprised as anyone that the new Gliido made orbit first time out. Taking off the third engine made balance a lot easier; I just had to learn to fly a smarter profile to compensate for the reduced thrust. Fully fueled it has a vacuum dV of over 3.4 km/s, so pending a successful landing I think Kerbfleet has a new workhorse for Kerbin-Mun-Minmus service. Only trouble is the docking port needs to move forward, I could not nose into the dock at Micarooni and had to \u0022angle park\u0022. Dream is for Micarooni to be able to comfortably manage multiple Gliidos as well as other visiting craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Thegamer211","CreatedById":149354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T17:57:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I can think of a few reasons....\n\nThere are even mods to enable those seats.\n\nThe 6 seat mk3 capsule: [http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/235281-seat-mk3-cockpit](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/235281-seat-mk3-cockpit) and 6 crew lab:[http://kspmods.net/6-crew-science-lab-mod/](http://kspmods.net/6-crew-science-lab-mod/)\n\nWhy are they modelled in the capsules then?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T18:11:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There are even mods to enable those seats.\n\u003E The 6 seat mk3 capsule: [http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/235281-seat-mk3-cockpit](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/235281-seat-mk3-cockpit) and 6 crew lab:[http://kspmods.net/6-crew-science-lab-mod/](http://kspmods.net/6-crew-science-lab-mod/)\n\u003E \n\u003E Why are they modelled in the capsules then?\n\nMy guess (for why they are modelled but not enabled) is that the spaceplane parts *already* outclass rocket parts in terms of crew capacity per ton. The Mk3 cockpit masses 3.5t (not counting mono) and carries four, while the Mk1-2 pod masses half a ton more and carries only three. The Mk2 inline cockpit carries two Kerbals at half a ton less than the Mk2 lander can, and despite its lower weight the cockpit has a much higher crash tolerance.
