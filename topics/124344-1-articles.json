There was some about axes bindings, but your issue seems different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP itself has no settings about centering axes; what couldn\u0027t be otherwise, as not even \u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUnity\u003C/a\u003E allows any setting regarding axes centering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven the above, the issue would normally be found in your system. Apart from the very axes position signal the joystick sends, the information is processed by the device driver, DirectX Input, and (if exists) any joystick software able to \u0022correct\u0022 the center position. Unity and therefore KSP would only see the axes values after all the processing by those software layers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would bet you already checked the center axes issue only occurs with KSP, and isn\u0027t present also with system software (e.g. the joystick control panel). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, because of the mismatch you report about the actions performed, I have a suspect another input device is registered with your system, and for some reason it \u0022fights\u0022 with the joystick. Each device has its own identifier with the system, but Unity just lists them by a single number, e.g. INPUT_DEVICES { \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; = 0, 1, ... }. If for any reason you registered the KSP settings with one configuration, and then the configuration changes (you attached or detached an input device), KSP may get confused and use the wrong device number. This is one issue going to be fixed soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in case, please try keeping the same input devices while registering settings and playing KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case the above has no effect, we need more info about your problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- make and model of the joystick, version of its drivers installed;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- version of the Operating System;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- DXDiag.txt save (should you need help with that, start \u0022DXDiag.exe\u0022 from the system command, save info with the button at the bottom of the DXdiag window);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KSP/settings.cfg (that file is renewed at each KSP start, upload a copy of when the issue is occurring).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
