There was a game that practically their test, it was called Kerbal Space Program. There were more than 5,000 players on Kerbal Space Program each day, and those were the numbers they could find. And it didn\u2019t help that there were constant challenges to one-up each other. They almost decided to keep all of the KSP players frozen on Earth, when one intern who just joined suggested making a separate challenge for those KSP players. There were two requirements to be considered a KSP player, you had to have played the game for at least 100 hours, and you must be able to create and send your own space plane to orbit. So it was decided. There would be two groups, one with the common people, and the other with the KSP players. So it was said, so it was decided, so it was done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-28T19:23:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2020 07:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by GuessingEveryDay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUltimate Steve has spoken.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GuessingEveryDay","CreatedById":203507,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-28T18:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-29T18:52:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not clear to me what the mission is, and are those the only two name choices?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GuessingEveryDay","CreatedById":203507,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-29T20:24:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, here\u2019s the next chapter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter One - Beginnings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello everyone, I don\u2019t know if anyone will ever find this, but I\u2019m on Kerbin! To all you people who haven\u2019t heard of KSP, although I\u2019m pretty sure you guys know about it too, since everyone was teleported to Kerbin... But my group had way less than a million, it was probably 10 thousand or something\u2014Oh! And we all looked like kerbals, there was no way to tell us apart. except for the name tags on the suits. They had the username and profile, so it looked like most of the people here also had an account with the forums, but a lot of people also had guests accounts, so there was a lot of people staring at each other with common names. But I\u2019m getting too far ahead, to explain why, I\u2019ll need to rewind to earlier today.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, earlier today, I was just sitting around in my cousins house in Utah, thinking of ideas for a story similar to a story I enjoyed, when everything turned blue, and then the ground turned from carpet to grass, and everything felt lighter. I tried rubbing my eyes, but something wouldn\u2019t let me. Then I took a look around and there was a crowd of kerbals. I started waving, and that\u2019s when I screamed. My hand was smaller, and in a space mitten! Then I realized that I must look like a Kerbal. Two thoughts came to mind. One: I am a Kerbal! 2: Am I stuck in a retelling of The Saga of Emiko\u2019s Station? Then I noticed there was a stage with the banner \u201CWelcome KSP players!\u201D So that would mean everyone else was a KSP player, but who? Then I noticed the flags on the backpacks and the names underneath, I was standing next to a person named Nuke. Then a kerbal walked up onto the stage and spoke \u201CHello everyone! My name is Jebediah Kerman, before being interrupted by a lot of cheering, I am proud to say I was one of them, the other guy next to me said \u201CMeh. Bill\u2019s better.\u201D, after a while, the cheering died down. \u201COkay, now that\u2019s out of the way, you guys have been chosen because you guys have played KSP for at least 100 hours and/or also have an account on KSP forums, if you don\u2019t have an account yet, we will give all of you kPads where you can set up your own. Now the process isn\u2019t done, you will also have to create a spaceplane that will take off, orbit 5 times, and land on the runway. You will be flying these planes.\u201D Said Jeb before being drowned out by more cheering, albeit less excited though. \u201CAlright, before we get started, we will hand out the kPads, and give more information about the space plane challenge. You will get your personal apartment, and will be transported to it.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
