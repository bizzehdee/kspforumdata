I\u0027ve been playing for over a year now and since KSP 0.90 I\u0027ve been always wanting to make a Mk3 spaceplane/SSTO that could lift up a combination of an orange tank and large MonoPropellant tank into orbit in one go. Now that we have the new Mk3 wings, this task could be much \u0022easier\u0022 nowadays. So post your Mk3 spaceplanes here! (craft file is recommended.)

Here\u0027s a craft that I made that can get a full orange tank into orbit. I didn\u0027t include a mono tank but you can add one easily enough. This SSTO has some issues, such as no RCS controls at all, and it gets a bit hairy at high speeds, also I haven\u0027t bothered trying reentry. Anyways, it\u0027s a bit rough but I got it into orbit on my first try without adjusting my original design, and it should give you a pretty good platform to improve upon and get ideas from. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fly it to orbit, I start with SAS on, full throttle, and I wound up having to use the end of the runway to get off the ground. Then I pitched up at around 40 degrees, until I got to ~8km, then i dropped down to ~20 degrees, and gradually down to 5 degrees at 10-11km, where I kept a pretty level flight with minimal altitude gain until I started going over 1km/s. At this point just start climbing at a rate that maintains your velocity. At around 20-22km when your velocity starts to drop off, activate stage 2, pitch up, and you should be good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t set up any control groups for this either which would be a good idea, but you can fiddle with all of that to your heart\u0027s content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/28489931539013187/D0ED7975FD5C556D8BDE46401C0571574E757012/\u0022 alt=\u0022D0ED7975FD5C556D8BDE46401C0571574E757012\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3dix5d5Bwf7bW5LeHRGa0UzRlU/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3dix5d5Bwf7bW5LeHRGa0UzRlU/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crikeycrapper","CreatedById":116365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T00:48:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice spaceplane, xScaramouchx.
