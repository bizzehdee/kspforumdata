If your not using flame simulations you can usually save a ton of time by using the GPU to do the crunching on your frames. It can be faster sometimes depending on the scene,samples,etc.\n\nGo to your User Preferences under the File menu. Then click the system tab at the top.

I like his tutorials because they are usually very clear and to the point. As he is explaining the sim he points out a few tweaks to make the fire do things like roar out or just kind of flicker. He also covers setting up the material node. When using the Quick Smoke to add fire/smoke to an item Blender leaves off the part of the material that makes it actually glow or emit any light. Nice of them huh lol\n\nBelow are a few screenshots I took that show a few different ways to setup the material nodes and sim.\n\n\u003E ![a6WMjQm.png](http://i.imgur.com/a6WMjQm.png)\n\n\u003E ![D9TdPrc.png](http://i.imgur.com/D9TdPrc.png)\n\n\u003E ![HRWu1Y7.png](http://i.imgur.com/HRWu1Y7.png)\n\n\u003E ![UM3S3JQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/UM3S3JQ.png)\n\n\\*edit smoke density is controlled by the value attribute in the multiply node just above the color ramp in the picture.\n\nSo, between the values up there you can get some really interesting flames. It can be a bit confusing getting the amount of flames dialed in. I\u0027d recommend just creating a new scene, select the default cube, press spacebar and type Quick Smoke and select it from the list. Now just play around with the sim values. \n\n\\*\\*edit 2 He doesn\u0027t mention this specifically but I\u0027ll save you a lot of hell in advance. Save your project often! Right after you setup the sim, save. After you make a single change and want to rebake it, save!!!! And lastly give your smoke cache a name!! I like to name it and click that external check box and make a directory just for the cache. If you ever want multiple smoke sims in one scene, this is critical!!!! Also if you do want multiple smoke sims in one scene move them to separate layers!!!! Weird and bad things happen with multiple sims on one layer. Even weirder things happen with multiple sims that don\u0027t have specific cache locations defined.\n\nHopefully this will save you the headache of waiting a few hours for a highly detailed sim to bake only to find out something wonky between two smoke sims blew it all up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T18:28:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 06:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by esinohio**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T20:30:30Z","Content":"Well, it\u0027s being a you-know-what right now. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n![8qWaTe2.png](http://i.imgur.com/8qWaTe2.png)\n\nEven with the whole setup, no fire.
