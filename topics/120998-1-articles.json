I\u0027ve always just added the radial stacks 2 at a time with 2-symmetry and never even considered trying to add 6 at once and then split them later. Gizmos and snapping makes doing it even easier now actually, because your stacks can always be exactly the same height without much fuss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
