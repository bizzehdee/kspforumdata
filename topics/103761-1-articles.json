The idea being to keep it small, simple, achievements oriented, and executable.\n\nI have a reusable SSTO Duna Ascent Vehicle (DAV) I am going to use in Deeply Duna. It\u0027s intended only to transport Dunauts between Duna surface and Low Duna Orbit.\n\n![vc3152f.png](http://imgur.com/vc3152f.png)![Vp6eiOc.png](http://imgur.com/Vp6eiOc.png)\n\nVery aerodynamic and futuristic, sort of stock linear aerospike engine...\n\nTo test it\u0027s Duna aero capture I had flown it there. I thought \u0027strap some drop tanks so it has the fuel to return from Duna \u0026 life support for the duration on it and it can be an outpost\u0027 - hence \u0027Dinky Duna\u0027. \u0027Dinky\u0027 in both the British (attractively small and neat) and North American ( disappointingly/comically small, insignificant) sense.\n\nThe basic plan is an extended stay mission, that could be a permanent presence by doing a relay overlap of identical missions. For me it\u0027s really about hacking together a quick completion with some good constraints and technology / technique trailing.\n\nFor mission robustness / I want to hit that first transfer window with the second launch - I need that if the first launch fails then the second can complete the mission =\u003E close to 30t total payload. Also small means simple, simple means fly-able. A few extra ton I can cope with by spending more dV for a slightly off Hohmann transfer.\n\nI can fly and complete just the \u0027Mission Robustness\u0027 second launch flight as a \u0027one off standalone\u0027 to get \u0022Mission Execution 1\u0022 and use it\u0027s Mission Report to get \u0022Mission Execution 3\u0022 on a plan for as many copies of identical flights as the eventual craft weight allows.\n\nHere are some sanity numbers:\n\nEarth Day 951 is the last D-K transfer in the 1000 days, returns by 1015, first window day 55 =\u003E 960 day mission \u003C 1000 day \u0022One-way Ticket Penalty\u0022 of 50% off the score.\n\nMy DAV is 6.5 ton, \u002B960 LS weighs ???? so 2 at 15 ton each could be do-able. But lugging return fuel all that way will blow out the mass budget with the 48s.\n\nI found the \u0027Duna Direct\u0027 mod that has two parts; a hydrogen tank and a reactor that does the Sabatier process to generate liquid fuel and oxidiser - [http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/224286-dunadirect](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/224286-dunadirect). One tank of H2 will make 360 fuel \u002B oxidiser. How much does it cost to push 360 f\u0026o to Duna ? =\u003E how much does Sabatier save: 1\\*48 engine =\u003E 360f\u0026o is a 8.5 ton craft, H2\u002B13f is a 364 kg craft! =\u003E 8400 vs 264 kg (excluding the engine) - a factor of 32 times or 3.14%. (16kg is H2 of 78.5 kg wet weight tank) Too good not to use to generate the return ascent and transfer fuel, and as a bonus it\u0027s exactly what Dr Robert Zubrin proposes for the real life (planned) Mars Direct missions.\n\nDuna Ascent and Kerbin transfer requires: 100(just in case) \u002B (1380 \u002B 700 \u002B 100(man)) \\*1.25 = 2725 \u002B 100(just in case) m/s and I can stage the drop tanks. (got 2824 vac / 2742 atmospheric)\n\nThe times 1.25 is to hit \u0022Crew Safety #2\u0022 of the challenge, succeed in the face of loosing 20% deltaV.\n\nTransferring to Duna requires 100(jic) \u002B ( 1200 \u002B 100(man) ) \\* 1.25 = 1625 \u002B 100(jic) m/s but I cannot stage anything I will need on Duna. I have to arrive with fuel such that adding 360 will get me home. So take the Duna asc\u002Bxfer config, jimmy the staging like it wont stage =\u003E 2232 m/s -1725 = 507 should be left, remove 360 f =\u003E 483 m/s left - so there should be slightly more fuel than I need left - 24m/s worth! we have a 100 m/s \u0027buffer\u0027. Adding 2x45 will add 200 m/s @ 17250 kg = 34500 =\u003E 51.75 days =\u003E 61.75 = 247 EDay - a Duna transfer then will be well under the nominal 1200 m/s. So I go with extra Kerbin-Duna drop tanks.\n\nAfter messing about the resulting 2 man transfer\u002Boutpost\u002Brover\u002Bfuel-refinery\u002Bascent vehicle ( DAV\u002B\u002B ) was a little too heavy on landing to hit Crew Safety #2, so I had to add one more engine. I wanted to keep the engines under the centre of mass so a single failure would not generate too much torque.\n\n![bLXGJKa.png](http://imgur.com/bLXGJKa.png)\n\n![rqcQXQl.png](http://imgur.com/rqcQXQl.png)\n\nNot so areodynamic and futuristic, but all the extra junk will be left on Duna. The DAV\u002B\u002B can land okay with one failed engine \u0026 one failed chute, it can ascend with one failed engine.\n\nFlight plan sketch for DAV\u002B\u002B from LKO is:\n\n- be full of fuel.\n- transfer to Duna\n- aerocapture\n- land somewhere low and flat\n- use Sabatier and H2 to make the ascent and return fuel\n- sit for XXX days, maybe take the rovers for a drive, selfies, Settlers of Catan, etc - try not to get on each others nerves.\n- ascent to LDO\n- transfer to Kerbin\n- aerocapture\n- take the shuttle down. The DAV\u002B\u002B can re-enter if it needed to.\n\nThings I thought about but decided against:\n\n- nukes - much more efficient! putting a nuke on a craft this small just does not pay off in fuel savings. Also makes the flight plan more complex by adding a rendezvous and as far as I know I\u0027d have to have a \u0027buffer tank\u0027 with the nukes, if the buffer was too small I\u0027d have to use the manual fuel transfer to keep it fed. Does anyone know a neat way to transfer fuel to \u0027an engine mounted straight to a docking port\u0027? I had an idea how to make it flyable even under a single nuke out of two failure. In the end I thought to just keep it simple and \u0027Dinky\u0027.\n- life support recycling - I\u0027ve only got 4 Kerbal, split across two craft, if it wasn\u0027t dinky I could send re-cyclers with a second wave.\n\nI have a 30 ton re-usable launcher ( henceforth named Kerbin Lift Vehicle - 30 (KLV-30), like it\u0027s larger sister KLV-75 ), see \u0027Dash 4 Duna\u0027 ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112640-Dash-4-Duna-Duna-Permanent-Outpost-Mission-Architecture-Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112640-Dash-4-Duna-Duna-Permanent-Outpost-Mission-Architecture-Challenge)) for details. It has TWR headroom so I added 720f to the 3rd stage, this left the recoveable first stage at 66% of launcher weight ( KLV-34.5 ). That will lift two DAV\u002B\u002B to meet the Basic Requirement of 4 Kerbals on Duna. Also as a bonus, travelling as a pair, in the case of \u0027total engine failure\u0027 of a DAV\u002B\u002B they can dock and one can get them both home on two engines, if they were \u0027great pilots\u0027 they could probably even do that in the middle of a transfer burn.\n\nNow I jus have to fly it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T14:21:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DBowman**"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T04:01:07Z","Content":"\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
