The arrival hall echoed with shrieking kerblets, free to run around at last after too many hours cooped up in an airplane. Their parents stood resignedly in line, keeping half an eye on their hurtling offspring, and listening to the steady thump, thump, thump of luggage dropping onto the collection racks. A slowly moving stream of passengers marked the way to the exit, shuffling one by one past a row of placard carrying kerbals and out through the revolving door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel had managed to commandeer one of the few remaining trolleys. James dropped his bag onto it and looked around. \u0022They did say they\u0027d send someone to meet us didn\u0027t they?\u0022 he asked. Sherfel nodded. \u0022By the door I thought,\u0022 she said. \u0022Hopefully somebody we\u0027ll recognise.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames squinted at the row of placards. \u0022Not so you\u0027d notice,\u0022 he said. \u0022Lets go anyway - this place is giving me a headache.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJames? Sherfel?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cheerful looking kerbal waved at them from amidst the placards. James watched him take something from one of the throng of kerbals surrounding him, quickly scribble something on it, and hand it back with a smile. The rest of the crowd looked around, trying to see who was attracting his attention. By the time he and Sherfel made their way to the door, a disconcerting number of kerbals were waving pieces of card, notebooks, and what appeared to be three ring binders, at them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSteady on, folks! Give them room to breathe!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbal thrust out a hand. \u201CPleased to meet ya both. I\u0027m Ornie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames shook it. \u201COrnie...Eve 2, yes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie grinned. \u201CYep. No need to introduce you two. Reckon everyone here knows about...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEndurance!\u0022A burly, heavyset kerbal pushed his way through the crowd, clutching a binder. Suddenly tongue-tied, he riffled through its pages before shyly offering it to James. The bemused kerbonaut, was astonished to see a picture of himself and Sherfel floating inside \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u0027s \u003C/em\u003E habitation module. An elaborate, and as far as he could see, surprisingly accurate, cutaway diagram of the module took up most of the opposite page. He blinked as Ornie handed him a pen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHope you don\u0027t mind signing an autograph or two?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh, no. Not at all,\u0022\u00A0said James, \u201CEr - what\u0027s your name?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEldrin,\u0022\u00A0came the mumbled reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames thought for a moment, then wrote a short message under his picture. He signed it neatly and passed it over to Sherfel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEldrin stared at his feet. \u201CThat spacewalk - Kerm, that was...\u00A0I mean, climbing out and just fixing the PV panels, \u003Cem\u003Ein space\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\u00A0He looked up at Sherfel hopefully. \u201CI don\u0027t suppose...pictures? Even just one or two?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel shook her head. \u201CAfraid not,\u0022\u00A0she said gently. \u201CNot on that EVA - we didn\u0027t really have time to unstow the camera.\u0022\u00A0She signed the picture and handed it back. \u201CI\u0027ll get our PR department to send over a couple of our flight packs though - they\u0027ve got some pretty good photos in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh I already ordered one of those,\u0022\u00A0said Eldrin. \u201CJus\u0027\u00A0thought...never mind - sorry to trouble you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo trouble,\u0022\u00A0said Sherfel easily. \u201CGood to meet you, Eldrin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEldrin nodded sadly, and stepped back into the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs quickly as James and Sherfel could sign one of the multitude of pictures, albums and other items of space memorabilia being thrust at them, another one took its place. Ornie saw Sherfel\u0027s jaw clench around a stifled yawn and clapped his hands for attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COK, OK folks. We need to be gettin\u0027\u00A0back to the Space Centre, so I\u0027ll tell yeh what we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re gonna do here. Everyone who\u0027s already had somethin\u0027\u00A0signed, take a step back. Everyone else - pick out whatever you want signed, and scribble yer name and address on the back. I\u0027ll make sure everyone gets their gear back in a day or two.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the more eager autograph hunters took him at his word and handed over large stacks of material to be signed, only to take most of it back after one look at his raised eyebrow. Ornie gathered the rest together into a neat bundle, and retrieved his, now rather battered, placard, which he hoisted in a polite farewell to the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank yeh, everybody. Like I said, I\u0027ll make sure you get all of this back. Reckon I\u0027ll be seeing some of yeh at the next lecture, and I\u0027ll\u00A0mebbe see you all at the next launch!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNext lecture?\u0022\u00A0asked Sherfel, as they left the airport terminal and crossed the car park.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie nodded. \u201CWe run them a couple of times a month at the Space Centre,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CBob\u0027s idea, but they turned out to be more popular than he expected, so he pulled a bunch of us in to help. We tend to do \u0027em in pairs, general stuff the first week, getting more technical in the second week.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat do you talk about?\u0022\u00A0asked James.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBit of everything,\u0022\u00A0said Ornie, fishing his keys out of his pocket. \u201CBasic engine design, orbital mechanics, tracking and astrogation, overview of Mission Control, sometimes we get one of the pilots to come along and do a kerbonaut\u0027s\u00A0diary slideshow for one of the flights.\u0022\u00A0Ornie grinned. \u201CThose are always popular. Climb in folks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel clambered up into the truck cabin, closely followed by James. Ornie slammed the door behind them, before jogging round and swinging himself up into the driver\u0027s seat. He touched the starter button and the motor purred into life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames frowned. \u201CI remember Bob,\u0022 he said, Flew on the Kerbal 1 obviously, one of your heads of engineering?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie nodded, both eyes on the road. \u201CYup. And heading up the lander project with your fella Danfen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s what I thought,\u201C said James cautiously. \u201CIsn\u0027t he a little bit,\u00A0well - \u003Cem\u003Ebusy\u003C/em\u003E for lecturing too?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHis idea,\u0022\u00A0said Ornie calmly. \u201CGuess he finds the time from somewhere.\u0022\u00A0Across the junction, another truck flashed its headlamps. Ornie waved at the driver and pulled out onto the main road.\u00A0\u201CGood idea if yeh ask me. Anyone in the team who can\u0027t stand up and talk for an hour about basic stuff that they should know back to front and upside down...\u0022\u00A0Ornie shrugged. \u201CIt hasn\u0027t happened yet is all I\u0027ll say. Plus we get a load of goodwill from the good people of Barkton - seems only fair to give somethin\u0027\u00A0back.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCars and other vehicles whirred past them on either side, many of them sporting long, fluttering pennants, adorned with a tilted rocket trailing a stream of flame behind it. Sherfel stared in astonishment at an old fashioned camper van decorated with a mural of Kerbin floating in space. Another, more modern, van lumbered past, flanks painted to resemble a \u003Cem\u003EMoho\u003C/em\u003E capsule on its booster, driver waving frantically at them. Sherfel saw his beaming face glance in their direction, a red cap perched jauntily on his head. Ornie flashed him a thumbs-up as he drove past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s a new one,\u0022\u00A0he said cheerfully. \u201CReckon he could do an Eve paint job for me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames shook his head. \u201CHow many lectures have you \u003Cem\u003Egiven\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022\u00A0he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie smiled. \u201CA couple, \u201C he said, \u201CWe do guided tours too, but most of it is down to Jeb. Back before the Kerbal 1, him and the rest of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E would do their flight planning in a local bar. Anyone could listen in, or come and watch the tests, even if most of \u0027em thought he was crazy. These days, old Jorfurt gives us a private room for the planning meetings, but you\u0027ll still find a good few of the team down in the bar afterwards, talking to folks, answering questions...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSigning autographs?\u0022\u00A0said Sherfel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat too,\u0022\u00A0agreed Ornie. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CPoint is though, that Jeb hasn\u0027t changed much since he was running his junkyard. Goes to the same places, mixes with the same folks. He\u0027s pretty good for business these days too, which doesn\u0027t hurt.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie put on a local accent. \u201CSure, when do you need them for? Oh right. That could be tricky I\u0027m afraid - we\u0027ve got a big job on for Gene at the Space Centre. We could do the first third now...Yes, that Gene. Jebediah - you mean Jeb? Quite well actually. Look, we\u0027ve got a guest box at the Space Centre for next week. Why don\u0027t you come over, we can sort something out over lunch, watch the launch, maybe have a word with Jeb afterwards...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie checked his mirrors. \u201CIf we\u0027ve got any room in the training schedule, Jeb sometimes runs private tours, complete with a ride in one of the Whirligigs.\u0022\u00A0He saw James\u0027s puzzled look. \u201CSorry - our name for the simulators. He\u0027ll usually leave an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E unit on the test stand too.\u0022\u00A0Ornie grinned. \u201CMost folks like to fire a real, honest-to-Kerm rocket engine, even if its only a small one. And riding in a genuine spacecraft trainer next to the first kerbal in space -\u00A0well I reckon more than one major deal has been sealed in a Whirligig cockpit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe truck rumbled down a side road past a row of warehouses. Clusters of clean, new, wood-and-brick housing stood in neat rows, conspicuous against the older, squarer industrial buildings. Here and there, Sherfel saw more pennants fluttering in the breeze, their bright colours vibrant against the domed, slate rooftops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside the cab, James was puzzled. \u201CBut why?\u0022\u00A0he asked, \u201CI get the need for good PR - and the pennants and paint jobs are very neat - but you\u0027re all putting in a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of effort here. More than Rockomax\u0027s PR department, and that\u0027s saying something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie gestured at the rows of houses. \u201CBecause we owe them,\u0022\u00A0he said quietly. \u201CThose new places out there? All for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E workers and they didn\u0027t cost us a thing. Richlin and me joined right after Kerbal 1. We were there when Bill showed the the rest of them his pictures from the flight. I went home to pick up some parts - by the time I got back, the place was overrun. Folks putting together new workshops, scraping the rust off old equipment, sorting through the oily, greasy depths of Jeb\u0027s old stock bins. Even more than most big projects, our space program depends on volunteers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CToo many other kerbals to mention from the great town of Barkton,\u0022\u00A0said Sherfel suddenly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie looked at her. \u201CExactly,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CAnyway - we\u0027re here. Welcome to the Kerbin Interplanetary Society.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames climbed out of the cab. Sherfel leapt down after him and looked around curiously at the nearby warehouses. She blinked at the sign boards on the roof and their, now familiar, tilted rocket logo. James read the boards and rolled his eyes. \u003Cem\u003ESeriously? We\u0027re planning to launch a spacecraft to the M\u00FCn, but they\u0027re \u003C/em\u003Estill\u003Cem\u003E calling themselves a junkyard and spacecraft parts company?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo kerbals stood deep in conversation by the door to the nearest warehouse, both sipping from large tin mugs. One of them looked vaguely familiar, although Sherfel couldn\u0027t quite remember where she\u0027d seen him before. Behind her, Ornie slammed the cab door, whistling to himself as he locked up. The second kerbal glanced up at the noise and suddenly James and Sherfel were staring at the most recognisable face on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EJebediah Kerman...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn unwelcome flutter tickled the back of Sherfel\u0027s ribs. \u003Cem\u003ESteady girl - he\u0027s just a kerbonaut like you. Nothing he\u0027s done that you haven\u0027t done too - and you\u0027ve done a lot more on top of that.\u003C/em\u003E Beside her, James had frozen in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EYeah. Except that he was the first. And he got there in a rocket built right here by a junkyard and spare parts company.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie coughed tactfully. \u201CExpect you two could use a coffee too?\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CWater too if you\u0027re anythin\u0027 like me. Flying passenger class always dries me right out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames nodded gratefully. \u201CBoth sound good,\u0022\u00A0he said. Sherfel shook herself mentally. \u201CYes please, Ornie,\u0022\u00A0she said. \u201CTo both.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe can do that,\u0022\u00A0said Jeb cheerfully. \u201CI\u0027m Jeb Kerman by the way, and this here is Wernher. Welcome aboard.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher smiled. \u201CLooking forward to flying with you,\u0022\u00A0he said. He eyed the stack of autograph books in Ornie\u0027s arms. \u201CWe were starting to think Ornie had gotten lost, but I guess he just got waylaid.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe rocket-spotters struck it lucky today,\u0022\u00A0said Ornie equably. \u201CHad to rescue James and Sherfel from the eager mob. You left enough coffee for three, Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust about,\u0022 said Jeb, leading the way around the side of the warehouse. \u201CJug\u0027s in my office.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMore of a den than an office\u003C/em\u003E, thought Sherfel as she took in the scuffed chairs, the low, shop-worn table, and the refrigerator under the desk. She stared at the picture of the M\u00FCn rising over Kerbin, a shiver running up her spine. \u003Cem\u003EExcept for \u003C/em\u003Ethat\u003Cem\u003E. Surely that has to be the original, and dear Kerm, being the first ones to see that view out of your window.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTake a seat, folks, and help yourselves to whatever you want.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe table was laden with fruit, a full jug of very fresh-smelling coffee, a tray of hot rolls, and a plate of bite sized, mud coloured cubes. Sherfel stared at them curiously as she bit into a roll. Ornie noticed them too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMore of Derny\u0027s experiments, Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb helped himself to a roll. \u201CYep. SRCs, version...whatever number he\u0027s up to now. Not quite as good as version six, but I\u0027d still pack\u00A0\u0027em for the journey.\u0022\u00A0He gestured at James. \u201CGo ahead - they taste a lot better than they look.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames took a cautious bite from his cube. A surprised look crossed his face, and he took another one from the plate. \u201CHey - these are pretty good - but what are they?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSavoury Ration Cubes,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Ornie. \u201CSpace rations. Derny figured that giving \u0027em letters would make them sound more like proper kerbonaut supplies. Not to be confused with Sweet Ration Cubes, Spare Ration Cubes or Surprise Ration Cubes - Derny hasn\u0027t really got the hang of acronyms yet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd never, ever to be confused with Spicy Ration Cubes,\u0022 added Jeb. He winced. \u201CThe snack that only Lucan could love - and he\u0027s been destroying his palate with smoky sapwood for Kerm knows how long.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie lifted his hands defensively. \u201CDon\u0027t blame me,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CI just told him that food can taste a bit bland in zero-g. I didn\u0027t know he\u0027d take it as a personal challenge.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe noticed that too,\u0022\u00A0said Sherfel. \u201CHerbs help a lot.\u201C She coughed. \u201CSmoky sapwood doesn\u0027t taste too bad in space either, but you never really get the full flavour.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie laughed at the dismayed expression on Jeb\u0027s face. \u201CYou\u0027ll definitely have to have a word with Lucan,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CHe\u0027s got a collection of smokes from different Groves, probably different years too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames chose a slice of redfruit. \u201CI think I\u0027ll stick to spicy SRCs,\u0022 he said dryly. He raised an eyebrow at Sherfel. \u201CWe should ask Ademone to hire a chef for the Rockomax crews though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, Derny\u0027s not really a chef,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher. \u201CHe was one of the rocket-spotters as a matter of fact. Until he managed to talk Jeb into giving him a job.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHard to turn down somebody who actively volunteered to mop floors and make coffee,\u0022\u00A0said Jeb. \u201CI still remember him telling me that he didn\u0027t know much about all those rocket engineers but that he was betting that none of them knew one end of a mop from the other. He probably wasn\u0027t far wrong and besides, having somebody to keep up with Bob\u0027s caffeine habit has been a \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E help.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie smiled. \u201CTurned out he\u0027s also a real fine cook, with a knack for making snacks that hold together in zero-g. We\u0027ll head down to the kitchen later - he\u0027ll want to know what sort of things you folls like.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb rubbed his hands together. \u201CThought I\u0027d take you on a general tour of the place this afternoon,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CShow you around, introduce you to everyone. Then, if you\u0027re still awake, we can run through the training schedule over dinner. I gather that Genie\u0027s been talking to Nelton, so he should have some idea of how you run things at Rockomax. We can figure out the rest at Jorfurt\u0027s tonight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe young breadfruit vines were looking healthier than they had for weeks. Row after row of neatly staked, green striped stems rustled in the light breeze, dotted with newly sprouted buds and thick with tightly wound clusters of waxy leaves that gleamed in the afternoon sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder the vines though it was very different. Knotweed ran riot, sprawling across the soil in a tangled, stringy mat. Hookwort clawed its way up the breadfruit stems like curly strands of barbed wire. Star poppies, yellowjackets and rustbells erupted from the soil in bright rafts of unwanted colour. Butterflies swarmed in droves, as if the rafts were fraying at the edges and blowing away on the wind. Their larvae infested the breadfruit leaves, leaving them ragged and brown edged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle carefully dug around the base of the nearest green striped stem, exposing the root system. The coarse, stunted fibres were still black and rotted at the tips but, to her relief, rot near the tips was finally being balanced by new growth near the main root. She scooped the soil back into place and gently tamped it down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie bounced happily around the vines, chasing the butterflies, scuffing at the knotweed, chattering to herself all the while. Gerselle watched her peering at one of the leaf clusters, pleased to see her keeping her hands clear of whatever had caught her attention. She got to her feet, brushing the loose soil off her poncho and called to her daughter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJoenie! Joenie! Come and help Mummy with the flowers!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie raced over, flinging her arms around Gerselle\u0027s knees in an enthusiastic kerblet hug. She reached up, proudly displaying both muddy palms. Gerselle kissed the ugly, ridged weal still scored across her daughter\u0027s fingers, a fading testimony to an encounter with a particularly nasty species of caterpillar. \u201CGood girl,\u0022\u00A0she said. \u201CYou were a good girl and didn\u0027t touch them!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere are the flowers, Mummy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey\u0027re by the gate, sweetheart.\u0022Gerselle tapped Joenie on the shoulder and jogged away. \u201CTag!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie giggled and ran after her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe carefully geometric, relentlessly monochrome flower beds stood in stark contrast to the anarchic exuberance of plant life under the vines. Each bed was fenced in by a low wooden palisade hammered into the soil. Gerselle surveyed them with satisfaction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EStar poppies, rustbells, cornshakes, yellowjackets.\u00A0Hookwort, knotweed, damsonwire, clover...\u003C/em\u003EShe pulled a notebook out of her pocket and flipped it open. \u003Cem\u003E Kerblets fingers, gingergrass, broadweed. Hmmm, the springfern is looking a bit bedraggled, but the rest of them are growing -\u00A0\u00A0well, like weeds.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhilst Joenie amused herself by leaping over the planks, or pulling up handfuls of flowers, Gerselle slowly worked over each bed, carefully uprooting the occasional windblown intruder and tossing it to one side. \u003Cem\u003EHmph. Weeding the weeds. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t take too long for fence jumping to lose its appeal. Joenie flopped onto the ground disconsolately, and began to kick the nearest plank. Gerselle picked a large handful of the thick-stemmed star poppies and sat down beside her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI tell you what. Why don\u0027t we make a pretty necklace for my pretty girl.\u0022She showed Joenie how to split the poppy stem with a fingernail and thread the another stem through the gap. Before long, Joenie was sitting cross-legged on the grass, tongue poked out in concentration and a ragged chain of flowers slowly piling up in her lap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLook Mummy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle looked up and smiled. Joenie sat amidst a ring of petals and torn flower heads, the finished chain draped round her neck.\u201CThat\u0027s beautiful, sweetheart. Come over here and let Mummy finish it for you.\u0022\u00A0She tied the ends of the flower chain together, and held up the finished garland for Joenie to see. \u201CThere you go, sweetheart. Can you play with your necklace for two more minutes while Mummy finishes the weeding? Then we can go to Adbas\u0027s house for tea.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle pushed open the gazebo door and stepped into the cinnamon scented gloom. The canvas roof rattled in the wind, the thick padded collar at its peak creaking as it shifted about the slender young Kerm trunk that poked out through the top of the small enclosure. She lay down on her bed, wrapped herself snugly in her heavy woolen cloak and propped a pillow under her head. The Kerm leaves barely even tickled as they brushed against her scalp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;kerbal back\u0026gt; \u0026lt;pleasure\u0026gt; \u0026lt;happiness\u0026gt; \u0026lt;good-right\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle smiled, letting the familiar cascade of aromas wash through her mind. Deftly, she rode the torrent of sensations, artfully placed mental stones diverting the raging flood into well practiced channels. The channels contained the torrent, letting the individual threads of meaning swirl through her mind, buffeting her but not sweeping her away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuffeting...slowing...seeking...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...allowed to find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle twitched under her cloak as her awareness exploded. Her vision shrank down to a pinprick, senses of hearing, touch, taste and, smell expanding exponentially to compensate. In a discomforting wrench of perspective, the proprioception evolved for one small, bipedal body was suddenly stretched vertiginously through hundreds of cubic metres of soil. Before she could pause for breath the pinprick yawned open over a vast, ever-shifting landscape of colours. A vista of Kerm perceptions filtered through kerbal sight to create a single, sanity-saving perspective for her to view its world from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle soared over the mindscape, searching for the breadfruit field. It didn\u0027t take long. The grid of flower beds was as distinctive here as it was to the naked eye, each bed a bold splash of colour against the dappled complexity of the surrounding soil. She sensed her Kerm\u0027s curiosity, felt it tentatively probing the tiny monocultures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;puzzled\u0026gt; \u0026lt;many-things-all-the-same\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHere goes...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle stared intently at the first bed, holding its hues in her mind, memorising their patterns and subtle shades before turning her attention to the bewildering riot of colour that marked the breadfruit field. Slowly but surely, she began to make sense of the apparently random swirls of clashing colour that gradually revealed themselves as intricately cross-linked mosaics. Methodically, she began to isolate the mosaics, disentangling them in her mind\u0027s eye, picking out the dominant pattern , searching for one particular set of colours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen she found them. A small part of the mindscape snapped into sharp focus, the other colours fading slightly, merging into the background. Gerselle stared in delight at the rainbow fringed dapples scattered over the field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EStar poppies - the Kerm\u0027s eye view! But they\u0027re not so important. Deal with the knotweed and hookwort first and see how that works out. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the surface, both weeds were indistinguishable from the background clamour. Gerselle concentrated and \u003Cem\u003Eshifted\u003C/em\u003E deeper down, through the noise. Beneath the surface the twisting carpet of knotweed roots tangled with the hookwort roots, both standing in stark relief against the rest of the soil. Gerselle held the image in her mind and reached out to the Kerm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;curious\u0026gt; \u0026lt;these-things-those-things\u0026gt; \u0026lt;all-the-same\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mindscape shifted out again and this time Gerselle could pick out the subtle knots of colour blanketing the ground. The image flitted back and forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;see\u0026gt; \u0026lt;here-here-same-thing\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle bit her lip and sent a new image.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;puzzled\u0026gt; \u0026lt;things-gone\u0026gt; \u0026lt;why why why why\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarefully, visualising each image as clearly as she knew how, Gerselle tried to explain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe roots appear, accompanied by a picture of a sad kerbal. They disappear and the kerbal smiles. The roots appear - sad kerbal, and disappear - happy kerbal. The image fades out.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EA sunlit field, with nothing but row upon row of ripe breadfruit vines as far as the eye can see. Smiling kerbals picking the breadfruit and eating them.

Although Jonton\u0027s Grove - the fields around his village always...oh.

Now what else was I going to show it. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat on Kerbin is taking him so long!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel shrugged. \u201CNo idea,\u0022\u00A0she replied, \u201CCould be almost anything - he \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E their chief engineer after all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames ground his teeth. \u201CYes - and he\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eour\u003C/em\u003E flight engineer. Not that you\u0027d guess from this farce of a training programme. Checklists changing every week, communications with Foxham flaking out - Kerm\u0027s sake, this is the first day they\u0027ve actually managed to get the simulator working and yet the great Chief Engineer barely deigns to set foot inside it for more than five minutes at a time!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel eyed the glowing light on the comms panel but decided not to mention it. \u003Cem\u003EBesides, he has a point.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI tell you, Sherf - unless things start shaping up, they can take this flight and shove it in a tree, because right now I trust this lot about as far as I can spit a gronnek.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hatch swung open. Wernher climbed into the simulator capsule and took his seat at the engineering station. \u201CSorry to keep you waiting. We were at the pre-staging aborts yes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames nodded tersely. Wernher spotted the open comm loop and pulled his headset on. \u201CSo, shall we get started?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cabin tilted abruptly, pitching up to a simulated launch attitude. Wernher looked bemusedly at the comms panel and tapped his earpiece. \u201CCalzer - can you hear...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was interrupted by a sharp explosion from outside, followed by an unpleasantly oily splattering sound. Sherfel looked up and saw a stream of viscous liquid running down the window. The simulator ground to a halt, sagging forlornly in its frame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly and calmly, James removed his headset, climbed out of the capsule, and walked away. Wernher leapt out of his seat. \u201CIt\u0027s not a problem, James, we can fix...\u0022 Sherfel rested her hand on his shoulder. \u201CDon\u0027t\u0022\u00A0she said quietly. \u201CGive him five minutes, and I\u0027ll go and find him.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton put down his mug of water, wrapped his vines a little more securely about his ankles and waist, and relaxed their grip on his calves and upper legs. Yawning, he braced himself against his trunk, and began his morning exercises. As always, the image in the mirror looked slightly ridiculous, a solemn kerbal face peering back at him from out of his leaf clusters, and a pair of kerbal legs twitching and dancing underneath. \u003Cem\u003EI could do with some of those bungee cords that the kerbonauts use.\u003C/em\u003E He stretched, branches rustling in the morning air, droplets of sweet dew tickling his leaves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun crept over the horizon painting the sky with streaks of watery scarlet. Jonton sensed the first faint warmth on his leaves and closed his eyes, letting his consciousness diffuse outwards, along his root fibres, through the soil, up through his many trunks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun rose above the tree line, lifting the Kerm out of the dawn shadows.

Prickleberry fields over here, breadfruit here, sunfruit there of course. Forest around them all.\u003C/em\u003E He pushed the taste of sunlight and slow tides of rising sap to the back of his mind, letting the rough mental map fill his awareness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnbidden, flecks of colour began to appear. Broken trails of orange meandered across his mindscape, fuzzy and faded at the edges. Dense blue specks gathered around a blob of green, each of them trailing out a thin blue thread behind them. Diffuse clouds of iridiscent multi-hued flecks, too small to see individually but visible through sheer weight of numbers. The map blurred, zooming in towards a single speck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENo. That\u0027s kerbal thinking. Feel, smell, or taste only. Seeing is a crutch - slow and clumsy.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnnoticed, beads of sweat popped out on the kerbal\u0027s face, as Jonton struggled to close his mind\u0027s eye. With an effort, he tore his gaze away from the mindscape, pushed its myriad details away and focused on the void around him. Slowly and deliberately he cleared his mind and, relaxing into his old Keeper training, allowed himself to sink into placid receptivity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne by one, sensations tickled the back of his mind. Tiny threads spun into strands, which twisted into threads. The threads wove themselves into a misty tapestry, perceived for a fleeting second and then gone. Suddenly, Jonton was \u003Cem\u003Eaware\u003C/em\u003E. Aware of the kerbal feet and which way they were pointing, without having to look at them. Aware of the \u003Cem\u003Eweight\u003C/em\u003E of his branches and the way they bent in the wind. Aware of the worms wriggling through the soil around his roots, following the pheromone trails that he had laid down.

Then it slumped, like a puppet with cut strings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton felt the shimmer of changes ripple across the field and sensed the field begin to change in response.

The projectors and screens that normally stood around the capsule were lined up along the opposite wall. The table in the corner was littered with crumb-strewn plates, a coffee jug and other remnants of a hasty breakfast. Under the table a tottering heap of takeaway cartons threatened to spill across the floor. The room stank of leftover food, stale coffee and the metallic tang of grease and hot hydraulics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalzer squatted by the open hatch, toolbox by his side, methodically plugging in cables and closing cable clamps. Tomcas perched on a ladder, screwdriver in hand, peering intently at the main wiring panel fixed atop the capsule roof. Two other kerbals that James didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t recognise, clambered over the simulator frame, checking the hydraulic lines.

There\u0027s a couple of ways it could go though and I\u0027m not quite sure which way will work best yet. The idea for this chapter (not sure how well it came across) was to compare and contrast the standard Keeper-Kerm relationship, where both sides are separate minds, with Jonton\u0027s situation as a single entity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeft to its own devices, a Kerm improves the surrounding soil for its own ends which tends to improve conditions for all surrounding plants (unless they start getting a bit too competitive but that\u0027s a different matter). The Keeper\u0027s role is to guide that process so that it favours certain plants (kerbal crops) over others (weeds). But to do that, the Keeper needs to be able to recognise the weeds as sensed from the Kerm\u0027s perspective. The way to do that is to have control plots of the different weeds that Gerselle can spot from within communion and then ask the Kerm to get rid of anything that looks like the control plot. Maybe that was over-thinking things slightly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E but the notion of planting markers in the real world that can be detected within communion is something that will definitely come up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJonton, on the other hand, is trying to get his head around the idea of effectively being Kerm and Keeper in one. Loose analogy - its the difference between programming in BASIC and programming \u0027next to the metal\u0027 in assembly code. One is relatively easy, the other much less so but ultimately far more powerful. I\u0027ll just leave that hanging there... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecific points: The Whirligig work was supposed to be part of the \u0027KIS does stuff differently\u0027 theme.

James opened his mouth again but closed it as Sherfel gave a tiny, almost imperceptible shake of her head.

Okay, the original \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E was strictly volunteers only, for the very simple reason that we couldn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eafford\u003C/em\u003E to pay ourselves anything. Any cash we scraped together we put towards the next project - ingenuity and scrap metal will only get you so far.\u0022\u00A0A brief smile flitted across his face. \u201CWe gave Genie fits most months, but he usually managed to keep \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E back for bills and food rather than letting us blow it all on rocket fuel.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb pointed at his office window and the factory floor beyond. \u201CWe\u0027re in much the same place today.

The sleep room was still dark, the single, curtained window barely visible as a dim grey blur against a black background. Yawning, he aimed a vicious swipe at the alarm clock and fumbled for the light switch, screwing up his eyes at the sudden glare. The thick wool rug tickled the soles of his feet as he climbed out of bed, retrieved his poncho from its hook and stumbled off to the moss room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time a scrubbed, refreshed, and far more alert James sat down for breakfast, the conversation had already turned to the day\u0027s work. Wilford stood behind the oiled wooden kitchen counter, slicing cold vegetables and pickles. Camrie and Sherfel sat at the matching table, sipping from bowls of steaming hot \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E. Sherfel smiled as she passed him the natas pot and turned back to Wilford.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd if it passes the last round of vibration tests, we should be able to start installing the tanks!\u0022\u00A0Wilford scooped the choppings into an earthenware bowl, and put it on the table in front of Camrie. \u201CWhat about you, Sherf?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027ll be helping Neling upgrade the data feed to Alpha site,\u0022\u00A0said Sherfel, \u201CMaybe taking a look at the connections to Whirligig 2 if I get a minute.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford nodded, \u201CYeah, Calzer\u0027s been talking about that for a while. Be good to have a spare sim up and running.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie snorted. \u201CYou volunteering to scrape the crust off the joints and see what else needs fixing?\u0022\u00A0she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMight just do that, once I\u0027m done with the tanks,\u0022\u00A0said Wilford cheerfully. \u201CPropulsion won\u0027t be finished with the 909 testing until the end of the week anyway.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames added a handful of vegetables to his bowl and ladled the thick grainy natas over the top. \u201C909?\u0022\u00A0he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CService module engine,\u0022\u00A0said Wilford. \u201CAccording to Ornie the main systems passed the stress testing without a hitch, but they\u0027re still qualifying the backup plumbing. Vibration, thermal and hot-fire tests next week, once its integrated with the thrust frame and hooked up to the tanks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel peeled the rind off a pickle slice. \u201CFull duration hot-fire?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYup,\u0022\u00A0said Wilford. \u201Cfor both your main burns.

Just gonna be another big happy day down at the junkyard.\u003C/em\u003E He looked up as a shadow passed by the window. Wilford stood up just as the doorbell rang.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMorning! You folks all set?\u0022\u00A0Edsen poked his head round the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust about,\u0022\u00A0replied Camrie, lifting the \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E jug. \u201CBowl while you\u0027re waiting?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u0027t mind if I do,\u0022\u00A0said Edsen. \u201CCold out there this morning.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsen threaded his car expertly into the parking bay and switched off the motor. His four passengers scrambled out, Sherfel bending over to massage her cramped calves, her breath steaming in the crisp morning air. Kerbals milled around outside the gates, chatting and greeting friends as they arrived. Periodically, small groups broke away from the crowd and headed towards the main warehouse. James checked his watch. \u003Cem\u003EThis is ridiculous - it\u0027s only eight in the morning for Kerm\u0027s sake!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSee you all later!\u0022\u00A0Edsen locked his car and hurried over to Bill and Neling, waving at three more kerbals who had just arrived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027d better go too,\u0022\u00A0said Sherfel. \u201CI\u0027m supposed to be with Neling\u0027s team. She squeezed James\u0027s shoulder, and with a murmured \u0022good luck\u0022, strode away after Edsen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford loosened his scarf. \u201CI don\u0027t know about you,\u0022\u00A0he said to James, \u201Cbut I could do with a coffee to get me started. Coming?\u0022\u00A0He hugged Camrie. \u201CSee you at lunch, love.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe and James made their way through the crowd, angling towards the staff canteen where they were greeted by a cloud of steam and a very peculiar odour. Derny lifted a pot off the stove and set it down on a chopping board. Frowning, he prodded at it\u0027s contents, absently scratching his head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMorning, Derny,\u0022\u00A0said Wilford. He eyed the cluttered worktop curiously. \u201CWe can come back later if you\u0027re still making breakfast.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u0027re welcome to this horrible slop, Wilford,\u0022\u00A0Derny replied, \u201CI wouldn\u0027t bother though. Freeze-dried tuber sounded like a \u003Cem\u003Egreat\u003C/em\u003E idea but it tastes like wet plaster and I just can\u0027t figure the consistency out at all.\u0022He brightened up. \u201CAnyhow - what can I do for you and James?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m just here to grab a coffee,\u0022\u00A0said Wilford. \u201Cbut James\u0027ll be standing in for Jeb this morning.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStarting at the top are you?\u0022\u00A0said Derny. He gestured at the two water heaters fixed to the wall. \u201CThose should be boiling by now, urns are on that trolley over there, everything else is in that cupboard to your left. Biggest urn is for coffee, you\u0027ll be surprised to hear, other two are for \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E and greenleaf. If you could crack on with that, I\u0027ll dump this mess in the bin and clean up. Kettle\u0027s all yours, Wilford.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks.\u0022\u00A0Wilford flicked the kettle on and began rummaging around for a mug. James stared at him expressionlessly, and walked over to the trolley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time Derny put his drying cloth down, steam was rising from the three urns and James was waiting for him, expressionless look still fixed in place. Derny lifted the lid on the coffee urn and sniffed appreciatively. \u201CThat\u0027ll do it,\u0022\u00A0he announced. \u201CMachine shop first, while it\u0027s still fresh, Assembly and Fitting next, then a refill, then Propulsion. The tank teams prefer their coffee with a bit more character, so we\u0027ll leave them till later. Could you get the doors? Cheers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe machine shop was crowded, noisy and redolent of cutting oil, hot metal and overheated kerbals. The smell of hot drinks and the squeak of trolley wheels on concrete still managed to cut through the din with ease. One by one the machines spun down, their operators hanging up their goggles, grabbing a mug from the rack and joining the queue at Derny\u0027s trolley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBob...Ordrie...Adelan\u003C/em\u003E...\u003Cem\u003ERichlin...\u003C/em\u003EJames realised he was staring blankly at the first kerbal in line. \u201CSorry?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCoffee for me please.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh, sure.\u0022James took the proffered mug, filled it and handed it back to its owner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, James.

Eyes narrowing, James filled it with the fragrant brew. \u201CMilk?\u0022\u00A0he managed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot for me.\u0022\u00A0Bob sipped his drink, \u201CAhhhh, that\u0027s a good cup. Thanks, James.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames glanced suspiciously at Bob\u0027s cheerfully guileless face. Beside him, Derny was chatting away to Adelan about the previous night\u0027s net-ball scores. He blinked, automatically taking the next mug being thrust at him and filling it with coffee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn their way out, Derny snapped his fingers. \u201CNearly forgot about Roncott.\u0022\u00A0He swung the trolley round and set off up a narrow corridor of concrete block wall and echoing metal ducts. \u201CNext door on the right, James but for Kerm\u0027s sake knock first. I never know what\u0027s going on in here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCautiously, James rapped on the plain steel door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne minute!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a heavy, trolley-shaking thud, followed by a rattle of chains. The door creaked open and a long haired kerbal peered out, face hidden by a heavy welding mask.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh. Hi, James, hi, Derny. Come on in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames followed him into a long corrugated iron shed. An unwieldy collection of tubing and hydraulic cylinders squatted on a test stand which had been set up at a discreet distance from the door. A large, tattered diagram was taped to the opposite wall and a motley heap of spare parts occupied most of one corner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow\u0027s the new gadget working out, Roncott?\u0022 asked Derny, handing him a mug of greenleaf tea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoncott sighed. \u201CWell it\u0027s working after a fashion,\u201C\u00A0he said, \u201Cbut it\u0027s still far too complicated.\u0022\u00A0He noticed James\u0027s curious look and gestured at the test stand. \u201CIt\u0027s supposed to be a hydraulic separator. In theory it should be more reliable and safer than explosive decoupling.\u0022\u00A0He sipped his tea. \u201CIn theory. I\u0027ve made some improvements to the original design but I\u0027m starting to see why they gave it up as a bad job before Kerbal 1.\u0022\u00A0He looked at James hopefully. \u201CHave you got any ideas?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMe. What on Kerbin do I know about hydraulics? \u003C/em\u003EJames shook his head. \u201CNot at the moment,\u0022\u00A0he said carefully, \u201Cbut I\u0027ll have a think.\u0022\u00A0His heart sank at the happy look on Roncott\u0027s face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat would be great! We should have everything we need here to build any prototypes. Hey, Derny - could I get a top-up before you go?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDerny looked at James sidelong as they walked back along the narrow corridor. \u201CYou could ask around at lunch,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CSomebody can probably think of a way to help the poor lad out and I doubt they\u0027d mind if you pinched the odd idea.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bustling main assembly area provided a welcome distraction. The nearly completed \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E capsule nestled snugly in its protective scaffolding. The surrounding bench tops resembled a high technology slaughterhouse, the electronic and mechanical guts of the spacecraft spread out for all to see. Two kerbals were perched on the scaffolding, installing subsystems in the nose assembly. Others were working at the benches or carrying finished components over to the open capsule hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNearby, another team of workers were busy applying insulation to \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 2\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s crew compartment, the raw metal and exposed frameworks a stark contrast to \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u0027\u003C/em\u003Es streamlined exterior. Some distance away, a skeletal cylinder was beginning to take shape, fuel tanks and other systems stacked up on the surrounding storage racks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDerny tapped James on the shoulder. \u201CI\u0027ll do the trolley work here. You\u0027ll be wanting to have a look around I expect.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames just nodded, his attention already caught by an immense dish, placed well away from the two capsules. Closer to, it resembled a giant piece of honeycomb, the very centre of which was inexplicably decorated with a shaggy fur disc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CResin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames spun round and found himself face to face with yet another familiar face. \u003Cem\u003EOh come off it. Point made Jeb, point made. No need to wheel out every last kerbonaut on the roster! \u003C/em\u003E He blinked. \u201CSorry - Ribory isn\u0027t it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory grinned \u201CThat\u0027s me. And it does look furry doesn\u0027t it? More spiky actually - we fill the cells under pressure and the resin tends to spurt out the top. We machine it down of course, before fitting it to the capsule.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow do you do the filling?\u0022said James curiously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBy hand,\u0022\u00A0said Ribory, \u201CWell sort of. Electric caulking gun, twin reservoir, fixed stroke.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames knelt down to inspect the heat shield. \u003Cem\u003EKerm - they do all this by hand?\u003C/em\u003E He sighed to himself. \u003Cem\u003EBetter than serving coffee for the next umpteen weeks. \u003C/em\u003E\u201CThat\u0027s still a big job,\u0022\u00A0he offered quietly. \u201CI could lend a hand if you\u0027ve got a spare gun?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerfun stamped the snow off his boots and hung his heavy, fur-lined jacket on the nearest peg. He tossed his gloves onto a chair and hurried through to the sleep room. The Kerm branches overhead rustled listlessly at his approach, leaves hanging limp in the gloom. He shivered, neither the fur mosaics decorating the walls, nor the thick drapes across the window helping to dispel the chill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAmbassador.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sour, layered scent of dried sweat clung to the shapeless figure on the bed. Bloodshot eyes gazed steadily at him from a mound of blankets, matted brown hair so entangled with Kerm leaves that it was impossible to tell where Kerm ended and kerbal began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeeper,\u0022\u00A0he replied, \u201CYou have news?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTruly, Ambassador.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn unwelcome chill swept through Jerfun. \u201CTell me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe figure sagged. \u201CAnother Kerm, Ambassador. Near the Valley, perhaps further. It is hard to tell.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou are sure?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe eyes glared at him. \u201CTruly. The patterns are recognisable - twisted, mark you - but recognisable. More to the point, the intruder observes and \u003Cem\u003Elearns\u003C/em\u003E. Unless you know of another learning tree on Kerbin, Ambassador?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI do not. I mean no offence, Keeper, but I will need to verify this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blankets lifted briefly. \u201COf course, Ambassador. And what then?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf you are correct, I see only one possibility,\u0022\u00A0said Jerfun, \u201CEven were I minded to ignore the violation of our borders, my duty is clear.\u0022\u00A0He scowled. \u201CNeither am I inclined to entrust this to the interminable deliberations of Conclave. No, Keeper - if needs must I shall claim the ancient right of all kerbals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe figure nodded. \u201CTruly, Ambassador. I would join you were I not so...required.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wind howled around the ridge, driving thick flurries of snow before it. Jerfun stopped to tighten the drawstrings on his hood. He reached under the lip of his goggles with one gloved finger, scratched his cheek, and settled them back into place. \u003Cem\u003ESo much for tracking\u003C/em\u003E. His rifle bumped awkwardly against his back. \u003Cem\u003EAnd so much for lugging that around. Any scallan, on this hill or the next, will be den-bound by now.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe scowled. \u003Cem\u003EWhich means that the nearest caves are probably occupied. Which means that I\u0027m stuck in this Kerm-forsaken snow unless I\u0027m minded to gamble with finding shelter. Which I am not.\u003C/em\u003E He looked around to get his bearings then, head down, he plodded on, his skis alternately scraping over packed ice and digging into loose drifts of snow with a knee-jolting jerk. Behind him, the snow was already hiding all traces of his passage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA large boulder marked a fork in the trail although by now the path ahead in either direction was completely hidden. Jorfun retrieved a handful of trail mix from his pocket and chewed on it thoughtfully, weighing up his options. To the left, the upper slopes of the ridge stretched out before him, bleak and exposed against the skyline. To the right the path narrowed as it wound down and around the side of the hill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENo choice really. Doubt that anybody\u0027s watching but the tops will be too exposed anyway in this wind.\u003C/em\u003E He bent down and fumbled with his skis, kicking the toes of his boots out of their bindings before lashing the skis together and slinging them over his back. He unhooked a set of crampons from his belt, leaning against the boulder for support as he tied them on. Then he set off down the path, leaning on one ski pole as he went and cautiously probing at the ground with the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe deepening snow lay like a bedspread over the village, deadening all sound. Low slung buildings, built from greystone and slate, hugged the valley floor, thick walls impervious to the inclement weather, heavily shuttered windows keeping in the warmth and the light. Terraced rows of dwellings had been dug into the hillside, front doors protected by stout overhanging eaves. Lamp-posts dotted the terraces, their warm yellow light all but swallowed by the billowing flakes tumbling from the leaden sky. Spindly trees dotted the landscape, skeletally thin branches standing stark against the grey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the hillside above, Jerfun lay flat on his stomach, sweeping the valley with his binoculars. \u003Cem\u003EThought they looked too regular. She was right - that\u0027s\u00A0a new village for sure. An ugly, blocky, \u003C/em\u003EKolan\u003Cem\u003E village to boot.\u003C/em\u003E He clenched his jaw \u003Cem\u003EBreaking our borders, stealing our land and despoiling what few fields we have! \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat last thought brought him up short. \u003Cem\u003ENeed to prove that first. Although I cannot conceive of a new village without a new Kerm.\u003C/em\u003E He panned back across the valley, looking out beyond the village buildings. Then he stopped, fingers tightening in a death grip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENo. She was right about that too.\u003C/em\u003E Painstakingly he scoured the valley, searching for more saplings. \u003Cem\u003ETwenty six...twenty eight...hirty two...one over there makes thirty three,\u00A0and three more in a line over there.\u003C/em\u003E The binoculars tilted down, focusing on the village. \u003Cem\u003EAnd one last one in the middle.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerfun got to his feet. Coldly and deliberately he put his binoculars back in their case, brushed the snow off his jacket and started back up the path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames wiped his cloth over the section of composite and peered critically at the oily film it left behind. He pressed the snub-barrelled ultrasound probe against the surface and squeezed the trigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA warning buzzer sounded, accompanied by the usual flashing red light. James swore to himself, marked the faulty cell with a vicious swipe of his pen, and moved on to the next one. The buzzer sounded again and James threw down the probe in disgust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRibory! This Kerm blighted probe is on the blink!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory hurried over. You sure, James? I only calibrated them this morning. Let me try mine.\u0022\u00A0She unhooked a spare probe from her belt and plugged it into James\u0027s analyser box. \u201CCoupling film looks OK.\u0022\u00A0She pushed the probe against the panel and pulled the trigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBzzzzzz.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory studied the grainy black and white image on the analyser screen. \u201CAhh - there\u0027s your problem.\u00A0She pointed at the screen. \u0022Got a bubble in the middle there. Not a big one, but big enough.\u0022\u00A0She gave James a sympathetic look. \u201CDrill time I\u0027m afraid. Don\u0027t worry about it - it gets easier with practice.\u0022\u00A0She grinned. \u201CReckon I wasted at least a year\u0027s worth of bad language on the Moho 1 shield, but Eve 1 was OK.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames frowned. \u201CYou built your own heat shield?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory looked at him strangely. \u201CI built - or helped to build - \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E of them, James, from Moho 1 upward. Why would I skip over Eve 1? Building your own shield certainly keeps your mind focused on the job, I\u0027ll grant you that, but building one for your best friend or your boss does that too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames digested her words. \u201CMust have been reassuring to have the quality control team checking over it,\u0022\u00A0he said at last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRibory blinked. \u201CWhat quality control team?\u0022\u00A0She waved her ultrasound probe in front of James\u0027s face. \u201CWhy do you think we\u0027re messing about with these? I suppose I could run a probe over your panel once you\u0027re done - and if your probe spits out any readings that you\u0027re not sure about then give me a shout. Apart from that though.\u0022\u00A0She shrugged, \u201CYou\u0027re checked out on the gear, your test piece was fine and you know what you\u0027re doing. You wouldn\u0027t be on the team if I thought I needed to watch over your shoulder the whole time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cold lump settled in the pit of James\u0027s stomach as Ribory picked up her caulking gun and went back to work. \u003Cem\u003ETommal - he\u0027s first in line for Pioneer 2.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stared unseeingly at the analyser screen picturing the superheated plasma hammering at the ablative resin. Just under the surface, the bubble swells, bursts, weakened fragments of resin torn away by the hypersonic slipstream. More plasma rushing in, carving out larger chunks of heat shield, melting the underlying bulkhead. Tommal\u0027s horrified expression as the window buckles, shatters, rips free. The capsule tumbling out of control, breaking up...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAt least I\u0027m not working on the aft shield. Not that it would make much difference.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames swallowed hard, carefully marked the defective cell and picked up his probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWell now - there\u0027s something you don\u0027t see too often.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDondrin stepped out from under the sheltered portico that guarded the entrance to the Capital building. \u003Cem\u003ENorthern Wakiran ceremonial garb I would say, and very traditional it looks too.\u003C/em\u003E He inspected the ornate fur collar more closely. \u003Cem\u003E Poor fellow must be melting under all that. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood afternoon, Ambassador. Dondrin Kerman, Capital News. May I have a moment of your time?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerfun narrowed his eyes and kept walking. \u201CYou may not.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDondrin blinked. \u003Cem\u003ESurly fellow aren\u0027t you.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have an audience with the Twelve Pillars,\u0022\u00A0Jerfun continued. \u201CWhich I intend to put on the public record. For the benefit of all news outlets,\u0022\u00A0he added sardonically. He strode towards the reception desk and, after a brief exchange with the receptionist, marched briskly out of the lobby with Dondrin following at a discreet distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce he\u0027d assured himself that the aloof ambassador was indeed heading for the Council chamber, Dondrin took off for the press gallery at a run. He burst through the door and threw himself into a chair as the Chamber doors thudded shut below. Chief Ambassador Burvis waited at the podium, the remaining Pillars sitting silently around the Council table. Jerfun stood impassively by the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMisters President, mesdames President, honoured chief Ambassadors. We are assembled here today to grant the ancient Right of Conclave. I have answered the petitioner and I deem his request worthy and to be made in sound mind.\u0022\u00A0Burvis inclined her head towards Jerfun, \u201CLet the record note that Ambassador Jerfun stands alone, and that I, Burvis Kermol, beg that the Twelve Pillars give his petition all due consideration and support.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI now call Jerfun Kermol to the podium.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurvis took her place at the table, facing the empty podium. Jerfun walked to the front of the room, bowed to the assembled Pillars and stepped up to the lectern. Burvis cleared her throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo you, Jerfun Kermol, wish to place your petition on the public record?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMadame President, I do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe twelve kerbals at the table sat up a little straighter. One or two of them exchanged brief looks. Up in the press gallery, Dondrin leaned forward intently. Burvis kept her face carefully impassive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBy order of this Council, a petition so placed shall be deemed accurate and inviolable. Any false statement made therein, whether purposeful or inadvertent, does constitute a betrayal of these Twelve Pillars, punishable consecutively, to the fullest extent possible by law, in each of the Six Regionalities of Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDoes now the Petitioner, in full and complete knowledge of the consequences of his actions, wish to place his petition on the public record?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerfun didn\u0027t hesitate. \u201CMadame President, I do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a sudden silence. Twelve pairs of eyes stared unblinkingly at Jerfun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnseen, Burvis\u0027s hands trembled. \u201CThen we beg the Petitioner to speak.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerfun bowed. \u201CMadame President, Mesdames President, Misters President, honoured Chief Ambassadors. I, Jerfun Kermol, thank you for granting this Right of Conclave.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe gripped the edge of the lectern. \u201CI claim this right that I may bring the gravest of news to this Council. I For I have witnessed a breach of the sovereign borders of the Regionality of Wakira, and a breach of Grove Law.\u0022\u00A0Jerfun paused. I refer specifically to the Law of Territory...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anyway, g\u0027night, guys. Try and get some sleep - Gene\u0027ll get nervous if you yawn your way through the countdown.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe door clicked shut, leaving James and Sherfel alone. James stared into the lamplight, his chair creaking as he rocked back and forth. Sherfel scrunched herself deeper into the couch and picked up her book. She stared unseeingly at her page for a long moment and then put it down again. James\u0027s head tilted towards her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wonder if anyone else is still awake?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel didn\u0027t need to ask where. \u0022Jeb will be,\u0022 she answered. \u0022According to Wilford he never sleeps the night before a flight. Gene too probably and I doubt they\u0027re the only ones. What about you, Jim? Restless night ahead?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames propped his chin on his hands. \u0022If you\u0027d asked me that a couple of months ago... but right now I\u0027ve got a pretty good feeling about it. I still think Jeb runs a strange crew and they can still be...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Haphazard?\u0022 suggested Sherfel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Infuriating was the word I was looking for.\u0022 James was silent for a moment. \u0022After working on Tommal\u0027s heat shield though - yeah, I don\u0027t have any worries about their engineering.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel laughed softly. \u0022You get used to it don\u0027t you?\u0022 She chuckled at James\u0027s questioning look. \u0022\u003Cem\u003ETommal\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E heat shield you said, Jim. Not Pioneer 2\u0027s.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames looked at her thoughtfully. \u0022I did, didn\u0027t I? That personal touch sure makes all the difference though.\u0022\u00A0He shook his head. \u201CThat\u0027s what their whole program depends on when you get right down to it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel rolled her eyes. \u0022I thought pilots were supposed to be observant. You missed the part where every kerbonaut they\u0027ve launched either works in Mission Control, or builds part of their spacecraft or does something else in the program...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Including making coffee and mopping the floors,\u0022 said James. \u0022That \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E threw me that first day. Nobody seemed the slightest bit amused - or even surprised - that I was trailing along behind Derny with the coffee trolley.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Speaking of Derny,\u0022 said Sherfel, \u0022I think I\u0027ve finally figured out what to do with his freeze-dried tubers. Remind me to tell him next week.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames grinned. \u0022You get used to that too, don\u0027t you? That\u0027s one thing I do like about being here - if you\u0027ve got a problem, you can guarantee that somebody else is working on it too - and won\u0027t stop until its fixed. Not that Rockomax is any different of course, but it\u0027s something else that feels more personal here.\u0022 He leaned back in his chair. \u201CWhich is probably why I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E worried about sleeping tonight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022... and we\u0027ll be bringing you more on this story as it develops. This is Capital News at Ten.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb switched off the television and stared wide-eyed at Geneney. \u0022So what do we do now, Genie?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney ran his fingers through his hair. \u0022I don\u0027t know,\u0022 he said at last, \u0022If this \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E what they think...it could get ugly, Jeb. Really, really ugly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And then some,\u0022 said Jeb, \u0022It\u0027ll be the end of the program, Genie, if things get that bad. Who\u0027s going to care about spaceflight if their Groves are going up in flames or down with the Blight, or...\u0022 His voice tailed away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh I think plenty of people will, Jeb,\u0022 said Geneney grimly. \u0022Except that the rockets won\u0027t be going very far - and they won\u0027t have capsules on top either.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sat bolt upright. \u201CWell they can pillage \u003Cem\u003Ethose\u003C/em\u003E rockets from some other spaceship parts company,\u0022\u00A0he said flatly. \u201CDecision made, Gene. I\u0027ll ring Ademone now. If Rockomax are still in, we call a general meeting first thing tomorrow morning. Anybody that wants to go back to their Groves, or bail out for any other reason, goes with our sincere thanks and best wishes. If enough of the team are left - we launch! Too bad we never got to build the lander but If this ends up being our final flight, then lets give them all a glimpse of what should have been.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-116-blackout/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=1683751\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 41\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-116-blackout/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=1721507\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 43\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-29T14:21:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2020 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T20:05:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EA Voyage for the Ages\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApart from the last minute furore, thought Wernher, the launch preparations had been surprisingly similar to \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E. The lines of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E members outside the warehouse to see them off; the ride to the Space Centre in Ornie\u0027s truck; climbing onto the back of the truck out of sight of the crowds; waving to those same crowds as they drove past the stands and out to the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAnd here I am again, standing on the gantry outside a three kerbal capsule, waiting for Bob to give the word.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stared down over the gantry rail at \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u0027\u003C/em\u003Es gleaming white flanks, which as usual were resplendent with sponsor\u0027s logos. From this height, only the chunky blue R and stylised silver engine nozzle of Rockomax\u0027s new logo were visible, proudly emblazoned on each lateral booster. The remaining letters and the tail end of their \u201CThink Better - Think Bigger!\u0022\u00A0slogan were hidden by perspective and distance. Far below that the engines waited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the distance, the Space Centre buildings stood silhouetted against the cloudless morning sky. Sunlight twinkled off the corrugated steel cladding of the Vehicle Assembly Building, squat and blocky at the end of the newly laid strip of asphalt linking it to the launch pad. The pad itself was deathly silent. By now, most of the engineers were safely ensconced within the launch bunker, and even the flocks of birds that usually made the gantries their home were nowhere to be seen, or heard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI wonder if they know something I don\u0027t.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ring of work boots on steel brought him back to the present, as Bob climbed out of the hatch and joined him by the rail. The rest of the pad team stood back at a respectful distance. For a moment the two friends gazed silently across the deserted launch site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob cleared his throat, \u201CWernher?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher gestured at the nose cone far beneath them. \u201CThere are three LV-T20s down there, Bob. The breakthrough that launched Jeb into orbit and we\u0027ll be discarding them less than three minutes into the flight.\u0022\u00A0The chief engineer stared down at the distant launch pad. \u201CYou know the LV-T30 is more powerful than the entire Moho stack?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob nodded patiently. \u201CAnd Pioneer needs three of them just to get off the ground. I know, Wernher.\u0022\u00A0He grinned at a sudden memory, \u201CI\u0027d rather be sitting on top of three LV-T30s than one LV-15 and a pile of Trashcans though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher snorted. \u201CIndeed.\u0022\u00A0He shook his head. \u201CDear Kerm - what were we \u003Cem\u003Ethinking\u003C/em\u003E? Putting you, Bill, and Jeb inside that contraption.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob squeezed his shoulder. \u201COr you, Lucan, and Gene, for that matter.\u0022\u00A0He tapped his headset. \u201CJim and Sherf are all set, Wernher. Time to go join them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded resolutely, handed his spacesuit helmet to Bob, and strode over to the open hatch. Gripping the hand rails tightly, he swung himself down into the capsule, manoeuvring his bulky spacesuit through the narrow gap. Sherfel grinned at him through her transparent helmet. James turned his head, nodded briefly, then turned his attention back to the instrument panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as he\u0027d settled into his acceleration couch, Bob climbed into the capsule after him. Wernher watched him work, quietly shifting from side to side in his seat to let him reach all the assorted ports, plugs and sockets of the life-support and communication systems. He grunted as Bob tightened the couch harness, checking that the straps were all lying flat. Satisfied, Bob lifted Wernher\u0027s helmet into place, and locked it in place against the neck ring of his suit. He rapped on the transparent bubble for luck, flashed Wernher a quick grin, and plugged his headset into the auxiliary comms port on the side of capsule instrument panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u0027re looking good, folks.

Good luck.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hatch swung shut and locked with a clunk. Wernher switched his headset on and surveyed the the profusion of switches, buttons, dials and other readouts laid out in front of him. Defining a logical structure and arrangement for the myriad controls had been the hardest part of designing the \u003Cem\u003EEve\u003C/em\u003E capsule that \u003Cem\u003EPioneer\u003C/em\u003E was based on. \u003Cem\u003E Even so,\u003C/em\u003E Wernher thought, \u003Cem\u003E the pilots and the capsule systems team managed to hammer out the basic layout remarkably quickly. Another point in favour of Jeb\u0027s management style.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stretched his legs out, nodding in satisfaction as his boots hit the capsule bulkhead. \u003Cem\u003EGood legroom. Compared to Kerbal 2 at any rate.\u003C/em\u003E A sudden draft from the capsule fans riffled the pages of his checklist book, as the environmental systems kicked in, purging the cabin atmosphere and replacing it with a flight ready, oxygen-nitrogen mix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe clicked his microphone on. \u201CFlight, Pioneer 1. Purge complete, atmosphere composition is good. Monitoring capsule pressure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene\u0027s voice was as matter-of-fact as always. \u201CCopy, Wernher. CapSys reports clean contact on all hatch bolts - please confirm.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u0027s eyes flicked to the hatch and back to the control panel. \u201CConfirmed, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, Wernher.

Wernher saw his lips moving behind his bubble helmet as he paged through his checklist. The main air to ground loop cut in with a burst of static.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAdvisory panels one through three are good, Flight.

The capsule was quiet, his acceleration couch had moulded itself comfortably around his suit, and the droning fans of the environmental system were almost soporific.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher shook his head sharply, hoping that Sherfel and James hadn\u0027t seen him. \u003Cem\u003EI\u0027m sure Jeb would be highly amused if I fell asleep atop of a fully fuelled M\u00FCn rocket, but I doubt that my two colleagues here would be too impressed.

CapSys says we\u0027re Go for the reentry battery test.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher sighed inwardly at the undercurrent of dry amusement in Gene\u0027s voice. \u003Cem\u003EThe joy of suits with medical sensors.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Flight,\u0022\u00A0he replied. \u201CBuses A and B transferred to batteries. Ready for external power off.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fans stuttered, and the capsule lighting flickered briefly before settling down again. Wernher scanned his system readouts - beside him, James and Sherfel checked their own sections of the control panel. All three kerbonauts reported a successful test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe see it too, Pioneer. Reconnecting external power. Guidance is ready for the SME gimbal test.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher flipped a pair of switches, disconnecting the reentry batteries from the capsule power systems, turned to the Service Module Engine panel and threw another set of switches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGimbal motors drawing power. Confirm hand controllers to TEST?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames gripped the two controllers. \u201CControllers to TEST, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E override ON.\u0022 He carefully tested their range of movement, watching his nav-ball tilt and roll in response. After each deflection, he waited whilst Pioneer 1\u0027s onboard computer attempted to re-centre the gimbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYaw gimbal tracking confirmed...pitch tracking is good...roll tracking confirmed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy, Pioneer,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney. \u201COK guys, break until KDS confirmation from Foxham. Moving gantry systems to standby and holding countdown at T minus thirty\u00A0minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney drummed his fingers on the edge of his console, willing the phone to ring. Around him, fidgeting flight controllers flicked through logbooks and swung back and forth on their chairs, sneaking surreptitious glances at his console. The open communication loop to \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E filled the room with a faint hiss of static, the crew as quiet as their controllers. Above their heads, the countdown clock was poised at T minus thirty minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA controller coughed. Geneney paged his headset from one loop to the next, eventually settling on the public link from the KBS commentary box. Leland was busy running through the countdown, explaining the current hold to the crowds in the stands and, Geneney noted, describing the Rockomax payload as a docking target.\u003Cem\u003EWe did a good job keeping this flight quiet but Leland is pretty sharp. Maybe he\u0027s just playing along.\u003C/em\u003E He clicked his headset back onto the air-to-ground loop. \u003Cem\u003EStill nothing from the capsule unless you count heavy breathing.\u003C/em\u003E He switched over to the Life Support console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLife Support, Flight. Everything OK in there, Ribory?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey\u0027re fine, Flight. Picking up elevated heartbeat readings for Wernher - nothing serious - but the other two could be tucked up in bed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, Jim and Sherf are pretty level headed.

Inside the capsule, Wernher lay flat on his back, swaddled in a discordant, shrieking cocoon of sound.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENow\u003C/em\u003E this\u003Cem\u003E is what I call a rocket ship!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis head sank back into his acceleration couch, eyes still level with the control panel, which was reassuringly free of warning lights, despite the shaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd \u003Cem\u003EI can still see the instruments.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove his head something began to rattle. The broad grin on his face slipped a notch and he reflexively searched the capsule for loose equipment. Then the engine noise abruptly shifted pitch, before everything went suddenly quiet. James\u0027s unperturbed voice filled his ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flight, Pioneer 1.

Guidance is green, pitch and roll is Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher heard the couch frame creak and grunted under the growing weight on his chest, squinting at the blurred displays on the vibrating instrument panel. The flight clock clicked past the two minute mark, and he slowly lifted one arm, fighting to hold it steady against the g forces, finger aimed at the LB-JETT button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Decouplers A through C armed. Go for T20 shutdown and detach.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe LV-T20s flamed out. Wernher\u0027s stomach lurched as the sudden drop in acceleration flung him against his harness. Three lights blinked out in front of him, a curiously muffled bang marking the departure of the lateral boosters. Relieved, Wernher let his arm drop back onto his couch. The capsule was still shaking but now the vibrations were smoother, a deep seated, soothing rumble replacing than the bone jarring discord of launch. A distant part of his mind noticed that the mysterious rattling hadn\u0027t returned, and was glad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe velocity and altitude displays on the instrument panel raced upwards. Wernher felt his weight shift, harness straps pulling on his shoulders as \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E gradually heeled over along its pre-programmed flight path. Then his heart soared at the sudden announcement from Mission Control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thirty-six kilometres. Pioneer 1 - your trajectory and guidance are Go!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf James was surprised at the unexpected altitude check, it didn\u0027t show in his voice. \u0022Flight, Pioneer 1.

She glanced at him and smiled at his exultant expression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EShadows slowly drifted over the \u003C/em\u003EKerbal 2\u003Cem\u003Eas it coasted onwards, lit from beneath by the bright glow of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. It rocked slightly as it reached the top of its thirty-five kilometre high arc and started the long descent. Wernher could hear a gradually increasing thrumming noise from outside the capsule as it dropped back into thicker air.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot today we don\u0027t\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher snapped out of his reverie thankful that neither the rest of the crew, nor Mission Control chose to comment on his outburst. Flushing, he checked the instrument panel, nodding in satisfaction as he keyed his microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flight, Pioneer 1.

Requesting braking burn check.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeart still pounding with adrenalin, Wernher forced himself to breath in through his nose. Raw, unfiltered sunlight washed through the capsule side window and over the legs of his spacesuit. The view through the smaller rendezvous window above his head was a uniform inky black, and for a moment he wished he was in James\u0027s seat and able to snatch a glimpse of Kerbin outside. Experimentally, he lifted his arm and grinned in delight as it hung effortlessly in front of him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good burn, Pioneer. Go for plane alignment at FET five four dot three zero.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher glanced at the flight clock, currently showing a flight elapsed time of just over eighteen minutes. Solenoids thumped open and the sunlight drifted slowly over his legs as James manoeuvred \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E into position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPlane matching on the first orbit.

Shorter bursts of flame tipped it back over, pointing its nose along its direction of flight and aiming it squarely at a shining point of light in the distance. The point drifted closer, first becoming a disc and then gradually resolving itself into a slender, gleaming tube. \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E slowed, thrusters flickering as they delicately edged the capsule into position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPioneer 1, Flight. Go for docking.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames nudged his hand controllers. Outside the window, the immense silver tube drifted towards them. There was a faint bump, followed by the staccato rattle of docking clamps slamming shut. Readouts lit up across the instrument panel and James sighed with relief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Pioneer 1.

Wernher grunted in reply, already busy at the engineering station. Satisfied, James turned to his own section of the instrument panel and flipped his checklist over to the next page.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher looked up from his instruments and glanced at his fellow crew members. Sherfel stared straight ahead through the rendezvous windows. James glanced back at him and nodded fractionally. For a moment, there was silence, each kerbonaut all too aware of what that silence meant. Then Wernher cleared his throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Everything looks good from here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guidance platform is Go,\u0022 replied Sherfel quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames simply leaned forward and clicked a single switch. \u0022Flight, Pioneer 1.

Geneney just dipped his head and deliberately stepped back from his console. Jeb nodded in quiet thanks, and took his place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pioneer, this is Jeb.

One by one, each of them raised a thumb. He braced himself, made a note on Geneney\u0027s flight log, and clicked his microphone on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022OK, Pioneer, I\u0027ve got a roomful of kerbals here telling me you\u0027re looking good.\u0022 Jeb paused, shifting into Geneney\u0027s formal flight director\u0027s tones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pioneer 1, you are Go for TMI.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy, Flight.

What d\u0027yeh reckon they stuck on it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnother rocket,\u0022\u00A0said Fercan simply, \u201CUnless you can think of any other way they could boost up to ten kps.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo joke,\u0022\u00A0said Fercan, \u201CI\u0027m going to rough out a trajectory before calling him, but I think the Director needs to know about this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COch, come on,\u0022\u00A0said Corvan, \u201CThere\u0027s only one place they\u0027re going.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know,\u0022\u00A0said Fercan softly, \u201CStill want the rough numbers before going to Lodan though. We\u0027ve got their final speed, launch time, and when they started the burn. That should be enough to tell us whether we\u0027re both reading too much into this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHmph. Time to call in that favour from Germore\u0027s team I reckon. A bit of time on their dish should help you firm up those numbers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFercan stared at the plots on her screen. \u003Cem\u003EToo many unknowns for a proper calculation, but yeah - there\u0027s only one place they\u0027re going. \u003C/em\u003E She grinned, as she picked up the phone and started to dial. \u003Cem\u003EAnd I\u0027ve wanted to do this for a long, long time!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe phone rang.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLodan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFercan here, Director. We\u0027re tracking an outbound spacecraft from low Kerbin orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan sat up straight. \u201C\u003Cem\u003EOutbound?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYessir. Trans-Munar trajectory.\u0022\u00A0A pause. \u201CWe\u0027re picking up voice comms, sir - it\u0027s Pioneer 1.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan took a deep breath. \u201CThank you, Fercan. I shall be down at Tracking shortly. Please keep me informed of any developments in the meantime.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbsolutely, sir!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe phone dropped onto its cradle with a faint click. Lodan looked at it curiously for a second then slammed both fists down onto his desk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDammit, Ademone! I gave you that funding to keep those \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E idiots in check: stop them pulling any more damn-fool stunts!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe waste paper basket ricocheted off the wall, scattering its contents across the carpet. Lodan threw himself back in his chair, making it creak in protest, \u201CI hope to all the Kerm that you bring your ship of happy fools home in one piece, Ademone! Kerbin \u003Cem\u003Eneeds\u003C/em\u003E this program and sending three corpses around the Mun is not going to help!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland frowned. \u003Cem\u003EWhy switch flight directors before a burn? That doesn\u0027t make any sense. \u003C/em\u003E He watched all the controllers slowly give Jeb the thumbs up. \u003Cem\u003EAnd neither does that. What on Kerbin is going on here?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPioneer 1, you are Go for TMI.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland frowned. Something about that sounded familiar. Then his jaw dropped. He shoved his microphone at his astonished camera operator and bolted for the press room door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGet this, Don! If you love your job, get every last minute of this!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe press room was empty: no smell of day old coffee from the stove, nobody asleep on the threadbare couches, nobody on the phones or sitting writing up their articles. Leland hurled himself across the room, grabbed the nearest phone and punched in a number.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe phone rang.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKBS News. Jonbo here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJon - it\u0027s Leland! No time to talk - need to get back to Mission Control, but I\u0027m gonna need a second crew here! And send another one over to Foxham - get them to Rockomax before anybody else does! And a research team on those kerbonauts - we\u0027ll want the family interest angle!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbo\u0027s voice sounded dangerously calm. \u201CAnd why would I want to do that, Leland? You don\u0027t think that maybe, just maybe, we\u0027ve got other news to cover right now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJon - have you been watching my broadcast? Didn\u0027t you hear what Jeb said?!\u0022 Leland\u0027s voice cracked. \u201CWe\u0027ve got a hero story here, Jon - and that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E what everyone needs right now!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbo sighed. \u201CI\u0027m watching you, Leland, but for one damn moment, just pretend that I haven\u0027t been following the space program, and that I have no idea what Jebediah was talking about. It shouldn\u0027t\u00A0be too hard. Now for the love of your mother\u0027s Grove, will you please tell me what on Kerbin is going on?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s just the point, Jon. This isn\u0027t\u00A0anything to do with Kerbin.\u0022 Leland paused. \u201CTMI. Trans-Munar Injection.
