I got it very quickly after it came out and I\u0027ve only very recently started building complex space stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my attempt to build a rather complicated space station for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E life support I\u0027ve noticed that it is nearly impossible to double or triple, or quadruple dock docking ports. Yes, I am using stock docking ports\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first problem with this of course is that if one docking port is docked to another than the entire vessel counts as docked and this prevents any other docking ports from finishing their dock. But, that isn\u0027t the issue this particular suggestion is about.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlease, could we have a\u00A0 \u0022glue\u0022 option? Or at least a better root option.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn my attempt to build a complicated space station I\u0027ve noticed that it is really hard to get three docking ports on multiple arms to be the same length apart. Particularly if these are attached across multiple pieces and are different sizes of ports (In my case SRs versus regular ports). This makes it practically impossible sometimes to get docking ports lined up in such a way that multiple ones even stand a *chance* of docking together.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe simplest thing to do here would be to give a simple tool to \u0022glue\u0022 one part to another. The tool would allow us to stick one part that might not be the right length in position then \u0022glue\u0022 it to the part you need it attached to in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E such that a player could launch the intact piece and *know* for certain that the docking ports are in the right place.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCurrently, the best possible is to either twiddle around with the sliders which doesn\u0027t always work, or to\u00A0do this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WuS9Xjp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WuS9Xjp.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is clearly not going to work. Sometimes the increments on the slider snap are too large. Sometimes too small. And sometimes no matter how much you tweak it by hand it\u0027s just not gonna get to the right place.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis leaves the next best thing for me to do to put that front docking port on the docking port on the central hub and somehow connect it to that top module. But this is impossible with the current tools. At least, impossible for what I am trying to do. Yes, I could get the parts in the top of the image connected together rather easily, but then the ports on the bottom truss section would be the wrong length and out of position themselves, which doesn\u0027t work for my station design.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, as I said, the next best thing is to do this:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EEyPNj6.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EEyPNj6.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich doesn\u0027t work. It doesn\u0027t work because it is literally impossible to connect those three pieces to the middle module on the right. No matter what combination of root trickery I try to do. Same goes for the other hub on the far right.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis issue has plagued me not just on this station, but also on a simpler design as well. I had a design for a nuclear rocket engine assembly that I would launch with a space plane in sections. But in order to get the whole thing up in the space-plane I needed to break the 8 small fuel tanks off and launch them separately. And in order to ensure structural rigidity I attached two docking ports to each of the small fuel tanks. Which, again, was very tricky to do because there was no way of knowing 100% for sure that the docking ports would be aligned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForum threads when googling this issue all inevitably say \u0022If you need structural rigidity then use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E struts\u0022. This would work for me as I\u0027m playing with mods already. But there are plenty of players that play stock only, and the lack of functionality to attach that set of parts to the right can really throw a wrench in complex docking port design.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003ESo, the proposal pet, get to the point.\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdd a better glue/root function.

Also, they\u0027re made out of tubes and the docking port seniors. There\u0027s also the added issue of the ends of the habitation modules (that center module) having several different snap points. One of them being flat, the other being conical. Still, yes, this is solved with the slider. But I just realized that this wouldn\u0027t entirely work because the conical bit extends out in front of the docking port, so it would be clipping. And thus, on launch, would be colliding.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can\u0027t move the docking tube\u002Bport forward on the left section because the left section \u002B trusses is already in orbit and the right section and all the hab modules is the new module. I could scoot the docking port forward off of the flat attatchment point, but this then adds an ugly gap in a different place. Which I guess could be solved with a little bit of clipping, but, again, isn\u0027t that pretty.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can scoot the tube\u002Bdocking port forward to the exact spot on the left hub as this would then be the correct placement, but then I run into this issue:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228dAIWtK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8dAIWtK.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MvxsiSa.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MvxsiSa.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is impossible to solve by re-routing. Obviously I can\u0027t attach the tube \u002B docking port to the center and then launch it because then it would be clipping with the right hub instead. And I spent the better part of 4 hours trying to figure out a way to re-route it with a fancy pattern of clicks.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow I realize that it would be possible to instead attach the thing to the right hub then scoot the tube forward and that would work. But, again, I\u0027d prefer it if I could get them exactly aligned for the sake of performance and ensuring that they connect. And, yes, I did re-route the whole structure to the right hub.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for not cloning the far side. The two top and bottom modules are different parts.
