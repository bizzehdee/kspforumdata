Often times, their size makes my ships top-heavy and messes with the aerodynamics and stuff and I can barely keep them stable even with upgraded fins and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried just about every combination of engines and fuel tank parts to pull these things into orbit with no such luck. Is there something I am doing on? Should I be skipping these missions until I have upgraded better parts? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Early access to something like the Poodle could make sending larger missions to other planets easier when the Terrier alone wouldn\u2019t be enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, check the tech tree- is the part in a tech node you\u2019ll unlock soon? Would being able to access it earlier make things easier for you in the short term so that you could complete the contract later on? If the part is in an expensive tech node or one locked behind an R\u0026amp;D upgrade, consider taking the contract even if the conditions are a bit weird (Thumper to the Mun or Minmus, for example) as getting access to that part we\u2019ll ahead of time is more valuable than the contract itself.
