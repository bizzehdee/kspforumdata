Also, with out knowing what exactly the issue is, are you failing to at least rendezvous with your intended docking target or are you getting to the rendezvous and then cant dock? It honestly does take a supreme effort to learn to do. Also, make sure you launch into the right window, say for example you have a ship on orbit at 200km up and its on the Equator and you are prepping a launch. You have 2 choices here. 1 is easy, the other, is not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. wait for the target to be about 20-30 degrees to your west and then launch, at which point, take your AP HIGHER than your target so your sub-orbital path crosses twice, at some point in that arc, if you timed it right and held the same inclination and so forth, you should cross into your object and can go for rendezvous then \u0026lt;this can be the hard way if you fail to time it right, or can be easy depending on luck\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Do the same as above, with a bit of a change, instead of going for a direct intercept while sub orbital, you take it to a full orbit either above your target, which makes you SLOWER than it, or below, which makes you quicker, and then, set up a node to either raise up into or descend down into the targets path. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeither way, once you have an intercept set up, get to about 1.5 to 2km from the target and 0 your relative speed and move in for the docking at 1 m/s closing rate until you are say 10-20 meters out then slow to .5 m/s to take it to about 2 meters then drop to .2 m/s and dock. BUT, above all: practice!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T05:05:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking is all about getting your head around the core ideas of celestial mechanics... in real life. In the game, you have a plethora of useful tools that can effectively reduce it to an afterthought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Getting an intercept - The maneuver node and targeting systems are tailor-made for this. Target the ship you want to dock with, then set up a maneuver node and adjust it so that you get an intercept with it. It helps when the two vessels have at least somewhat similar orbits, of course... Anything within 1KM is plenty close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Closing the gap - Once you\u0027re about a minute from intercept, set the navball to Target (it\u0027s usually set to Orbit or Surface; just click that text to change it), pull up the map screen and start thrusting towards the retrograde (yellow X) marker. Adjust your thrust so that the time to intercept is somewhere between 20 and 50 seconds by the time you\u0027re down to 1m/s. Advanced tip: if you fire equidistantly from the pink dot in the direction that the yellow X is but on the far side of the yellow X and pink dot, you\u0027ll push the yellow X closer to the pink dot, making your intercept even closer!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Final intercept - By the time you get down to 1m/s, you\u0027ve usually got a pretty close lock on your target. Flip your ship around and use RCS to accelerate as needed to get to it faster, keeping the prograde (yellow circle) marker over the pink circular marker. Time acceleration really helps speed this along. Try to keep your speed no faster than 1m/s per 50 meters of distance left to cover, and slow to 0.2 to 0.3m/s by the time you get within 50 meters. This is also the time to select your target docking port on the ship you want to dock with and select Set Target, as well as choosing Control from Here on the docking port on the incoming ship which you want to dock with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Docking adjustment - If the port\u0027s not straight ahead, switch camera to Chase mode (hit V to switch modes), and adjust your heading so you can get closer. The translation controls (IJKLNH) are very helpful for this. Your ultimate goal is to get it so that the pink circle is right in front of you, and then get the yellow circle right in the center of that going between 0.1 and 0.3m/s. The game takes it from there, assuming your craft are not unbalanced and don\u0027t drift.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stelith61","CreatedById":58699,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T05:07:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ae35unit\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ae35unit\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not 13...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are you trying to imply here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first docking was when I \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E 13, and Mechjeb didn\u0027t even have an autodocker.
