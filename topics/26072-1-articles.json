For example, when I get to Duna\u0027s SOI I\u0027m usually somewhere between 30 and 40 million kilometers away and then I need to burn over 1k dV to to the atmosphere to perform aerobraking. I\u0027m guessing that I should do some corrections before I get into SOI, but at which point? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it seems that maneuver planner does not work correctly when successive revolutions trajectories are close together but not exactly the same, so it makes it difficult to plan any corrections before entering the SOI. Any tips?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T04:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a line in the settings file you can change from \u0022CONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 3\u0022 to \u0022CONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 0\u0022. You will then see the project path your ship will take, depicted within the target world\u0027s SOI. You can then set a manuever node long before you arrive there, move the node direction markers around, and find a couse correction that will bring you close to the world upon arrival.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T07:41:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA lot of people recommend halfway there, ie halfway from the burn to the intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact the best time is the same time you do the transfer burn. However it\u0027s extremely difficult to work out where you are when you have the encounter due to the camera controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManeuver nodes help in that you can set one up and play around trying to get it right without using fuel. I will actually spend a fair amount of time trying to set up a reasonable encounter before even burning, and generally get close to what I set up. I\u0027ll then do another burn around 15 days from the SOI transfer if I think I need it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don\u0027t have time acceleration running when the SOI change happens, and the predicted periapsis doesn\u0027t change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falofonos","CreatedById":57821,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T08:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe earlier you make your course correction burn, the less deltaV you need but the less accurate the prediction will be on the map. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally your orbit intercept should be at kerbol periapsis so that orbital velocity around Kerbol is as close to Duna\u0027s as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make as many correction burns as you need, tweaking to get a first path that skims the upper duna atmosphere would be worth the fuel spent earlier to get a little aerobreaking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T13:30:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe default maneuver node editor is really tough to use for fine tuning transfer orbits like this. It tends to close and be hard to reopen, it hard to make very small changes (sometimes 0.05 m/s changes make a big difference when you are so far away), and, like you mentioned, when you have closely overlapping orbits you have to be careful to set the node for your current orbit, not the next one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in general I just try to get an encounter with the initial burn. Usually I am a little above or below the planets orbit, so there is an ascending or descending node somewhere along the way. That\u0027s a good place to do your correction burn (if it\u0027s not too close to the target planet). Sometimes just a tiny adjustment in your inclination can get you much closer to the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes when I get tired of dealing with nodes I just do little random burns to get as close as I can. Just point in a random direction, throttle up to maybe 3-5% and see whether your periapsis around the target planet increases or decreases, it usually increases. I generally only do this with RCS, or ion engines, but if you are careful and persistant you can get really close.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nyksy","CreatedById":63698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T16:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks you for the answers.

By using MechJeb to align my craft in the cardinal directions, I just use a little trial and error to adjust my intercept. Typically I\u0027ll watch the approach distance/periapse and burn prograde/retrograde as necessary until I can\u0027t get it any lower, then I\u0027ll re-orient the ship radially and do the same thing, and then back to prograde/retrograde and so on until I\u0027ve gotten as low as I can.
