I tried it on my SSD and just moved it back since the difference was minimal and I mostly use it for the OS since it\u0027s only 64Gb. If you\u0027re getting one though it\u0027s just another upside. Generally though games that have larger textures to render will be where you see a bigger difference as it will cut down pop in on most games. Unfortunately KSP is directly CPU limited by the engine so nothing will really get you a big boost other than a processor with an enormous clock speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barklight","CreatedById":57723,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T14:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can second this. I run KSP (and a few other games) on my 120GB ssd and it does improve the load times quite a bit - KSP loads in about half as much time as it does on my 7200RPM platter drive... But the gameplay itself doesn\u0027t get any faster. That\u0027s dependant on the CPU, GPU, and Unity Engine restrictions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluesteel","CreatedById":9256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T14:58:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can second the above comment, but where it does make a difference is windows boot times and overall system response I have an old Intel 510 drive, so not the quickest.

Without it, your not going to be doing much of anything with your PC. Quibble over whether or not a flashdrive or CD counts, but the storage that holds your OS is critical to your user experience. If it does a horrible job, then no matter how well the rest functions, your not going to have a good time of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn SSD opens that door so wide that if you\u0027ve never experienced it, you can\u0027t really understand it either, its just over the top in comparison.
