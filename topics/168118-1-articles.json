Because the latter won\u0027t help you at all. Dres is too inclined and too small.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, to do a gravity assist, you aim at another quite heavy body to slow you down or speed up, instead of direct transfer. For Laythe, set your maneuver, let\u0027s say, to Tylo, and do some fine-tuning so you won\u0027t end up on escape trajectory from Jool, but get a capture instead.Once in Jool orbit, you can do it multiple times so you won\u0027t swing past Laythe at 3km/s or so. I\u0027ve done that few times, all manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the efficiency: yes it is efficient, but, in much bigger scale, more time consuming.

Dres -\u0026gt; Jool slingshot, there are two common slingshots that are used to get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) As Aegolius described, use Tylo to brake yourself into Jool orbit. While your initial orbit afterwards will be highly elliptical, you can then set up further gravity assists to brake yourself down into a more circular orbit. If you want to practice this first, you might try using Ike to gravity brake into Duna orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Inner-planet slingshots. Using a KEKKJ (Kerbin Eve Kerbin Kerbin Jool) window, you can get out to Jool for around 1100 m/sec, little more than the initial transfer to Eve. The simplest path that gives significant \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E savings would be the KKJ path, costing around 1550 m/sec.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo execute a KKJ path: your initial ejection from Kerbin should have an orbital period of 2 Kerbin years, resulting in an apoapsis around 2.17x Kerbin\u0027s orbital radius. This means that, when your probe returns to periapsis 2 Kerbin years after the initial ejection, Kerbin is exactly where it needs to be to get a slingshot. It\u0027s not quite as efficient as something like a KEKKJ path, but has the advantage of being much simpler to set up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-03T11:59:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223233065\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168118\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221512185930\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022183218\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cheif Operations Director\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 02/12/2017 at 4:38 AM, Cheif Operations Director said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello I want to do a gravity assist from Dres\u00A0\u00A0to Laythe but I a.
