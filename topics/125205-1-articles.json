FWIW, I think it doesn\u0027t even damage the jettisoned stage much; when I do this, I see the intact jettisoned tank flying away, so I think that it\u0027s just the stack decoupler on the top of the spent stage that\u0027s going kablooie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the real issue here is the game\u0027s lack of graded explosive F/X. If a component overheats and is destroyed, you get a massive camera-rattling, screen-filling fireball, regardless of whether the destroyed component was a tank full of tons of explosive rocket fuel or just a humble OX-STAT solar panel. I really wish they\u0027d provide different levels of F/X so that you only get the fireball when it\u0027s something genuinely explosive. When something small and inert does (like a solar panel, or a spent decoupler), it should just be a brief sizzle and a puff of smoke. Would save a lot of player confusion (such as yours, in this post), and also make the real explosions more emotionally effective by not crying wolf all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T16:45:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r_rolo1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r_rolo1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThrust damage was upped ( better said, it was made to follow a law more closely related with RL, a thing that makes that if you\u0027re close of a rocket nozzle, you\u0027re going to have a bad day ), so if you decouple and activate at the same time, the lower stage will most likely get damaged .\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to solve this is to either activate the engine in the upper stage after decoupling and gaining some distance ( like most rockets in RL do ) or simply hot stage ( aka decoupling and lighting the engine at the same time ) and forget about reusing the lower stage ( also a thing in RL )\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat makes sense!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rematog","CreatedById":134130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T18:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, thanks for all the replies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"webward","CreatedById":98371,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T04:44:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUh, from what I\u0027ve seen there does actually appear to be a bug...
