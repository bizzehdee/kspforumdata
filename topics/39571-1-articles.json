I\u0027m afraid no such orbit exists. Placing a ship between the two would require the ship to be closer to the sun than the planet is, which means a faster orbit, so the ship will get ahead of the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Or when you say in orbit around the planet, but always between the planet and sun... If the ship is orbiting the planet, it can\u0027t always be in-between the two. If it is in orbit of the planet, it will be constantly circling it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nurph","CreatedById":59509,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T04:55:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure the orbit you want is possible.

If you\u0027re talking about an orbit around Kerbin that always is between Kerbin and the sun, that\u0027s not possible either, there\u0027s no way to have a year-long orbital period around kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Lagrange points, in case you didn\u0027t know, occur at several points between two bodies, one orbiting the other where the gravitational forces simultaneously act on a third body to keep that third body always in the same position relative to the other two. There\u0027s five of them I believe, but I only know two, the one directly between body 1 and body 2, and the one on the opposite side of body 1 from body 2, which occur because of the decreased net gravitational force and the net effective gravitational force, respectively)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adjsaint","CreatedById":76376,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T16:47:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies, yeah I realized what I was thinking was impossible after trying some orbits.

It makes your vessel sailing the front or behind planet on the same orbit. Your vessel will never intercept planet SOI.
