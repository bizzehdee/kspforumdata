I tried to actively re-create such an offset for learning purposes, but neither manipulating the origin of the mesh in blender, offsetting the part and the mesh in unity or offsetting the whole part in unity,\u00A0 or making the mesh non-rotational-symmetric will ever force my test part to wobble in the spinner animation like the Lander Can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-10T19:05:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2016 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by InsaneDruid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T18:43:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it may have something to do with the (non-visible) ladder and hatch colliders on the side of the can -- it sticks out more than it would if it were angled (such as on the MK1 / mk1-2 pods).\u00A0 Can\u0027t say I\u0027ve noticed that behavior on the hitchhiker can though, so this might not explain it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
