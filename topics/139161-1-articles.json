Whenever I load in the craft, and make a takeoff run, as soon as I pull up, the plane immediately flips up so it is backwards, and then promptly belly-flops on the runway. I have tried tweaking the COM and COL to get them closer together (just for clarification, the COL is a little behind the COM, as it should be), but the plane refuses to cooperate. Can any of the more adept plane-builders take a look and see what is wrong.
