I actually first built a retractable ladder but decided, with the chrome accents on the hatch, to complement them with chrome-ish rungs instead. I might still put the retractable in as an option, though. Elon specifically said that this capsule would still use the exact same parachutes as the cargo Dragon, which I take to mean they work the same way on the actual, launchable capsule that we\u0027ll see later this year or next. These parachutes use a drogue that rips a line up the back of the Dragon from a narrow, shallow channel that is covered with polystyrene foam and then spools out from the top. I hope I\u0027m right, but as always will modify in the future as these parts become reality. Interestingly, I almost assumed that the top ports were for something else and only added rcs to those just before I released the first version of the Dragon V2. I\u0027d also like to know how the winglets on the trunk are really going to work. I would assume they are control surfaces, but the Dragon V2 separates from the trunk long before the atmosphere plays any part in reentry. I think the animation that accompanied Elon\u0027s presentation influenced the little gap I left between the capsule and the trunk, since the gap is also in the video, but I believe I will get rid of that in future releases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ser Brynden","CreatedById":84390,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T05:26:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LazarusLuan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LazarusLuan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you for your comments - I wish I could have been as close to the capsule as you have been.
