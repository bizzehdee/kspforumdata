Once I have done that, I feel like there\u0027s not so much left to do. I could go explore Duna again but it\u0027s more fun when I\u0027m also completing some goal. The problem is that I don\u0027t have all of the cool parts unlocked until I reach the top of the tech tree, so I get used to living without them and wishing I had them to complete my goals. I never have the top parts when I still have tech to unlock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was thinking it might be nice both to add upgraded variants of parts, using lighter, stronger, and more expensive materials--but also giving rise to more room in the tech tree beyond unlocking all the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I think more of the basic structural components should be available early on. It doesn\u0027t make much sense to me that I can build a 2.5 meter liquid fuel engine but I can\u0027t build a 2.5 meter empty box to adapt it to a smaller rocket on top. And it really doesn\u0027t make sense that I have advanced jet engines, yet I still can\u0027t make 1x1 meter metal squares.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
