I mean, wormholes! That being said, I\u0027m curious as to the long term plans for this mod. Do you have biomes in mind for the current moons and planets? Also, do you have a set number of stars, planets, or moons you plan to include?\n\nWhile I\u0027m here, I had a couple of ideas I wanted to throw out there:\n\nA cluster of small bodies, ranging in size from smaller than Gilly to the size of Minmus, with similarly sized spheres of influence. These objects would be closer to each other than the Mun is to Kerbin, but on their own, unique and technically independent orbits around their star. The thing that makes them remain in a cluster would be the fact that they all have identical orbital periods. Their orbits are just slightly differently placed, with maybe one or two being longer and thinner than the others, so, while they undulate around each other, they remain in close proximity none the less.\n\nA star system on an extremely eccentric orbit around the galactic center, making it particularly difficult to get to.\n\nA pulsar or magnetar system, with the pulsar being a strobe light star, and the magnetar disallowing transmissions while in it\u0027s Sphere of Influence. Not certain if these are accurate interpretation of these kind of celestial bodies, but I think they would be fun.\n\nA star system with five or six captured satellites, each with a strange, wildly eccentric orbit.\n\nA planet using the color scheme: white stone land, black tar oceans, and sparse, purple iodine clouds. I would imagine it would have a thin atmosphere and be hot (close to it\u0027s parent star) to have iodine gas as said atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"Alkahest","CreatedById":144015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T17:35:50Z","Content":"Suggestion for the Wormhole, instead of a black hole, get a starfield and map it to a globe and use that as the texture."},{"CreatedByName":"Tankuwi","CreatedById":146636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T20:09:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If I add this to my modded save which already has OPM, will the OPM planets fit inside kerbol\u0027s SOI?\n\nNo, KerbalGalaxy mod has not developed for OPM.

I was afraid of downloading it myself because I was already running KSP with only 3GB of RAM, but I gave it a shot, and, insanely, my game actually runs *better* now. I assume it\u0027s because the skybox was eating up my RAM before.\n\nAlso, I agree with danie l. It\u0027s better to make people wait for a few weeks and make sure everything runs perfectly, than to release a pretty-looking load of junk in a couple of days. That being said, maybe you could get a couple of forum users to go through your coding and refine the coding.
