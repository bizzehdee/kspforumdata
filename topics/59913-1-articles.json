Hi all! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to share my first attempt at a Solar System traveler. Here\u0027s the final pre-launch form of Project Phoenix:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain Power is provided by 16 Nuclear engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main fuel tanks are docked at the rear of he craft and are designed to be discarded in interplanetary flight as fuel is used. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two science landers (docked at 1 and 3) are to be used in multiple planets in one trip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mule Space Tug (Docked at 2) is a purpose built tug intended to brute force the fuel tanks into place or transfer the tanks from my LKO Space Station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Recovery vehicle (Docked at 4) is for crew recovery and replenishment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final craft was almost 100 Meters long and weighed in at just under 500 tonnes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uoJ1QlI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uoJ1QlI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T02:39:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas it gone anywhere yet?

It DID get out of LKO (200Km) and to geosynch safely after disengaging all the fuel and parasite craft. After redock and refuel I went for Duna trajectory and all the parasites and the fuel modules did what you\u0027d expect their inertia to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI over-engineered it to let Kerbals move from the lower dock all the way to the command module. Whenever a module came within 2 Km my PC lagged as it loaded everything. the Docking rings were made before i had Max-Mono units and max-batteries so i\u0027ve reengineered those sections to use far less parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post more as i redesign.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T10:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeakong as someone that built a grand tour monstrosity of a thousand parts and 10 independent sections docked together: tractor configuration!

But don\u0027t be discouraged! Even if you find yourself having to totally scrap it, I personally went through THREE whole full scale stations like this before I came up with the formula which worked for me. You\u0027re bound not to get everything right on the first go around, because a lot of the important lessons you learn about space stations and cruisers come from building them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeet The Red Giant (My final revision for now at 174 parts) and Supernova Seven (I keep it around because its awesome-looking). They are both self-launching \u0022one piece\u0022 cruisers, meaning that the main core of the ship is complete without expansion. This means they are absolutely stable and have none of the wobble problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tKBHzzZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tKBHzzZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in this next picture, you see Supernova Seven Docked to one of my earlier experimental stations to absorb anything useful. Th station on the left is a wobbly, uncontrollable monstrosity, and took me a day and a half to put it all together. I learned a lot from it though, and ate all of its resources later, so it wasn\u0027t even a total loss. Supernova Seven then acquired a second experimental station before I made some revisions and launched a new one entirely. And then Supernova Seven ate Supernova Seven. Then I decided I needed to reign in the parts count after Supernova seven (the second) was completed, and I built Red Giant, which is essentially my fifth large scale ship of its kind, but the first to ever be put into actual service. The entire learning process took about two or three weeks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9vJH6Lm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229vJH6Lm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-14T14:05:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2014 02:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Camaron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
