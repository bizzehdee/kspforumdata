Use fewer, but longer burning and higher thrust asparagus stages. Thrust plates are good for some situations, but mostly they are just duct tape that increases your lag and parts count because you have a bad design. Download and install MechJeb or Kerbal Engineer Redux so you have solid numbers on what each stage is doing. Consider installing Kerbal Joint Reinforcement. Build smaller boosters first and then work your way up as you learn how to build. Learn how to minimize your parts count for the task at hand. (More parts = more joints = more things that can slip, slide, or bend.) Search out Temstar\u0027s Zenith series boosters, read the thread for some of the theory of big booster design, then download them and take them apart and study them closely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my booster (just about ready for public release) that boosts a five tank payload to 150km - note the complete lack of thrust plates or insane amounts of struts. It\u0027s completely stock except for Kerbal Joint Reinforcement. The non KJR version (in work) needs more struts, but still doesn\u0027t need thrust plates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1065.photobucket.com/user/DerekL1963/media/KSP/screenshot23.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1065.photobucket.com/albums/u384/DerekL1963/KSP/screenshot23.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot23.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd build rockets, and watch them fly, figure out how to fix any problems, lather, rinse, repeat.

To combat this I employ thrust plate technology with I beams and panels that sits on top of my boosters and under the payload. In this pic I put up 7 full orange tanks and the orange tank on my last booster still had all it\u0027s fuel left for a total of 307 tons into a 100km orbit.
