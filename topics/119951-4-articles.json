Just one question for the OMS pods, though. I see a \u0022gap\u0022 so to speak when I go to mount an engine onto these pods. Is it a node miscalculation or is it me? I \u0022think\u0022 this has been addressed, but these parts should have abalator on them to fit the bill as it\u0027s look intends them to be.
