Once you get that first orbit, you don\u0027t really need a whole lot of engine to get going. A couple well fueled nuclear engines will get you most anywhere. Get the minimal stage you need for space, though if you are like me, you like big rockets anyways. Typically a tumble on launch is due to wobble. You need to strut along the length of your ship, especially across couplers. Getting rid of the wobble and making sure your ship is symetrical plus using the ASAS should eliminate wobble and therefore tumbling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
