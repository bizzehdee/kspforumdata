The moment I saw C7\u0027s new parts in action, it was all I dreamt of making. The photos I provided are a little out of date. I have added flaps and canards to the aft end of the Blackbird. It can fly pretty well once off the ground, but I warn you, don\u0027t play with the roll too much, or you\u0027re going to have to put up a fight. She can be a bit touchy at times, and you\u0027ll have to restabilize her roll ever so slightly now and then, but I managed to hit a service ceiling of approximately 15,400m (50,524 ft.) at a speed of about 520 m/s (1,872 km/h), which is Mach 1.53 supercruise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you C7 for your amazing contribution to this wonderful game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueFalcon77","CreatedById":12907,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-08T09:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI forgot to add, you need to disable the forward-facing engines.
