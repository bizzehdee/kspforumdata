But they only stay open for like half a second, so I can\u0027t actually read them. Especially when I\u0027m usually trying to keep control of a quickly disintegrating craft. I\u2019d like the option to leave them up and manually close them so I can review what went wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome players might hate having to manually close them though so maybe make the auto close be an optional feature that can be set in the settings win?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
