We know that Intercept decided to stick to the metastable metallic hydrogen as one of the fuel types. It is based on an old, outdated hypothesis that hydrogen has a metallic state under high pressures that can be maintained under much lower pressures once achieved. While metallic state of hydrogen is pretty much a certainty under the right conditions, these conditions turned out to be far higher pressure at much lower temperatures than originally anticipated, and there is no longer a reason to believe that there is any metastability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2\u0027s Kerbol system is located in a different universe, one where materials have somewhat different physical properties to our own. This is inescapable from the fact alone that Kerbin has 9.8m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0surface gravity with a 600km radius. The average density of Kerbin has to be about 58g/cm\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. Densest known metal on Earth is osmium at 22g/cm\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. We don\u0027t know of any materials that would reach 58g/cm\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0even at the pressures in the Earth\u0027s core. Clearly, planets in KSP and KSP2 are made of some other stuff. Or, at least, stuff that behaves differently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo circling back to the metallic hydrogen, the surface pressure of Jool is a little over 5MPa. That\u0027s a touch over 50 bar. The \u0022air\u0022 density, however, is only 6.7kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0at 200K ambient. Substituting that into the ideal gas law, we see that the atmosphere of Jool has an average molar mass of 2.23. Which means its\u0027 mostly hydrogen. In fact, this is a good fit for 90% hydrogen, 10% helium, \u0026lt;1% methane. In other words, Intercept probably took Jupiter\u0027s composition for the basis here. But now we get to the surface. On the real Jupiter, that hydrogen-helium soup turns into a supercritical fluid, which continues getting denser without a big change in its other properties until we get to (what we believe to be) liquid metallic hydrogen layer. That liquid metallic hydrogen \u0022mantle\u0022 of the planet extends down to the core, which has a rather fuzzy boundary, resulting in no real solid surface. The transition from supercritical hydrogen to metallic is also likely to be a fuzzy one, meaning there are no sharply defined boundaries anywhere, but we can break down the broader regions into the solid icy/rocky core, liquid mantle of metallic hydrogen with helium droplets, supercritical lower atmosphere of molecular hydrogen and helium, and gaseous upper atmosphere of the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now we get into the topic of metastability. If in Kerbal universe the hydrogen becomes metastable, what properties do we expect of this Jupiter analog? Well, we still expect the planet to have a liquid metallic hydrogen mantle. However, as the mantle circulates, the liquid metallic hydrogen that would reach lower pressure and temperature of higher altitudes instead of evaporating to a molecular hydrogen would instead solidify to its metastable metallic phase. This phase transition would expel much of the helium mixed into the composition, meaning the density of MSMH would be slightly lower than density of the liquid metallic hydrogen of the mantle. This is a very similar situation to what happens on Earth with all the molten rock in the mantle - the parts that solidify first near the surface form a lighter layer of various oxides that float on top of a molten metal-rich mantle. We end up with a solid surface. Except, on Jool, it\u0027s a solid surface of metastable metallic hydrogen. And indeed, the surface of Jool looks metallic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNaturally, at a low enough pressure, we expect MSMH to sublime into molecular hydrogen. Apparently, in Kerbal universe that happens at around 200K at 5MPa of pressure. Which is fairly extreme, but reasonable enough for storage and transportation for use as fuel. And, well, Jool is the place you get it from. How we\u0027re going to be transporting it off the surface remains to be discovered. But in a world where MSMH exists at all, surface of Jool would be one place you\u0027d find it, and indeed, a surface made of the stuff is exactly what you expect and predict based on extrapolating Jupiter analogue planet to Kerbal scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S_Coriolis","CreatedById":226711,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T23:21:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s build colonies on Jool to mine metastable metallic hydrogen !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal3","CreatedById":225307,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T00:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224249251\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213242\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677711967\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe surface looks pretty intentional.

If in Kerbal universe the hydrogen becomes metastable, what properties do we expect of this Jupiter analog? Well, we still expect the planet to have a liquid metallic hydrogen mantle. However, as the mantle circulates, the liquid metallic hydrogen that would reach lower pressure and temperature of higher altitudes instead of evaporating to a molecular hydrogen would instead solidify to its metastable metallic phase. This phase transition would expel much of the helium mixed into the composition, meaning the density of MSMH would be slightly lower than density of the liquid metallic hydrogen of the mantle. This is a very similar situation to what happens on Earth with all the molten rock in the mantle - the parts that solidify first near the surface form a lighter layer of various oxides that float on top of a molten metal-rich mantle. We end up with a solid surface. Except, on Jool, it\u0027s a solid surface of metastable metallic hydrogen. And indeed, the surface of Jool looks metallic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI seriously doubt that the surface is metallic hydrogen, for starters I dont think solid metallic hydrogen is even practically possible? The pressures for liquid metallic hydrogen are already insane, to get it to a solid Id imagine would take much more. Also Im pretty sure if you landed on solid metallic hydrogen your ship would just explode, hydrogen is super reactive. Not to mention it just doesnt look like metallic hydrogen, metallic hydrogen is shiny and reflective whereas Jools surface is rocky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm pretty sure the surface is just intended to be like a standard gas giant core, a rocky mixture of ice and metal. There\u0027s a pretty big explanation you could go for for why Jools solid core is so large, its a mini neptunes. Mini neptunes are gas giants smaller then neptunes, and larger then super earths. There cores are much larger relative to other planets. I think Jool could go with some oceans for its surface to make some more sense, but besides that I think its cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uUYenp7vGSQU6BmgZreL9N-970-80.jpg.webp\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.08\u0022 height=\u0022681\u0022 width=\u0022907\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uUYenp7vGSQU6BmgZreL9N-970-80.jpg.webp\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-03T01:37:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224250506\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213242\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677807053\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222150\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Strawberry\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, Strawberry said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI seriously doubt that the surface is metallic hydrogen, for starters I dont think solid metallic hydrogen is even practically possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the real world, unclear.
