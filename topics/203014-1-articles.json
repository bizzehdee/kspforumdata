To tell what it is, we need the log files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest log to find is KSP.log, you\u2019ll find it inside the KSP main folder (if you downloaded KSP via steam it\u2019s in steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal Space Program, otherwise it\u2019s wherever the installer put it). There\u2019s a more detailed log called Player.log, but it\u2019s harder to find so for now just get hold of KSP.log, upload it to a file sharing site and post a link to the file here- please don\u2019t copy and paste the contents of the log\u00A0directly into the forums, it\u2019s a real pain to look at especially on a tablet or mobile, as I currently am.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you got KSP on Steam, you could also try verifying the files- right click KSP in your Steam library, click \u2018properties\u2019, then the \u2018local files\u2019 tab, then \u2018verify integrity of local files\u2019 which should find out if you have any missing or corrupted files and re-download them; it might fix the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that doesn\u2019t solve the problem, read this and see if anything helps:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
