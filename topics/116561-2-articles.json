Valentina and Bill Kerman then did another EVA to transfer back to the CSM.\n\nAfter undocking from the ascend stage the crew spent eight more day in space, testing their equipment, navigation and the SPS. On the eleventh day the SPS fired one last time to intiate reentry. The capsule separated from the service module and splashed down close to the KSC only ten minutes later.\n\nThe mission was the second manned launch of a Sleipnir V rocket and it proved the MEM worthy of kerballed spaceflight. Further tests on the Odin 10 mission will prepare the MEM for its ultimate goal, landing on the Mun.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gwmJe/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:03:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T00:38:23Z","Content":"The final rehearsal, the fourth kerbaled mission in the Odin space program and the second to orbit the Moon: [Odin X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_10)\n\nThe Sleipnir V booster worked flawless during the ascend and put the Odin craft into a 108km x 104km orbit around Kerbin.

A small problem that led to explosive first stage separations in the earlier flights had been fixed. Once in Orbit the crew spent just 30 minutes on system checks before Commander Valentina received a go for Trans-Munar Injection. At T\u002B37 minutes the S-VIB stage fired and put the craft on a free return trajectory to the Mun. Shortly after TMI the CSM turned around to dock with the MEM and pull it away from spent the S-IVB stage.\n\nAfter their voyage to the Mun the Service Propulsion System fired while the craft passed behind the Mun and injected it into a almost circular 60kmx55km orbit around our grey companion.\n\nThe Kerbonauts spent serveral orbits around the Mun with system checks, they also spent time eating snacks and taking a nap. Once rested Commander Valentina and Munar Module Pilot Bob Kerman entered the MEM and prepared it for the munar landing. A short while after they undocked und lowered their orbit, leaving Command Module Pilot Bill Kerman behind.\n\nOne hour later the MEM entered the final stage of it\u0027s decent. After tipping upright Commander Valentina lead the MEM to a safe landing location since the original location turned out to be on a slope.\n\nA few minutes later Bob and Valentina donned their spacesuits. Valentina left the MEM first, slowly climbing down it\u0027s ladder to the munar soil. With the words \u0022*One small step for a woman, but a giant leap for Kerbalkind*\u0022 she stepped onto the Mun.\n\nBob follower shortly thereafter. Together they first set up the Odin Program flag near to the MEM and then set up the [EOSEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Surface_Experiments_Package#Apollo_11_.28EASEP.29). EVA continued for over two hours before Val and Bob returned to the MEM. They enjoyed another nap time before they fired up the asecent stage, returning them to the Command Module.\n\nAfter just one orbit they redocked with the CSM and transfered back into their old craft. They then jettisoned the ascend stage and fired up the SPS to return them to Kerbin. One day later the Service Module was separated as they approached the Kerbin atmosphere.

Once in orbit the crew jettisoned the S-II stage and started system checks on the remaining space craft. Since the crew is by now well versed in their procedures, they could initiate the trans-munar injection after about an hour in orbit. A few minutes after the burn the crew extracted the MEM and pulled it away from the S-IVB stage. Time for a nap and a few snacks while drifting toward the Mun.\n\nAlmost exactly one day after launch the Crew fired the SPS to inject the spacecraft into munar orbit. A few minor course corrections were necessary during the munar approach as the Seer III probe landed at a higher latitude than the guys at Mission Planning remembered. Once again Val and Bob entered the MEM to decent to the munar surface. They lowered the MEMs orbit, therefore they were soon speeding a low altitude above the munar ground at incredible speed. Using the descent engine Val and Bob decelerated the MEM on it\u0027s final approach to the midland crater. Thanks to careful timing and Valentinas flying skills they touched down softy and within walking distance of the Seer III probe just a few minute later.\n\nThe crew used their time on the Mun for two EVAs. During the first one, immediately after landing, Val first set up the Flag while Bob started deploying the OMSEP. Once done with the flag Val helped with the second experiments package. Both then went to the Seer III probe to inspect it and take some parts back to the MEM for later analysis on Kerbin. Time was late by now, so they both went back into the MEM for a little nap. On their second EVA Bob and Val studied several of the surrounding rocks, taking probes and pictures. After finishing their second trip it was almost time for liftoff - the Sun on the Mun was about to set.\n\nAfter almost one day on the munar surface Val fired the ascend engine of the MEM and headed back for orbit. Since the landing site was nowhere near the munar equator a few maneuvers where needed to match the CSM\u0027s orbital plane and to catch up with it. Nonetheless the crew was united again a little later. After committing the ascend stage to a crash on the munar surface, the SPS was fired up again and the crew returned back to Kerbin. Four days and one hour after liftoff the crew splashed down safely in the kerbin ocean.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/2WaQN/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:05:47Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T16:22:19Z","Content":"Great mission recreation and report !\n\nNow considering making one myself ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T16:33:09Z","Content":"Thanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) It\u0027s fun and while doing this I leaned quite a lot about the apollo program I didn\u0027t know.

Five minutes after launch the Odin spacecraft had entered 99.5 km x 92.3 km orbit around Kerbin. The experienced crew started system checks to make sure that everything was ready for their trans-munar injection. After three orbits all checks where completed and Odin XIII was go for TMI. The S-IVB engine fired and put the crew on the desired trajectory. Once the burn was completed the crew started preparations for the transposition and docking maneuver. The CSM separated from the remaining craft, turned around and docked with the MEM. The CSM used it\u0027s RCS to extract the MEM and to put a safe distance between the spent stage and itself.\n\nFour hours into the flight and well on their way to the Mun the crew heard a loud bang accompanied by fluctuations in electrical power during their snack break. The crew initially thought that a meteoroid might have struck the MEM. While the Crew was still trying to find out what happened, Bill Kerman saw the spacecraft\u0027s main energy source, it\u0027s twin fuel cells, it\u0027s main battery and RCS-Fuel supply floating past his window. After making sure that KSC had *not* sent a spare pair of fuel cells the crew was forced to shut down the CM completely to save it for re-entry, and to power up the MEM to use as a \u0022lifeboat.\u0022 However, as the MEM has only place for two Kerbals, Bill had to don his spacesuit and cling to the ladder.\n\nIt seems however, that Bill was mesmerized by the sight of the approaching Mun an soon let go of the ladder. Thankfully the craft and Bill where already on a free return trajectory to the Mun. The craft passed behind the Mun and some time afterwards Bill was responsive again. He reapproached the Spacecraft and entered the shut down Command Module to refill his RCS reserves before clinging back onto the ladder. Now that Bill was holding on to the craft again the crew could use the MEM\u0027s descent engine for some course corrections.\n\nAfter two days the craft finally came close to Kerbin again. The first step of reentry preparations was to separated the service module, using the MEM\u0027S RCS to pull away from it. The crew entered the capsule and started a complete power-up from scratch of the completely shut-down Command Module, something never intended to be done in-flight. Once this was completed, the MEM was undocked and the crew was ready for reentry.\n\nTwo days, one hour and three minutes after liftoff the capsule splashed down in the seas of Kerbin. The crew was safely back home on their beloved home planet.\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Bg1Dd/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T17:07:27Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 05:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeldrak**"}]}
