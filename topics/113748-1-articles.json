I\u0027m using an ASUS laptop on windows 7. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just tried uninstalling then reinstalling. Still did not work: still stuck on version 1.0.0.822. Went to the launcher, and the same message came up about the rsync. Looks like I\u0027ll be stuck on 1.0.0. for a while. I\u0027ll contact amazon to see what they can do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astro Boba","CreatedById":146766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T00:17:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate as of 6-23-15:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmazon has not yet update their version of KSP.
