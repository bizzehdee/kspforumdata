I was just curious if large solar panels can be used to generate lift, as a sort of replacement for wings, assuming everything else about the plane is structurally sound. These types of bigger panels are not physicsless, right?

What I would do, assuming you\u0027re just trying to have fun, is get them at 30-45 AoA with sun tracking. turn off sun tracking with tweakable everything mod, and turn on unbreakable craft in the debug menu and see if it will take off with a zero degree engine AoA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T04:41:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast time I tried something like this, the panels did not generate lift -- and those gigantors were able to hold together up to 100 m/s.
