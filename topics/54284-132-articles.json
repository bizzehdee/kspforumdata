This represents the fiddly work that would go into producing all those high-precision tools. Any imbalance comes from the same mass of structural trusses taking the same time to build (this will be remedied in a future release when I un-hard-code kerbal-hours). The idea is you can either spend a lot of money to buy a workshop, or you can spend a lot of time to build one (and possibly miss that launch window), though with its productivity boost, it may well be worth the time investment.

So far I\u0026#39;ve not been able to mine any metal ore in 1.0.5. It\u0026#39;s all good though because I\u0026#39;m flipping over to the MKS rocket part methods of mining.
