I\u0027m thinking for the first version I\u0027ll just leave it as is, but it will need to be addressed at some point. My current thinking (which hasn\u0027t been vetted by looking at what\u0027s possible) is to do a walkthrough of the vertices of the underlying data structure that represents the planet\u0027s mesh/PQS (which I finally just figured out stands for Planet Quad Sphere). For each vertex get the biome and flag whether it\u0027s above or below sea level. Use that information to get a % of land/water for each biome. I can then use that to estimate what biome/situation combinations can be considered extremely difficult and filter them out (or better yet, filter them into special 3-star contracts that make the difficulty clear).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea how hard that will be code wise. I have no idea how performant it will be (do I need to do it one-time only at game start and cache the results to disk? or perhaps once per game without caching?). Regardless, I can\u0027t see it being something that can be done per scene change/game load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the player figuring out where the biomes are, the most I\u0027ll do is give suggestions in the mod\u0027s thread. SCANsat is one, KRE shows the current biome, and the stock cheat menu has the biome overlay. Out of game, the wiki has biome maps for everything, and I\u0027m sure there\u0027s more options out there too. Some players may want to figure it out on their own, as the biome names often give enough of a hint (\u0022Highlands\u0022, \u0022Northern Craters\u0022, \u0022Poles\u0022, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022arkie87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022arkie87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBiome Research?

What I found was that there are many, many PQSmod objects that modify the terrain height. I had hoped that just using the height map directly would be close enough for my purposes, but there\u0027s a lot of areas that get modified significantly by other things (like the ice sheet that has some logic for setting it to 30m across the board). So I changed it to take a random sampling of locations to gather the biome data and doing it using a normal vector (which is significantly slower). But doing it this way, I have the coordinates for those outliers, so I\u0027m thinking I\u0027ll make contracts for visiting the rare biome/situation combinations and provide waypoints to guide the player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I though there were some archipelago type islands that account for the ocean/landed combinations?
