Seeing as KK is doing mostly ULA stuff, and Raidernick doing mostly early USSR/US stuff, I figured I\u0027d steer clear of those types of launchers. Atlas II and III would fit much better in KKs pack than they would in mine anyway, as I\u0027m going mostly for ESA launchers and a few future ones like the Ariane 6 versions, the Ariane 6 concept (PPH) and ULAs Vulcan. But maybe KK wants to add Vulcan to his pack? We\u0027ll see.\n\nMy Delta III is getting a fairly big \u0022face-lift\u0022 for the new update, with new core tank texture, verniers for proper roll control, new DCSS (upper stage) model, new RL-10-B2 engine model with animated extendable nozzle skirt and so on. I might leave it as a separate download, but I don\u0027t feel there is a need for 2 of the same launchers once KK releases his.
