As for Atlas D and III, I believe Raidernick is busy with making all the early rockets, so he might do Atlas D (who knows). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtlas III I think would fall under rockets that Kartoffelkuchen would probably do down the line. I don\u0027t want to do Atlas II and III if Kartoffelkuchen wants to add them to his pack at some point. It\u0027s already a bit \u0022backwards\u0022 of me having the Delta III in my pack, as Kartoffelkuchen will definitely add it to his pack at some point. I did not know he was planning on making it when I made mine, so I will most likely remove my D3 once his is released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022frostsid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022frostsid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh the Titan family would be awesome!

Seeing as KK is doing mostly ULA stuff, and Raidernick doing mostly early USSR/US stuff, I figured I\u0027d steer clear of those types of launchers. Atlas II and III would fit much better in KKs pack than they would in mine anyway, as I\u0027m going mostly for ESA launchers and a few future ones like the Ariane 6 versions, the Ariane 6 concept (PPH) and ULAs Vulcan. But maybe KK wants to add Vulcan to his pack?

I might leave it as a separate download, but I don\u0027t feel there is a need for 2 of the same launchers once KK releases his. And it also means less for me to maintain down the line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note; I believe KKs launchers are all to scale, as each of the launchers comes with optional configs for re-sizing them.
