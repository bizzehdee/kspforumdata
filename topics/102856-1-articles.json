We hiked about about 7 km total, and had amazing views of the snow covered mountain tops from the ridge we climbed up to. There were a number of ice-covered stretches on the path, but with our trusty walking sticks we navigated those, as well as dealing with the inevitable mud because the ice was turning to slush very quickly. The dogs acted like they hadn\u0027t had a \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E walk in months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still can\u0027t believe we hiked in the foothills in March. I once again renewed my appreciation for some of the relatively unspoilt beauty which I am fortunate is near to where I live. I didn\u0027t even think about rockets or space until just before Squadcast. The dogs have only moved to eat and go outside a couple of times since we got back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy sympathies to all those dealing with terrible weather, wherever they may live.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T16:27:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWisconsin got about one week of nice weather, which was amazing.
