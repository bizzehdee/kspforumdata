In my case it hasn\u0027t been the second encounter that doesn\u0027t display, but the first one. \n\nSpecifically, there have been multiple times where I set up a Minmus encounter that also happens to encounter the Mun on the way back. After I have it set up and warp a little bit, the Minmus encounter disappears, leaving me with just the Mun encounter shown. If I\u0027m careful and cross Minmus\u0027 SOI at warp below the highest two levels I enter the SOI as expected, and the shown trajectory is now correct. If I use those top two levels of warp I pass through the SOI without it registering as such, and continue on the previous trajectory that leads to a Mun encounter.\n\nThis may be related or it may not, but there definitely seems to be some weirdness when the trajectory has multiple encounters."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T02:58:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If I do a swing-by on a body, leave its SOI, and get on a trajectory that immediately gets another encounter with the same body, the orbit prediction does not recognize the second encounter until the ship leaves the SOI.\n\u003E Is this a limitation in the course plotting system, or basically just a corner case that almost never happens anyway and no one cares about it?

The close proximity of so many relatively massive bodies with overlapping SOIs makes all sorts of weirdness happen out there. Granted, the whole patched conics system has difficulties with SOI changes in general, but the Joolian system just drives it nuts.\n\nA good example is trying to do the most economical transfer from Laythe to Vall, whereby you leave Laythe nearly tangent to its orbit to meet Vall 1/2 an orbit later. If you do this, it will all look OK during your burn but it will almost certainly fall apart just after you leave Laythe\u0027s SOI. At that point, you\u0027re in Jool\u0027s SOI and the effects of Laythe are ignored in the 2-body gravity system. So, you\u0027re now in a slightly wider orbit than Laythe, which from Jool\u0027s POV means you should be going slower than Laythe, so that\u0027s what happens, and Laythe starts catching up from behind despite you having just burned a pile of fuel to be going faster. And because you took the efficient route, you\u0027re not diverging quickly from Laythe\u0027s path, so are still within reach of Laythe\u0027s wide SOI when it catches up with you. The patched conics, however, show your path continuing on towards Vall with no Laythe encounter, so you crank the warp up high to get the trip over quickly. Then suddenly, POOF, you\u0027re back in Laythe\u0027s SOI on a collision course with its center of mass, and will probably crash before you can react due to the warp speed ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif). To avoid this, you have to do a less-efficient transfer to leave Laythe\u0027s orbit at a steeper angle, so that when Laythe catches up you\u0027re out beyond the reach of its SOI. Also, don\u0027t warp more than 100x until you see Laythe pass you by and know you\u0027re safe ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nRemember, the Kraken lives on Bop so things are going to be unpredictable in Jool\u0027s vicinity. Save early, save often, and never trust what your instruments are saying."},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:56:02Z","Content":"Yeah, that happens sometimes.\n\nIf you want to fix it, put a maneuver node down on the orbit after the encounter. This will force the game to compute the next orbit and should show you the second encounter."}]}
