I\u0027ve had them create as much drag as a Big-S Shuttle Wing on some occasions. Now, is there any nice way to make drag cubes check for other drag cubes existing in the same space, or would this be an absolute nightmare for anyone to code? I don\u0027t know a thing about modding on KSP, so I am posting this as a request, but if anyone knows some of the basics on how to do this, I\u0027d be willing to try my hand at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-25T21:26:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t help you with that, but I can tell you how to make the drag cube of the ladder smaller.
