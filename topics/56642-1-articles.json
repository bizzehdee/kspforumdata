Have to check with an older version of the game later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELowering it will trade Physic time for Frame rate so in practice that means more CPU time is spent on rendering and less on physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvantage is that High part count models will run at a smooth FPS with pretty much the same Real time Rendering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe down Side is that low part count models might run at less then real time, lower physic time that is with out any benefit if your FPS is already at say 60 FPS with Vsync.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally set Physic time to 0.03-0.01 with 1000\u002B parts and with say 500-600 parts I run it at 0.04-0.03.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning it at 0.01 for example with 500 parts will give me a physics time of 0.6x but and a steady frame rate but running at 0.04x will give me close to 1.0x Physics time so real time rendering but still maintain a good smooth FPS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning a 1300 part ship with 0.10 will run at about 0.3x real time but with a few FPS at best. Running at 0.03x will give me more or less the same 0.3x real time physics but a lot better frame rate tough not smooth its not still frames at least. 0.01 will reduce physics time to 0.25x or so at a more steady frame rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo from my testing since 0.18 its preferable to lower Physics Delta with increased part count. Exactly whats optimal is hard to say, it depends on GPU and mostly CPU, what ever limits you. But there is a balance between CPU, GPU and part count for the optimal Physics Delta. 0.10 is good fore some that run low part count models but others like 0.03 and others like something in between or higher then 0.10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggest using the debugging menu to show Physics time and some tool to measure FPS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if they lowered Physics Delta to 0.04 as default they did not realy do anything new to tweak the game becuse the user could do this before in the settings menu and I have ever sense I started playing back in 0.18.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight be Why my i7 3930K @ 4Ghz and GTX570 did not get any performance difference in 0.23 VS 0.22 with any of my test crafts either I ran 0.10, 0.04, 0.03 or 0.01 I still got about the same Physics Time compared to previous version and the same perceived frame rate. I did not see the 30% or so boost on and i7 Mu was talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried both the windows version in wine and the native Linux port. I cant find any sign of performance optimization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging the default in the settings.cfg cant realy be called improving performance because it all depends on how many parts you run. People using few parts would probably prefer higher Physics Delta while those that use hundreds of parts would prefer a lower Physics Delta.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they lowered Physics delta to 0.04 one should run in to the yellow clock a lot sooner when it comes to part count sens less CPU time is spent on physics rather then rendering so the game will run slower a lot sooner but maintain a higher frame rate even with more parts then with the previous Physics Delta at 0.10 in 0.22 and older if thats the case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we need Mu to confirm if that Performance update was implemented in 0.23 that was suppose to be in 0.22 but was left out. I cant replicate his 30% boost on an i7 that he claimed and I have an i7.
