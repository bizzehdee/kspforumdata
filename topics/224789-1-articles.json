I have a very big install, and it\u0027s begun running into performance issues. I\u0027m reluctant to reduce the number of mods, because many parts mods have their parts incorporated in various important missions and spacecraft in my saves. I\u0027m trying to find mods to cut down on while still keeping as many of the main parts mods as I can. So far on the chopping block is Parallax 2 scatters, Restock, and Planetside Exploration Technologies (a large parts mod I\u0027m not using many parts from).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRestock is the one I\u0027m least attached to, but unfortunately, it is a dependency of Restock\u002B, and removing it would require removing Restock\u002B, which adds a lot of parts that I use very frequently and it would likely result in bad things for various craft of mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way to uninstall Restock while still maintaining the functionality of Restock\u002B? Relatedly, what happens if I load a craft in-flight that has parts from mods that have been uninstalled?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-09T15:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224388102\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224789\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715223279\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201924\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LittleBitMore\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, LittleBitMore said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way to uninstall Restock while still maintaining the functionality of Restock\u002B?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo. Restock Plus uses assets from Restock and will not work if the latter is removed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBitMore","CreatedById":201924,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-09T18:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224388235\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224789\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221715268311\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156657\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HebaruSan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, HebaruSan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo. Restock Plus uses assets from Restock and will not work if the latter is removed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, that makes sense, thank you for your reply!
