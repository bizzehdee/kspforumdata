The bottom of the crew decks could have a proprietary docking port that corresponds with the one on the top end of each of the modules and would have a flush fit so there wouldn\u0027t be any ugly exposed clamp-o-trons. You\u0027d then launch the modules via SLS/etc and dock them to the bottom of the crew deck sections using the Landers. This way you\u0027d stay true to the movie while at the same time staying KSP friendly with the part count, as well as adding a modular/customizable feel to it. That way other modders could potentially make expansions as well, USI, Karbonite, NFT, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother small idea is having the engine modules just be tanks that you could configure to hold different fuels similar to how B9 does it, and then have three nodes on them to attach the included engines or otherwise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, definitely bookmarking this and will be following it for sure\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T17:32:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering how long it would be before someone would be making an Endurance pack.
