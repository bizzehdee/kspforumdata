That way a group of people does all the research on designing the rockets once, instead of everyone who would enjoy recreating the space program having to do all the research themselves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably a ton of work, and if there\u0027s no interest, that\u0027s cool. But decided I\u0027d throw it out there cuz I found the learning curve for RO a little overwhelming when I tried to design a ship, so something that made it easy to just fly the missions in order and learn about nasa history by doing, would be sick.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T09:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127398\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENASA, Career-mode total conversion\u003C/a\u003E but I think it\u0027s for stock, not RSS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EliasDanger","CreatedById":151803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T18:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027m thinking this idea might be better to wait for 1.1 and then the time after that to wait for rss and ro and all the parts to be updated and bugs to be ironed out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T19:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethere are a few mod packs that provide some NASA space craft around the forums.
