Asparagus staged; probably has something to do with it. My first asparagus-staged design, incidentally. Stuck it on a Zenith VII booster to see if it could take off, land, take off and land again. Booster got caught on the lower docking port lights; had to rip it off, then failed to re-pack one of the chutes. UVD. Might try again tonight. Still thinking about how I might use this as an upper stage for an Eve lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-03T13:11:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2013 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thunderstar","CreatedById":64703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T17:21:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etested the AIES aerospace pack and landed a kerbal on the mun with a small lander probe included with the lander\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sufficient Anonymity","CreatedById":57923,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T22:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther progress update for today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old munbase was flown north out of physics range to reduce lag, and a light rover was landed by it to explore the nearby canyon. The plan to use the logistics rover in fuel transfers was scrapped, and instead KAS was installed on the fuel shuttle, which has since left testing and carried out its first refuel. It means it has to land closer to the wellhead (so I have to remember to stow the solar panels and drills there each landing) but it reduces overall mission complexity. It does, though, require kerbals to carry out some labour; they are rotated occasionally to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k7tloZn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k7tloZn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WFoPIGu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WFoPIGu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T22:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlayed around a bit with alternative Propellants \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tvrHVS1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tvrHVS1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out - RCS has a terrible ISP\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T00:19:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xeldrak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xeldrak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPlayed around a bit with alternative Propellants \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tvrHVS1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tvrHVS1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out - RCS has a terrible ISP\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause it used to be really easy to go to the Mun with just RCS if you did it right. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for what I did today, I mapped minmus...and then stopped when Harv said 0.21 breaks compatibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T03:01:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYesterday I got this started and today I brought up two more fuel tanks and the big communications array, making a total of 12 launches and 11 dockings.
