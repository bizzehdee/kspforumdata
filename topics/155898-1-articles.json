After it was loaded up, I realized that docking my big motherships with tons of parts and my big station with tons of parts put a real drag on my frame rates and required that my motherships had \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E so they could dock (more parts). Also, from an RP perspective, putting the two most expensive things in the solar system in close proximity was risky...So, I ended up just parking the mothership in orbit and flying tankers directly from my fuel sources to it and my station sits on a giant stock of unused fuel. This only works if you have plenty of time to fill your ship, but in the end it worked out better for me...just a though \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheKorbinjer","CreatedById":172204,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-03T19:36:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EAs an experienced KSP player \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Comic Sans MS\u0027, cursive;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E~1,500 ish hours combined over\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E4\u00A0computers\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EI can say that the more your craft\u0027s mass is, the harder it is to aero-brake.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EIf you\u0027re worried about spending so much fuel, go for a more efficient craft.
