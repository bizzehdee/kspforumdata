After flying my vehicle, the Badger, over to the drop zone, it immediately began rolling down a hill. It kept going even after I turned the brakes on and crashed. Because it was moving, I was unable to quicksave and have to repeat the flight again. I thought I\u0027d be smart and slapped some landing legs on the Badger. Turns out they were upside down. Fortunately, the badger was able to come to a stop this time and I was able to quicksave. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo add to the chaos of the initial landing, they area I landed was incredibly hilly. I was unable to time warp or turn on the propeller without crashing, making progress slow. I was still crashing frequently, turning a slow journey into a painful one. Eventually I made it to some flatter ground and was able to go at a faster pace. After my first game session (I\u0027m not sure how long exactly) I made it 22 km. Let\u0027s hope things get better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/XGe5V\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Well, today I didn\u0027t actually do any driving, I merely tried to set up a target to aim for. The key word here is \u0022Tried\u0022. I read \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105372-Eve-A-ground-based-circumnavigation-13-m-s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFengist\u0027s circumnavigation of Eve\u003C/a\u003E, and really liked the idea of setting up a target to aim for. My plan was eventually to visit the second space center, so I figured I\u0027d send a small probe there. I put it in a plane and sent it off. The plane was pretty slow and took about half an hour real time to get there. I took pictures per usual, but upon jettisoning the probe, the game crashed. I was quite flustered and because of time constraints, had to call it a day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/nUFmz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Nothing to horrible happened today, the ground was flat and I made good distance. Although I did notice some strange things. For one, I noticed a strange bright spot on the ground when I loaded a quicksave. Not really sure what caused it, but I suspect it is similar in nature to the bright spots encountered on Fengist\u0027s Eve circumnavigation, linked above. The second odd thing I noticed was a circle of missing trees. When I zoomed out I noticed It created almost a cresent shape, when combined with the load distance. Other than that nothing much happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/PwAHF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

School is a thing. Today I went started my path through the mountainous interior of the starting continent. It allowed for some interesting night driving, before I finally decided that kerbals do indeed need to sleep. Some odd things did occur on the way. First off, game crashes. I installed a couple additional mods between sessions and noticed the game was almost unplayable. After some hard work (deleting some folders), the problem was fixed. Another thing is that there were more bright spots. They seemed to happen at 6 km intervals, similar to Fengist\u0027s obsevations of the eve bright spots. But it does make me wonder what exactly is coming out of the exhaust of this thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile driving I experienced some slight issues with the craft, none of them important though. When I began for today, I realized that the propeller was producing almost no thrust at all. I figured I\u0027d make another rover and airdrop it in, after upgrading the design and testing it, I found the source of the problem. The engine was throttled down. With that embarrassment out of the way, I continued driving the original badger, which is actually already the second iteration. Another \u0027problem\u0027 that developed was that whithout my knowledge, the two front landing legs and underside light broke. There are multiple other lights and the landing legs were upside down, so this shouldn\u0027t be a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/BsoJO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
