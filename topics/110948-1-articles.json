Its actually annoying I\u0027d like to keep my FOV settings. Also there needs to be a number value somewhere when adjusting it for reference. I don\u0027t know why the default FOV is so zoomed out giving everything a fish eye effect. It looks terrible. I adjust my FOV so the Mun looks to be the same size as the moon in our night sky. And omg its like night and day the game looks so much better. And go figure Kerbun looks larger as it should.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dspan_000","CreatedById":144320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T23:16:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Motokid600 said there is not other way but to reset the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brusura","CreatedById":57899,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-06T07:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found out from a reddit comment that you can reset the FOV in game with a double click on the middle mouse button\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
