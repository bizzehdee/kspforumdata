I have no idea why. Probably a bug in the construction process.\n\nI know that because when I was detaching parts in the construction hangar, it\u0027s not the pieces that would stick on and off the *pod*, but instead they would all (including the pod) come on and off off *that specific fuel tank*.\n\nBecause of that, the game went loco when the rocket started separating in-flight: it didn\u0027t know anymore on what piece to focus, and it was focusing on a piece that cannot generate a \u0022mission ended\u0022 event (the fuel tank). Therefore it would never go back to the normal \u0022out of flight\u0022 state. Hence the symptoms I was describing above.\n\nGoing back to the main menu didn\u0027t help, but completely exiting the game and restarting it solved the issue. I re-did the rocket design from scratch and it didn\u0027t happen again.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T11:21:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 11:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jeancallisti**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dragenauth","CreatedById":146619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T11:40:36Z","Content":"I have the same issue from time to time.
