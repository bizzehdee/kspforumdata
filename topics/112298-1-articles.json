I have no idea why. Probably a bug in the construction process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that because when I was detaching parts in the construction hangar, it\u0027s not the pieces that would stick on and off the \u003Cem\u003Epod\u003C/em\u003E, but instead they would all (including the pod) come on and off off\u003Cem\u003E that specific fuel tank\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of that, the game went loco when the rocket started separating in-flight: it didn\u0027t know anymore on what piece to focus, and it was focusing on a piece that cannot generate a \u0022mission ended\u0022 event (the fuel tank). Therefore it would never go back to the normal \u0022out of flight\u0022 state. Hence the symptoms I was describing above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing back to the main menu didn\u0027t help, but completely exiting the game and restarting it solved the issue.
