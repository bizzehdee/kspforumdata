That said, however, there are situations where it feels inappropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI propose that different celestial bodies have different sound tracks played while on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, Eve is a hellish world meant to be similar to Venus- a place hot enough to melt iron, and where acid is in the very atmosphere. However, the same cool, calming space music plays when on it; killing the mood. What if instead, upon entering the atmosphere of Eve, the music stopped, and then was replaced by a foreboding, Vulcan tune. This would complete the mood, and add a great deal of atmosphere to KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wouldn\u0027t take much to do, a few tracks per celestial body should do, and you could easily get away with applying the same tracks to some over the more minor bodies. (for example, one could get away with having the same material play on Ike and perhaps some of Jool\u0027s rocky moons.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just think it would be a simple thing that would improve the KSP experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T05:43:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice idea.

The discussion turned into different ways to make the soundtrack more dynamic and customizable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/43964-Dynamic-Soundtrack\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/43964-Dynamic-Soundtrack\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo summarize: Imagine having folders for different events(approaching planet, landing, casually orbiting, landing while low on fuel, settled on surface, etc...) that act as playlists. When those events trigger, it loads a random MP3 from those folders and you\u0027d be able to substitute your own music if you didn\u0027t like the vanilla stuff. Or even if you just wanted to add more tracks to your game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKinda like how it works in Oblivion(and probably Skyrim). Or your custom radio station in GTA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
