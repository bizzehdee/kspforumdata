If we assume 1960s, then they get the best map they had BEFORE they got there (because film). Obviously they would still see whatever you can see from the craft itself. All they would lose is the planning aspect in terms of aiming for a landing spot. I suppose there could be a small bonus for being there to represent what would eb hard to characterize in game (the ability of kerbals to memorize ground features from simple observation).

Ie: clutter that you could crash on. One possible thing to unlock via mapping---would be a map that shows flat spots in false color. It would be less accurate with photographic mapping, and perhaps eventually a radar mapper is a thing. At lower resolution, it could highlight areas within an x-degree slope compared to dead flat, but it would slop the area adding X pixels, and at higher res, it perhaps grades the color to completely flat (sort of like the way biomes are represented). So you could do a retro burn for landing, and place the landing point within a flat area.
