I was having a very hard time trying to bring back my SSTOs and, all of the sudden, I install 1.0.2 and the parts still do heat up but they don\u0027t explode at high atmosphere, almost for nothing, like they did in 1.0 even with a shallow reentry angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand another question?

The LV-N engines no longer heat up as much either and the ore drill/refiner also are a lot more resilient at least in my limited experience. I think I read somewhere that there was a mistake in the code where a sign was reversed in one of the equations which has now being corrected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118785-No-heatshield-risky\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E, but yes reentry heat has changed; aside from vulnerable parts like science experiments, it\u0027s not worth worrying about in 1.0.2, regardless of how aggressive you are with reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like finding the proper balance between everything exploding and nothing exploding has been a challenge. I would say, at least it seems like they\u0027ve found the bounds of the system, with 1.0.0 maybe a bit on the explody side and 1.0.2 being on the non-explody side.
