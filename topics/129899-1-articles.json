Note - if you\u0027re orbit is on a wildly different plane to the desired orbit, this is probably going to be a very expensive maneouvour - you should try and launch such that you a) fly in the right direction, but also b) so that you\u0027re flying into the right direction at the right time. \u00A0Try popping your rocket on the pad, and then watching kerbal spin under time acceleration on the map - you should launch into the right direction when the KSC is right underneath the desired orbital path - otherwise, you\u0027ll be starting off in the wrong place entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3- And the most annoying one that everyone has screwed up from time to time. \u00A0You need to be going in the right direction... \u00A0Look at the map - you should see dots flying around the desired orbit - that\u0027s the direction that your satelite needs to be travelling in. \u00A0If you\u0027re going the opposite way, you need to a perform a maneouver to do a 180 degree turn. \u00A0The amount of dV to do this should be twice what your current orbital velocity is (since you need to be going in the same orbit, but exactly opposite velocity) - it\u0027s cheapest to do this at the Ap.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMJ can do all of these for you, but I\u0027d try and have a go manually - you don\u0027t need to be horribly accurate for sat missions - eyeballing it is entirely good enough most of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWemb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-14T10:37:36Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2016 10:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wemb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T12:11:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I did specific orbit contracts was less efficient than Wemb\u0027s method but maybe easier for beginners:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLaunch\u00A0into an ordinary low equatorial orbit (easier than trying to time it right\u00A0and eyeball the relative inclination on the map during a launch, and you can follow any launch tutorial verbatim)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOnce in orbit, switch to the map screen and look for the relative ascending node (AN) and descending\u00A0node\u00A0(DN) of the target orbit\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhichever one has the target orbit farther away, set up a maneuver on the opposite side with enough prograde thrust to intersect the target orbit at the higher point\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAfter\u00A0that burn, place a maneuver at the intersection (which should also be your Ap marker now in addition to the AN or DN)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrag\u00A0the purple normal handles to match the orbit\u0027s inclination, the yellow prograde ones to raise the periapsis as needed, and the cyan radial ones to rotate, with the goal of moving your\u00A0Ap and Pe markers to match the target orbit\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPerform that burn once you get there, then fine tune as needed\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t the absolutely most efficient method, but I never ran out of fuel this way either, since most satellites can be built with very low mass and plenty of extra fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daterxies","CreatedById":156971,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T20:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the replies! \u00A0Im going to scrap MJ and learn how to do this stuff without it. \u00A0i ended up getting it last night by manually doing it.. but just accepted ANOTHER mission to place a satellite at like 5900ish km orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T11:40:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMJ is a really good learning tool - and I certainly would suggest it\u0027s\u00A0worth using it (at least a few times)\u00A0to do the actual burns so you can sit back, relax, and watch what it\u0027s doing from the map view and get a nice understanding of what it\u0027s doing, why, and how it does it.

have to set everything up by eye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe general procedure I use is like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#1, and most important, BE SURE YOU KNOW WHICH WAY AROUND THE TARGET ORBIT IS GOING (as in prograde or retrograde).\u00A0 You tell this by looking at the dots going around the target orbit in the map view.\u00A0 If retrograde at Kerbin, be sure to launch heading west instead of east.\u00A0 If retrograde at another planet, be sure to arrive there on inboard side, not the outboard side.\u00A0\u00A0Otherwise, you\u0027re pretty much screwed from the get-go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2.\u00A0 Having established which way I need to be going around the planet, the 1st parameter of the target orbit I go for is the inclination.\u00A0 If you don\u0027t do this up front, it costs way more fuel than it should.\u00A0 If the target orbit is at Kerbin, put the rocket on the pad, go to the map view, and warp until Kerbin rotates KSC directly under the target orbit\u0027s AN or DN, then launch directly into the target plane (remembering to go east or west as needed).\u00A0 Problem solved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2A.\u00A0 If, however, the target orbit is around another planet, things are a bit more complicated.\u00A0 First, you do a mid-course burn to move your Pe at the\u00A0planet above or below its equator to approximate the\u00A0target inclination (and remembering to be on the inboard or outboard side of the planet as needed).\u00A0 However, you\u0027re LAN will hardly ever be close to right so you\u0027ll have to finagle that after you capture.\u00A0 So what you do is just BARELY capture into a highly elliptical orbit so the necessary plane change will be as cheap as possible.\u00A0 Then rotate the map view until you\u0027re looking edge-on at both own orbit and the target orbit (both appear as single lines).\u00A0 See where these lines cross---these are your AN and DN\u00A0to move to\u00A0the target orbit\u0027s inclination.\u00A0 If one of these is far enough from the planet to make the burn cheap, put a node there and pull the up/down handles until you\u0027ll match planes.\u00A0 But it often happens that both AN and DN are close to the planet.\u00A0 In this case, put\u00A0the plane-change\u00A0node at your Ap.\u00A0 This will either do the job or get you close enough that the real AN or DN is now far enough from the planet to use for the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#3.\u00A0 So now you\u0027re in the correct plane going around in the correct direct, all that\u0027s left is fixing your APe and setting your Pe and Ap to the correct values.\u00A0 It\u0027s generally best to walk into the final configuration in steps.\u00A0 First off, without worrying about your APe, just adjust your Ap and Pe so that your orbit is approximately the size and shape of the target but not quite.\u00A0 Now pick a point about half way between your current Ap and Pe, place a node there, and pull the radial in/out handles.\u00A0 This will slide your Ap and Pe around your orbit, IOW changing your APe.\u00A0 Fiddle with this until your new Ap and Pe will like up with the target Ap and Pe.\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t matter at this point if your Pe is next to the target Ap and vice versa because you\u0027ll fix that in a minute.\u00A0\u00A0 What you\u0027re doing here is getting your APe either correct (your Pe and the target Pe are on the same side of the planet) or 180^ off (your Pe is on the same side of the planet as the target Ap).\u00A0 Once you\u0027ve got your Ap/Pe on the same line as the target Ap/Pe, all that remains is adjusting your Ap and Pe to match the target\u0027s.\u00A0 And when you do this, you\u0027ll swap your Pe/Ap to match the target\u0027s automatically if they didn\u0027t start that way.\u00A0 So put nodes as needed at your Pe and/or Ap to change the altitude of the opposite side of your orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#4.\u00A0 Sit back for 10 seconds and watch the money roll in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
