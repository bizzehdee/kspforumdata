If you lower your orbit until it intercepts the ground, it may not look steep, but it\u0027s actually steep enough to seriously stress your heat shield, if not overload it to the point of failure. I find an initial periapsis of between 25 and 30 km will guarantee single-pass capture without overloading your heat shield (using default DRE settings). That way you do most of your braking in the thinner upper atmosphere.

In the way stock aerodynamics works, drag is applied for every part on the craft regardless of whether it\u0027s in the airflow, while in FAR the cross-sectional area of the craft as it faces into the wind actually matters. The net effect is that more actual drag is applied in stock aerodynamics, which causes the craft to slow to terminal velocity much more quickly than in FAR -- which means less time for the craft to absorb shock heating from the extreme deceleration, and thus less heat absorbed by the craft overall. At least, such is my theory, assuming I\u0027m properly understanding how FAR and DRE work together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got an install of KSP that has both DRE and FAR, and I can confirm that it\u0027s entirely possible to recover a craft from either a suborbital or an orbital flight safely with the stock settings.
