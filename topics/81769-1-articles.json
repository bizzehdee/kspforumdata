As for interplanetary stuff, that\u0027s governed by transfer windows and Duna is NOT the 1st one to come due. At the start of a new game, windows for Moho, Dres, Jool, and Eeloo all come up before Duna\u0027s, and Eve is the last one for a new destination (Moho repeating several times in between).

Players do science to unlock parts so they can do the cool things they envision as the ultimate direction of their game. All this costs money, which can only be obtained from contracts (unless you have a mod that lets you mine resources you can return and \u0022sell\u0022 for cash on vehicle recovery). So what players can do at any point in the game is controlled to a large extent by what contracts are available. However, the base \u0022Explore\u0022 contracts appear in a semi-fixed order that completely ignores the fact that players are accustomed to doing Minmus before Mun (it\u0027s easier AND has more science per landing), and also ignores the immutable timing of transfer windows. And there\u0027s a penalty for not following this Squad-imposed order of visiting places, in the form of \u0022Explore\u0022 contracts not appearing if you go there before the contract spawns by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this conspires to compel players to do certain things, and only certain things, in a specific order, if they want a healthy cash flow. IOW, it restricts the freedom that KSP has previously been all about. Naturally, budgets and research restrict what you can do at any given time, but they don\u0027t by themselves force you into specific courses of action. This is what irks me. For example, it\u0027s not uncommon to research the tech tree enough to do a reasonable Jool mission by the 1st time its window comes around in a new game, which is before Duna\u0027s. Why shouldn\u0027t this still be an option for the motivated player? Sure, the travel time to Jool is long enough that its \u0022Explore\u0022 contract might come up before the ship gets there, but it might not, and if your ship enters Jool\u0027s SOI before then, you\u0027ll never get that money. Which you need because you just spent it on the Jool ship. So out of fear of bankruptcy or fear of having to do another dozen test contracts to avoid bankruptcy instead of doing what you want to be doing, you\u0027re stuck with playing by the schedule set by Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
