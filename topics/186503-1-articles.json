Things like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E window, TestFlight\u0027s reliability and data units, the point of rated burn time and so called engine overburning, how do even set the tank priority(?), what\u0027s the point of all those empty tech tree nodes, crew training and \u0022\u003Cem\u003EPress the KRASH button to enter a simulation.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 are left unexplained. Though i\u0027m not sure if the \u0022flight simulation\u0022 and the KRASH button is a metaphor/joke or a real thing. Anything i should read/watch about those topics? I\u0027ve seen some NathanKell\u0027s videos, but he didn\u0027t explained much of the stuff there plus his videos are fairly old, even the tech tree is different now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using 1.6.1 version btw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-21T10:15:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2019 10:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Actually_New_KSP_Player\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
