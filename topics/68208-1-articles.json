On the navball, is the target\u0027s prograde at the COM? Because I\u0027ve been aiming at that and then it seems to just spin way off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you know how fast you can hit the target and it will still work? When I did the asteroid mission I tried with it really slowly (0.1ms) to see if it needs any momentum to force it in, and it doesn\u0027t. So I was a bit silly when I tried to capture this satellite, because I thought, \u0022it\u0027s moving slightly, I know, I\u0027ll go at it with a bit of speed so I\u0027m not off-target when I reach it and then I won\u0027t send it spinning\u0022, which is ironically what happened. Still, I was only going a little above 3ms that time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T19:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want you can always cheat.
