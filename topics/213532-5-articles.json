It\u0027s a bunch of ships I docked together to go to Jool and visit all the moons AFAIK the part count is just too high for KSP2 to handle. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s possible to see part count in the flight mode, but that\u0027s not really the point. The point is I pushed the game to the limit, but the game didn\u0027t push my hardware to the limit. Obviously it\u0027s possible to build something that will slow down your game. Anyone can open cyberpunk and crank the max raytracing reflections to 100 and tank their performance, whether they have a 4090 TI or a 2060 super. But when you do that and open task manager you see your GPU get maxed out and heat up. What I find strange is that the bottleneck doesn\u0027t seem like it\u0027s hardware.

So I\u0027d be getting single digit FPS, but task manager would show no activity on my GPU. This is obviously not the problem, since the computer I\u0027m currently using has no onboard graphics. I\u0027ve also checked I\u0027m not in power saving mode, that the game is recognized as a game, etc. but it just has the same kind of feel, like something is just not using the right system and bottle necking on something totally random.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it\u0027s an Nvidia driver issue.
