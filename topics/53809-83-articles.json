Has anybody done a breakdown of the different directories? I downloaded the source last night to see how ATM works, and it looks like each update event it checks to see what textures need compressing. Just brainstorming here, but maybe the problem is that the game loads textures faster than the mod can compress them. Makes me wonder if an external app could compress the textures and replace the mod\u0027s textures with placeholders.
