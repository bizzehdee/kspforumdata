Squad it now catching up to the modders in terms of aesthetics. More important is their functionality. We know things inside them are to be basically removed from the drag calculation, but how are the fairings themselves going to interact with the aero model? Is the overall shape going to play? Or will each fairing part have an assigned drag value much as standard parts do today? I worry that without a proper drag model, nesting fairings for each stage might become the new OP technique, akin to asparagus staging.\n\n(Nesting fairings would involve each and every stage using a separate fairing to hide all above it from the drag model, creating almost drag-free rockets.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T03:35:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No big inflatable heat shield?
