Obviously now you can remove the new models for most of these parts, and I think you could probably release the Swept Wing with a lightly different texture (black edges perhaps), and people might use it.

I couldn\u0027t care less for parts looking like junk. You can use stock if you want that. IMO, this pack is great in that it gets rid of stupid-looking parts in favor of more realistic ones. Just who did ever see black jet engines. IMO, people can relate to stuff that looks like real-life plane and rocket parts, not like steel oil drums and engines made of scrap. This just doesn\u0027t look right, spaceflight is and always was high-tech, and as such, should look the part. I think that most people who play KSP actually do associate it with SF-looking, \u0022advanced\u0022 parts. Even \u002760s tech looks sleek and SF-ish. Indeed, I always hated stock parts and how ridiculous they looked. I think that this \u0022full of character\u0022 look just makes parts look shoddy, like they were made by someone who never seen a rocket in life. \u0022Throw things together and see what works\u0022 is an approach that was only any good in the past, since then, KSP evolved a lot and it became clear it\u0027s much more than just slapping stuff together (and when they fix the aerodynamics, it\u0027ll definitely end the era of downright stupid designs that nevertheless work well). Squad is moving that way with SP\u002B parts, too, and I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if rocket parts were remade at some point, too. Parts looking like junk are an anachronism that we need to get rid of, KSP has outgrown both this aesthetic and this playstyle. There is still some comedy in company names and part descriptions, but it\u0027s much less pronounced than originally was. As such, I think that \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E Jeb\u0027s Junkyard parts have any right to look silly, and even that should be used in moderation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say, keep it clean, sleek and good-looking.
