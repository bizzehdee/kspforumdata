How long will it take the asteroid to hit Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: I fear it will only be like 5 or 6 days, hard to tell exactly yet. The estimated size is 18 meters radius and a weight of around 1900 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: So no time to prepare the mining barge, refueling from Minmus takes way to long, especially considering the amount of fuel this barge needs. Why is the barge not powered up and refueled anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Well, this barge is a tad large, so it\u0027s not launched via a rocket. It launches more like an SSTO just with boosters. That means it\u0027s dry in orbit around Kerbin and needs to get refueled before it can actually start working ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: So we need another solution and launching another barge would not help\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: I fear so, yes, we need to talk to Linus and Gus engineers over at the research facility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/Linus_Kerman.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Linus_Kerman.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: We are listening anyway, this is a conference circuit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/Gus_Kerman.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Gus_Kerman.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus: Well whenever you guys have something I can slap together let me know, I\u0027ll start right away\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/Walt_Kerman.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Walt_Kerman.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWalt: Heh not so fast guys, shouldn\u0027t we tell something to the public?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: NO!

Not long and they come up with the Predator concept ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship has lots of fuel and lots of nukes to make lots of use of lots of fuel. It\u0027s supposed to be able to intercept the asteroid and hopefully to change the asteroids course. As usual in Kerbalverse, ships are more or less created in an instant. Actually Gus Kerman is the specialist to make such things happen. So first tests of the concept on the starting ramp began more or less immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/predator_00_01_test.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022predator_00_01_test.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was only one little backdraw to this: The ship has a take off weight 211 tons and it needs to be brought into orbit with full tanks! And in ONE piece! It also comes with a price tag of more than 280,000.- funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Thanks guys, but guess we need to make more overhours ... we don\u0027t have a rocket strong enough to launch this thing even five millimeters off the ground ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they continue to work until they had a solution. The engineers strictly followed the first design rule - known as \u0027Moar Boosters\u0027 - and came up with the Thor rocket. Now the total assembly takes shape and finally can be tested on the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/predator_thor_launchpad.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022predator_thor_launchpad.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrooke: Awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Dang, lets hope this thing will actually take off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: At least we could set her on the launch pad without her collapsing right away ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/Mortimer_Kerman.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Mortimer_Kerman.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMortimer: Guys ... look at the price tag - nearly 600,000.- funds.

After finishing launch preparations the thing took ... well ... not really off ...

The logs tell that there was a structural failure between one of the radial attachment thingamabobs and a booster. Which let the whole assembly collapse like a house of cards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Linus, Bill and the other engineers and scientists from KSC start work on refining the model ... silently admitting they were totally ignoring the 2nd most important rule of Kerbal construction - \u0027Moar Struts\u0027 ! After adding in a s...load of more struts they were finally set to launch Predator again. So Gus took his turn and tinkered the final model after the guys new blueprints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMortimer: Well the first launch cost us nearly 700,000.- funds including repair of the launch pad.

The main problem seemed to be that they didn\u0027t have enough conventional rocket thrust after dropping the solid fuel boosters. So they had to add in better engines. But better engines mean also the 3rd rule, moar fuel, needs to be satisfied. There is nothing in between a KR-2L\u002B (2000kn) and a S3 KS-25x4 (4000kn). But they didn\u0027t have enough thrust and adding more conventional engines like 2xMainsail would just require even moar parts. Considering the 4th rule of rocket building is \u0027less parts\u0027, that was not an option. So they finally decided to swap out the two KR-2L\u002B for two S3 KS-25x4. Of course with the new engines they needed some extra fuel. It was best, to add it to the center rocket, since that was still the smallest of them all. They added plenty of fuel!

Of course we have to fly a mission with it to see whether it works but i\u0027m pretty positive all will be fine. Can\u0027t wait to see it in action. And with Carrica on board I have a good feeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Even better.

A new vessel designed for intercepting the asteroid was developed: the Predator. The vessel launched and could, remote controlled, intercept the asteroid. But problems with navigation computer and the concept of the vessel made it impossible to redirect the asteroid off of his deadly trajectory. It finally crashed into Kerbin but at the same time simply vanished! The Kawds of Kerbin have obviously had their fingers in the game and rescued Kerbalkind - this time. Lots of snacks were eaten to calm the nerves as a consequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this incident and the unexpected survival, the scientists and engineers got a second chance to refine their concept.

Working on it ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few minutes of careful manouvering and a few hundred units of mono later the ship was docked to the asteroid facing the direction in which it needs to burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/ird777_docked.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ird777_docked.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrica: Made it, docked to asteroid, a little deviation between nose marker and pink target marker but guess thats within the tolerance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: Excellent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrica: I fear we have a problem. Despite the distance of the engines to the ships center, they are still too close to the asteroid! Let me do a test burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: Ok. Don\u0027t overdo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrica: KSC, we have a problem. As I already suspected the asteroid melts when I engage the engines! They are still too close to the asteroid, despite the construction of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/ird777_damaged.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ird777_damaged.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMortimer: Oh no. That\u0027ll be our next 600,000.- funds ruin in orbit if she can\u0027t deal with the asteroid!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/Gene_Kerman.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Gene_Kerman.jpg\u0022\u003EGene: As long as it stays under the control centers control I don\u0027t care whether it\u0027s a ruin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: Change of plans then: Mine the asteroid until your tanks are full and then we destroy it by melting it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrica: Ok. Switching to mining then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe resource miners at the ships rear end next to the claw sink their teeth into the asteroid and start mining it. Carrica engages the ISRU and converts the ore into mostly liquid fuel and also refills the mono reserves. Due to the density of ore in the asteroid, the ore tank fills a lot faster than the ISRU is using it up. Once full, the mining process doesn\u0027t stop though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/ird777_mining.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ird777_mining.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrica: Oh no, the resource miners don\u0027t suspend mining automatically once the tanks are full!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: DOH! Hmmmpf! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargggh!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a snack later -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: That renders asteroid mining practically useless! I hoped we could pull a few E class \u0027roids into orbit around Kerbin and do the refueling stuff there. Then we wouldn\u0027t have to fly our IP-tugs and stuff to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrica: Yes sigh. No unattended mining of \u0027roids like we do on Minmus or the Mun! Wonder what the devs thought when they were implementing the firmware for the miners?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: Probably nothing! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E (See also bug report at: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/133443-Bug-Asteroid-Resource-Extraction-Continues-when-Ore-Tank-Full-\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/133443-Bug-Asteroid-Resource-Extraction-Continues-when-Ore-Tank-Full-\u003C/a\u003E!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrica: Well for now going to fill my tanks and then destroying the roid!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mining and resource conversion continues until tanks are full. Then Carrica fires the engines again, just a bit. After an unexpected short while the asteroid simply vanishes as if it never existed! The resource miners are still extended and pointing into the void now. Not even an explosion or anything else that could be told to your grandchilds and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/ird777_destroyed.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ird777_destroyed.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrica: Did you see that? It didn\u0027t even take a lot to destroy the roid!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: OMK, if we had known that before we coudda saved Kerbin last time just by destroying the roid with our engines!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMortimer: What a fail and wasted funds!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWalt: I wouldn\u0027t say it was a fail. It was a great success actually. At least thats what I\u0027m gonna tell the public. For the first time we docked and MINED a class E asteroid! Doesn\u0027t sound bad to me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: Guess we need to go back to work with todays experience and redesign our interceptor!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrica: It would only be a fail if we didn\u0027t learn from our experiences. Guess I return to my sentinel orbit for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: Oh by the way, we have a problem on the Mun and we need you to help out. You are our last 3-star engineer available here in the vicinity around Kerbin. We need you for a rover repair on the Mun. So report back to Mun - Galileo station for now. Someone killed all 5 wheels on one side of his research rover and we have no funds to replace it now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/mun_broken_mantis.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mun_broken_mantis.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarrica: LOL, sigh and ok.
