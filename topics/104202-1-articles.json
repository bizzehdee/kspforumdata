Use a combination of prograde/retrograde and radial/anti-radial to tweak your encounter so you end up going the right direction to begin with. The earlier you correct (in general) the less delta-v it takes.

Just remember that when we say \u0027pass in front of the body to slow down, behind to speed up\u0027, we are talking about the direction the moon or whatever is going in, its own prograde. Your own direction is fairly moot, as long as you pass on the aft-side of the gravity well you will gain energy and visa-versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad you managed to flip at a moon, its very cost effective. I use it on Ike at Duna a lot too. Longrun the best bet is as stated to tweak your inbound trajectory while still way out of Jool SoI, but knowing how to reverse on a moon is a handy skill. (as is using moon slingshots to achieve huge apoapsis and performing a straight-up reverse out where you have hardly any orbital-velocity, then grav-braking back in.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T08:22:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 08:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
