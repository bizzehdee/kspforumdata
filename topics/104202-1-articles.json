Maybe I always end up in a retrograde orbit and just haven\u0027t noticed it because I rarely go to the moons of anything.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T21:02:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T20:33:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\*snip\\* I was thinking maybe this is because I sometimes make my transfer orbit overshoot my destination planet and other times I make it undershoot.\n\nIf I understand you correctly then you are right. If you overshoot the transfer a little your trajectory might go through the body and out the other side. This will put you on either a pro or a retrograde orbit.\n\nI reccommend just setting up a regular LKO and then hohmann transfer to the mun. As you edit the manouvre no you will notice that you can either come in on the Kerbin side of the mun, or on the \u0022outer side\u0022. This is what makes the difference.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T20:35:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler**"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T20:43:35Z","Content":"Thanks a lot.

Use a combination of prograde/retrograde and radial/anti-radial to tweak your encounter so you end up going the right direction to begin with. The earlier you correct (in general) the less delta-v it takes. In fact, for interplanetary transfers, I often fine tune with monopropellant (RCS translation controls: H and N keys) because the main engines are too powerful and move my encounter too much."},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T08:18:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I knew some kind of interaction like that was possible and the basis of gravity assists but I never knew what the rules were exactly so thanks again. Are these rules reversed if the body you encounter is travelling in the opposite direction?\n\nNo the rules dont reverse. Just remember that when we say \u0027pass in front of the body to slow down, behind to speed up\u0027, we are talking about the direction the moon or whatever is going in, its own prograde. Your own direction is fairly moot, as long as you pass on the aft-side of the gravity well you will gain energy and visa-versa.\n\nGlad you managed to flip at a moon, its very cost effective. I use it on Ike at Duna a lot too. Longrun the best bet is as stated to tweak your inbound trajectory while still way out of Jool SoI, but knowing how to reverse on a moon is a handy skill. (as is using moon slingshots to achieve huge apoapsis and performing a straight-up reverse out where you have hardly any orbital-velocity, then grav-braking back in.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T08:22:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 08:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by celem**"}]}
