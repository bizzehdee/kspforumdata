It could check if there are vessels landed on the planet and then check if they contain Kethane, but such a mechanic would break realism when the Kethane patch was depleted, or the particular Kethane was actually shipped in from elsewhere. Taking all that into account would require more complicated code. It might be a better idea if Kethane users wanted such functionality to have some dedicated relay system where you would deliver fuel to a ground station which would then with delay be delivered to an orbiting station. It\u0027s much easier to make something like that from the ground up and it would integrate better with the Kethane game mechanic than to try and squeeze it in the current mod in a somewhat acceptable way.\u003Cp\u003E ... \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there are at least two people who would like something like this.

The plugin allows the part to cycle through vessels on the surface of the planet below. The plugin can then be requested to take up to a certain amount of fuel from the selected vessel (the resource and the amounts can be configured in the part.cfg file of the part the partmodule is installed into and can for instance work for Kethane). After a time interval the fuel will be delivered to the station the part is attached to. I will clean up the code and do some bug checking tomorrow. A couple of weeks ago another modder indicated he was planning on making a Kethane enabled Davon-module part, so \u003Cem\u003Emaybe\u003C/em\u003E we also have a part to go with it as this plugin will better match with Kethane than the Davon Supply plugin (I\u0027m not a very good modeler myself).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmiteZero","CreatedById":10862,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T11:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry if it\u0027s been mentioned, but can this be modified in any way to deliver other types of resources besides the stock ones?
