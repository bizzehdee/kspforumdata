Three main sources of science: Gravity mesures; Landing a mirror; Bringing \u0027goo\u0027 to perform fly-by near the Mun.\n\u003E - When accepting the \u0022Plant a flag on the Mun! Hurry up!\u0022, some experimental parts appear on research nodes.\n\u003E - Scientific intruments must be put on the probe core (or the command pod) to gather their \u0022science slot\u0022. It\u0027s mandatory to keep them in working condition. The science slot is consumed at liftoff.\n\u003E - When activating the thermometer, the barometer or the gravimeter (for gathering science), the instrument can break. Failing chances are between 22 and 35% (depending on difficulty).\n\u003E - Each type of breakable instrument cannot break two times in a row on the same vessel. There are two sequences that are not possible: break-\u003Ebreak, and break-\u003Esuccess-\u003Esuccess-\u003Ebreak .\n\u003E - Be carefull when activating the instrument (gathering science): it can break your instrument even if no science is gathered. Check twice the vessel situation and biome (it\u0027s displayed on the screen) against your science check list.\n\u003E - Some experiments have already been done. Check against this cheat-sheet (made by [creepyD](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61632-0-23-5-Better-Than-Starting-Manned-Career-Mode-Redefined-%28v1-56-May-7th%29/page204?p=984915#post984915)) for btsm): [link](https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=24b14eb57322c2f4\u0026id=24B14EB57322C2F4!147) (note: you should fill experiments already done).\n\u003E - New Science instrument: Mirror. Need to be landed on the Mun. Gain 150 science. Data size is displayed in the VAB.\n\u003E - Mystery Goo is special: operable only via eva, can\u0027t break and result can be transmit via an antenna.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - When staging an engine, it consumes an igniter.\n\u003E - When throttling down to zero, the engine(s) stops. So you can\u0027t throttle down to the minimum thrust of your engines without shutting them down (be carefull).\n\u003E - When throttling up from zero the engine(s) restart, consuming an other igniter.\n\u003E - When you start your engine without an igniter available, its isp is reduced 50 times (it\u0027s venting your precious fuel in the deep space). It\u0027s easy to notice: there are no more exhaust flames.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - To do a test, you need to create a vessel with an antenna and some \u0022test instrument\u0022 resources.\n\u003E - The testing level of each engine is displayed on the contextual menu (right-clic).\n\u003E - Testing engines at ground level is enough, you don\u0027t need to test them in space.\n\u003E - When an engine explode in testing, the warranty is applied and you are refund.\n\u003E - To test the parachute, it must be activated via staging (no need to test it at an higher altitude than ground level: it\u0027s a work in progress).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nsource: [https://github.com/supermerill/KSP-Mun-rush](https://github.com/supermerill/KSP-Mun-rush)\n\nlicence: apache2\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T16:28:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Merill**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T13:01:44Z","Content":"Sounds very specialized to have that many dependencies which aren\u0027t included in the zip file. \n\nFor the dependencies, can\u0027t you ask permission to include them?"},{"CreatedByName":"Merill","CreatedById":136069,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T14:28:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sounds very specialized to have that many dependencies which aren\u0027t included in the zip file. \n\u003E For the dependencies, can\u0027t you ask permission to include them?\n\nYou\u0027re right, it\u0027s a thing i need to work on.\n\n- btsm and kct: it\u0027s not advisable to skip their post.
