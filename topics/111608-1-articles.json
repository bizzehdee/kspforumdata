This is very useful for painting extra scratches etc. Tho some things like adding geometric shapes edge effects and patterns are much better done i ps/gimp imo.\n\nOfcource if you are just texturing other ppls models then ps/gimp might be the only thing you need.\n\nAs said texture baking(color/ao/normals/cavity from highpoly or directly from your lowpoly) is also very valuable in the texturing process but not required\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T14:53:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T01:49:19Z","Content":"I use Photoshop CS3, GIMP to convert my bump maps to normal maps, and GraphiConverter 9 to convert my textures to DDS."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T01:57:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I use Photoshop CS3, GIMP to convert my bump maps to normal maps, and GraphiConverter 9 to convert my textures to DDS.\n\nYou do know you can use GIMP also to convert DDS."},{"CreatedByName":"martinezfg11","CreatedById":59995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T18:09:12Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been using Photoshop until I met 3D Coat.\n\n3D Coat is AWESOME.
