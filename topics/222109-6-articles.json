You need to have colonies (not necessarily full colonies, but something to either consume or process the resources) to have any reason to collect them. As far as resource collection being after interstellar, honestly I think a big reason might just be because interstellar is far cooler/a bigger reveal. Resource collection and management is (can be) a really cool logistical mini-game. Interstellar is something totally brand new and far more exciting for the large majority of players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree absolutely with your first point, and I can see also how letting players play with interstellar drives and build up constraint-free interstellar vessels will give the devs a sense of what goal transport mass and fuel quantities are needed to cross that threshold, but precisely because all of those free-parts, free-colonies, free-interstellar settlements and vessels will be essentially driven by luxury and cosmetics rather than efficiency its not going to give good mark-to-market values for those endeavors. I\u0027ll also put out there that if we don\u0027t have \u003Cstrong\u003Eproper transfer window and flight planning tools\u003C/strong\u003E the devs aren\u0027t going to see a substantial portion of the the player base going interplanetary let alone contemplating interstellar flight. Its the same as adding all these dope discoverables and not giving players the in-game tools to find them. In some ways incorporating resources after colonies but before interstellar might sound at face value less sexy but actually gives players way more actual gameplay to bite into earlier.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
