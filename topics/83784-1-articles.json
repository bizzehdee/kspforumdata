Each tree component would have some or all types of points required to progress. So for example new lander pod tech would be say 60% Spaceflight Science Points, 20% Medical Science Points, and 20% Planetary Science Points (made up %s ). Most rockets engines might have just Spaceflight Science Points, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlanetary Science (PS):\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---Mapping (orbital flights)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---Surface samples\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---Geology (seismic, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---Atmospheric data\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese would give points mostly towards making better instrumentation for doing this kind of science.

These points would go towards habitat tech, including any manned elements of spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tech tree might in fact be tied more closely to the contract idea. Spitballing, here...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get a broad contract from Kerlington to develop a new command pod. It has parts. The first is a manned, orbital flight in a Mk1 pod of some set duration. It might have another requirement for a certain reentry (XXXX-XYYY m/s at 69,000m alt). Another might be to lift 5 tons to LKO or something, then deorbit it and land safely with parachutes. These are \u0022SS\u0022 experiments, while the time in orbit is a MS experiment and the reentry is PS. You\u0027d be doing the science to get THAT item by contract. At some point you get it provisionally to test. Obviously this could be tuned to tech tree groupings, not single items. Perhaps you pick a node to work on, and it lists the required points needed from each discipline of science, then you design missions to accomplish those goals, contract or not. In this case, the specific node might have additional requirements that look sorta like contracts. Meaning that you need PS points, but out of the 10 you need, 5 must be gathered at an altitude from 30-60km for this node. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout mapping, perhaps the map view of a world shows little data. the Mun would be decent from telescopic observation, but Dres? Maybe a flat picture with only rough altitude information. So you can land your probe, but using the map to deorbit to a certain location\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 not helpful, it\u0027s seat of the pants flying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T18:18:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis suggestion for the game\u0027s development has been moved to the Suggestions and Development Dicussion subforum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T19:13:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery kind of scientific research suffers from a phenomenon called diminishing results.
