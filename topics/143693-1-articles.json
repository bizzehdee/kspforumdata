To. Build. A. Propeller?????? Seriously, I encounter some really unexpected things when building such devices and I have no idea of the theory behind IRL props. First of all, no matter how I build a hinge, the propeller in it is very jumpy. But this one isn\u0027t as bad, as I\u00A0recently reverse-engineered a Hazardish hinge (I tried doing it myself, but failed, so I downloaded one craft using it, saved the hinge into subassembly, and used it in a test aircraft. It worked quite well, still jumpy, but better). A problem is also \u0022How should I rotate my prop?\u0022. Due to simplicity, most my propeller\u00A0craft\u00A0are reaction wheel powered, and some use\u00A0tip jets. I tried to use jet engine exhaust (so, an engine with an internal rotation source), but\u00A0it somehow\u00A0didn\u0027t create any rotation and I soon recognized that tip jets give bigger rotation speed for less fuel anyway. Then, is probably the biggest problem. How to build the prop itself? I don\u0027t exactly understand what effects does rotation and forward movement speeds have on the prop. I found out that placing the wings of the propeller further out gives WAY better effects. A vehicle with a reverse-engineered hazardish hinge and one small reaction wheel to rotate the prop, with the prop itself being made of wing connector type E\u00A0could barely move even with gravity hacked no matter how many blades it had. When the same engine had a prop made of two wctE\u0027s it could go 10 m/s with hack gravity (somehow, the inner wctE\u0027s created reverse thrust\u00A0when I enabled aero forces overlay while going at max speed, and the outer ones always thrusted forward). When I mounted a single wctE, but on an I-beam, I got to 19\u00A0m/s without gravity. I tried different numbers of blades, this appears to change initial acceleration but do nothing with max speed. I also used different blade pitch angles, and higher pitch gives higher top speed (my 19m/s record is with 60^ pitch this gives terrible initial acceleration, but it accelerates pretty good after 5 m/s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T01:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222673900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143693\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468396142\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160216\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheDestroyer111\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, TheDestroyer111 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m gonna stand out of this section by asking a question that isn\u0027t explained (or even told of)\u00A0ingame: How.

Propeller theory isn\u0027t that difficult and there are a few simple rules:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nHigher RPM = always better. There\u0027s a limit in Physx/Unity/KSP, it varies but it\u0027s usually\u00A0 around 50 rad/s (477 RPM).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLarge prop diameter is usually a good idea, but it puts a strain on the bearings at higher RPM when changing direction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMore blades is usually a good idea, but due to higher mass does the same as a larger prop diameter with bearing load at higher RPM.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVariable prop pitch is always good.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t talk about tip jets or reaction wheel drives, I invented the turboshaft/turboprop engine with a reason. But ... following guideline works for both electric engines and turboprops.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0027s what you do: First you design an engine and make sure it runs fine without load. Then you add a propeller, start with a 2 bladed prop and make it variable (probe core, battery \u0026amp; control surface as prop blades). Make sure you have a way of reading your engine speed. I always use V.O.I.D., it\u0027s the best. Do not use Kerbal Engineer, it gives faulty info.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFind the max allowed RPM for your engine, then start adjusting your prop pitch and keep a safety margin for normal operation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are some of the basics.
