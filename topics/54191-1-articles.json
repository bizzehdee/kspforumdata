So perhaps, and I understand it may not be possible at all, it might be easier to implement a form of co-op multiplayer. Where you and your friends fly a single craft together as different Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMerely an idea that could add a few things to enjoyment, you for one would be able to share you gameplay with a friend directly, even more direct than multiplayer through multiple crafts or competitive space programs. There could be implementations of each person having limited roles and abilities, for example you could do a pilot and a navigator. The pilot cannot access the map but can fly the space craft, the navigator can access the map but cannot fly the spacecraft. This would make for some great amounts of cooperation and probably quite a bit of swearing and yelling \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to hear peoples thoughts on this idea and maybe it could be the source of an earlier implementation of a basic multiplayer.
