In other word, said rover on its way to duna, from the tracking station you would see its position delayed, so if you were to take control of the ship it would be farther than what you see in the tracking station. That way you\u0027ll have the delayed position, as well as delayed commands to the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would make a very close to real life gameplay, since you\u0027ll probably have to script a landing sequence with kOS for exemple into the vessel and all you can do is wait and monitor, with a delay, evrything from the tracking station, like in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe also add to that cameras, again theres already mods that add cameras, but imagine these would send their footage and we would recieve them with a delay, evrything would have already happened. And going to spectate the ship would kind of be the cheat-way of looking in real time at what is happening, but wouldn\u0027t be able to to control it, since commands are issued from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, or a remote guidance unit, and delay will be inforce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-14T19:45:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds pretty niche, like Mission Control Simulator.\u00A0I can\u2019t see it appealing to many players tbh as I think many would rather play the game \u2018live\u2019 and control the vessel rather than watch a little blip on a screen moving about. But then there\u2019s plenty of mods that appeal to others that don\u2019t to me so who knows?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-14T20:44:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/211144-eliosaade/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022211144\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/211144-eliosaade/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ElioSaade\u003C/a\u003E idk if you\u0027ld be in the same boat with control-only affected, with this mod...vOv\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022141813\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6919827558\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/166584-19-signal-delay-0213-2020-08-21-signal-delay-background-antenna-ec-consumption/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-14T20:44:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2021 08:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-14T20:46:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223954013\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201692\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221618352957\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022211144\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ElioSaade\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, ElioSaade said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd going to spectate the ship would kind of be the cheat-way of looking in real time at what is happening\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s an interesting idea.
