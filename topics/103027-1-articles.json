But it is not as interesting as the storytelling mechanics, the world building effort, and the intriguing plots.\n\nIt is a very much living story that you play in the game, and one that change based on your choice. And oh, the choices...if there is one thing I have to say about Pillar of Eternity, it will be \u0022There is no easy choice\u0022. There is no clear cut good and evil choice in this game in this bleak world where the only morality is grey. You may have to make some questionable choice. You may have to judge other characters doing questionable choices. Nothing is certain, and unless you choose to ruin your experience with spoiler (the only real bad choice ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)), you will always be left wondered \u0022Did I do the right things?\u0022\n\nIt really draws me into its world and makes me feel like I am writing my own story in that world (the character\u0027s biography actually updates with your major choices and record it).\n\nQuite a great experience for those who are less interested in fancy graphic (not that the game graphic is any bad) and love a deep, deep story in a wonderful world to explore.\n\nAnyway, my sorta review is done here, go try it!"},{"CreatedByName":"segaprophet","CreatedById":14087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T12:43:38Z","Content":"It\u0027s on my Steam wish list.

It got completed."},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:04:20Z","Content":"This game caught my attention, too. I saw a nice review by Super Bunnyhop on YT and i like what i saw. \n\nI loved Baldurs Gate 2 for its story telling and combat. Perhaps i see BG2 through the glasses of nostalgia but i remember the fights as the most epic."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T14:18:37Z","Content":"I gotta say, I really love the writing of this game. The interaction of the characters really make them lively:\n\n\\*A fighter character asked the ranger about her animal companion\\*\n\nFighter: Hey, [ranger\u0027s name], does your fox bite?\n\nRanger: Yes.\n\nFighter: Can I pet him anyway?\n\nRanger: It is your hand.\n\nFighter: I am going to pet him.\n\n\\*later on\\*\n\nRanger: How\u0027s the hand?\n\nFighter: Turning purple.
