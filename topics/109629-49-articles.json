The one dragon uploaded is the most recent version. There might be a newer version however that one would be wildly outdated and I think the official ISS community forum page has a link to the old kerbal spaceport which doesn\u0027t exist anymore. Also I understand that it\u0027s a tough undertaking because to get the ISS to work you need to get MIR working. And for pirs and poisk you need to get the R7 and Soyuz working.
