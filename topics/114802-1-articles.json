The lights emission changes color, the light itself does not. TV\u0027s (and Marquee\u0027s and other such display devices) work by the individual pinpoint of light created at the source, not it\u0027s emissive.\n\nThat said, you could make an all white marquee since the texture does brighten when turned on, however having it actively change is another story, you might could do it with action groups to display a few messages though. You would have to set every single bulb in each action group to turn on or off based on your design. Do not use the toggle option.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T21:18:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 09:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Plume \u0026amp; Akakak","CreatedById":142955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T21:27:41Z","Content":"It could work.
