So I have a lot of different tanks with different values and balances. Every now and then I get a craft doing various tasks suddenly spiral out of control - after checking the fuel balance is okay I noticed that one of the engines was flickering its power back and forth for no reason - if I reduce its twin down to 50% trust it would even out the flickering but wasn\u0027t a solution especially if another engine started having the same issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft were built with small radial tanks with engines stowed under them - everyone assumed it was either a flame out issue (on nukes) or that I had mucked up the symmetry. I would swap out the bugged out craft and it would behalf normally. Well last night I was doing a landing and I was monitoring my fuel on one of my craft and while it was landing it started spinning out of control as soon as one of the middle tanks had depleted - this gave me a clue as to what could be causing it and after a couple of crashes and reloads I was mucking about with the fuel mix moving fuel from one tank to the other using the fuel pump settings. At one point I turned off all the auto-pump settings on all the tanks and the craft righted itself straight away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease bear in mind that I have looked in to this in great detail and all of the radial tanks show plenty of fuel in them whether I have the balancer on or not - its just used for when the ship docks it automatically fuels up or offloads its fuel depending on the type of craft. So its not a fuel balance issue per se.
