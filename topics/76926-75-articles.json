Also some larger cannons are going to have bigger explosions than others, and certainly I, at least, would want a cannon that shoots the before mentioned nukes. having the ability to scale explosions based on some value in the config file, would be extremely helpful to those who would take it further by making fusion bombs and even antimatter bombs or shells so that a gun can shoot it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -third, and by far the most important point, the ability to change firing modes. for example, say i have some howitzers that shoot 7 rounds a minute. that is by far to long a wait between shells, so i suggest that a sequenced firing mode be added, that way by adding more guns I can increase the firing rate. another not unrelated point i would like to bring up is the fact that some guns are bound solely to a mouse click and not to the \u0022fire\u0022 button in the weapons controller, please change this so that i can fire with the fire button. I would like to add that I play with a ps4 controller and have action group 1 set to the right trigger(r2) and my camera mapped to the right stick, by adding \u0022fire\u0022 to action group 1, it would help me to shoot with the controller, but as it stands this method does not work. playing with a controller in the right hand and a mouse in the left is not an effective strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -fourth, last thing, I promise, some battleship guns would be cool. I mean single gun, double gun, and triple gun turret variants, if possible, within one part config, so that the user can tweak the part to add and subtract guns to and from the turret. not just 16 in. guns either but like 12 in. guns and even 20 in. guns and 30 in. guns like the really big railway guns of WWII... which could shoot nukes by the way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E that\u0027s it, thanks for your time\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T14:47:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the seismic charge, but is there any way to make the \u0022ring\u0022 part more horizontal?

Having my own lock on indicator but keeping the basic, current way of selecting a target could work for now. There is a very long way to go before this mod gets to the level of PvP and PvE that I would be proud of. Since KSP is not meant for combat, nor multiplayer, and DMP is not built for combat, a lot stands in the way. If it ever does get to that point, though, then I will reconsider a more interesting method of locking targets, as it will become necessary for gameplay/balance.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about something simmilar to BF4 SA-18 IGLA, it\u0027s very simple and works very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I missed the white ring for the mouse aim the last time I played, it was better before when we had it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes the gun limits can make it hard to know where your mouse is, and also aiming around gets harder.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-12T21:12:48Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2014 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tetryds\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BahamutoD","CreatedById":72433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T21:13:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Space Scumbag\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Space Scumbag\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, some not so good news. The seismic charges doesn\u0027t work very well in space. The problem is the orbit velocity. When it explodes the effect expandes only in the current orbit position, while the other crafts move away from it with their respective orbit speed. I tried it in Duna orbit with ca. 550 m/s orbit speed. You can\u0027t see the explosion when you are too fast, or at least it is far away from you. For now it is only enjoyable on slow orbits like Gilly with its 9m/s. Is there a way to make the effect travelling in space?

The explosion is supposed to be stationary, but in what frame of reference? How should I decide what it should be stationary with? The firing craft\u0027s orbital velocity? The bomb\u0027s orbital velocity? In both of those instances, the explosion would appear to be moving to an observer, say on a nearby space station. Also, on surface bombing, the explosion would be moving in relation to the surface.

The fire limits prevent you from firing if you are trying to aim at something that is outside the range of motion of the turret. Since you set yours to not be able to yaw, it will never be in range unless you put your mouse exactly within its plane of motion. Turning off fire limits lets you fire it even if your mouse is not within the range of motion. It\u0027s useful for any fixed turret, or like in your case, a turret fixed to one axis. I made it automatically free the limit when both axes are set to zero, but I guess I need to make it happen when \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E axis is zero.
