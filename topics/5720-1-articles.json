On top of that, politicians are worried about their summertime \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Etans\u003C/span\u003Eolives, and have thrust a truckload of money at KSC to fix this problem. Literally. It arrived on a truck in pallets. It\\\u0027s all ones, though. Anyway, the scientists aren\\\u0027t all that great at engineering, nor do they have the purchasing power you have. However, the politicians demand a spectacle, as re-elections are coming up and all their butts are on the line if this mission fails. Naturally, you\\\u0027re in the spotlight, as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, you are charged with developing the largest, most complex rocket possible in order to deliver the trainload of scientific stuff you don\\\u0027t really understand into a stable Kerbol orbit. Closer to Kerbol is preferred, but beware of Space Krakens. After one (1) successful orbit of Kerbol, you are to return your crispy astronauts to Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAcceptable Parts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Stock (duh)[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]NovaPunch[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]DownUnder[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]K\u0026amp;W[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Mission Aerospace (RSDs only, not that there\\\u0027s anything else)[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Docking Node[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E[li]Probodobodyne[/li]\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar panels are only acceptable if used in conjunction with very low-thrust engines, such as ion drives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdits that add non-functional items (such as hab modules or decoration) are fine, as long as they have appropriate drag and weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Parameters\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bigger, the better. Your orbit stage should be large enough to handle a bunch of green midgets for the duration of an orbit. This means food, water, waste management, power (enough to power the instruments, as well). You\\\u0027ll also have science equipment to handle and support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, you have to get off the planet and out of Kerbin\\\u0027s SOI.
