Quick question if I may. I have tried to install ISA mapsat x4 on to KSP 0.90. I attatch the dish yet all I see when I hit the icon on the bottom left of my screen is a grey rectangular box on my screen? I have tried extracting to ksp, moving to ksp etc, yet every time the outcome is the same? Is it me or the wrong mapsat?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T17:23:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maceemiller**\n  \nanswered"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T06:56:29Z","Content":"IIRC, ISA Mapsat is no longer being developed?\n\n[EDIT: [It isn\u0027t](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/9396-0-22-ISA-MapSat-4-0-Dev-Build?p=1494709\u0026viewfull=1#post1494709).]\n\nIf that\u0027s the case, it will not be able to find the biome information, as that was moved to a different location in 0.90.0.
