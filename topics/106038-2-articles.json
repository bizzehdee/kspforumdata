It is not QA that codes or even that decides what is in game or not or what bugs are worth to lose time fixing ( or even if they are fixable at all ) ..."},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:53:28Z","Content":"I agree that blaming the testers themselves isn\u0027t fair. \n\nOne thing I\u0027m curious about is sort of a dissection of how an individual bug makes it into the release.

Personally most of the 1.0 features are stuff that is what i consider extra ontop of a already good game. the only features that i really cared for and wouldnt have been happy without are the aero improvements, as now we get (minus some bugs) a MUCH more plausible model, where stuff makes logical sense. The only other features were the speed ups, optimizations, and mem leak fixes that made KSP annoying and unplayeable over longer times. This was done well, and while there is still plenty that could be optimized (for example load textures on demand instead of on game start), its still a massive improvement over the old versions.\n\nThat said, there are many bugs that did get into the release, many of which are such outright exploits its not even funny, such as what is below.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/TrJTd)\n\nWhile im sure this is an oversight (and im guessing the devs never intended for people to build craft this way in the 1st place), the occlusion system for drag/heating is completely broken right now. I understand its not possible to catch every bug out there, but im guessing stuff liek this really should have been patched out before release.\n\nThat said, the issue with testing in my opinion is that its hard to imagine all the possible situations without going into a very wide variety of players. For example i tend to abuse part clipping ALOT, critisisms about my playstyle aside, this has shown me many many bugs in the new occlusion system, and many of the corners that are cut for it end up creating exploits. You gusy need to create a WAY larger experimentals team, im not saying open it up to EVERYONE, but perhaps include a few more players, and try to get a wide variety of construction styles in too. Some build rockets, some make real life replicas, some make whackjob sci-fi craft, and some just strap a booster to a pod and call it a day. While i dont know who is on the experimentals team, nor how they play the game, i feel they could use a larger subset of the community, especially a few players that push the boundaries of the game and dont make classical rocket designs. These are the people that are more likely to catch bugs, as the game seems to be designed around classical stuff, classical rocket, planes, ect, and the whackjob builders can actually catch alot of bugs (for example the one i found within 2 days of testing).\n\nStill, while i might sound a little critical, im sure everyone has their ups and downs (i know many people are mad that craft broke, that jets nolonger go to LKO alone, ect), but overall ill say its a very good upgrade to an already awesome game. Just consider adding more testers so we can have more likelyhood of catching bugs."},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:21:07Z","Content":"Is anyone actually blaming the testers?

But takes those 1 or 2 issues and multiply them by a hundred and you\u0027re closer to the amount of things the testers and devs sorted through since testing was announced. There will never be a perfect release, and thats a fact.\n\nWhile your post is informative and all, there\u0027s one simple problem (and that\u0027s a fact). Bugfinding and fixing was not even done by the time the 48h stream was going, see the bug scott manley ran into live on stream when he lost aerodynamics on his surfboard, when he closed the cargo bays on the launching vehicle again. That\u0027s something that i would\u0027ve absolutely understood if overseen. Yet, that was actually fixed, so apparently that was more important than other issues. Now one can categorize bugs (and of course, you guys do that too) - one hand has the \u0022i\u0027m dicking around with stupid things, somethings not working there\u0022 bug, and the other has glaring issues with the core of the game, namely reentry/parachutes/aerodynamics. See the problem?\n\nApart from that, the whole time, people are trying to sell the Q\u0026A team as an entity completely unrelated to the development, that is just plain wrong. Of course the Q\u0026A is part of the development, one of the most important actually. I know quite a few games that got their releases delayed because of a Q\u0026A team that said it isn\u0027t ready (one will release in a bit less than 10 days, finally TT), and that\u0027s what should\u0027ve happened here too - but by the looks and sound, the \u0022rushed feel\u0022 of things in the game might have to do with the fact that the release was indeed rushed for some reason."},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:29:54Z","Content":"My complaints, as they have been for months, all boil down to the insanity of putting so many changes into a \u0022final\u0022 release.

Doing a - not good - but passable job under pressure can be admirable... but not when that pressure is entirely artificial and self-imposed.\n\n\u0022How did the testers miss this\u0022 is answered nicely by Tiberion above.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s also entirely possible we didn\u0027t \u0022miss\u0022 something you think we did.

Constructive criticism is one thing, but some people have been downright hostile.\n\nSome people are complaining that the reason some bugs made it through is because of the almost complete lack of a beta test. That is a fair assessment: The point of a beta test is to get the (almost) finished product out to a bunch of people so it can be thoroughly tested before calling it complete, and Squad didn\u0027t do that with 1.0. \n\nHowever, the problem of an early access game is all of the hype. Squad had to find a balance between releasing a perfect game, and releasing a game with a bunch of brand new features to get people hyped. Like it or not, they have to make money off of this game, so they\u0027ll need some hype behind the release to increase sales. Now, you could easily argue that they found the wrong balance and should have been a bit more careful at the cost of a bit less hype. But that\u0027s really just a matter of opinion. In the end, all it comes down to is semantics: No matter what the version is called (beta vs. release), it\u0027ll still end up in the same situation.

Of course this is purely speculation, but ...\n\nYou are indeed speculating and you are wrong on a lot of it.

I always always want more time (and I would be a terrible QA manager because of that) I haven\u0027t really changed my mind, but in the end the only thing different from all the other releases is a special version number, this release is not especially bad in any way and things are being greatly overstated to fit in the narrative.\n\nMore straight talk: Something required this specific launch schedule to happen, the reasons are not known, not even to testers and may never be. **It doesn\u0027t matter now, move on.**\n\n(end of part directed at Kerbart)\n\nI\u0027ll restate it again: what people consider very important and glaringly obvious inside the echo chamber of the forums is completely different than what we\u0027re dealing with after a couple of weeks and hundreds of instances of feedback being logged. It\u0027s your OPINION that we should have changed \u0027re-entry/parachutes/aero\u0027 instead of \\*\\*\\*\\*ing around, but we \\*DID\\* submit bugs and feedback on those multiple times, and they were tweaked and changed over many builds as well. So the end results may not be perfect or what you want; time to deal with it and offer proper feedback for future versions rather than assigning blame or whatever.\n\nAlso, without getting too much into how the \u0027sausage\u0027 is made - we tested through the weekend, but there is always a point in testing where things begin to get locked down, major changes won\u0027t happen unless critical, so that the last period of time is spent just making sure none of those critical bugs make it in. (one or two usually do anyway though)\n\nAnd something I didn\u0027t mention earlier; a very important part of testing is confirming that an issue that was published in a new build was fixed and that no new issues are caused as a result.

Kudos ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIn the same vein, I feel that the backlash was inevitable considering the lack of a true feature-complete beta, e.g. a 0.99 release before 1.0. Releasing 0.99 and insisting that **there are surely still plenty of bugs** before calling it 1.0 might have diminished the criticism. Avid, loyal players\u0027 criticism is the least of Squad\u0027s concerns at this point."},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:03:35Z","Content":"I cannot and will not get into specifics on any one issue (parachutes, heat, pod balance et al) because that is only going to provoke more fingerpoinitng which is exactly what we do not want or need.\n\nConsider this though: there are thousands of combinations of parts and one of the greatest difficulties in testing is checking all of those combinations for \u0022edge cases\u0022 where doing certain things in an odd way reveals a flaw. And again, we do miss things. It\u0027s easy to say something is \u0022obvious\u0022 and \u0022completely breaks something\u0022 after you already know about it. When you\u0027ve spent a few days testing both in various states its much less obvious. That will have to satisfy your curiosity for now, sorry.\n\nTo clarify; I am not a \u0022QA\u0022 guy - they are members of Squad and actually work for a living. I am just a veteran member of the experimentals team, which is just volunteer community members selected to take part in the final stage of closed testing. As a tester I have no extra knowledge about the release schedule (seriously, this isn\u0027t a \u0022I know but can\u0027t tell you\u0022 situation.) As a community member just like you, I think its pretty clear there was something that was driving the release schedule for 1.0, be it outside sources, business reasons, or just unspecified development concerns. IE: 1.0 was happening and there\u0027s no stopping it. It\u0027s time to accept that.\n\nDo I think it might have been \u0022better\u0022 for KSP to have another beta release? Yep, I said so several times in the past in he various posts about that subject.\n\nDo I think this build was rushed? Not really, not any more than others have been. Other than a special version number this has been a fairly typical release and the world will keep on spinning, just as it has.\n\nAgain, I think that people keep talking like this build is deeply flawed because it fits a narrative better (and we all like saying \u0022I was right!\u0022) but it\u0027s not really so severe. \n\nI really don\u0027t think I have much more to say about this so I probably won\u0027t. I\u0027d just urge everyone to turn the page, leave specific feedback if you don\u0027t think something is addressed, and then go back to playing the game. It\u0027s fun!\n\nBack to editing configs for Novapunch for me ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"falloutaddict","CreatedById":140606,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:13:29Z","Content":"If it makes anyone feel any better I REALLY like the release. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) No complaints here."}]}
