The game looks at the parts and determines if you can control it or not, ect, and then you can reassign the label in the tracking station I believe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a piece of equipment that you put down might be considered debris, but if you change the label in the tracking station, it won\u0027t be destroyed by the \u0022garbage collector\u0022. However, I doubt that if you have a research station or equipment like this that the game would auto assign it as debris, especially if it\u0027s meant to be left alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr: game probably smart, will see if vessel is supposed to be there, if not it gets collected, if it\u0027s good it stays\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
