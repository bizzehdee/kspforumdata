Crewed by a single kerb after the only lander flew home with a full complement of crew, there were some lonely nights out there. But then I landed my first rover (and my first mod part, hooray) with Bill as the lone pilot. Seeing as this was one of Bill\u0027s first missions to the Mun after he was the first to set foot there, I found a drive to be rather fitting. After a dozen or so kilometers, Bill parked neatly next to the crew building and shook hands with its single occupant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the real hullabaloo came when I attempted a minimalist mission, and stranded Kirford on the Mun with bare kilograms of fuel remaining. Some people might have scrapped the mission, but I try to never leave a kerb behind. I knew I could use the lander to get Kirford into orbit with the help of his pack RCS, but I also have never done an orbital rendezvous. And the only point on the Mun that I knew how to consistently get to was my Mun base, some forty kilometers away...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a ten-kilometer RCS pack flight that almost killed poor Kirford, I set to the task of walking him home. After almost nine hours real-time, Kirford slid gently down on his feet into the canyon that housed my Munbase. Just as he reached the top of the ladder, the sun rose. It was probably my toughest and most rewarding ordeal in KSP, especially considering the fact that I kept an eye on the computer the whole time (it was hilly terrain, and I was worrying about taking a fatal tumble.) Ahh, memories...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"royalkingofgames","CreatedById":23658,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T12:08:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emy first 0.16 moon landing i named the kerbals after me and my my friends, i let one of my friends(kerbal) eva and fly around the moon but i hit the very tall nosecone of my ship killing my friend and knocking the ship over i managed to self right but i used all my fuel,so i rescued me and my other friend and left that ship on the moon as a giant gravestone i wrote my friends name and date of death as the ships name and my other kerbals always eva when they orbit past the grave as a sign of respect\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JackAz","CreatedById":46219,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T14:03:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHad a kerbal left on a southern isle of kerbin ( went there during mission) but didnt have any fuel left !

Now, this aircraft looks nice but, true to the original design, has no tailfin making it incredibly unstable. Still, it flies with a bit of wrestling so I decided to make its maiden flight a shot for the North Pole. Jeb naturally stepped up to the plate in order to pilot this thing, and we took off. The first challenge, banking around steeply to a northbound heading without plummeting out of the sky was overcome with ease and I relaxed a bit - maybe it wasn\u0027t so bad to fly after all. After a bit of flying, I decided to test its ability to fly high-atmosphere using an aerospike meant to simulate the craft\u0027s stratoshpheric engines. Up we went, to 45000m before burning out and plummeting back into the atmosphere at 800m/s. Once we were low enough and slow enough, the autopilot was disengaged and we continued North. Not a hitch in sight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout half an hour in, the fuel started running pretty low and it was obvious the target wouldn\u0027t be reached, so I called for a landing on a nearby plain. Jeb comes in with the engines off, hoping for a glide - landing, but vertical speed was too high and he had to engage the engines, coming in at high horizontal speed. The wheels touched the ground so lightly the suspension didn\u0027t even notice, and Jeb let it coast for a bit, got bored and pulled the plane into a powerslide, causing the whole thing to disintegrate. I thought he was lost, but then, out of the wreckage, rolled an intact cockpit with a very much alive Jeb inside, grinning like a maniac. Normally I\u0027d end the flight and leave him to his fate, but at least he gave me some amusement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I dispatched a rescue plane designed to have the fuel to reach the poles and more by flying low and slow on its hour long journey to save Jeb. And so, he was rescued by his eternal pals Bill and Bob and given a severe dressing down by Command for trashing the so-called FiyaHawk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
