For now I am not too worried, there is a mobile lab processing lots of data, but there are 3 people in there and they are expensive to replace (that\u0027s what the board said:))\n\nIs it because I refuelled it once with a rendez vous manoeuver? Is it because it is somewhat on a polar orbit? Is it a bug?\n\n![ue28aaq.png](http://i.imgur.com/ue28aaq.png)\n\nI am taking any advice ; please tell me it\u0027s not a bug."},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T08:08:20Z","Content":"For reducing your velocity for landing are you switching from Orbital velocity to surface after reducing your orbital velocity, by clicking on the nav ball where it says orbit? \n\nOnce you have reduced your orbital velocity you need to kill the surface relative moment, you wont get that perfect, but you can get it very close."},{"CreatedByName":"Woquit","CreatedById":146137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T08:22:19Z","Content":"Maybe you are controlling your ship from docking port?

Do you have a docking port on the side of your ship or a command pod that is not pointing in the same direction as your main engines and clicked \u0022control from here\u0022? Then you will always burn in the wrong direction."},{"CreatedByName":"Ripper2900","CreatedById":146418,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T08:45:25Z","Content":"I think that\u0027s the thing too.

I had left it in charge after \u0022control from here\u0022. But the curious thing is : I have the same problem with another ship, this one has no docking port but a rover on top of it. This is probably the same problem, but it is very disturbing ; mechjebs is lost and this \u0022angle to prograde\u0022 is not helping at all. And this time i can\u0027t change it with the \u0022control from here\u0022 action...\n\nSo i am going to try landing a rover without my ship. How could this not end well?\n\nThank you for your answers!\n\n![KDBcQpt.png](http://i.imgur.com/KDBcQpt.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T12:36:36Z","Content":"Your rover\u0027s probe core probably isn\u0027t oriented in the right direction compared to the ship."}]}
