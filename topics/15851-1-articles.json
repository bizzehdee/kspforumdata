I did a bit of terrible math and came up with a version that functions pretty much exactly like the DYJ part, only it\u0027s a 1m part and has room for 2 Kerbals. I did my best rebalancing the weight, fuel load, and things like that, but I didn\u0027t take into account cylindrical volumes or anything like that, and it looks pretty ridiculous as the hatch is probably not even large enough for a Kerbal to get their helmet through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would attach the part.cfg, but the new vB boards are really restrictive in many areas and I can\u0027t get the file to attach. If you want the info, just reply saying you do and I\u0027ll post it in here. The only issue with it is that you need to have someone in the command pod it\u0027s linked to in order to exit the hatch, but I believe this is a DYJ crewtank issue as well, so it\u0027s functionally the same, just smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-04T17:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan a mod lock this.
