Years later when they finally put out a \u0022gold box\u0022 version, it still had dozens of quite serious glitches. Things like archers shooting at the wrong targets and hitting your own troops, and cavalry stopping pursuit for no reason and letting enemies get away. When it worked, it was a terrific game.

It can\u0027t be that bad, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get a screen with two people who don\u0027t really look like people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou click \u0022new game\u0022, you get a blackscreen. Apparently, it\u0027s the character selection. Select a character by just clicking randomly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get to see the game. Or at least, the intro. It\u0027s very long and very boring and you can\u0027t skip it, but that\u0027s not really a problem, because then you look at the textures that are made out of cardboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a city with a pizza restaurant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game starts. The phone rings. You pick up the phone, the phone hangs itself up, you then make a pizza, which you have infinite time for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you do that? Well, just pressing space at the ingredients you need. The chicken is cut with a chainsaw, oddly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you made the pizza, and then suddenly an timer appears, and you need to get to the client within the time. You do that by food and by quad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and did I mention if you accidentally bump a little you immediately crash and that the timer is always at a super low time which is almost impossible to beat? Well no money for me today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell guess what, the game is over! You need to restart, go trough the whole intro again and then do it all over again but then with an different impossible mission! Every time, there are impossible goals. 20 seconds for a house a few blocks away, 2 minutes to get to somewhere in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I did, is I never picked up the phone. It keeps ringing, but I don\u0027t care. I just drive around and study the whole environment. Oh, and you can get money instead by just picking them up while you\u0027re riding. On the money, you see some guys face with the text \u0022tyrannosaurus rex\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how bad it is.

I tried so hard to like that game. I really did. I loved Morrowind and Daggerfall and gave O a good go but I just couldn\u0027t like it one bit. Stripped down to below minimum. The number of skills were cut down to a Mario Bro\u0027s level, the variations of genuine characters went from whatever you want to be (in Daggerfall) to fighter, thief or mage? The leveling system is attrocious where it becomes close to utterly pointless to level up at all. Magic is crippled to a backyard amateur illusion talent competition thing.
