I got the thing making orbit and back perfectly, only to find out that the thing is horribly unstable when its fuel has run out. After hours of tweaking and testing, it turns out that relying on a control surface (or a wing section with one built in) at the front of the ship creates unrecoverable stability issues when the CoG shifts as much as it did without fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after a couple hours messing around with the wing configuration, I finally got atmospheric handling to work great at all fuel levels.

It might very well be worth taking a break, sure, but you bring yourself back, clear that blackboard and you just do something crazy. Assemble a mini Borg Cube with panels and send it to go assimilate Dres. That little asteroid is up to no good with its own askew orbit and it needs to fit better to the ways of the Borg.
