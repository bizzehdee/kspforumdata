But all measurements showed that this part is heated engines! [http://imgur.com/a/V0Nvl](http://imgur.com/a/V0Nvl) (Yes, it was a long flight)\n\nAnother point was detected in flight - ISP engine is not as specified. As you can see in the screenshots, when ISP = 19200 I could fly 11.5 hours. But after 20 minutes of flight time is rapidly reduced to 4.5 hours. I have no reason not to trust this mod, also from my own experience I know that 19k ISP is very much. It is almost 5 times more than the ion engine!\n\nThe next test that I did - check Pre-cooler with another engines, not jet. For the purity of experiment I chose the most hottest engine - LV-N. \n\nThe test showed that the bug is observed with other engines. Not only on surface, in space too (paradoxically). [http://imgur.com/a/ptsXG](http://imgur.com/a/ptsXG)\n\nThat\u0027s all I additionally checked without mods, i got the same result.\n\n All this is tested on KSP 1.0, Win 8.1 x64.\n\n Crafts - [https://www.dropbox.com/s/rcn6p5rfdel67w1/SPH.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rcn6p5rfdel67w1/SPH.zip?dl=0)\n\nP.S.

Oh well, least I know to leave it off things now."}]}
