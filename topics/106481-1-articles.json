As you can see in the screenshots, when ISP = 19200 I could fly 11.5 hours. But after 20 minutes of flight time is rapidly reduced to 4.5 hours. I have no reason not to trust this mod, also from my own experience I know that 19k ISP is very much. It is almost 5 times more than the ion engine!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next test that I did - check Pre-cooler with another engines, not jet. For the purity of experiment I chose the most hottest engine - LV-N. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test showed that the bug is observed with other engines.
