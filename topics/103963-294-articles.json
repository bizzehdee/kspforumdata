It doesn\u0027t seem to happen with either mod installed on it\u0027s own, but it\u0027s present with both together.  I also think that it might be a issue with the stock game and that these mods are just exacerbating it (just a hunch, although it\u0027s not apparent in a pure stock install).  \n\nI\u0027m getting really violent z fighting of textures (at least I think that what it is) when on the ground at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (it happens when landed in other locations but less intense).  When a craft is on the runway it is almost flickering; it most apparent at the joins between parts, around clipped parts and on flat textures (like flags on cockpits) but shortly after take off (after getting about 300m above ground) it suddenly stops.  It\u0027s not just the textures on craft, sometimes the whole of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is flickering.
