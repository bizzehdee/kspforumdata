Model-positioning for ISDC engines has also been implemented, and the ISDC will now be eligible for inclusion of alternate engine models and engine layouts.  The work on model-positioning functions will also carry over to the ModularPart \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and solar panel options, so it was effort well spent.\n\nRapidly closing in on having all of the necessary features implemented and working.  At this point the large majority of the work left to do is config work, with most of that being cleaning up and updating the model definitions and part configs.  The systems at play need a ton more information regarding the models in order to accommodate the new features, and all of this information needs to be specified somewhere.  So, updating of config files it is...."},{"CreatedByName":"devikwolf","CreatedById":142118,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-10T01:27:28Z","Content":"Great news!
