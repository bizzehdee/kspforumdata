If Musk comes with a total unreal plan we (well, some of us) will critic it, I don\u0027t care how cool it looks the render he presented in that conference if the engineering below is still dubious. He showed a big carbon fiber tank to make a point, but then in the reddit AMA he admitted that they still don\u0027t know how they will insulate the interior of the tank, it was only a production test (testing the manufacturing machine, looked very good by the way) , so there isn\u0027t a basic figure of tank mass to do the numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen he is also claiming that the biggest rocket ever with a big lifting body as upper stage will cost less than a serial production airplane.

That malnutrition is one of the reasons why costs of health care systems in the rich countries explode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother problem is radiation. That field is almost without any data. Sending people into the center of the ship between the stored stuff sounds like \u0022pull a leather-bag over your head\u0022 ... helpless. But i would expect that more research on radiation shielding can be done once it is better understood what kind of radiation does what kind of damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLow g: very well trained atsronauts come down in a bad shape from months in weightlessness.

You need a surface targeting system which is precise on the scale of meters (we do not yet have this capacity), You need to establish a bootstrap powerstation on mars, and hope like crazy that subsequent landings do not damage it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. You need automated and robotized excavation/drilling equipment that can remove or move martian substate. We have to argue that the current SPACEX business plan lacks the scope to do this, this would require another enterprise of NASA assistence.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 a. To build a solar or nuclear power station on the surface for required power.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 b. To begin the process of wiring the complex for power distribution.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 c. A series of robots to do the above but also repair and recharge themselves. Essentially First step is to build a village of robots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. You need to be able to robotically built a close atmosphere environment, preferably underground (Why: your first occupation is to build a greenhouse and protect your plants). Again the vapor pressure on Mars is insufficient to support any earthen life, even deep in Mars surface. You would have to drill several killometers into the surface to arrive at a pressure were plants can grow. However if you drill sufficiently deep underground it is possible to close off caverns and seal them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Robotic micro electricians, to set up an array of leds in the blue and red-orange wavelengths. Also you need substrate (bootsrap) since there is no composted or compostable material on mars. You need to plants seeds and nuorish the plants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. While it is possible to periodically transfer gases, some sort of vapor tight plumbing needs to be established between greenhouse and building. If subterranean building are built adjacent to the greenhouses the radiation problem can be eliminated and stable connections can be made between green house and living quarters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. So as I am talking you will note that as the colony expands, its surface impact declines, and more of the colony is subsurface. Not the kind of colony where you have Suits romping around on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. We have to assume that Martian gravity will suffice for at least a year or two, otherwise you are going to have to provise crew rotations. Yes, as I mention its possible to build a small (3.5 meter in diameter) human centrifuge that humans can exercise in to maintain cardiovascular health, but this is not going to be an early stage employment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now what about Mars support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is more than just transport, this means you have a relay environment were stuff is being placed in LEO, then shuttled to MEO (eventually using ION drive ships I an presupposing). And you have an emmense number of these, probably 30 or so) that can shuttle equipment and supplies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second problem is assembly on ground is almost absolutely required. The reason is that martian parachuting systems are horribly inefficient, and thus payload drops will be small. Thus the payload has either to be a micro version, or just about everything will need to be assembled on the surface. I see surface building on mars being dropped empty and then the interiors being assembled by other drops. I dont see little martian habitats being dropped complete with human inside. The larger the object i think the more difficult it will be to target were it lands, and the more difficult it will be to move if it is mistargeted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat SPACEX says (1 million people) I think is incredible, its 100 - 1000 times more difficult to manage resources on Mars relative to earth. When talk about about a million people on Mars you are talking about the management problem for a billion people on Earth.

You need a surface targeting system which is precise on the scale of meters (we do not yet have this capacity), You need to establish a bootstrap powerstation on mars, and hope like crazy that subsequent landings do not damage it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. You need automated and robotized excavation/drilling equipment that can remove or move martian substate. We have to argue that the current SPACEX business plan lacks the scope to do this, this would require another enterprise of NASA assistence.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 a. To build a solar or nuclear power station on the surface for required power.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 b. To begin the process of wiring the complex for power distribution.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 c. A series of robots to do the above but also repair and recharge themselves. Essentially First step is to build a village of robots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. You need to be able to robotically built a close atmosphere environment, preferably underground (Why: your first occupation is to build a greenhouse and protect your plants). Again the vapor pressure on Mars is insufficient to support any earthen life, even deep in Mars surface. You would have to drill several killometers into the surface to arrive at a pressure were plants can grow. However if you drill sufficiently deep underground it is possible to close off caverns and seal them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Robotic micro electricians, to set up an array of leds in the blue and red-orange wavelengths. Also you need substrate (bootsrap) since there is no composted or compostable material on mars. You need to plants seeds and nuorish the plants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. While it is possible to periodically transfer gases, some sort of vapor tight plumbing needs to be established between greenhouse and building. If subterranean building are built adjacent to the greenhouses the radiation problem can be eliminated and stable connections can be made between green house and living quarters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. So as I am talking you will note that as the colony expands, its surface impact declines, and more of the colony is subsurface. Not the kind of colony where you have Suits romping around on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. We have to assume that Martian gravity will suffice for at least a year or two, otherwise you are going to have to provise crew rotations. Yes, as I mention its possible to build a small (3.5 meter in diameter) human centrifuge that humans can exercise in to maintain cardiovascular health, but this is not going to be an early stage employment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now what about Mars support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is more than just transport, this means you have a relay environment were stuff is being placed in LEO, then shuttled to MEO (eventually using ION drive ships I an presupposing). And you have an emmense number of these, probably 30 or so) that can shuttle equipment and supplies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second problem is assembly on ground is almost absolutely required. The reason is that martian parachuting systems are horribly inefficient, and thus payload drops will be small. Thus the payload has either to be a micro version, or just about everything will need to be assembled on the surface. I see surface building on mars being dropped empty and then the interiors being assembled by other drops. I dont see little martian habitats being dropped complete with human inside. The larger the object i think the more difficult it will be to target were it lands, and the more difficult it will be to move if it is mistargeted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat SPACEX says (1 million people) I think is incredible, its 100 - 1000 times more difficult to manage resources on Mars relative to earth. When talk about about a million people on Mars you are talking about the management problem for a billion people on Earth. So realistically we need to talk about practicality, a research colony of maybe 10 to 50 people over 200 years or so, just to get that management problem down by a magnitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo keeping this on a future SPACEX topic.
