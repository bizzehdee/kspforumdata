(and the rest of you welcome me too, my first post here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you select \u0027end flight\u0027, the capsule (and whatever is attached to it atm) disappears. The flying debris does NOT disappear though, stuff like decoupled last stages in low orbit, decoupled satellites (should you consider part of your craft to be one). If you use Powersat or other sat mods, the sat will turn into a separate capsule. The max. number of flying objects that the program will keep can be tuned in the settings. If you want to clear the space, delete the persistent.sfs file in the saves/default folder\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get into orbit, the trajectory should be roughly as follows: straight up till your speed is 550m/s, which should occur at about 20-25K ASL, then start a gravity turn to the horizon (\u0027topple\u0027 your vehicle), then accelerate towards horizon. Aim to achieve 2245m/s at 100K - that would be the orbital speed for that altitude. The atmosphere ends at 64K ASL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo calculate orbits, use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://files.arklyffe.com/orbcalc.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://files.arklyffe.com/orbcalc.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T07:31:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey there, saw the questions, and will answer the best I can. First off, the persistent models. Ending flight will only remove your active module from the persistent objects. If you jettison boosters, etc while in orbit, those will stay regardless. Same with stuff on the moon if you leave space debris behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbits, for myself, I never did any calculation charts or any of that myself, I did it all by the seat of my pants, Jeb style. Failure is alot of the fun of the program, so experiment, blow up and get stranded in space.

This way you won\\\u0027t have to wait for a repatch after you completely clog up your Parts and get lost in the heaps of useless parts and have to wipe/reinstall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZoxygene_0.5.2.zip\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZO2_Powertech_panels.rar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowerTech_Plugin_v0.2.5.rar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowerSat.rar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above 4 are to give you something to do on your flights. An even more intricate system is dynasat_v_0_6_1.zip and SatelliteRelays_v0_5.zip, but I haven\\\u0027t tried those yet. Probodobodyne Construction Kit - v0.5.zip is also in this category - it contains mostly props, but also 2 nifty unmanned capsules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Silisko Edition 1.2.zip - BE CAREFUL. Definitely do NOT install it like the author suggests (you will lose a number of components if you do), rather, don\\\u0027t overwrite the existing parts, just add the ones that don\\\u0027t exist in the default set. And not all of them, at that. The only parts I ended up using from this set are the excellent non-nosecone parachute, the small weak decoupler, the nosecone for the tanks... and maybe something else. Do not use the modified engines and fuel tanks, they are more effective to the point of cheating, IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb_1.8.4.zip - guess you already know this one. I am still to use it - for now i am just enjoying manual flights, with an M screen trajectory predictor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are into space history, there are several excellent sets of Russian space vehivcles. be warned though - parts from them usually don\\\u0027t work well with default ones.
