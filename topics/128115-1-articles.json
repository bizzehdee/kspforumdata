I think I put in about 5000m/s dV into my rocket to get it out of the atmosphere. It had some of that left over once it got to\u00A0orbit, but not loads. It also really wanted to fly\u00A0backwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other lesser problem that I found is that loops will tend to be high in part count. To get the angle looking smooth you need lots of little pieces. My PC is a little old, but there is a noticeable pause whenever any ship approaches the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe alternative approach that I have seen (but not done myself) is to construct the ring in orbit. A simple(ish) setup might involve 24 structural fuselages with a docking port on one\u00A0end of each and a docking port rotated by 15 degrees (24 * 15 deg = 360 deg) on the other. You will need a few tugs on the launch vehicle and probably some extra docking ports on some of the parts to help close the link.\u00A0This approach will require fewer struts and might also be less draggy on take-off. However I think that it will be very fiddly to construct in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-18T15:11:10Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2015 03:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ineon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
