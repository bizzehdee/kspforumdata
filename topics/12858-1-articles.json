After doing that a couple times I feel I should move on. So I decided to shoot for Minmus. So first I tried it on my own, but realized Minmus is on a different orbital plane than Kerbin and the Mun. So I watched tons of YouTube videos with no luck. None of them were really too clear on how to land on Minmus. So now my last resort is this forum. So how can I do this? How do I get on the same orbital plane, and how do I know when to start burning to reach Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. If one person answers me I still want others to give me their opinion on how to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-18T01:15:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI honestly just make sure whatever rocket I build will have enough spare fuel for me to make a lot of correction burns.

For a plane change to match the orbit of Minmus, I do a correction at Kerbin periapsis. You can do a test burn while in the map screen to make sure that you\\\u0027re pointed in the right direction (if not, turn engine off and re-orient 180 degrees). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis fella posted a video with a \u003Ca href=\u0022\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enice\u0027\u0026gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR0jq85nVwg\u0026amp;list=UUxzC4EngIsMrPmbm6Nxvb-A\u0026amp;index=7\u0026amp;feature=plcp\u0027]nice\u003C/a\u003E illustration here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-18T06:00:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWARNING SPOILERS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efly heading 45 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso, use the same rocket you used to get to the mun, and make sure to rink some food for your kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-18T11:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBurn out to meet Minmus, then burn either normal or anti normal to change the plane.
