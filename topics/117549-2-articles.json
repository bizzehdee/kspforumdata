Cool your jets, man! ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nFirst... *it\u0027s just a game*. I don\u0027t really care if a 2 kerbal capsule employs TARDIS grade sci-fi magic. Seriously though, WHO CARES!!! \n\nAs for your out of the blue \u0022America\u0022 comment, it\u0027s *clear* what inspired the creators of the game to create the various primary capsules. They only *are* adjacent to the country that launched capsules of that shape. I\u0027m sure Central America was just as excited about the space launches as the rest of the world was. YOU are the only person shouting anything, \u0022America\u0022 or otherwise. Since you feel like SHOUTING... How about this: I\u0027M ONE OF THE PEOPLE who suggested *Tantares* as an alternative, and even PROVIDED THE LINK! Get off you high horse, and stuff your freaking \u0027Murica hating down a Mohole... ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)\n\nAnd seriously... It\u0027s Squad... They HAVE CHANGED the stock parts in the past... You act like they can\u0027t do it a second time. For all I care, they could make a 2 crew capsule with an integrated ablator, and just enough extra width, and an attachment node positioned just right to clip the capsule to line with the largest diameter portion of the decoupler. You *could* have unique parts to fit it. So what if you end up with a decoupler that pairs a mid size capsule to a smaller or a larger tank. Who cares if they create tapered service bays, or even create a low profile separator at a unique diameter.\n\nThe only one stifling creativity, passinglurker, is you, who would rather run your mouth off at people with ideas, than actually suggest anything productive.\n\nI\u0027d HIGHLY suggest living up to your name, and be both passive, and a lurker... ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\nI, for one, WOULD welcome new parts. You don\u0027t even need a new size of tanks or engines, as long as the capsule comes with either an integrated ablator, a matched ablator, or \u0022magically\u0022 fits two Kerbals into an MK1 base diameter. If it *is* a little bigger than an MK1, you can simply have a tapered service module. Maybe one could even integrate a decoupler on the top end, for simplicity\u0027s sakes, so you don\u0027t have to create a unique part for one singular task. I\u0027ve actually seen that done before. There is a radial engine mount mod that has integrated fuel cross feed, and decoupling, all built into the single piece. Why couldn\u0027t an \u0022Mk2 Command Pod\u0022 have an integral ablator (adjustable int he VAB), or a custom sized ablator, and then a service bay that has built in decoupling from the pod/ablator. You could have two service bays, one to fit the FL-T tanks, and another to fit the Rockomax. You are talking a MAXIMUM of 4 parts to make a 2 crew pod work, and loosely fit a Gemini styling. it can be done in as little as two parts, if you have an integrated ablator (built into the pod), and have only a single service bay size. That forces you to use a C7 adapter to fit larger Rockomax tanks, but you\u0027ll still get fuel in the adapter. It would reverse the taper of the service module, in relation to the real Gemini, making it get narrower after the capsule, instead of wider... but then again, who cares about sticking to realism, right? ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nEven if the decoupling isn\u0027t built into the service bays, you can still do a low profile decoupler, same thickness as the tiny, tiny decoupler. With that, you are looking at a TOTAL of 5 parts for a complete 2 crew, Gemini inspired tier int he tech tree, with NO additional tanks or engines. Pod, Ablator, low profile decoupler or separator ring, capsule to FL-T service bay, or Capsule to Rockomax service bay. That\u0027s it. Sure, if your trying to mimic Gemini perfectly, and you try to keep stock parts, of course it\u0027ll have issues, but all I\u0027m saying, is it would take very few parts to make a Gemini like 2 crew capsule VERY feasible in the stock game.\n\nWhy this isn\u0027t feasible??? I have no idea... I\u0027d say that the tech tree should unlock the two kerbal pod and early service bays at near the same level. That was a big thing that got introduced around the time of Gemini. Gemini had the guidance computer, and added a lot of stuff, whereas the Mercury capsules had only the tiniest little retrorocket pack on the back. Unlocking service bays and the 2 person pod makes sense.\n\n![Kerbal2Crew4U.jpg](http://richfiles.solarbotics.net/eb/Kerbal2Crew4U.jpg)\n\n\\*Nothing is drawn to scale, i just sketched this as a proof of concept, cause I\u0027m tired of naysayers.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nYou know what...

The K2 Command pod works fine as a 1.25m part, why wouldn\u0027t a similar stock part?\n\nHonestly, IMHO, there are quite a lot of fitting uses for 1.875 parts.\n\n-Of course, the 2-man pod that\u0027s mentioned a few pages back.\n\n-There\u0027s a huge gap between 1.25 and 2.5m parts, while the gap between 2.5M and 3.75m parts doesn\u0027t seem to huge.\n\n-As well as sizes, we still have a gap between 1.25m engines and 2.75 m engines as well. Take the LV-T Series and the Rockomax series of engines. Their power gaps are pretty huge, and also take jet engines. I think they\u0027d be more suitable for Mk3 airplanes and such. Take the Ramjet and the Basic Jet engine.

I like slim service modules, but 1.25m is too slim for 2.5m crew module. 2.5m launch stage, on the other hand, is too wide for 1.25m orbital insertion stage.

For example, if you want to make a realistic Kerbal-esque version of the Soyuz R7 launcher, you\u0027re not gonna get engines that are powerful enough. The RD-107 is an unvectored engine used for the boosters (so it would be replaced by the LV-T30 in stock) where the RD-108 is less powerful so you could use the LV-T45 for it.\n\nHowever, in that configuration with 4 engines on each 2,5m cluster, you\u0027re not going to get anywhere near the power of a Soyuz R7. A similar setup with 4 Mainsails and a single Skipper does the job effortlessly.\n\nThe 1,25m engines are only useful if you want to lift nothing but 1,25m parts, because the 2,5m parts are too heavy to lift. So yes, there definitely \\*is\\* a power gap which is less pronounced on the 2,5m/3,75m transition."}]}
