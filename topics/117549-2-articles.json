If it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E a little bigger than an MK1, you can simply have a tapered service module. Maybe one could even integrate a decoupler on the top end, for simplicity\u0027s sakes, so you don\u0027t have to create a unique part for one singular task. I\u0027ve actually seen that done before. There is a radial engine mount mod that has integrated fuel cross feed, and decoupling, all built into the single piece. Why couldn\u0027t an \u0022Mk2 Command Pod\u0022 have an integral ablator (adjustable int he VAB), or a custom sized ablator, and then a service bay that has built in decoupling from the pod/ablator. You could have two service bays, one to fit the FL-T tanks, and another to fit the Rockomax. You are talking a MAXIMUM of 4 parts to make a 2 crew pod work, and loosely fit a Gemini styling. it can be done in as little as two parts, if you have an integrated ablator (built into the pod), and have only a single service bay size. That forces you to use a C7 adapter to fit larger Rockomax tanks, but you\u0027ll still get fuel in the adapter. It would reverse the taper of the service module, in relation to the real Gemini, making it get narrower after the capsule, instead of wider... but then again, who cares about sticking to realism, right? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if the decoupling isn\u0027t built into the service bays, you can still do a low profile decoupler, same thickness as the tiny, tiny decoupler.

Pod, Ablator, low profile decoupler or separator ring, capsule to FL-T service bay, or Capsule to Rockomax service bay. That\u0027s it. Sure, if your trying to mimic Gemini perfectly, and you try to keep stock parts, of course it\u0027ll have issues, but all I\u0027m saying, is it would take very few parts to make a Gemini like 2 crew capsule VERY feasible in the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy this isn\u0027t feasible???
