The only one I can think of that might have an impact would be Trajectories, but I would have assumed it just measures and calculates, not makes any changes.

It affects a clean vanilla install as well as any modded installs. I own the steam version of KSP, and experienced no heating or visual reentry effects when attempting to run the Linux 64-bit version. The temperature gauges would not activate on reentry, and it seemed as if none of the parts on the craft were being heated at all. However, adding a shortcut to the 64-bit binary to my steam library seems to make reentry effects and heating work without issue. In fact, running the 64-bit linux version from a shortcut in my steam library is currently the *only* way I can get reentry effects and heating to work using the 64-bit version. I have no idea why this may be the case."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T02:26:13Z","Content":"Deleting the file and letting KSP regenerate it is **NOT** sufficient. You need to either get the clean file from a store download of KSP, or delete it and verify local cache (steam). The settings in the 1.0.4 file are **not** the defaults that KSP generates."},{"CreatedByName":"JAD_Interplanetary","CreatedById":134778,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T04:44:28Z","Content":"Thanks to all for your suggestions. I verified the local cache through Steam but that didn\u0027t help. In the end, it turned out it was a working directory problem. I have a command line script to start KSP, but it wasn\u0027t switching to the KSP directory before running KSP. As soon as I added that, bingo! Re-entry effects. I guess there are some config files (physcis.cfg?) that look for their path relative to the working directory, not the KSP binary\u0027s location.\n\n@BrunoTheMad, try running the 64-bit version from inside the KSP directory, and see if that helps. I believe the reason launching from Steam works is that it correctly sets the working directory, but just running from the command line with a relative or absolute path does not."},{"CreatedByName":"BrunoTheMad","CreatedById":146426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T16:23:08Z","Content":"That worked perfectly for me, thanks for the heads up!"}]}
