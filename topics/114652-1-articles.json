It affects a clean vanilla install as well as any modded installs. I own the steam version of KSP, and experienced no heating or visual reentry effects when attempting to run the Linux 64-bit version. The temperature gauges would not activate on reentry, and it seemed as if none of the parts on the craft were being heated at all. However, adding a shortcut to the 64-bit binary to my steam library seems to make reentry effects and heating work without issue. In fact, running the 64-bit linux version from a shortcut in my steam library is currently the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E way I can get reentry effects and heating to work using the 64-bit version.

I verified the local cache through Steam but that didn\u0027t help. In the end, it turned out it was a working directory problem. I have a command line script to start KSP, but it wasn\u0027t switching to the KSP directory before running KSP. As soon as I added that, bingo! Re-entry effects. I guess there are some config files (physcis.cfg?) that look for their path relative to the working directory, not the KSP binary\u0027s location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@BrunoTheMad, try running the 64-bit version from inside the KSP directory, and see if that helps.
