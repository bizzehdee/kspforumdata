Been recently getting back into KSP, decided to complete a tourism contract, when landing back on Kerbin, I made it so that the craft decouples itself into individual segments so it can make a safe landing. Everything was fine with every segment having deployed their chute above water, my main command pod landed just fine, but the two passenger segments (each containing a MK1 Crew Cabin and two Mk2-R Radial-Mount Parachutes) got flung out at impossible speeds the moment they contacted water. Naturally the four tourists died from the sudden, extreme, and anomalous acceleration, but the contract did not seem to register them as dead despite all the debris of the flung out crew cabin containing no tourists. Any idea why this is happening and how to prevent it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vasilisa","CreatedById":234202,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-03T19:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRolled back a save and found that somehow, the tourists just got returned to the astronaut complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-03T21:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem solved! \\o/\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKidding aside, welcome to the forum and I have not encountered that odd bug.
