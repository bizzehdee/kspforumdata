After playing around with the craft in the editor, I\u0027ve noticed a few things though:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you remove the fairings on the left and right, a single \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster will remain in mid air, which isn\u0027t attached to anything (it\u0027s not highlighted if you hover over the root part of the craft) and if you try to launch it then, you\u0027ll get an error message: \u0022part 4294373202 is missing\u0022, so if opened your craft file in a text editor to look up, which part it is. Apparently, it\u0027s one of the medium sized reaction wheels down in the service bay of the center stack. Coincidentally, if you move the whole craft by grabbing the root part, one of these reaction wheels will stay there in mid air, like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster (which also dosn\u0027t move).\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven though you can pick up these floating parts, you cannot delete them or do anything at all with them and at some point, you will just get the error message about the missing part again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried a few things to remove these parts from the craft file via text editor but I always ended up crashing my game or 80% of the craft just disappeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I have to come to the conclusion, that your craft file is corrupted and maybe, someone more skilled comes around who can fix the file for you or maybe there is even a tool for this somewhere in the \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/35-tools-and-applications/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ETools and Applications\u003C/a\u003E\u0022 subforum but I think, the easiest way is to rebuild the whole craft from scratch.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately, I cannot tell you why this happened to your craft, so maybe it happens again or maybe not \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-01T02:29:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter reading \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/187982-4x4cheesecake/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022187982\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/187982-4x4cheesecake/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@4x4cheesecake\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s post, it sounds like an issue I had a long time ago, except my craft exploded as soon as I pressed the space bar to launch it. I\u00A0have no idea why yours doesn\u0027t explode until a certain altitude, unless it has something to do with air density/pressure *shrug*. If you were doing a lot of work with symmetry, sometimes a part gets \u0022stuck,\u0022 which this issue sounds like. The best solution, now that you have your design hopefully figured out, is to rebuild it from scratch. And I mean\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Escratch\u003C/em\u003E. Reboot your computer (or console as the case may be), launch KSP, go to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and build it again from a clean slate. With all the symmetry going on, it may be best to build up one of your side boosters and save it as a subassembly, to add it (in symmetry) to your core later.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPro tip: I see you have a lot of docking ports (too many open ports can contribute to lag, but you should be okay). Your design lends itself to one of my favorite tricks. Place your radial decouplers closer to the top or bottom, and align your docking ports closer to\u00A0the other end so they are almost touching in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. When you take it to the pad, the ports will stick together, eliminating the need to strut the side boosters to the core. By opening the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E for\u00A0the ports by rt-clicking them, you can enable staging for the ports, so they will undock when you stage off the radial decouplers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an example....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZGWLOJl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZGWLOJl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-01T02:35:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2020 02:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by StrandedonEarth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darbin Giesorg","CreatedById":157957,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-02T14:16:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe secondary docking connection is a fantastic trick I will use from now on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso thanks for finding the problem.

The same applies in a stack- strut some of the higher parts in later stages to the heaviest part and some of the lower stage parts to either root or grandparent parts, and this works with docking ports in the stack too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat original rocket of yours looks really strange to me- why are you using a solid rocket as the main stage and twin boars as radial boosters? It\u0027s better to do it the other way round and set the booster decouplers to \u0027enable crossfeed\u0027 so that the fuel tanks on top of the boosters can feed the core stage and drain first before being discarded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darbin Giesorg","CreatedById":157957,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-05T02:01:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea of the rocket was to have the fuel rockets be reusable.

I didn\u0027t know how much I\u0027d spend getting the station up there, so I ballparked it, gave it a little extra and planned on sending one stage back after emptying its contents into the other in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E by detaching it and using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to re-enter the atmosphere.

Possible but since I had problems getting anything attached to the docking port in the first place (probably haven\u0027t found a proper autostrut configuration yet but I\u0027ll try strutting to various parts like you suggested), putting even more in between didn\u0027t feel good.
