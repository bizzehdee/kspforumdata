Although, a big part of it is to get the rocket down-range early in case of an accident. All else being equal, better if debris fall\u00A0into the ocean/desert than on the launch pad. But it also works out from optimization that it gives you no advantage to ascent directly up even early on. You always want at least a little bit of an angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, ascent profile can vary quite a bit between different rockets. Your main criteria are aerodynamic heating, dynamic pressure, and fuel use. On one hand, you want to be out of the atmo as quickly as possible, on another, you don\u0027t want to be moving too fast. And the sweet spot will never be exactly the same for two designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-18T06:15:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn reality, you don\u0027t go straight up and suddenly turn. Converting vertical speed into horizontal speed is a waste of energy.
