Like how Hotrocket\u0027s changes the exhaust- but this mod changed the sound to something more realistic and satisfying... am I dreaming that this imaginary mod once existed or did it? If so- is it compatible with 1.0.2? Or has it been updated for 1.0.2?\n\nIf this never existed- could someone make it?
