Note the very little impact damage.\n\nNow take a twinkie, and glue it to the face of a brick. Throw at floor again.\n\nMore damage? Why!?!?

Similar construction.\n\nThe small one has surface area proportional to 3^2 = 9\n\nThe large one has a surface area proportional to 10^2 = 100, so it presents 11 times the surface.\n\nThe small one has a mass proportional to 3^3 = 27\n\nthe large one has a mass proportional to 10^3 = 1000, so it masses 37 times as much.\n\nSimilar speed, 37 times the mass, distributed over 11 times the surface. = 3.36 times the energy flux (heating) imposed on the object.\n\nExpect its surface to be much hotter. Not quite 3.36 times as hot, but easily 1.2 or 1.3 times the temperature."},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T19:14:39Z","Content":"Not sure if this is what is going on in KSP- I\u0027m having no problems with exploding spacecraft yet in this post-1.0.0 career- but if it\u0027s based on real physics then it\u0027s like Marvin says.\n\nBasically, the amount of an object that is subjected to heating is related to the **radius squared**. The surface area, effectively.\n\nHowever, the amount of kinetic energy that an object is carrying is proportional to **radius cubed**- the volume.\n\nThus small objects have larger surface areas and lower masses, since r^2 (r == radius) gets larger in proportion to r^3 when r is small. However, as r grows bigger and bigger, then r^3 grows much more quickly than r^2. \n\nThis is known as a \u0022scaling law\u0022. The behavior of the physical world is HIGHLY dependent on scale. You can\u0027t arbitrarily shrink things or enlarge things and expect them to work the same."}]}
