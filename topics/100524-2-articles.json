What the hell do y\u0027all call that anyways?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I figured I\u0027d start out small - got into the litterbox and built a simple single-Turbojet RGU-controlled plane. Put a batt with the probe core, put a nose cone on front, added a short Mk2 Adapter to that (drained the Liquid Fuel out of it along with most of the oxidizer), put a small cargo bay on. Stuck two PB-NUKs, a Stabilizer, two wheels and a girder in the bay. Added a Mk2 Liquid Fuel Tank to the end and strutted the bay to the tank, ran a fuel line from the front adapter to the fuel tank, then closed the cargo bay doors. Added a Long Mk2 Adapter to the end of that (drained the LF again, left the oxidizer intact), then added a Turbojet and four 24-77 engines. Put a couple of Engine Nacelles on the sides, bicouplers up front and Ram Intakes on those (4 Ram Intakes). Used RCS Build Aid to balance the mass; had to add a couple of RCS cylinders for ballast into the equipment bay. Delta-Deluxe Winglet for a rudder and for tail elevators, Advanced Canards up front as canards. Wings were a pair of Delta Wings, a pair of Wing Connector Bs and a pair of Swept Wing As, with Elevon 3s as ailerons. Put tricycle gears on, unlocked the steering up front and disabled the front brakes, then fired up FAR for analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was at this point that I realized I really should\u0027ve RTFM. So \u0022red is bad\u0022 - got it. What the crap do I do about it? I mean, I knew I\u0027d built a plane that would\u0027ve had absolutely no problems with the soup - 15 tonnes on the nose, 1 Turbojet, 4 Intakes with the right amount of fuel to make it up, down, fart around a bit and land. If anything at all, it wouldn\u0027t have had enough wing area to take off at a low speed - not an insurmountable problem. But I was seeing red numbers all up and down the Mach scale. In flight I realized it was telling me I\u0027d have hellacious side-slip, because I was having some hellacious side-slip throughout the flight. Couldn\u0027t get the damn thing to hold 090 for the life of me...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway - first flight attempt!! Lawn dart. No problem - go back to the SPH, adjust the wings to move the CoL closer to the CoM and adjust the position of the ballast to re-balance the plane. Second attempt - plane careened off the runway and \u0027sploded. Realized I was holding down the D key instead of S - so that one was \u0022pilot error\u0022. Facepalmed. Third attempt! Tail struck. Fourth attempt! Tail struck. Fifth attempt! Wobbled up for a moment, then tail struck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESixth attempt I got into the air with my butt intact. So I cranked the nose up to 40 degrees and started flying. Went ahead and opened up the FAR controls. Flight was...okay-ish. Aside from the aforementioned side-slip, the damn thing consistently went into a minor stall as I approached 12k AGL, quickly evolving into a major stall. This happened twice; both times I was able to recover from the inevitable spin, get the plane pointed back in the prograde direction and lift the nose back up above the horizon, having lost nearly 6k of altitude in the process. After the second time I cranked the nose down to 20 degrees and it didn\u0027t happen again. I\u0027m guessing I got the AoA too high there. Damn physics...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after that I didn\u0027t have many problems. I did encounter something that folks call \u0022SAS Waggle\u0022, but it wasn\u0027t particularly severe - the one thing y\u0027all have been warning me about that \u003Cstrong\u003Edidn\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E happen was the spontaneous disintegration of the plane.

The obvious thing is; planes in the real world don\u0027t look like that, and there\u0027s a good reason. You\u0027ve got two huge blunt surfaces either side of the fuselage, and it\u0027ll be making horrible drag. Honestly, I think you could dump the nacelles altogether and put a single (or double via a bi-adapter) shock cone on the front end, with a couple of structural intakes at the wing roots (again, see the Karnifex). With careful flight, this would still get you to 30km or better, assuming the rest of the airframe is stable. In stock, people favour ram intakes because their weight-per-intake-area is better, but in FAR it\u0027s all about minimising drag, and shock cones are superior for that job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d recommend getting the exposed monoprop tanks into the cargo bay, and using just the little spheres, since they\u0027re also a draggy thing to have outside.

The further back they are, the more stable your flight will be. You can optionally lift the horizontal tail fins up a bit, pulling your CoL to the upper side of the plane, which will help it want to stay upright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, have you checked what happens when the tanks are empty?

Can you take off (and land) at a reasonable speed? You\u0027ve got enough wing. Can\u0027t take off before the end of the runway? Probably need more wing. taking off halfway down the runway at 100m/s? You\u0027ve got more than enough wing, it makes landing and takeoff easy but will be slowing you down at mach 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe RCS Build Aid data is up there - the position of the CoM is almost completely stable; it actually shifts forward slightly as the craft burns through its fuel.\u003Cp\u003EWell...those exposed tanks are the main reason why the CoM is balanced; they kinda need to be there...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using it as ballast.

I don\u0027t mind the CoM moving around as long as it isn\u0027t making the plane unstable at any point.

One lesson learned last night is that \u00220\u0022 was somewhere in the middle; if you turned it all the way down for a given axis, it would just react in the opposite direction - and once I figured this out, I actually had a halfway successful flight (right up until the plane stalled for no apparent reason at 8k and went into an un-recoverable spin...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost control surfaces you want at 100% for what they are, and 0% for the things they are not.
