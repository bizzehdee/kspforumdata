Staying our course and only slightly augmenting our power supplies, not replacing them, with token amounts of renewable energy sources is continuing a policy that will indirectly kill 125.000.000 people over 25 years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that comparison, nuclear power is allmost thousands of times safer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we look at direct deaths: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Does any energy source kill a significant number of people? In a post from last year, we discussed human fatalities by energy source, and how coal is the biggest killer in U.S. energy at 15,000 deaths per trillion kWhrs produced, while nuclear is the least at zero. Wind energy kills a mere 100 people or so per trillion kWhrs, the majority from falls during maintenance activities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe in the United States actually care more about this kind of thing than most other countries, so our numbers are the lowest in the world. The global averages in energy-related deaths are significantly higher than in America, with coal at 100,000 deaths per trillion kWhrs (China is the worst), natural gas at 4,000 deaths, biomass at 24,000, solar at 440, and wind at 150. Using the worst-case scenarios from Chernobyl and Fukushima brings nuclear up to a whopping 90 deaths per trillion kWhrs produced, still the lowest of any energy source.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If a natural disaster is just a natural disaster and we can do nothing about it, then the fukushima accident doesn\u0027t even count. We should also stop earthquake proofing buildings in earthquake regions and cancel the pacific tsunami warnings.
