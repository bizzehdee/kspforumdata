The FungEye scope was a request the original author did for a telescope that could fit in the smaller KSO shuttle bay. The limitation of the scope is the same as in the older versions of CactEye, it can do everything the larger scope can, but can only yield 10% of the total science value. It also cannot close its aperture like the larger scope can, and should still blow to smithereens when pointed at the sun. The fact that it did not is a bug.

This was a design decision I made in the redesign of the GUI, that you would have to select a target through map view first. I did this for several reasons, the biggest being support for planet mods such as Outer Planets; I was afraid that with a side panel with a restrictive listing that people would think CactEye was not compatible with planet mods when, in fact, it is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bar27262\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bar27262\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESeems I can\u0027t access the GUI for the telescope..\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should be able to right click the telescope body and click \u0022Toggle GUI.\u0022 If the right-click menu isn\u0027t showing that option, then you might need to reinstall Cacteye.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022handsmahoney\u0022 data-cite=\u0022handsmahoney\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m having an error when I attempt to zoom in using the wide field/asteroid processor level two, where I just have a black screen when I open the GUI and try to DO SCIENCE!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if this isn\u0027t an issue with the skybox.
