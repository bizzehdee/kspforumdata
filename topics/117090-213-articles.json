Now I\u0027m working on UV layout, esp. in regards to how to do the AO bake for the torus meshes without having to duplicate a lot of the UVs, all while eliminating visible seams as much as possible. \n\nMight have to split the interior and exterior portions of the torus into separate islands, and duplicate the interior islands where the AO would be different -- this just leaves me figuring out how to best hide the seams between the ext/int islands.  The seams between segments shouldn\u0027t be too noticeable as they will already be segmented on the texture (just have to mask out the noise/make the noise mirrored on the seams).\n\nHere is the auto-layout UV mess that I get to clean up -- note the large # of **unique** islands I have to work with; every island is either unique geometry, or duplicate geometry that requires unique AO; most meshes have already been halved, quartered, or more.\n\n![7QtEbWP.png](http://i.imgur.com/7QtEbWP.png)\n\nStill a bit more island reduction that can be done by using sub-optimal UV sharing for some meshes where the AO would be \u0027close enough\u0027.  Many of the smaller detail bits from each torus can likely be stacked, and I may be able to re-use the same texture space for each of the bracing lines.  The trusses are already sharing UVs wherever possible.  The largest use of UV space by far is the actual torus mesh segments which unfortunately cannot be stacked or re-used (or else the texture resolution would vary widely between each size of torus).\n\nHopefully the next images I post will be of the WIP textures, probably here in a day or two."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-14T20:40:53Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) Usually, filtering is only 1 or 2 pixel wide.

However when MIP-maps are used you need to increase the padding quite substantially (by about 2px for every MIP-map level used on the texture).  Even at 16px padding on a 2048x texture I can still see seams on stuff in KSP when I zoom out.\n\nI used to use 4px, then 8px, but still ran into seams on many models when zoomed out -- you can still see this on a few older parts; the SC-B and SC-C CM\u0027s for example, check the editor icon or zoom way out and there are visible black seams.  So now I use 16px for any 1024x or larger texture.  The padding can be reduced for smaller texture sizes as they have fewer MIP-map levels.\n\nThinking on it, there is probably a nice formula/equation that I could put together to calculate the correct padding for any given texture size...."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceBadger007","CreatedById":150547,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-14T23:08:28Z","Content":"So I made this lunar station, using mostly sstu parts, and I thought I might as well show it off.

Then do them as skylights (facing radially inwards). The idea is that at night, that\u0027s the ambient light in the rooms inside (cabin lights), and in the daylight, the lights look off, since the station is getting light from the sun. No idea if that is possible. Might look visually interesting, though.

Specifically:\n\n    \tLAYOUT{\tname = Single\tdefaultMount = Mount-Delta-IV\tMOUNT\t{\t\tname = Mount-Delta-IV\t\tsize = 3.75\t\tminSize = 3.75\t\tmaxSize = 3.75\t}}\n\n You can add similar code to any other engine, specifying which mounts to adjust the min/max size on.  If specified in the config it will overwrite any auto-calculated values.  You need to first specify what LAYOUT the adjusted mount belongs in, and then specify the adjusted parameters for that mount.  If adjusting multiple mounts for the same layout they can be added into the same LAYOUT node.  If you attempt to adjust a mount that is not already in the layout, it will be added as a new mount (as can be seen in the example above; that definition -adds- the delta-iv mount to the RS-68).  You can also remove specific mounts from specific layouts by adding a \u0027remove = true\u0027 key to the MOUNT node (it should contain only \u0027name = XXX\u0027 and \u0027remove = true\u0027 key-value pairs).\n\nDiameter increment is already available in the engine cluster module configs ( \u0027diameterIncrement\u0027 ).\n\nThe way it all works is that each engine is flagged to include either upper stage and/or lower stage mounts (in the engine-cluster module config).  Each mount definition contains a flag as to whether it should be used as an upper stage or lower stage mount (or both).  From there the initialization code pulls all of the available layouts for an engine; for each layout it pulls all available mount options for the given upper/lower stage setup.  Each mount then has its size auto-calculated based on the given \u0027mounting area\u0027 and the \u0027mounting diameter\u0027 of the engine.  If overrides are specified in the part config it will skip the auto-calc and use the manually provided values;  you cannot override just the min or max, you must specify both if you are overriding the auto-sizing.\n\nOh, and you are on your own if/when it all breaks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  (I wrote the auto-sizing code for a good reason, trying to hack around it is asking for trouble...)\n\nI have to ask though -- what are you trying to accomplish?

The smallest any mount can go is 1 x \u0027diameterIncrement\u0027.  So even if you were to modify the mount/layouts to allow for the smaller mount size, it probably won\u0027t work properly unless the increment is adjusted as well.\n\nIf you want to use the engine without mount, while still allowing for greater range of fairing size selection, you can adjust the \u0027minSize\u0027 and \u0027maxSize\u0027 of the \u0027Mount-None\u0027 mount option for the given layout.  If you want smaller than the default \u0027diameterIncrement\u0027 (0.625m), make sure to set that up properly as well.\n\nAlternatively, you could use the ISDC as a stand-alone engine shroud (click the \u0027toggle interstage node\u0027 on the engine to enable the upper attach node).  Not sure what the \u0027minDiameter\u0027 for it is off the top of my head, but you can likely config patch it to allow for 0.3125m as well.\n\nSRBs -- they do not support fairings, nor will I be adding fairing support.  You can add the module to the part configs, but it won\u0027t work properly as it would need a metric buttload of interaction code added to the MSRB module, as well as additional information added to the model definitions for each \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E piece.
