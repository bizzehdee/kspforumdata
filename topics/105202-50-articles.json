i.e. greenhouses, agroponics, cultivators, etc. - especially when they compete for the same resources, or where having multiple things turned on ends up being detrimental to the player (like losing mulch at a lower rate when you could have gotten more supplies by using a different converter on the same part, or another part on the same vessel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently, USI-LS assumes very nice built in recyclers (water is recycled/reclaimed, air is scrubbed, etc.) - so that your only supply cost is essentially food. \u00A0This is being replaced by an alternate series of mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst - supply consumption will be baselined at 15 units per day. \u00A0This (roughly) breaks down to 2L of food, 1L of oxygen, and 13L of water per day per Kerbal, and covers everything from eating and drinking through sanitation, etc. - so as a baseline, there is zero reclamation. \u00A0And for shorter trips, this may make sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecyclers operate not by converting all of that mulch into supplies, but by reducing demand before they hit the mulch stage. \u00A0They will have varying levels of effectiveness, and require alternate inputs (EC, water, etc.). \u00A0For example, a water purifier can take water harvested from a planet or asteroid and convert it to potable water, effectively reducing your supply need by 80%, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecyclers are shown in the UI in the \u0027Supplies per day\u0027 figure. \u00A0So as more recyclers pop online, they will effectively push down the amount of supplies you have to directly tap into (since we assume you are using the recycled ones first). \u00A0This mechanic solves issues with multiple recyclers competing for mulch and (in some cases) resulting in sub-optimal conversions. \u00A0Mulch does not even need to enter the picture at this stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you are past that cut, you go right into the basic supply-\u0026gt;mulch converters, \u00A0This is where the second round of recyclers kick in, that essentially use mulch as an input. \u00A0Note that all Mulch-\u0026gt;supply converters are being deprecated in favor of a standardized mulch\u002Bfertilizer=supplies mechanic. \u00A0This makes all greenhouse stuff operate consistently, with your key difference being size and conversion rate. \u00A0Note that it may be easy to overwhelm your greenhouses without a recycler, since you are also trying to use your greenhouse capacity as a biological filter, and not just growing food. \u00A0Luckily, most of these bits will be intended for use by mods like MKS, since the basic recycling mechanic (and it\u0027s corresponding supply consumption jump) are only lit up when that mod is installed. \u00A0Again, the intent here is not to surprise a bunch of other mods who then have to scramble to provide updates. \u00A0Rather, it lets USI-LS be extended easily based on the mods you have installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother side note on recyclers - they also tap into the wear system, and can have a positive or negative effect on long term habitation since the recyclers are part of the entire habitation ecosystem. \u00A0i.e. installing a colony-grade recycler will extend hab life, while depending on a junky one might reduce it (in the latter case, it may even be more effective to just cart in supplies vs. recycling to extend the hab\u0027s usable life). \u00A0It makes for some very interesting mechanics, all of which will be surfaced via the UI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTotally unrelated, but slightly relevant to this thread is that I\u0027ve been working on a colonization guide, that takes you step by step through a series of missions, each of which illustrates some facet of both USI-LS and MKS along the way. \u00A0The intent is that someone who has never used a colony or life support mod can go through the sample missions, and develop a better understanding of the mods by very slowly incremental complexity. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty happy with it, and a lot of the changes here (and upcoming MKS ones) were based on, essentially, taking a clean slate to colonization and writing the docs from the ground up. \u00A0I hope you folks enjoy it, and I will begin showcasing all of the demo missions and the guide on my twitch stream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnjoy \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snarfster","CreatedById":80347,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T22:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey Roverdude,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the work on that.
