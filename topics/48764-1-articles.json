But if you splash down at the ocean then when you go to end the flight, you are informed that the current state will be restored to the last auto-save, and that it is so because your ship is moving on the surface (obviously it is! It\u0027s in the ocean!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... So, this is something new? I find it odd that you cannot retrieve a vessel from the ocean, being that pretty much the entire history of manned space flights ended up with a vessel on the water. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Depth","CreatedById":81698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T00:16:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a new Recover Vessel button above the altimeter, did you try that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.
