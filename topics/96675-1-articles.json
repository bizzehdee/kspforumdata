While being able to grab a ladder that was made too short will be great, the second part us what intrigues me. I\u0027ll admit I haven\u0027t explored nearly as far as many of you, but where I have on Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus, terrain features are simply \u003Cem\u003Efar\u003C/em\u003E larger than the scale of a leaping Kerbal. Except on Minmus, where I can leap high enough the RCS pack comes into play. So the inability to climb them isn\u0027t that there\u0027s no place to hold onto, they\u0027re simply too tall and steep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6I ask you other explorers: are there locations in the system where the aforementioned ability would be a boon to foot travel\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6or are we getting ready for a tremendous increase in local terrain detail and ground scatter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is purely speculation on my part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T17:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo me it sounds more oriented to getting in and out of crafts. \u0022Ledges\u0022 may be terrain or ships, or both I suppose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently had a plane where the ladder looked perfect, it went right over a wing strake, and connected to the built-in ladder on the side of a MkII cockpit... except the kerbal would climb up the ladder and get stuck and if you attempted to leg go, you simply fell to the ground.

The trick is to rotate it away from the plane more, so that the ladder is closer to the same angle as the built-in steps, but still reaches the ground.
