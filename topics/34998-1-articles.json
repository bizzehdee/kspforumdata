I\u0027m trying to set up a space station. My first part is already in orbit, now I wanted to bring up the second part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as a reference, I\u0027m using Rocketry and the whole rocket looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://abload.de/image.php?img=ksp2013-06-2715-54-345oe0j.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://abload.de/thumb/ksp2013-06-2715-54-345oe0j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp2013-06-2715-54-345oe0j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upper stage looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://abload.de/image.php?img=ksp2013-06-2715-55-01shfkx.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://abload.de/thumb/ksp2013-06-2715-55-01shfkx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp2013-06-2715-55-01shfkx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I obviously want to dock at the upper multiple docking port. Now, I have a Remote Control Unit for the actual second part of the station (just above the batteries with the green lights). Below it is a cuppola which I intend to use at the space station. Right below the cuppola is a separator: I\u0027d like to dock with this thing and maybe transfer fuel and MAYBE use the engine for something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is another remote control unit for the part which I intend to separate - my thought behind it was to steer it with the remaining fuel on a collision course with the planet, to get rid of the debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn second thought, I probably don\u0027t need the upper remote control unit, as it should only get disconnected after I dock, and then I can use the control unit of the space station already in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWell, anyhow, the problem is, that a guy sits in the cuppola and this results in the Nav-Ball being upside down\u003C/strong\u003E...so it gets pretty hard to plan maneuvers. Is there a way to fix that/leave the guy on the ground or do I really have to turn this thing around? If there is a guy in the cuppola anway, then I can of course leave the upper remote control unit out. Or is there a way to switch \u0022point of views\u0022 (I want to steer using the remote control unit, not the guy in the cuppola).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope I\u0027m posting this in the right place \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E The main question is obviously about the cuppola, but maybe you have other suggestions/I\u0027m making something else terribly wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest regards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChloiber\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-27T14:23:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2013 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Chloiber\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T15:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the launch pad right click a part that\u0027s facing the correct way and select \u0027control from here\u0027.

Very useful for docking if your docking port is at right angles to or the rear of your vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
