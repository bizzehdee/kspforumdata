I\u0027ve looked at many videos and tutorials online and the proper way of docking is to get two target points that are \u0026gt;1 km apart while matching the other ship\u0027s orbit.

That makes it easy to understand how you are moving compared to the thing you\u0027re aiming at, and additionally places the vectors on the navball so they tell you what direction you\u0027re going relative to the target too (your green pro/retrograde markers for your ship orbit, and pink markers for direction of the target). When the target velocity indicator reads 0.0m/s, you are in exactly the same orbit as the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, to close distance with an object you are attempting to dock to, you orbit should never be identical to the target\u0027s, because your relative positions will therefore stay the same forever - instead, if you need to catch up on the object, you need to drop your periapsis to a slightly lower altitude than the targets\u0027, so that for part of your orbit you are traveling faster than that target. For situations where the target is \u0022following\u0022 you, just do the opposite, making your apoapsis slightly higher up so the target gains on you.

That means that if you simply accelerate one craft directly toward the other, the usual expected outcome of it eventually reaching that object, is not what will actually happen. Both of your trajectories are constantly being modified by gravity. The further apart you are from your target, the more of an effect this will have. So, in order to reach your target you have to work out the problem in a different way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, you need to modify your orbit so that the next time you reach the point where your orbit intersects your target\u0027s orbit, you are very close to it. Additionally, you want your relative speed to be within tolerances both for safety and for having a reasonable amount of time to slow down. If you\u0027re in the same exact orbit as your target, then when you modify your orbit, it will have an intersection point from the spot you modified it from. Ideally, you want to change your orbital period so you come back around to that spot at the same time your target gets there. This is where things get counter-intuitive. If your target is ahead of you, you actually want to thrust away from it, to shrink your orbit. This will shorten it\u0027s period and you will eventually catch up to your target. Conversely, if your target is behind you, you want to thrust away from it again, enlarging your orbit, lengthening its period, allowing it to catch up with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t want to change your orbit too significantly or you\u0027ll have too great a relative speed when you finally do intercept your target. When you do finally intercept your target, you\u0027ll want to nullify your relative speed to come to a near stop relative to the target while you are close by (within a handful of kilometers or closer). Then you can simply thrust toward your target to approach it. When you are this close, the complications of the non-inertial reference frame are minimized and your maneuvers will have much more intuitive results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t try to rush it. The space shuttle would take a day or three to slowly sync its orbit with the space station and would take hours on the approach and docking procedures.
