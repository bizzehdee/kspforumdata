Specifically, you will be able to enter the game time of the last sysygy (i.e. opposition, conjunction, inferior conjunction, or superior conjunction) and the game will use the synodic period and the transfer geometry to compute the game time of the next intercept opportunity (i.e. the time the user should initiate the transfer, or burn). I\\\u0027ve done some simple tests with this method and IMO it\\\u0027s far superior to methods that require the user to estimate the relative angular separation.

As with real spacecraft, as long as the duration of the burn is relatively short (e.g. on the order of a couple of minutes or less), this assumption is valid. Note: for high-thrust chemical engines, this almost always holds for short \u0027impulsive\u0027 burns; low-thrust engines that use electric propulsion (e.g. ion) that must be fired over a long period are not ideal candidates for this assumption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LambdaCactus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LambdaCactus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the burn when the engines are cut, the ship immediately starts losing speed since it\\\u0027s in a steeply climbing orbit.

The equations assume that the impulsive energy transfer (i.e. the burn) occurs at the periapse or apoapse of the transfer ellipse. As with the previous question, everything is fine so long as the duration of your burn was relatively short (i.e. on the order of a few minutes or less). The goal is to achieve the indicated injection speed as quickly as possible (to satisfy the impulsive transfer approximation); once you have, you\\\u0027re fine to let the spacecraft drift along the transfer ellipse until you arrive at the target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Hohmann transfer data takes into account the \u0027dropping speed\u0027 that you describe, because this is exactly what is predicted by the governing equations Kepler and Newton provided us. In it\\\u0027s most elegant form, this falling speed (when gaining altitude) is a result of the conservation of angular momentum for your spacecraft\\\u0027s orbit; a line connecting the central body and your spacecraft will always sweep out equal areas in equal time. This means your orbital speed must decrease as your radius/altitude increases. \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThe calculator takes all of this into account\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LambdaCactus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LambdaCactus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the angle?

When your spacecraft is at periapse (for a low-to-high transfer) or apoapse (for a high-to-low transfer), your instantaneous velocity vector will appear to have zero inclination (i.e. \u0027flat\u0027) on the nav-ball; you should burn prograde (for low-to-high) or retrograde (for high-to-low) at max thrust to achieve the transfer ellipse injection speed indicated by the calculator as quickly as possible.
