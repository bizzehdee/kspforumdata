Maybe blue kerbals or something... But thing is, here is a more detailed thing:\n\nThe race would live on laythe, and every 4 days, would launch a vessel. These vessels would progress like the player, and would collect science, money and trust. Eventually, they would create space stations and even fly over to you when they meet resource requirements!\n\nNew mechanic:\n\nIf your trust or relation is high enough, you can research Diplomatic Advancements. This would be costly and could branch from one of the survivability upgrades. What it would do is it would allow you to see telemetry data from the tracking station of the other race\u0027s vessels and progress.\n\nAfter that, you could research Diplomatic Harmony. This upgrade would cost a LOT. What is does: allows you to dock with their ships, launch from their launch pads (without scientific parts...) And request money or offer contracts (to an extent)\n\nOffering money to them would increase relations, requesting it would lower them. \n\nThis would be hard to code, but it would be really cool!\n\n-G1"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T22:06:14Z","Content":"As much as I would love to discover lifeless, Alien-like (the film) ship wrecks floating around the solar system I believe this is a part of \u0022What Not To Suggest\u0022 list."},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T22:08:59Z","Content":"It is, under Miscellaneous."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T22:31:29Z","Content":"All worlds are yours, except Laythe.
