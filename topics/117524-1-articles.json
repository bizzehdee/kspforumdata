Taking off and landing \u0022like Kod and Robert Keinlein meant spaceships to\u0022, paraphrasing a little. \n\n![N8bZmhX.png](http://i.imgur.com/N8bZmhX.png)\n\nSporting a ridiculous 40 parts, and 4km/s in the tanks, it gives you just enough juice to limp into a 100km circular orbit with three kerbals. Trust me, you will learn a thing or two about gravity turns flying this thing. But, if you can refuel it up there, then boy, the sky is the limit. Being able to SSTO in kerbin means you can do the same on *every other body in the kerbol system with the exception of EVE*. And you can get yourself there if you have the depots, or course. A true workhorse, designed to work just as fine on the frigid Jool system shuttling Val as it would do on the Red planet, or hop some tourists on a quick orbit in no time flat. Orbit is quite literally halfway to anywhere! And orbit it does, if you know how to handle her. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n[table=width: 1000]\n\n[tr][td][![DPdQoe2l.png](http://i.imgur.com/DPdQoe2l.png)](http://imgur.com/DPdQoe2)[/td][td][![2BojKvPl.png](http://i.imgur.com/2BojKvPl.png)](http://imgur.com/2BojKvP)[/td][/tr][/table]\n\nReally, there is not much more to say about her, other than that warning about needing a pilot that knows his stuff (or Mechjeb), in order to make the design benchmark of 100km LKO. And even when flown by its creator, you can see I had all of 90m/s left in the tanks to do all the rendezvousing and coming back. Other than having tight margins, tough, it is very easy to fly in every other aspect. The gimballing engines give it awesome agility under power, and empty like it\u0027ll be most of the time when you rendezvous it handles like a jet fighter since it\u0027s so light. And the action groups... nonexistant, why would you need them? Simplicity itself! (To reuse the chutes, they are actually bound to the abort action group... you know, because they are your abort). The only moving parts are the landing gear and ladders, and they are synchronized. It is stable on the atmosphere going up *and* down, up because you have those awesome engines and the CoM and CoL are very close at any attack angle, and down because I took care to test that you can survive an unpowered reentry with no electrical power. It can even land on land without using its engines for a powered touchdown! It\u0027s a bit rough, though, keeping a few drops of fuel is advised, especially if you are coming into water and hope to recover anything other than the capsule (which would survive horrendous crashes anyway).\n\nSo with that advice, I leave you to hone your ascent skills, with a design where you just have to care about flying, and not worry whether something is going to bobble into an explosion, or the whole thing will flip out from under you.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Though considering the rear Sr. dock, you could also wing this with a drop tank to get the extra ~2.5km/s. Dunno if it would have the TWR to burn it quickly enough, it would be quite the big tank...

And some I actually studied to find out before that! Like the stability thing: I have the tanks set up so the lower one empties first, which means the CoM moves *forwards*, increasing aerodynamics stability. But when you come down, the upper tank is also empty, so the CoM is back into its original position just behind the CoL (or, more accurately, center of drag). Short of like how RL shuttle had the O2 tank in front of the hydrogen one, on account of O2 being much denser, only totally not like that. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nRune.
