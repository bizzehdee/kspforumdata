This is because it\u0027s much shorter and wider, and so two capsule-shaped pressure vessels fit less optimally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, some stages (like the Saturn S-II and S-IVB) have a common bulkhead, where the upper dome of the oxidizer tank is also used as the bottom bulkhead of the fuel tank.

This brings up the second use of utilization: replicating real rockets. If you know how tall a rocket stage is, and how much volume of fuel/oxidizer it should actually hold, you can set the stretchy to the appropriate height/width and then use utilization to tweak the volume until it\u0027s correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T20:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOhh I see so it lets you mimic real-word dimensions to the T.
