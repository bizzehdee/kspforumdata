It should be located in the central rectangle/square hole. The circular holes don\u0027t match the P6 truss pegs when P6 is attached.\n\n[http://imgur.com/TeNlVvR](http://imgur.com/TeNlVvR)\n\nI also figured out that the Z1 truss\u0027s dimensions are incorrect.\n\nHere we see that the P6 truss goes way beyond the frame of Z1,\n\n[http://imgur.com/TtmQ6zB](http://imgur.com/TtmQ6zB)\n\nwhile in real life, the both trusses are equal on both ends.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![sts097-704-071.jpg](http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/assembly/hires/sts097-704-071.jpg)\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: Z1 and S6/P6 trusses aren\u0027t proportional to the other parts of the pack. \n\nIn game, Z1 does not span the entire width of the payload bay, nor does it go very far down into the bay.\n\n[http://imgur.com/7lX6bOi](http://imgur.com/7lX6bOi)\n\nI wish I could have found a photo of the shuttle payload bay for the mission which delivered Z1, but a paper model of STS-92 created by shuttle enthusiasts depicts how Z1  would appear in the payload bay.\n\n[http://www.axmpaperspacescalemodels.com/STS-92payload.html](http://www.axmpaperspacescalemodels.com/STS-92payload.html)    (All credit goes to the creators of this)\n\nThere are some photos of the Z1 frame when it arrived at Kennedy Space Center before it was covered in mylar and installation of electronic components in this photo archive.\n\n[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-92/images/images.html](http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-92/images/images.html)\n\nTherefore, the S6/P6 trusses must also be improperly sized. \n\nIn its current size, the S6/P6 truss is almost exactly 1/2 the length of the payload bay (minus solar array).\n\n[http://imgur.com/vRoowsc](http://imgur.com/vRoowsc)\n\nHowever, in real life, the S6/P6 trusses take up around or more than 2/3 the length of the payload bay. The width of the truss is correct though, only the length is off.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![STS-119_RPM.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/STS-119_RPM.jpg)\n\nI think some realistic additions would be if the Z1 had reaction wheels. The gray/silver bulge on the rear side of Z1 is actually a set of gimbals used to orient the ISS. Also, all of the solar array trusses had large batteries in them. The rectangular things at the end of those trusses like in the picture above are actually those batteries. Therefore, the S4/P4 and S6/P6 trusses should have a sizable electricity storage capacity. The docking port on the bottom of Z1 is also nonfunctional. \n\nI think the original Z1 piece from Bobcat\u0027s pack was actually closer to the correct size.\n\nEDIT\n\nAfter doing some more digging, I\u0027ve found a HUGE archive of payload photos on Kennedy Space Center\u0027s archives.\n\n[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/gallery/photos/2000/](http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/gallery/photos/2000/)      This has thousands of pictures taken in the space station processing facility from the year 2000.  Most of the folders there should bring up at least a few photos of the STS-92\u0027s payload. However, [http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/gallery/photos/2000/2000-sheet-14.html](http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/gallery/photos/2000/2000-sheet-14.html) and sheet 15 have the best views of Z1 in the payload bay.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-27T05:51:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2016 05:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by LMRaptor**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSPGamerABC","CreatedById":159401,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-27T17:40:46Z","Content":"Hey, i did just downloaded this mod.\n\nBut i have a couple of problems.
