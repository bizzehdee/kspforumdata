I\u0027m not about to claim these numbers have any direct applicability to anyone\u0027s gameplay. However, it may prove insightful.)\n\nI built a 1-ton payload (really 1.04 tons but I can\u0027t quite shave off the last 40 kilograms....) and equipped it with an accelerometer; a barometer; two thermometers, one inside and one outside the cargo bay; and the Graphotron 2000.\n\nAfter sending it up on a BACC booster, I let it drop, recording data starting at the edge of the atmosphere and continuing until about 500 m ASL. At that point I was about 150 m from lithobraking, so I paused to save the data recorded.\n\nAlready there have been some attempts in the [Google\u002B KSP Community](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119337) to puzzle out the implications in the data. As they say--the more the merrier. Feel free to grab the data and use it as you will. I only ask that you credit me for generating the data.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/znYRUGWH0PU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T08:05:00Z","Content":"Very nice data, thanks for the share.

Dropped a little rocket from 150km straight down. The poor thing never did reach terminal velocity, except maybe for the last few seconds. So I did a similar experiment with a little rocket, the Sniffer. I wasn\u0027t aware of Graphotron, but a friend suggested VOID, so I used that instead. Sniffer1 took measurements in 0.90, Sniffer2 repeated them in 1.0, and this morning Sniffer3 flew in 1.02.\n\nHere\u0027s a graph of the results:\n\n![KSP_density3.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78157466/forum%20posts/KSP_density3.jpg)\n\nAfter reading lots of complaints about \u0022Squad reverted back to the soupasphere in 1.02\u0022, I did not expect the actual density to look like this. It\u0027s a bit hard to see, but 1.0 and 1.02 have practically the same density profile all the way up. (There are subtle variations, probably due to time of day.) The bigger differences is between 0.90 and 1.0, where the density actually increased except near sea level. So I think this means the perception of changed density is due to other related changes of the drag model, etc.\n\n(Your data would have been used for this, but VOID measures density (g/m^3^) while Graphotron measures pressure (Pa). Instead of fumbling with conversions, I just made the third test consistent with the prior two. I can supply raw data and/or selected data points if anyone wants to see.)\n\n*Very* nice vid, by the way!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T19:45:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zephram Kerman**"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:02:43Z","Content":"Correct, nothing about the atmsophere changed 1.0 to 1.0.1, just the drag multipliers.

Spent a peaceful afternoon cruising around Kerbin in the spotter plane, and found a coastal location that reaches 288K twice each day. At that moment, the density reading was 1220 g/m^3^. Almost exactly like you said; I think the difference was due to the 5.21m height of the equipment. Built a mobile launcher for Sniffer4, got it there, and redid the experiment. The yellow line is the new data, launched from 288K beach.\n\n![KSP_density4.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78157466/forum%20posts/KSP_density4.jpg)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [AeroGUI will calculate your instantaneous terminal velocity.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117141-1-0-AeroGUI-v1-0-28-Apr)\n\nThanks for the tip!

The heavier your craft the higher its TV. Some crafts will be so heavy that their TV is above mach 1 at which you have increased drag."}]}
