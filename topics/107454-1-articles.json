Even though it no longer needs oxidiser, it produces less than half the delta v of the LV-909 engine (the next most efficient engine in the game). I have done all sorts of experiments and there is no doubt this is the case. This doesn\u0027t really make sense since it still has the highest Isp. What happened to it? Are there plans to rectify this issue? If not, what can be done to fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:43:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119135-LV-N-Delta-V-Is-this-right\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E discussing a similar topic, basically the greater mass of the LV-N means it doesn\u0027t produce more delta-V until propellant and payload masses are sufficiently large.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso if you are using KER to display dV, make sure you are using vacuum values.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^^ Good point.

I stacked two of the super jumbo tanks (drained of oxidizer) and got a much better delta v than what could be accomplished with the LV-909. But this is still a problem. Right now I am trying to build a good rocket to get to the Jool system and back. All my previous designs in .90 were very compact things with one or two LV-Ns. Huge rockets tend to be unstable in 4x time warp and I am not wanting to wait the 2 full hours it takes for a burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nmorrish","CreatedById":143030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T17:59:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlus, any prolonged burn causes everything to overheat and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeat management is a new mechanic, and I agree it is difficult with the LV-N.

Seriously, the system is flawed because it makes more massive objects heat up faster than less massive ones, which is bass-ackwards compared to how heat really works.
