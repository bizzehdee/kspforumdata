I was investigating the ISRU convertor overheating issues I was having... and trying to replicate what was happinging on Mun, right on the launch pad...\n\nBut to my surprise, it wasn\u0027t overheating... but something else was.\n\nBefore I tried just filling the ore canister in the VAB, I launched a sat, and then a surface rover to looke for ore to mine.\n\nMy surface rover was sitting on the runway when I was conducting my ISRU convertor tests...\n\nThe rover would consistently overheat and lose multiple parts when I timewarped with the ISRU running on the launchpad!!!!\n\nDoes KSC conduct heat from vessels? could this explain the way the ISRU passed testing upon release?\n\nI haven\u0027t been able to get my ISRU convertor to overheat when running it on Kerbin at KSC, but it sure overheats on Mun...\n\nNow I see a heat source on the launch pad is causing something to overheat on the runway when I run the ISRU module...\n\nThis is quite strange....\n\nFor now, I think I\u0027ll be turning some \u0022true\u0022 flags to \u0022false\u0022 in the .cfg files so I can actually do ISRU off-kerbin"}]}
