Don\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027m looking forward SLS, but I don\u0027t see how it\u0027s gonna help making exploration affordable and how it will achieve it\u0027s ultimate goal in the 30\u0027s.

That\u0027s not at all the same. GTO capacity is 14 for DIVH and 21 for F9H. Affordability is very relative. An SLS Block I launch will cost almost half a billion and originally it was meant to be launched once a year or two. So far no other components has been approved for development than the Orion MPCV. Anything from habitation modules to a lander for eg. hasn\u0027t been approved yet. Bigelow Aerospace has had inflatable modules in development for years and has offered space stations and even a lunar base. The successful lunar catalyst program could be escalated to develop a manned moon lander, hence Boeing came up with the idea of a reusable lander and a station at earth-moon Lagrange point 1. If SLS was approved to use any of these, I\u0027d say it\u0027s all good. But so far everything else for SLS is just a concept.
