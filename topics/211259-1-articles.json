As long as these parts are present, the life support requirement is ticked off, and everything is fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat way the game would not need to bother the starting player with budgeting life support resources on their first Mun flyby. But it would have an answer for the question that started this thread. And if players want more, there will most assuredly be mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think its worth talking about closed and open LS in real terms here. I\u2019ll say off out of the gate what you\u2019re describing is possible but would be incredibly disappointing. The reason I say that isn\u2019t because I think the game should be more complicated; Im somewhat notorious in my opinion that the game should be indeed as simple as it can be. There are broad swaths of needless, tedious elements like the class system and contracts that I would cut entirely. The reason I say that is introducing bare-bones criteria parts doesn\u2019t \u003Ci\u003Ecreate\u003C/i\u003E anything. Its not a genuine game mechanic. There\u2019s no optimization or underlying dynamic design idea that challenges players to seek creative solutions. Its just a \u003Ci\u003Echecklist\u003C/i\u003E. Its just a thing you have to do without alternate solutions or tradeoffs or anything thats worth thinking about, \u003Ci\u003Eand if its not worth thinking about it shouldn\u2019t exist\u003C/i\u003E.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the very least one might consider closed loop LS. This would be basically a quota system. You add LS parts that support X kerbals and if the numbers line up they remain steady-state and happy. \u00A0Given the way nearly all city builders work this is a pretty solid foundation for something like habitation space. Each module has a habitation rating and if you have habitation equal to crew size everyone\u2019s happy. \u00A0The same would be true on colonies. Its like adding more housing, and the more consistent rules are between colonies and vessels the \u003Ci\u003Eless\u003C/i\u003E complicated and frustrating the game is because the same rules apply \u003Ci\u003Eeverywhere\u003C/i\u003E. Players don\u2019t need to learn two sets of rules. There\u2019s just one underlying principle to understand. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this still isn\u2019t really a \u003Ci\u003Edynamic\u003C/i\u003E, not in the way all of the other facets of KSP are. Its not like the tradeoff between thrust and efficiency with engines. Its not like the weight and output dynamic that PV panels and batteries have. What makes KSP interesting are the \u003Ci\u003Edesign puzzles\u003C/i\u003E. Thats how resources should behave\u2014as a complex relationship between traversing space, landing where you mean to, and having the energy and heat dissipation to collect what you need and deliver it somewhere useful.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats also why you really want LS not just to be a checklist or static mass penalty, but a thing that depletes over \u003Ci\u003Etime\u003C/i\u003E. Including the concept of time fundamentally changes the way you think about space and the way you think about its hostility and the value of life. It changes the way you plan and execute missions. It changes your relationship to care for these fragile little green creatures. They aren\u2019t just a heavy experiment part. They\u2019re \u003Ci\u003Ebeings\u003C/i\u003E that require care.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA single depletable LS resource also allows you to delve into the concept of efficiency and generation. It becomes a dynamic and gameable parameter that spurs unique, creative problem solving.\u00A0Planets and moons with simple harvestable resources become safe harbors capable of growing your populations. Greenhouses and rehydrators might greatly increase the efficiency with which food is consumed so that mass penalties don\u2019t scale linearly with longer missions and larger crews. If water and oxygen are considered recycled and all you\u2019re worried about is food you can also easily include a grace period without consequences so LS isn\u2019t a concern on early and short missions, but slowly scales in with progression.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI honestly think LS is one of the biggest bang-for-buck elements a game like this could promise, and while there\u2019s no need to make it punishing or overcomplicated it would be crazy to ignore it or give it short shrift.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-02T05:24:09Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2023 05:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drakenred65","CreatedById":154503,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-02T04:29:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224214807\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211259\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221672631012\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n27 minutes ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is honestly not great. \u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot disagreeing with that.
