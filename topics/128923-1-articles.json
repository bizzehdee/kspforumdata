But after the sixth keybodyne tank with mammoth attached, in line, with fuel crossfeed to central ones, the delta V added decreases significantly. So much that i can\u0027t pass the barrier of a certais (low) delta V\u00A0with 600 ton of fuel.\u00A0and I need 5000~6000 (based on a delta V map). That makes sense, but since I saw videos of ridiculously large rockets with many engines in line over many stages I don\u0027t get why. Can someone explain how am I supposed to get to Jool anda Eeloo?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 36-ton payload isn\u0027t very big as things go, about average for me actually.\u00A0 This is totally and easily doable in stock.\u00A0 Which part of the Jool system are you going to?\u00A0 I\u0027ll assume Laythe and no aerobraking so that\u0027s 4370 m/s from LKO, to make this sort of a worst-case.\u00A0 Dunno where you\u0027re getting the 5000-6000 from.\u00A0 Anyway, call it 4400-4500 in the transfer stage to have a slight margin.\u00A0 With this, worst case, you can capture into an elliptcal orbit at Laythe and then do some gentle aerobraking if you\u0027re running low on fuel when you get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find it easiest to design rockets by the burns required for the various phases of its flight, starting in reverse order.\u00A0 So you\u0027ve got your mission payload of 36 tons which I\u0027m assuming includes whatever fuel it needs to do it\u0027s job once it gets there.\u00A0 So, you need 1 or more transfer stages to get it from LKO to LLO.\u00A0\u00A0Depending on how annoying you find long transfer burns leaving Kerbin, you can either do this as 1 big LV-N stage (which I do in this example) or you can break this up.\u00A0 Have a smaller LV-N stage right under the\u00A0payload with about 2200m/s to do the burns near Jool and Laythe, and a 2300m/s\u00A0LFO/Rhino stage for a short burn out from Kerbin.\u00A0\u00A0But that will require a bigger lifter\u00A0so probably the Nuclear Lightbulb is your best bet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, let\u0027s assume stock here.\u00A0\u00A04500m/s pushing 36 tons will need 4x LV-Ns, each under a 3/4 of a 1.25m long tank radially attached to a big orange tank.\u00A0 Put nosecones on the 1.25m tanks, add 2 large folding radiators to keep the LV-Ns happy, and add 2x 2.5m reaction wheels.\u00A0 That\u0027s your payload and transfer stage with a total weight of 101 tons.\u00A0 Now, with 4x LV-Ns, you\u0027ll only have a TWR of 0.21 leaving Kerbin, which will require doing the transfer burn over 2 or 3 orbits instead of all at once so if it was me, I \u0027d the Nuclear Lightbulb engine from the Atomic Age mod instead of the LV-Ns.\u00A0 Or I\u0027d break this into a 2200m/s OMS stage\u00A0and a 2300m/s chemical stage\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now for the lifter itself.\u00A0 You only need about 3400-3500m/s to reach LKO these days.\u00A0 This is EXTREMELY easy to do these days with stock parts, without even needing crossfeed, let alone asparagus.\u00A0 Make a stack of the 2.5m-to-3.75m adaptor, 2 of the biggest 3.75m tanks, and a Mammoth engine.\u00A0 This will give you above 2600m/s and a TWR of 1.46, low but good enough.\u00A0 So now you need another 1000m/s.\u00A0 For this, make 4 radial stacks of LFBs with the 1/2 size 2.5m tank (the \u0022oil drum\u0022) with a nosecone on each.\u00A0 No fuel lines.\u00A0 Set these up as the 1st stage (1347m/s and 1.56 TWR) with the central Mammoth being the 2nd stage.\u00A0 You now have 3570m/s in these 2 stages combined.\u00A0 Now you could use Mainsails instead of LFBs, and you could use crossfeed or even asparagus to get by with less booster tankage, but not doing that just shows how doable this rocket is just being simple.\u00A0 Of course, the LFB stacks will need a pair of centrally mounted Septratrons each, and the central stack should have some Sepratrons, too.\u00A0 Plus you need 4 Vernor engines and some small tail feathers at the bottom of the central stack.\u00A0 But that\u0027s really all there is to it.\u00A0\u00A0If I was building this for msyelf, I\u0027d have the Space-Y mod and would use some of its mondo SRBs instead of the LFB 1st stage, and maybe have a smaller central stack as a result, but again, stock works fine.\u00A0 This lifter will get the 101-ton payload \u002B transfer stage to a 100km orbit with about 140m/s left in the central tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/cdxkxptyft5eu5n/Test%20Lifter.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external

Getting to Jool isn\u0027t too hard, even if you\u0027re taking 36 ton (although you don\u0027t need to). But your design has some issues that need fixing if it\u0027s to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink of it in four stages: lift, transfer, mission, return.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLift is the boost to LKO. This needs high TWR engines (aim for a TWR of 1.5-2.5 throughout the lift) and about 3,500m/s of \u0394V. It also requires smooth aerodynamics and decent control authority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTransfer is the shift from Kerbin to your destination planet (Jool, in this case). For this, you don\u0027t need high TWR; this is where the Nukes come in. One nuke if you can tolerate the long burn, 2-4 if you\u0027re impatient. Jool transfer is about 2,000m/s if you\u0027re aerobraking (take a heatshield, it\u0027s toasty), doublt that if you\u0027re doing a non-aero capture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission is what you\u0027re doing while you\u0027re there. This is where the LV-909 Terriers\u00A0come in; small vacuum landers don\u0027t need big heavy nukes. A small Terrier ship usually has the \u0394V to hit several biomes on a low-g moon, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReturn is the trip home, if it isn\u0027t a one-way mission. Transfer back is generally the same as the transfer there; 2,000m/s in this case if we\u0027re assuming a Kerbin aerocapture at the end. Again, this is a low-TWR high efficiency stage calling for LV-Ns or similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBig doesn\u0027t mean crude; you still need to pay attention to aerodynamics.

efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want to do transfer burns from LKO so your ship is moving faster during the burn, which means\u00A0you get the most Oberth Effect and therefore burn less fuel to generate the same dV.\u00A0 Which means you have more fuel for later in the mission.\u00A0 However, the lower your parking orbit, the less time it takes to orbit Kerbin--it\u0027s about 25 minutes in LKO.\u00A0 This means that during a burn of 5-6 minutes, your ship will make 20-25% of an orbit.\u00A0 You shouldn\u0027t ever burn any longer than that in LKO or you start losing a lot of efficiency due to the angle between the direction you\u0027re thrusting and the direction the ship is moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis loss of efficiency is due to vectors.\u00A0 The object of the burn is to increase your \u0022forward\u0022 velocity, but if you\u0027re not pointing forward (aka prograde) when you burn, you\u0027re only adding the component of the burn that\u0027s parallel to the prograde direction to your velocity.\u00A0 The other component of your burn is along the radial-inwards direction and therefore doesn\u0027t contribute to you getting to Jool---it is effectively wasted and, in extreme cases, can even push you down into the atmosphere which is really bad.\u00A0 The greater the angle bretween your maneuver node and the prograde direction when you burn, the greater the waste.\u00A0 But by limiting burn duration to 20-25% of your LKO orbital period, you keep this wastage to an acceptable level.\u00A0 At least acceptable to me.\u00A0 Some folks really obsess about efficiency so refuse to burn more than 2-3 minutes in LKO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the shorter the burn, the more efficient it is because 1) you have less divergence\u00A0between thrust direction and prograde, 2) this divergence lasts for less time during the burn, and 3) you accelerate faster, which means you get more Oberth benefit sooner.\u00A0 Therefore, a high TWR on the transfer stage out from LKO is very desirable, plus it also makes it more convenient for you as a player.\u00A0 The sooner you get the burn over with, the sooner you can hit warp and zip on out to your destination.\u00A0 Now, when going to Jool, your burn will be about 2200-2300m/s.\u00A0 A TWR of about 0.7 will make this take about 5-6 minutes, which is the longest acceptable burn duration.\u00A0 This is, therefore, what you should attempt to build into your ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, it sometimes happens (especially if you do stock) that you simply CAN\u0027T get a TWR \u0026gt;= 0.7 on your transfer stage without compromising the rest of the rocket.\u00A0 What do you do?\u00A0 Well,\u00A0 you certainly do not make a 10-15 minute burn in LKO.\u00A0 That just wastes gobs of fuel.\u00A0 So you have 2 options.\u00A0 You can either leave from a considerably bigger Kerbin orbit, so that 10-15 minutes is an acceptably small fraction of the total orbital period, or you can stay in LKO and break the burn up into chunks of 5 minutes or so.\u00A0 The bigger orbit option is less efficient because 1) you\u0027re slower so you get less Oberth Effect,\u00A0and 2) you start from a lower initial speed so require more dV to get to the same place.\u00A0 So it\u0027s preferrable to start in LKO and burn from T-2.5 to T\u002B2.5, coast around the resulting elliptical orbit, repeat as necessary until you complete the burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way to fudge on transfer stage TWR is to make your lifter so that its last stage still has a fair amount of fuel in the tanks (say 400-800m/s) after achieving LKO.\u00A0 Then figure out where around your orbit you need to place the transfer burn node.\u00A0 Go to that point and burn the remaining lifter fuel.\u00A0 This effectively applies the lifter\u0027s fuel to the transfer burn, reducing the amount of dV the transfer stage needs to deal with and thereby shortening its burn time.\u00A0 It\u0027s the same as breaking the transfer burn into chunks.\u00A0 One thing to be careful of, however, is Mun.\u00A0 If you plan to wait days/weeks in parking orbit prior to leaving Kerbin, you need to keep your Ap well inside Mun\u0027s orbit or you\u0027ll likely get tossed by Mun at some point.\u00A0 OTOH, if you\u0027re leaving immediately, you can cross Mun\u0027s orbit (assuming it\u0027s not, by chance, in the way)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T14:16:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote
