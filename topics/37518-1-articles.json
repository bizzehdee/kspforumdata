Direct launch azimuths to any desired inclination are pretty easy to calculate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer the actual question though you want to cancel your out of plane velocity when your position is on the plane of the desired orbit. You can think of an inclined orbit as being two orbits happening at the same time. Your north-south wobble is an orbit around the center of mass. In any case the ring of your orbit intersects the equatorial plane at two points called the ascending node and descending node. At either one burn in the opposite direction of your ascension (south) or descent (north) until your inclination disappears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe aware that you can only fully cancel your north-south movement as you pass through such a node. If you cancel your north-south motion away from the equator you\u0027ll still have inclination because you\u0027re still north or south of the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T03:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty simple, and already explained well enough.

For example if the apoapsis is inclined towards the north pole, then at periapsis (which would itself then be inclined towards the south pole) you should burn north. Think of it this way, if looking at your orbit from the side, edge on, it is like a teeter-totter and you should apply a force in the direction you want to move that side of the orbit. Really you can fix this at pretty much any point in the orbit, though I believe either the AP or peri are going to be the most cost effective.

If you get an intercept and pass close to a moon its gravity will change your orbit, including inclination. Use maneuver nodes to plan this. However, Mun is roughly 800dV away from LKO, so it will likely cost you around 1600dV to use it for a change and return to LKO. This is a lot, but changing from an equatorial to a polar orbit directly probably costs roughly 3000dV, so it can still be cheaper.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gus","CreatedById":68154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T20:42:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022arq\u0022 data-cite=\u0022arq\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you want to do a massive change of inclination, sometimes it is most efficient to raise the altitude of your ascending or descending node (make it the apoapsis) and do it out there.

On an elliptical 100km-50Mm orbit, your speed at apo is tiny, maybe 50m/s. That means that for 100dV out there, you can completely reverse your orbit (or go to any other orbit for slightly less). Then, with some aerobraking you can get back down almost for free. This means that for around 1100m/s you should be able to change from any LKO to any other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there\u0027s no cheaper way than to simply launch in the orbit you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T05:52:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAh, the magic of orbital mechanics.

Now, apply that same delta V of 5 m/s to a vehicle that\u0027s already moving 10 m/s (so you start at 10 m/s and end at 15 m/s). Now, your change in kinetic energy is 15^2 - 10^2 = 125.
