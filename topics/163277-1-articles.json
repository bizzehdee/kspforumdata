I am using extra planetary launchpads so that my station has a purpose ingame (other then being fun to build of course). I am also going to build a surface base on the surface of the moon so that I can mine ore and metal and ship it up.\u00A0I plan on using the station to launch interplanetary missions (including my still uncompleted duna mission lol). My question is, what should be done first? Should launch my and assemble it (I plan on using mechjeb for rendezvous but docking by hand), or should I land my base components and put them together?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods in use the may effect the decision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E LS (no mks though)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEPL for building shuttles\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStockalike mining extension\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKPE (not sure if I\u0027m going to use it though)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanger Mod\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-15T13:53:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2017 01:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by nascarlaser1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-15T14:04:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you\u0027re planning a surface base to mine and an orbital station for construction it doesn\u0027t really matter which you\u0027ll launch first.
