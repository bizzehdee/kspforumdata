Building a rocket that takes advantage of cryogenic fuel is a challenge.\n\nIf anyone\u0027s wondering what this mod changes when building rockets with LH2 engines, well, it depends. **Cryogenic Engines can make your rocket more expensive or less expensive**, **but they *will* surely make it taller.**\n\nSmaller rockets will always be more expensive and 50% to 100% taller, but big rockets might be either more, or less less expensive (but still taller). It depends on the engines used, so it\u0027s worth experimenting.\n\nExamples:\n\nSpoiler\n\n**1.** Comparing the deltaV with the same weights (but who cares about the weight?)\n\nUsing a Mk1-25 command pod and a Jumbo tank for reference, I took 2 smaller tanks for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/Ox that weighed exactly as much as the bigger hydrolox one. The engines used in the comparison were the top-of-the-line vacuum \u0027Terrier\u0027 (345s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E) and the hydrolox equivalent, also top-of-the-line vacuum \u0027Hecate\u0027 (465s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E). They weigh practically the same and have practically the same thrust.\n\nUsing the cryogenic fuel in the rocket and a tank that weighed exactly as much as the stock one, the deltaV increased by 20% for the same weight, the size of the cryogenic tank was just a bit over 2 times larger, and the cost of the cryo tank\u002Bfuel\u002Bengine was about 4 times more expensive than the stock cost.\n\n**2.** Keeping the same deltaV and the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E with a 1.25 Mun rocket: stock PT Series Munsplorer with 3.5 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O stages versus a modified PT Series Munsplorer with 1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O \u002B 2.5 LH2/O stages (the lander had to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O for size purposes):\n\nThe almost-cryogenic 1.25 Mun rocket became about 50% taller, 15% more expensive and 35% lighter. Still not worth it to use cryogenic engines (unless you want to shave off some weight... but why?)\n\n**3.** A massive 5 meter-wide **335t** 7000dV lifter for a 11.5 payload (and a 0.8t fairing) with also a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O lander:\n\nThe cryogenic version was **12% LESS expensive** (yay!) 45% lighter and only 1/3rd taller, surprisingly.\n\nWhen it comes to the individual stages:\n\nCryo, top to bottom: 16k credits, 36,6k credits and 43,2k credits.\n\nKerbolox, top to bottom: 16.1k credits, 30.2k credits and 68,7k credits.\n\nAs you see, LH2 first stages have the most potential to decrease the costs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-04T00:31:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2020 12:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Krzeszny**\n  \nI was wrong about CE making rockets more expensive"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Dry","CreatedById":163177,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-23T11:57:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 9/16/2020 at 8:48 PM, EimajOzear said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Apologies for taking more of your time, I\u0027ve got this far but I\u0027m stumped as to how to make it work:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hide contents\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E @PART[\\*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleCryoTank]]:FINAL  \n\u003E \n\u003E {  \n\u003E \n\u003E    @MODULE[ModuleCryoTank]  \n\u003E \n\u003E    {  \n\u003E \n\u003E     @BOILOFFCONFIG  \n\u003E \n\u003E     {  \n\u003E \n\u003E OUTPUT\\_RESOURCE  \n\u003E \n\u003E   {  \n\u003E \n\u003E     @ResourceName = Hydrogen  \n\u003E \n\u003E     %Ratio = 0.5  \n\u003E \n\u003E     %FlowMode = ALL\\_VESSEL  \n\u003E \n\u003E   }  \n\u003E \n\u003E }  \n\u003E \n\u003E }  \n\u003E \n\u003E }\n\u003E \n\nSame question here.\n\nI searched all configs, also those in my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E backups, and did not find anything helpful.\n\nEdit:\n\nPerhaps it\u0027s necessary to patch away the boiloffconfig block and then patch a weird ResourceConverter into the tank, that converts LqdHydrogen to Hydrogen when no EC/s is used, and does NOT convert LqdHydrogen to Hydrogen when EC/s is used.\n\nSo a \u0022negative\u0022 power consuming resource converter that needs electric power to NOT convert.\n\n![:/](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png \u0022:/\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-23T12:01:05Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2020 12:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Gordon Dry**"},{"CreatedByName":"lordcirth","CreatedById":137417,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-24T16:08:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 9/23/2020 at 6:58 AM, Krzeszny said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Nice mod.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If anyone\u0027s wondering what this mod changes when building rockets, I\u0027ve done a super simple comparison.
