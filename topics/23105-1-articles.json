The Mission was to do a Grand Tour with a lander capable of landing 5 guys on each planet with the exception of Eve (and Jool obv). Initially the crew was just the supreme trio, but they picked up 2 other stranded guys along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe route I took started with landing on Moho (and refuelling), passed by Eve and then landed on Gily (and refuelled). Then onto Duna where the first guy (Corald) was picked up followed by a quick visit to Ike (and a quick refuel). Then onto Dres where another kerbal, Richley had crashed in Dres canyon. After refuelling on Dres I pressed on to Jool and visited each of Jools moons; Laythe, Vall, Pol, Tylo and Bop. In that order as I only refuelled on Pol and Bop and needed a refuel before landing on Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen from Bop I had a long flight out to Eeloo before finally making the voyage back to the Kerbin system and doing a quick landing on Minmus then Mun (for completeness sake). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary goal was to complete a grand tour with a 5 man lander and see 5 Kerbals set foot (or at least landing gear) on each planet and moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe secondary goal was to do it with just one craft that could mine kethane as it went. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first goal was accomplished, but not the second. I had to send an additional booster section to bolt onto the lander to assist it in the descent/ascent on Tylo and Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was the first time for me visiting many of these places. I\u0027d not previously been to Moho or Eeloo and my probe mission to Jool and it\u0027s moons had failed so they where new to me too. Next time I will know what to expect!! yeah next time, I will be doing this again at some point after the new resource system is in place (and stable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft I did the mission in was called Shuukou, which means \u0022circle tour by ship\u0022 in Japanese. It\u0027s a two part craft, the Lander and an Orbital section which has the atomic engines for IP transfers. One of the key features of this craft is the way the lander slides inside the orbital section to dock making the whole craft quite compact (and makes docking very very easy). The lander is also one of the most manoeuvrable craft I\u0027ve ever built, with the main command pod, lander can and 3 SAS units it is very responsive. It also has a remote-tech module to enable it to remotely control the orbital section when they are separated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two sections together, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0iiF8BZh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220iiF8BZh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELander and Orbital section \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yFS0LRal.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yFS0LRal.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand a shot taken from inside the orbital section with the lander coming in to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7Z1afXHl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227Z1afXHl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy other goal for this mission (which is still WIP) is to make vids of the whole trip.

I had missed the window to transfer to Jool and it was going to take more than a year for it to come round again. I could either wait, or I could burn 3 times as much fuel and go now. Jeb was getting restless so I did a very costly transfer to Jool but it reduced the mission time by over a year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile I\u0027d sent out an unmanned ship carrying two booster sections that would assist in the ascent from Laythe and both ascent and descent on Tylo. These where now parked in orbit around Laythe and Tylo. On approach to Laythe something when horribly wrong, lag set in and set in badly. After much head scratching I found that is was the ISA map-sat plugin that was causing the problem so took it out and the mission was able to go ahead. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe, with the booster section on top of the lander which was used to reach orbit again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ySuP89H\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ySuP89Hl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ySuP89Hl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I transferred to Val. I needed to refuel to have enough for the Tylo landing, but realised that it would take several trips from the orbital section to Val\u0027s surface to stock up again.

I don\u0027t think that it will be impossible, but your problem is going to be the shear size of the thing, hope you have a powerful computer! How many different landers are you thinking of carrying? More landers means more overhead from non-dV producing parts that you have to shunt around so I\u0027d suggest just having two, maybe three. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy craft (lander and orbiter together) had a dV of just under 6000 when fully gassed up and I pretty much needed to refuel at every stop. So you\u0027re going to need the mother ship to have a very high dV and I can\u0027t even begin to imagine how much fuel you\u0027ll need to start off with. Have you started work on this one yet? If you have I\u0027d love to see some pics of your designs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027m going to do this again at some point and do it with multiple landers, but I still plan to use re-fuelling (just less frequent) with the new resource system when that comes out. One downside of just using one lander is it gets kinda repetitive, so multiple landers will be more fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T14:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have yet to get any sections to my liking for launch as their will be at least 10 launches that have to dock perfectly in 4 linked stacks. My Plan was to use disposable decent stages that stay on planet with a reusable ascent stage and a small orbital taxi. I think in the end this will save fuel as I can start at Eve so the lander for it and the fuel to get back to orbit will not fly very far. The orbital taxi will handle transfers to low orbit so that only just enough fuel will be dropped onto planet to get back and the mother ship can stay in whatever orbit it settles into from planetary transfer saving fuel on that end as well. If my numbers are right the main drives will need less than 20k delta v to make planetary transfers. If everything else is handled by much smaller sub craft and the heaviest of these are used and left early I think my current plan of LV-N Atomic Rocket engine clusters powered by 20 Rockomax Jumbo 64 fuel tanks can provide that much. From orbit ship will be about 60% fuel by weight but much of the remaining weight will not be making the full trip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"musicpenguin","CreatedById":57938,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T18:48:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice!
