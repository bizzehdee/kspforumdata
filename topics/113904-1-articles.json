I uninstalled KSP (also deleted Steam folder manually) and reinstalled the game. I\u0027ve started it, made a new default sandbox game, went straight into the VAB and placed an orange tank, on which I mounted approximately 32 radial parachutes (Mk2-R). I notice extreme fps drops doing this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere my persistent and log\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/z2gn9a1jn42qjir/radialParachute_exception.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/z2gn9a1jn42qjir/radialParachute_exception.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game seems to throw a million exceptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this post is better! Cya\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve narrowed it down a little more. Loading the Kerbal X craft in the VAB causes no issues allthough it has an parachute equipped. I can click the parachute, remount it nothing happens. The NullReferenceException seems to be an editor issue because when I click any parachute in the editor menue on the left I get exceptions thrown. I only need to click it for this to happen, no need to mount it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T20:52:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 08:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerbalEssences\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
