First one argues, that life-support will be a cool mechanics to add into the game, and another argues, that it\u0027s not necessary. The major disagreement between these two groups lies in will life support be too complex to have. But the thing is - complexity of life support is almost entirely depended on the way of\u00A0implementation. There might be countless amounts of parts and resources, required to keep\u00A0Kerbals alive, which truly might be too complex, and might be just a single part called life support with only 2 resources inside - oxygen and snacks, that drain over time,\u00A0which is no where near \u0022too complex\u0022. My point here is, that\u00A0there is no reason to argue whether it will be too much for the stock game or not, while we have no idea of the shape on life support, that will or will not be implemented into the game.\u00A0I want you guys to think about it\u00A0from a different perspective and be open minded.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile discussing possible improvements in KSP 2, a lot of people have talked about\u00A0how sending a manned missions before drones makes very little sense(i\u0027m\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003Etalking about the m\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003Eissions that\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003Eare at least \u0022get\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Eto orbit\u0022 complex)\u003C/span\u003E. I agree. Original Kerbal Space Program does not represent the level of complexity\u00A0included in manned missions, compared to unmanned ones.\u00A0There was no point in sending reconnaissance and testing missions to your destination.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst reason\u00A0for that is, that\u00A0all the information about celestial bodies, necessary for the missions, was already available in the Tracking Station. It\u00A0can easily be solved, by removing all the info from tracking station, and integrating process of\u00A0collecting said data into the progression system. Necessity of observing the Mun(or any other celestial body) with telescopes, researching acquired data, in order to calculate size/mass/orbital velocities,\u00A0and sending probes to it, in order to\u00A0clarify data, instead of blindly sending Kerbals roughly in the direction of the Mun(or any other celestial body), without any idea what will happen, should be essential and even \u003Cstrong\u003Efits well\u003C/strong\u003E with the concept of progression system through missions in the \u0022Adventure Mode\u0022 PC Gamer article talked about.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe second reason was, that in KSP 1, in order to send manned mission you only need 3 parts. Crew module, fuel tank and the engine(You don\u0027t even need the parachute\u00A0these days! Every Kerbal has his own!). For the unmanned mission however, instead of crew module, you need drone core. But that\u0027s not it. You also need a power source, to keep it running. Solar panels, fuels cells, RTGs, you name it. You also need a decent battery reserves, for your probe to not die, once it enters the dark side of any celestial body. And don\u0027t forget about antenna! You have to keep your up-link with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E in order to control your\u00A0vessel! Do i even have to mention necessity of relay satellites for the deep-deep space missions? All of that makes unmanned missions 10 times more complex, than the manned ones, which is precisely the opposite of how it should be and how it was and is IRL. And this can be solved precisely with introduction of life-support.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNecessity of having to put oxygen tank and supply of snacks on your rocket, can be the answer on\u00A0why you maybe should pick unmanned mission over the manned one, for a simple survey, that can be done autonomously and\u00A0Kerbals are not even necessary for. Inability to produce snacks and oxygen for kerbals\u00A0in mid-flight, while being able to produce electricity for the probe with solar panels, can be the answer on why you maybe should pick unmanned mission over the manned one, for a mission to a distant destination. Importance of sending unmanned survey missions also benefits from presence of life support, because of ability to measure the temperature/radiation levels/gravity/composition of the atmosphere, in order to use that data to understand, can Kerbals survive there\u00A0and which type of life-support will they need. And have you noticed how i mentioned\u00A0temperature/radiation levels/gravity/composition of the atmosphere? That\u0027s right! All the science experiments, from original KSP now suddenly have \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E ACTUAL PURPOSE\u003C/strong\u003E,\u00A0other than just collecting some magical science points, that will unlock new engine for you, which once again \u003Cstrong\u003Efits very well\u003C/strong\u003E with announced progression system through missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd since we are talking about progression system through missions - life-support can enhance even that. Think about how you would have to perform test-flights with experimental hardware in order to develop more advanced life-support systems. Don\u0027t tell me it won\u0027t be fun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome examples:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen you start your game you have nothing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* After you complete your first high-altitude flight and discover, that there is very little oxygen there, you unlock\u00A0a\u00A0oxygen cylinder, like the ones, that divers use.\u003Cbr\u003E\n*\u00A0When you complete your first sub-orbital flight and experience zero-G for the first time, you unlock tubes with food for your Kerbals, so you can actually feed them\u00A0in zero-G and perform flights, that are longer than just couple hours.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd so on and so on. Possibilities are almost limitless!\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd suddenly replicating X-15 flights now also have a purpose!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn conclusion i want to quote myself from my post about career mode. KSP is the game all about challenge of getting to space. If you are already enjoying original KSP, you definitely will enjoy new challenges of getting to space in the sequel, once you master them, just as you already mastered the challenges of original KSP. Don\u0027t be afraid of complexity. And remember, that this won\u0027t be boring by definition, but can become boring only if designed poorly. And just because it can be designed poorly, doesn\u0027t mean it will be. Having said all that, i am certain, that life-support will be a good addition to KSP 2, and i have faith, that Nate Simpson and all the guys from Intercept Games are capable of implementing it \u003Cstrong\u003Ein the way\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Eit will be fun\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd don\u0027t tell me how Jeb Kerman, orbiting Kerbin on a Space Chair with scuba diver oxygen cylinder attached and some chocolate bars in his pocket, is not in the Kerbal Spirit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-02T11:30:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2020 11:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Acid_Burn9\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-02T10:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt won\u0027t be fun if we can\u0027t do \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/4Uk1NNcUEgs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-02T10:52:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223813237\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195229\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593687095\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt won\u0027t be fun if we can\u0027t do \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/4Uk1NNcUEgs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can always be a toggleable feature, like Commnet is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Acid_Burn9","CreatedById":192392,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-02T10:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223813237\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195229\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593687095\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt won\u0027t be fun if we can\u0027t do \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/4Uk1NNcUEgs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWho says you won\u0027t be able to do something like this?

Even with dedicated resources, once you\u0027ve made one supply run, the problem is solved. Big habitation module (and well, the Hitchhiker module fit that description for me) will probably come with some resource processor integrated. Why ? Because if they do not, you will have to add them systematically to make it functional, so you might as well integrate it to the concerned parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame goes for the Command Module. It is assumed they have some oxygen included. Or that Kerbal don\u0027t breathe (but they do not generate waste either, so no need for waste management). I mean, you can abstract most of the LS system for short term mission. I mean, Apollo and Soyuz capsule all had some oxygen included, as well as some waste management and food processors of some kind. It\u0027s just included in the pods (the mk-1 and the Onion family one in game). For everything in Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, you do not really need LS system anyway, most of the trips are under one month, it\u0027s at most a few kilograms of stuff that can be abstracted in the total weight of the pods and/or the Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen people wants LS, it is to maintain long term to permanent settlements. To have a challenge to build those, and maintain them. Most of the maintenance can be automated away: you\u0027ve demonstrated your ability to do the supply run once, no need to do it again and again, it can become a simple tick converting funds into sustainability of your space station over time. If you want to manage roads of supply run, with an interstellar FedEx system connecting all you space station with an insane amount of logistics, then you\u0027ll have a game that will be more focused on logistics than it is on problem solving and building fun rocket to fly crazy missions toward Jool with only a command chair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can probably get away with it with a Supply resources and/or habitat part that include some sort of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E/waste recycling/plant growth/space cows. But I\u0027m not sure to understand what are the game mechanics added to the game by just one resources (I mean, we already have a lot of fuel, science points and stuff to manage, do we really want one more resources that can be abstracted away?). The Supply resource could also abstract maintenance costs. Because there won\u0027t be micro-meteorit either, and all parts will probably never break. And if it is, engineers have magic pocket containing all the needed part anyway. But then you need to add a new game mechanic of part consumption degradation of engines and system, parts breaking, and stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, beside the logistics system, one part of the LS that I\u0027d like to see more, is the mood of the kerbal. Are they connected to their home somehow? Do they enjoy the place they live? Do they want to go home? Do they feel lonely? Instead of delivering Supplies, you\u0027ll manage crew rotation (and will be able to build stories around relationship between said kerbals), which is globally the same (instead of sending a pod full of Supply you send a pod full of Kerbal, each of them carrying what they need). You will need different kind of Kerbal for some task (sitting alone for years in a pod to get around Jool, would require some personality traits for instance, or to have a connection to some habitats somehow).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCramped kerbals could work a bit less effectively. Lonely kerbals would require friends, or to get back home once in a while. Or a change of scenery. This can be done by having bunks in habutation module. Consuming EC to maintain the Kerbal entertained. Requiring some level of connection. All of that already game mechanics present in KSP. It will make Stock requiring to develop a bit more a communication network across the Kerbol system, and across the star It will require to probably setup some gateway station where kerbal sent on mission on outpost can have some R\u0026amp;R.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can make pressure on long term exploration mission done with one kerbal alone (and only its HAL system to talk to), and helps with the \u0022it\u0027s a fun and big adventure, not a logistics nightmare\u0022 thing that I like with KSP. It does not requires a new ressources that can be abstracted anyway, while giving volume to your individual Kerbals. With a potential of a lot more story telling than just shoveling Supply run in space, while Kerbals waits strapping on their chair, doing almost nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not need a Life support system based on yet another resource to manage. I need one that makes my Kerbal alive, develop personality quirks, develop relation ships, going on strike and having party when they\u0027re finally back on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"afafsa","CreatedById":129680,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-05T18:29:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the best way to keep life support simple,\u00A0regardless of how it is implemented,\u00A0is just to build a superb mission planner.

With mods you can also have greenhouses producing food but this consumes water, water use is still less than food an you might be able to mine ice, ice is unrealistic rare I say.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow you could\u00A0simplify this removing air and water requirements.\u00A0if you have methane and oxygen in your tanks you have oxygen and could burn methane for water,\u00A0that would not work for ships without chemical engines but is an process probably simpler than water recycling.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn long missions food it the bottleneck and the one thing who is hardest to produce as you need heavy and bulky greenhouses, in short you need to get colony greenhouses up and running before you run out of food unless you get resupply who also takes time.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow you could simply have the kerbals starting hibernating until they get food again so this would require an rescue mission.

Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E. However I do agree that any life support implementation needs to find a way to avoid tedium or it just becomes annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome good news on that front, in the recent PC Gamer article linked in another thread the devs specifically addressed this and said it would be possible to automate supply runs after you\u0027ve done it at least once yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me LS should be about Kerbals and what they can do or can\u0027t because they are hungry. Life support isn\u0027t so much a direct resource like a part but potential work like EC. Overload the supply and thing stop working but don\u0027t break they just recover a demand drops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it was me I\u0027d design life support the same way as EC. KC or KE each Kerbal has energy it trickles down if they do interesting things, it stays pretty stable if they don\u0027t on the assumption they eat, drink and generally take care of themselves if the situation allows. As others have said parts should generally be considered as fit for purpose with a stock of supplies like they have EC. If Kerbals can\u0027t take care of themselves like on a space walk it kicks back in as an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the mechanic is always there but ramps up as you do more interesting things but always solvable by a logical solution or the kerbal way because we will always find the Kerbal way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple mechanic then allows lots of other systems stock or mod to interact to make it as complex and as trivial as the player would like. Plus one very simple control to turn it off (no drain, no pain). Bonus those systems don\u0027t even need to know about each other just the core mechanic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause its about the Kerbals you can then adjust based on factors on the Kerbals - Training, Health, Interest. Mods can go nuts on adding detail and realism if they want. \u00A0 Also oddly you don\u0027t need to micro-manage groups as colonies would produce an excess of KE which would translate to product up the supply of KE and production will speed up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Acid_Burn9","CreatedById":192392,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-08T12:40:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223814977\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195229\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593894698\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167629\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brikoleur\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/4/2020 at 11:31 PM, Brikoleur said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of us in the LS skeptic community aren\u2019t worried about complexity.
