I\u0027ve finally put together a version that should work, so I\u0027ve decided to make a separate thread for it. I\u0027m putting it in add-on development instead of addon releases because it is untested at this point (I have loaded it in my game and the templates can be loaded, I have not tried using them yet). If anyone wants to help test it, it is available\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/RocketSquid/WBI-Medical-Expansion/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere.\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeatures:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt adds three new templates: The Sawbones medical station, the House Call medical clinic, and the Needleworks medical supply factory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Sawbones (science lab) allows scientists to turn medical kits and power into Medical Care, which is then used to recuperate a patient in the medical station at a whopping 10% per day. This process also produces medical waste, which can be recycled (50% efficiency) using the onboard autoclave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe House Call (habitat) cannot produce Medical Care, but can use Medical Care\u00A0it to provide 2% recuperation to a theoretically unlimited number of kerbals. It can also slowly manufacture medical kits from ore, plants, and water. Plants are produced in the MOBL from M.O.L.E. and I think in the cropworks, if not I will add a plant-producing greenhouse in the future. It would take two House Calls to support a single kerbal in the sawbones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Needleworks medical supply factory (factory) produces large amounts of medical kits from ore, rare metals, exotic minerals/minerite, plants, and water. It can also use medical waste in place of 90% of the ore, rare metals, and exotic minerals/minerite.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also modifies the castillo: it now has radiation shielding due to its concrete structure, and serves as a home away from home, granting \u002B2 health per day to kerbals inside it. The castillo factory and observatory get the radiation shielding but not the healing effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, it makes the ponderosa habitat reduce crowding and increase connected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketSquid","CreatedById":152665,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-09T03:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/RocketSquid/WBI-Medical-Expansion/releases/tag/v0.3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/RocketSquid/WBI-Medical-Expansion/releases/tag/v0.3\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCastillo radiation shielding has been removed, as it made the parts not appear in-game.

This is to increase the viability of bases on low-gravity worlds such as minmus, as well as in orbit, and to reduce the necessity for a medical kit supply chain or a Castillo, and balance the mod against stock or SSPXR parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossible issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not entirely sure on the balance of the various parts. The castillo is a truly immense boon, but it\u0027s also a truly immense part. The Saloon might be too powerful if loaded in a MOH; if so I will remove the moleHab tag from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sudragon","CreatedById":53192,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-20T12:28:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhats the easiest way\u00A0to provide shielding on stations built around the MOLE, Mk One Botany Lab and Mk one Habitat?

Lead is less effective than dedicated radiation shielding, but a coach can hold far more lead than a pod can hold radiation shielding. I have a station in munar orbit that only has proper radiation shielding in a few, non-WBI parts and thanks to a container of lead and some huge tanks of water the crew has negligible (i.e. shows up as zero) radiation exposure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
