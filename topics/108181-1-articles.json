I swear it used to always be lined up to face out of the hangar, and now it seems to always face in the direction the root part comes in\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to be able to make rovers by using a bunch of I-beam parts one after the other to form the base, but since I have to turn the parts sideways to do this, I can\u0027t do it any more since the symmetry turns sideways as well, unless I place a different part as a root part and then build the entire rover as an attachment to that part and then change the root part and delete it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also doesn\u0027t let you get different orientations on how it mirrors based on which way you turn the entire craft\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
