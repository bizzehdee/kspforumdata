First I\u0027ll introduce the craft I used, all of which have projectiles with a crash tolerance of 80m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the Yelll Mk I Broadside.

The Broadside can destroy fuel tanks and engines, but the Sniper can only destroy engines but not empty fuel tanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe projectile specs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBroadside RV59m/s,\u003Cstrong\u003Em0.57t\u003C/strong\u003E,DV59m/s (Low DV, Low Speed, High Mass, powerful weapon?!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESniper \u003Cstrong\u003ERV89m/s\u003C/strong\u003E,m0.13t,\u003Cstrong\u003EDV94m/s\u003C/strong\u003E (High DV, High Speed, Low Mass, weak weapon?!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t make sense. Bullets are light and fast, and they work in real life! But KSP is a physics simulator, so maybe Kinetic Energy is more important than just Velocity. KE=1/2*M*V^2. I don\u0027t know if it matters if a projectile is spinning or not, but relative velocity and DV were close enough that it doesn\u0027t matter for the projectiles I used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProjectile specs (Kinetic Energy = 1/2*Mass*Velocity):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBroadside 0.5*Mass*Relative Velocity^2=\u003Cstrong\u003E992\u003C/strong\u003E (If KE is high, strong weapon)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESniper 0.5*Mass*Relative Velocity^2=514 (If KE is low, weak weapon)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, the more effective weapon had a high KE. I\u0027ll need more testing to prove my theory, but I think KE is more important to KSP collisions than Crash Tolerance, or Speed and Mass alone! Future tests will confirm whether a fast spinning projectile (High M*DV, Low M*V) is better than a non spinning projectile (Low M*DV, High M*V). Let me know if you have any suggestions or information for me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey: RV = Relative Velocity in m/s. CT = Crash Tolerance in m/s. M = Mass in Tons.

Whoops. I\u0027ve edited the OP. That aside, you don\u0027t seem to have understood my post - crash tolerance is NOT what we think it is. Both projectiles had crash tolerances of 80m/s and traveled faster than 50m/s towards targets with crash tolerances of 12m/s or less, and yet it most cases the projectiles were destroyed, not the targets. Clearly mass or some other unknown factor is at work in determining whether the target or the projectile is destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
