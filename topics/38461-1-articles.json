I love the Concept of it, although i just feel like there is no Challenge in it at all, and that I don\u0027t have control over doing my own Exploration and Science in Career Mode [haven\u0027t tried the other Modes yet]. The Game is littered with Waypoints that just constantly point to the pin position on where to be, and what to do where. Personally, I would much prefer a \u0022Hard Mode\u0022 Option that disables Waypoints and \u0022big coloured circles on the Ground\u0022 and replace it with Co-Ordinates that I need to follow, this way, it will actually be about Exploration and Science. The Pictures instead of showing a big Green Box on the screen should also be removed, which at the end of your Mission, your Pictures will be priced on how effective they were.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Game is cheap, and again, the Concept is very nice indeed, however, I don\u0027t see it being a long time Gameplay style for me unless there is a reason to do some thinking in it, otherwise, it\u0027s just point A to point B to point C ect ect ect ect.
