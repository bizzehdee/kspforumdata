The shuttle must be independent and use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E on the M\u00FCn\u0027s surface, so that rules out hyperbolic and kerolox. The shuttle has a heavy crew compartment and only 1 small engine so the heavier fuel tanks and lower thrust of hyrdrolox are inferior to the higher thrust and density of methalox. Plus \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E is not an issue because it uses \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E so fuel is free and it\u0027s just a M\u00FCn shuttle. This the isp hit from methalox is not an issue, making it the obvious best choice. But for a similar Minmus shuttle a different propellant may be the best choice. Low gravity means that your engines thrust is not as important. Also water is very common on Minmus while methane is quite rare, this means you can land in easier spots. Furthermore the high isp and thus \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E savings from hyrdrolox allow you to carry extra passengers making hyrdrolox the obvious choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery fuel type would have pros and cons and be more of less applicable in certain situations. You would not have a best fuel because different fuels would be better our worse in certain applications. Even if you insist that you will end up with a super-fuel that will beat all others it would still add an immersive and entertaining progression mechanic. And even then when you have z-pinch fusion propulsion and nuclear turbo-jets you would still use a different fuel for the former than the latter. Having \u0022fusion fuel\u0022 instead of real chemicals would not only be a gross oversimplification, but would be disrespectful to the engineering in these wonderful ideas. The same basic thing applies to regular liquid fuels. I would not understand a ksp2 that has metallic hydrogen but no liquid hydrogen. Claiming that all liquid fuels are the same is like claiming all mammals are the same species just because they have some things in common.
