By far my most enjoyable playthrough of KSP1 involved lots of Scansat, such compelling gameplay and always felt much deeper than build a single satellite with all the science modules.

It feels like they have a vision of what the game should be - with only a single story mission and single playthrough in mind. It doesn\u0027t feel like they are experienced die-hard fans who really enjoyed all aspects and the rich diversity of the game and what it can be. But now I start to digress. I guess we\u0027ll just have to wait and see. Though for now, I\u0027m still on the verge of refunding my EA.

I think in time that stuff will get cleaned up and fleshed out. The bones are there it just needs work. So far all of the things they\u0027ve said about colonies and progression sound really smart to me and if those words match up to the finished experience the way procedural wings or (un-bugged) acceleration under timewarp have we\u0027re probably in pretty good shape.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-09T15:53:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2023 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-09T15:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224255572\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212812\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678376728\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell most games do build guidance into the progression system, and since the first-time user experience is so important to KSP I\u0027d be surprised if the first several missions aren\u0027t designed in some ways to walk players through the basics.
