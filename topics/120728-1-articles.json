I have a 27\u0022 2560x1440 display, and this game looks like it\u0027d be tough to play on even a 1920x1080 display. I saw a flight ui size slider, but that does nothing for every other part of the game and I haven\u0027t even gotten to a flight ui yet. This is a serious hindrance for myself (and many other people as just googling for a solution to this can attest). I\u0027m surprised this hasn\u0027t been mentioned yet here, but a search of the forums yielded no results. A way to scale the entire UI or just fonts even would help a ton in making this game playable. There\u0027s no reason I should have to get closer than a foot away from my 27\u0022 monitor to be able to read all of the text.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T14:05:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEnhanced Navball I think lets you rescale the navball, there IS a GUI size option in the non-game settings menu but I\u0027m not sure if it affects everything\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
