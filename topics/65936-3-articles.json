I noticed that the colony hub does not operate if it has no punch cards, but its purpose is to generate punch cards. In one of my first tests I launched with no punchcards and found myself with an inoperable base. This may be how you intended it to work, but it seems to me that the punchcard generator should be able to work without punchcards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso on the fix list - short version is that I procedurally generate all of the configs and need that one to not need PunchCards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Koooooj\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Koooooj\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I had a hard time selecting exactly 250 parts for the construction hub--I set up a very basic bootstrapping base with just a construction hub and a colony hub and wanted to have both operational with the construction parts on board. The slider snapped to increments of 100, though, so I could only either bring 200 (too few) or 300 (50 more than I wanted). I worked around it by taking 500 in the construction hub and 0 in the colony hub, but if you can set that tweakable to snap to counts of 50 or less then that would be ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me see if that\u0027s doable, had the same issue and had to do the same tweak.

On my map of the Mun water is *extremely* scarce, which I think is fine--the search for water is a pretty big thing in space exploration (or, at least, it is what makes it into the media--NASA mush have found water on Mars a dozen times by now). The algae tank lets you work around a lack of water just fine, but it strikes me as being unrealistic--you can generate mass with this unit. It would be within the suspension of disbelief if this module required some mundane resource, like \u0022dirt,\u0022 that was found everywhere. This prevents an orbiting algae tank from violating conservation of mass. For now I\u0027ll be self-imposing the rule that algae tanks only work when hooked up to some sort of drill. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, I am going over all of the parts to find gaps like this. I believe the new one requires substrate and enriched soil, so you need another module and some drilling to keep the operation going long term. Also the generation rate went up fivefold since you\u0027ll need lots of biomass to make polymers, and there had to be a way to generate biomass in cases where you have a lot fewer Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Koooooj\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Koooooj\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, though, looks pretty fantastic.

Yes (kinda). the Kerbitat MKS module is not crewed (none are), but it\u0027s required cap has a one crew capacity. The actual location of your Kerbals could be anywhere in the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Probably another way of thinking of it is that the Kerbitat has storage tanks for Waste/WasteWater/CO2, which are then consumed by other attached modules to convert them, and the Kerbitat in turn can store resources regardless of where the generation module is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Since all of the MKS bits would have to be linked to operate, once your ship is docked you could just transfer from any Kerbitat, which should all stay at a pretty high net amount due to the closed system - and if you drained one, it would just be the first to fill up again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo one way to get what you are looking for would be to have your Kerbitats brimming with food/water/oxy on launch (they hold 500 each). Alternatively, if that number is too low, I could always add in a stand-alone high capacity provisions module specifically to handle this kind of excess conversion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
