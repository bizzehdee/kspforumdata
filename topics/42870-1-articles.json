There is a well known fix for this, but asking people to muck around in the settings.cfg file seems like it may not be the best way of addressing the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest solution that I can think of is just to put a dedicated terrain quality option in the settings menu. That way people could leave the regular terrain setting on high (and avoid some of the issues that occur when lowering this) and put the ocean terrain setting on low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this issue has been brought up many times before, but I have yet to see this as an actual suggestion. It isn\u0027t in the list of things already suggested either. It seems like something that would be relatively simple to change and it would greatly improve the experience for a large segment of KSP\u0027s users.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T16:43:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not only the oceans though, many players raise the pixel light and shadow cascades values, and both of these come with large processor overhead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T21:43:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s not only the oceans though, many players raise the pixel light and shadow cascades values, and both of these come with large processor overhead.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s true, but there are dedicated sliders for both of those settings.

And the suggestion given over and over again, by players, moderators, and devs, is to dig into the settings.cfg file and change the ocean terrain values. A simple drop down box in the settings menu seems to be a far more intuitive solution, and one less likely to screw up game files (never underestimate people\u0027s ability to not follow simple instructions).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T21:47:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep you are right, a slider to make changing the seas complexity easy would be a great addition \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
