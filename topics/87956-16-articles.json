No, I don\u0027t buy that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines \u0027in real life\u0027 are always tested to extremes, and the resulting rating for \u0027full throttle\u0027 is always going to be well below the true limits of what the engine can really handle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, if these engines are that sensitive, then there\u0027s something wrong with the configuration settings that needs to be addressed. In other words, this isn\u0027t \u0027operator error\u0027 as you seem to be implying, this is a flat-out manufacturing flaw, a defective product that should be fixed by the factory, if you will. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, my two cents.
