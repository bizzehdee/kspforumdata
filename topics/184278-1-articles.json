There are two main kinds of evaporator, separated by how they heat up the metal: Thermal evaporators, which heat up the metal using electricity (typically going through a resistor in which the metal sits), and\u00A0 E-Beam evaporators which use a beam of high voltage electrons to heat the metal. When heated, most metals will liquefy before they evaporate, and don\u0027t disturb the high vacuum. In fact, they often help the vacuum through a process called gettering, where the evaporated metal vapors react with the tiny amount of gas in the chamber (typically water at 1*10^-8 atm), and then stick the resulting compound as a metal oxide/hydroxide on the chamber wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s many excellent metal amalgams.

From our perspective it means they have extremely high surface tension, even relative to water. Their adhesion depends 100% on what surface they\u0027re on. When we want low adhesion, we tend to use specific ceramics or sometimes vitreous carbon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s several forms of electric levitation that work on molten metals. The main one I\u0027m familiar with uses eddy currents for levitation much like the standard Physicist\u0027s jumping ring trick. It\u0027s used very rarely in specialized \u0027inductive\u0027 evaporators. As far as I\u0027m aware, it should work in the 1s of kHz region but the paper I link to suggests using RF. You can also use a quadrupole electric field if the molten metal is provided a net charge to ground (which in practice is fairly easy). About a decade ago I really wanted to build one, but fortunately discovered before starting they\u0027re a huge pain in the rear end.

technologies is the laser wakefield accelerator which can produce a pulsed beam of electrons at 1 GeV using a tabletop device (1m).\u00A0 I couldn\u0027t see the application at first because it does not alter the neutron balance.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, these electron pulses on semiconductors can generate muons.\u00A0 Muons can replace electrons in atoms, but with much smaller average distance from the nucleus.\u00A0 Therefore they shrink the Coulomb barrier.\u00A0 This makes duetrons and alpha particles way more susceptible to fusion.\u00A0 And my intuition would be more likely to breed heavy elements as well, especially at the surface where metal and alpha particles meet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice

Several elements of this throw up hoax red flags for me, but honestly the bulk of it passes the smell test for good science done in good faith. As a whole, I\u0027m inclined to believe it. Definitely going to run a copy over to a condensed matter group at work to see what they think. If even a quarter of what\u0027s presented is true, it\u0027s jaw droppingly amazing- Hydrogen at a density of 100, able to exist as a stable free phase! Too good to be true doesn\u0027t begin to cover it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-12T05:41:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2019 05:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Cunjo Carl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-12T12:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell the muons have a lifetime of 2 x 10^-6 s.\u00A0 Not stable at all.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWakefield accelerators typically shoot 50 femtosecond pulses at a rate of 50 Hz.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-01/using-muons-disguise-chemists-fool-helium-thinking-its-hydrogen\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-01/using-muons-disguise-chemists-fool-helium-thinking-its-hydrogen\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
