Two transfers at same point ?  \n\n- I\u0027m not advanced enough to send rockets on perfect optimitic trajectories (and sometimes I try to do rendez-vous ^^), so I need some \u0022circularize manuver avidity\u0022 values at some steps. Where to be useful, and how ? draw triangles with capture and loworbit for sample ?   \n\n- It will take me years to populate it !! (and I have no wrapping abilities ^^!)  \n\nThere is a gap between the flies I do (and the values I reach, by chance, mistake and successives attempts), and the process to get some \u0022right\u0022 values.  \n\nI would basically draw a map of the system while discoverring it, but now I\u0027d rather find a way to finish it fast, and with some accuracy.
