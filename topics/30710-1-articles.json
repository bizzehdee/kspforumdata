For example, if you descend very slowly to Mun\u0027s surface, you will burn a lot of fuel hovering even though you\u0027re covering the same distance that the ideal figures talk about. Landing at higher lattitudes on Mun can also cost more fuel than landing near the equator (depending on how you get there), and so on. If you\u0027d like an example, I made a rocket that should have enough dV for the job, and wrote out a flight path that is not ideal, but should be reasonably close to a minimal fuel method.

So make sure that your lower stages have enough delta-v to get into orbit, and then make sure that your upper stages have enough to get you to the Mun and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, your ascent from ground level to Low Kerbin Orbit should take about 4500-5000 m/s of delta-v. I prefer to engineer a bit of extra safety into my designs and try to aim for the 5000 m/s marker, as it is more forgiving if my Thrust-to-Weight-Ratio is a little lower than optimal, or if I accidently cut my engines halfway through (I have done this).

I\u0027ve found totals to be a little iffy before, as they don\u0027t take into account where you burn your engines (you can get much higher efficiency in space than at sea level, so if you\u0027re burning with your transfer stage in atmosphere, then you\u0027re wasting fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr, design your ship in two parts, one to ascend through the atmosphere, the other to get to the Mun and back.

The best thing to do would be to measure your delta-v at each point along the trip and let us know which specific steps seem to be costing more delta-v than you calculated they should. Any of the steps could be done inefficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most common place that you\u0027ll find suboptimal maneuvers is in landing. If you go from a normal orbit, kill most of your rotational velocity so that you start dropping, then occasionally thrust upward to keep your downward velocity from getting too high, you can easily double or triple the delta-v required to land, and when I was learning, sometimes I\u0027d go even higher. This is a common way for people to land before they learn how to do it more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people do rather inefficient launches as well. I normally budget about 4750-4800 m/s for launchpad to LKO, but when I was learning, I\u0027d occasionally have a bad launch that took closer to 6000 m/s delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer burn should be a single burn in LKO, and should be a hohmann transfer. Don\u0027t overshoot, you want the transfer orbit to have an apoapsis very close to the Mun\u0027s orbital altitude. If you use a higher apoapsis, then not only does it take more delta-v to transfer into that trajectory, but you have to kill more velocity when you reach the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEfficient circularization at the Mun requires a fairly accurate intercept. The higher your Munar periapsis pre-circularization, the more delta-v it\u0027s going to take to circularize in a low orbit over the Mun. Also note that if you need to lower your periapsis right after crossing into the Mun\u0027s SoI, radial burns tend to be more efficient than prograde/retrograde burns in order to change your periapsis, since you\u0027re not close to your apoapsis or periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturning to Kerbin efficiently is basically burning so that you leave the Mun\u0027s SoI moving in the Mun\u0027s retrograde direction (compared to the Mun, you\u0027ll still be moving in the same direction as the Mun, just not as fast) so that you\u0027re in an orbit with an apoapsis near the Mun and a Kerbin periapsis of about 20km. I\u0027ve never managed to do that perfectly, but you want your munar transfer burn to be as close to this as possible so that any correction burns are small. Lifting so that you\u0027re barely out of the Mun\u0027s SoI and then setting up the return trajectory may sound close enough, but it\u0027s not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR: Use Kerbal Engineer Redux or MechJeb to measure your delta-v during the mission and compare that to what your plan says you should have, and that should narrow down what part of the mission is going over budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bloody_looser\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bloody_looser\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENecro alert.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUgh, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T22:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bloody_looser\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bloody_looser\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENecro alert.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only that, the presented tool is, as of now, kinda broken - it only gives a correct sum of dV for the first body you click on, every other selection fails to reset and gives false results.
