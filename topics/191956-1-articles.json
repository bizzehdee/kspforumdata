This is great for cinematography, but I had a new idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI discovered this idea while working on a KSP craft troubleshooting scheme. The scheme has since been discarded, but the idea could potentially be used for other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea is simple: imagine the F2 pause mode, but\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewith\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0all the stats and overlays outside of the pause menu. You should be able to\u00A0look at your kerbal list, take a look at your speed, monitor mod windows, Check Yo Staging\u2122, and other things. of course things like turning your ship or changing throttle wouldn\u0027t have immediate effects since the game would still be paused, but you can run through a pre-landing checklist during a heated moment, or take a picture of your current stats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow I think it should be implemented is cycling through modes with F2. For example, you pause and hit F2, and you\u0027re now in the 1.9 camera mode. You hit it again, and you go to my idea: the pause camera with overlays. You hit it a third time, and you\u0027re back at the pause menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think of it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
