Series, Kenshi and Mount \u0026amp; Blade Warband. At first, it looks like a wild, disjointed selection, but in reality they\u0027re all games that share something very important in common: Emergent narrative elements in a world where the player is just another person, rather than \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E protagonist. Save for common story elements on the first series, every experience you will have is different, every goal you could craft is different, every way of achieving that goal is different as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it stands right now, the only thing that makes your experience of KSP1/2 different to mine (before mods) is how we design our rockets. Anything but that is the exact same for you and me, and the challenges we\u0027ll face will be the same: Land on the easy bodies, maybe try Moho and Eeloo, a Jool 5, make an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, and an Eve ascent vehicle. Anything after that is roleplay. KSP2 is shaping to be the same, even if they include a grotesque amount of \u0022discoverables\u0022, and there\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eone thing\u003C/em\u003E that makes the idea worse: They\u0027re selling it as an exploration game, even if what we\u0027ll end up exploring, seeing, and achieving is almost exactly the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is sadly the current state for most single-player experiences: A bottled in little story with few divergences, that requires you to not look at anyone else doing it, lest you \u003Cem\u003Espoil the experience\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cem\u003Efor yourself\u003C/em\u003E, because it\u0027s literally gonna be the same for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI honestly don\u0027t know what I expect, but I do want to see the narrative side taken further since they mentioned hiring writers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNah man, we\u0027ll get to discover a mysterious new distant planet full of ruins of an ancient civilization.. guiding us to DebDeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cocoscacao","CreatedById":225696,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-02T14:51:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224336182\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221698933320\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258026\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n56 minutes ago, PDCWolf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it stands right now, the only thing that makes your experience of KSP1/2 different to mine (before mods) is how we design our rockets.

You can choose to not ally with any lord, or take on the cause of the exiled lords. There\u0027s also the fact that what happens on your map, and thus the story of your character, will be completely different, as that\u0027s pretty much emergent narrative. That\u0027s the thing with open ended, emergent narrative games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 is open ended, but has almost no narrative elements save for whatever story will come out of the easter eggs or discoverables, which even if told non-linearly, will start and end up in exactly the same place on your first or hundredth play-through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to fix that? I\u0027m sure there\u0027s hundreds of ways that me and others could\u0027ve thought of, and not a single one of them realizable because we\u0027re getting another puddle depth lego game. They could\u0027ve turned the contract system into something remarkable by transforming it with allegiance/sponsorship mechanics with different companies, governments, competing space programs/nations and so on. Colonies could be an interesting point as well if included in that same system. Kerbals could actually be unique individuals rather than having different hair and skin colors and randomized stats. Heck, just think of similar games like Stormworks or From The Depths, just having \u003Cem\u003Ea purpose\u003C/em\u003E for vehicles other than get X to Y place, drives players to extremely different playstyles, where you\u0027ll find some people never ever develop a water tanker helo/plane for forest fires, others just do trains, and so on. In KSP2 the only way for those to be born is self imposed restrictions, or role-play, because not even contracts are there to challenge you anymore.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why I have so little faith in \u0022exploration mode\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, to continue the rant, here\u0027s another piece of mind: for my stint as a gaming journalist, one of my personal jobs was to review the Sims and its expansions. EA would provide us an account with access to all DLCs forthe Sims 4 every time they added a new one. Do you know why the Sims 4 is such unfunny, soulless garbage? Exactly for the same I\u0027m describing. Every DLC is its little uninspired, disjointed, bottled in experience. Back in Sims 1, 2, and even parts of 3, Sims would act on their own most of the time, and every non-asset DLC would add stuff \u003Cem\u003Eto the world\u003C/em\u003E. This meant every sim could partake in the new features. You\u0027d have your neighbors be turned into vampires by a random visitor, people marrying and having children, cheating, doing good or bad at their work, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConversely, Sims 4 is a dollhouse where nothing happens unless you directly intervene for it to happen. You can start your save, play for 7 generations of Sims, go out of your house and realize the world is exactly the same as when you started. Added DLC? That\u0027s something only you can partake in, and will only meet the sims pre-generated for the DLC plus maybe one or two visitors from the homeless sim pool. Once you\u0027re back from the DLC area? no one cares, no one knows, and no one will ever partake in that. Thus every DLC is a droolfest pit of clicking, and then going back and never playing it again, or seeing its effects again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AtomicTech","CreatedById":210823,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-02T16:19:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022d1866187d1aa9f0cfef0c7c3327dd0f3fb358142\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002235.97\u0022 height=\u0022250\u0022 width=\u0022695\u0022 src=\u0022https://2kgamer.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/original/3X/d/1/d1866187d1aa9f0cfef0c7c3327dd0f3fb358142.gif\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wheehaw Kerman","CreatedById":223516,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-02T21:23:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224336182\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221698933320\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258026\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, PDCWolf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy worry is not discoverables or no discoverables.
