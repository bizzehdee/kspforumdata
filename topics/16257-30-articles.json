Basically you need one or two highly elliptical satellites around Kerbin (upto 9000km or whatever the base dipole antennas range is) and on those satellites you put dishes, you then point those dishes at your Jool base station to use the example above and have a dish on the Jool station pointing back AT THE SATELLITE WITH THE DISH. if you point \u0022at Kerbin\u0022 it doesn\u0027t work, it must be specifically targetted at the ship targetting it. Thus you must make pairs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy relay network consists of a lot of satellites with 4 dishes each (not unrealistic for actual satellites) and those 4 dishes point at 4 other satellites making an awfully complicated relay network that practically never fails.

The \u0022long\u0022 links, between say Eeloo and Duna etc are done with the 9000 sats from manned vessel to another manned vessel, so whilst links may break between the planets when the half geostationary orbits are blocked, they act as base stations themselves for probes in that vicinity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the maximum range for anything other than a satdish 9000 is 50Gm, which is at a stretch, the distance from Kerbin to Dres. it will not reach Jool except when Kerbin is on the same side as Jool in an orbit (so about 90 days worth or so at a stretch) then like 2 years of no contact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tek_604","CreatedById":59699,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T16:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lyndonguitar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lyndonguitar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow does it affect Mechjeb? sorry IF I have lots of questions\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a connection to KSC, you can command new nodes with MJ.

But, I\u0027d like to be clear on the second point. As I\u0027ve stated in previous posts, I use MJ for piloting. To me, this is no different than uploading a sequence to a spacecraft, even if I didn\u0027t personally work out the maths myself (which, as far as I can tell, we can\u0027t, as we have no real idea on the positions of bodies at given times, or even able to plan missions to the second, as is the case in real life).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if MJ \u0022uploads its sequence\u0022 to the spacecraft during comms, and then we lose contact, there is no real reason/explanation as to why MJ should then not be able to carry out the planned burn sequence. Its just that when out of comms, we should not be allowed to plan any more sequences, or at least, not upload them to the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, I do understand that as the two mods stand, its either impossible, or at best, very difficult to implement. These thoughts are from a gameplay/realism point of view, not coding. Now, from a coding perspective...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I think needs to be done, is an interface be developed as a way to have the two mods play nicely. My first thought would be to take the code from both mods, and have a combined mod - \u0022RemoteTech MechJeb\u0022 - this seems like a perfectly reasonable and doable solution. Second thought is to agree an interface which allows RemoteTech to send commands to MJ (disable/enable node creation - which we kind of have now, with the disable MJ button, and the mechanics of loss of comms), or MJ to send commands to the RT Flight Computer (which we don\u0027t currently have).
