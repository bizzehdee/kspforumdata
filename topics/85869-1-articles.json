Also try another port on the motherboard, as it is unlikely that it got damaged but is easily tested. Just make sure to adjust any necessary settings in the BIOS.

The very first thing I ever did with a computer, was break it (apparently it\u0027s a bad idea to open it up \u0026amp; touch the guts while its on). I come from those distant, dark days when the simplest hardware change meant meant hours of fiddling (anyone remember IRQ\u0027s? Show of hands? No one? How bout setting jumpers? No?) and possibly sacrificing the blood of a virgin to Gzxtyos, consort of Othuyeg. Or calling tech support, but that was only a last resort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint is, such projects NEVER work as they should for me and always take way longer than I think (takes me a couple hours just to change the oil on the trucks, but darn it, it stays changed!). So anything mission-critical like this I\u0027d rather just pay someone who\u0027s smarter than me to do it properly and punctually. That way I have some one else to yell at if something goes wrong.

Most people don\u0027t even know this can be an issue, yet it probably causes a lot of the issues with homebuilt systems you see. I am fairly sure many dead GPU\u0027s and RAM both come from a lack of proper ESD conduct.
