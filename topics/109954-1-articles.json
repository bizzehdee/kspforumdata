This plugin allows you to tweak a handful of those fields in the VAB via the right-click menu, without having to muck around in the actual part files. These fields were also made persistent so they will stay with your saved vessel and behave as expected after unfocusing and refocusing a vessel.\n\nThe fields I chose to make tweakable are the ones I both fully understood (through testing) and felt were the most useful for fairing customization. They include:\n\n- **Divisions** - How many vertical slices the fairing is divided into. *(\u0027nArcs\u0027 in the part files) **[Depricated - tweak now included in stock]***\n- **Max Height** - The maximum height for each section when building the fairing. *(\u0027xSectionHeightMax\u0027 in the part files)*\n- **Edge Smooth** - Roundness between edges of sections. *(\u0027edgeWarp\u0027 in the part files)*\n\nFeel free to post any bugs or suggestions.\n\n**Download Current Version (1.0.2)** 23 April 2016, for KSP v1.1\n\n(source included)\n\n[Spacedock](http://spacedock.info/mod/575/Stock%20Fairing%20Tweaker?ga=%3CGame\u002B3102\u002B%27Kerbal\u002BSpace\u002BProgram%27%3E)\n\n[Curse](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/230678-stock-fairing-tweaker)\n\n*\\*ModuleManager included and required*\n\n**Changelog**\n\nSpoiler\n\n[v1.0.2  - 23 April 2016]\n\n- Updated to work with KSP 1.0\n\n- Removed \u0027divisions\u0027 tweak (included in stock now)\n\n[v1.0.1 - 22 June 2015]\n\n- Fixed a bug that reverted tweakables to default settings when reverting to VAB/SPH\n\n[v1.0 - 19 May 2015]\n\n- Initial release\n\n**License**\n\nSpoiler\n\n\u0022Stock Fairing Tweaker\u0022 Kerbal Space Program mod\n\nCopyright \u00A9 2015 Chase Barnes\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \u0022Software\u0022), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u0022AS IS\u0022, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This one is definitely a welcome addition, thanks!\n\nI actually think proc fairings look and behave a lot better than stock fairings, but I really love the level of customization the stock fairings offer, plus the exploded view that allows you to access parts underneath is beyond awesome. And being stock, the guarantee that they play nice with other systems is a plus.\n\nI\u0027ve also heard a lot of people complaining about the way stock behaves with regard to inline fairings, but personally it\u0027s never been a problem for any of my vessels with inline fairings.\n\nMy plugin alleviates some of the aesthetic issues a bit when compared to proc fairings. I\u0027m hoping that given time I\u0027ll be able to find a way to get the sections to stick together on deployment, eliminating the \u0022grenade\u0022 effect that everyone hates so much (i.e. a fairing tweaked with Divisions=2 will fall away in just two pieces like a clam shell).
