But I went on to play Parts 22 and 23 in the meantime, still in version 0.22. Well, now I have version 0.23 up and running, and I\u0027m jumping back in time here to do that transfer of ships. Since I\u0027m doing the transfers in a separate save file, this was easy. It just took me a little while to get around to it because handling yet another armada of ships to Jool is not nearly as exciting for me as it once was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Laythe at this time, Hellou and Emilynn were on Fredoly Island doing a lot of exploring via rover, so let\u0027s look in on our boys on Dansen Island:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022The boys at KSC are getting ready to send the next batch of ships to us.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Great. Are we finally getting the resources processing modules?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022No. And we aren\u0027t likely to get any before we return to Kerbin.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022What have the guys in Division 19 been doing all this while?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Apparently they haven\u0027t been able to get any of the equipment to work out the way they wanted. So that project has been terminated for the foreseeable future.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Dude! I so wasted all my time taking that resources processing training. What ARE we getting?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Three ships will be sent, all double Tug trains with extra fuel, since we aren\u0027t going to be refining any fuel here. One is another SSTO spaceplane...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Another one? Same as the one already on the way here?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022No, this one has the new R.A.P.I.E.R. engine. When the first spaceplane arrives I\u0027ll want you and Emilynn to test it. When the R.A.P.I.E.R. one arrives later, I\u0027ll want you and Nelemy to test it. The boys at KSC are very interested in how they will compare. It will also arrive with a second NAMOR vehicle.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Any toys for me?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Yes. The second ship will have a R.A.P.I.E.R. version of the SSTO rocket crew carrier. I\u0027ll want you and Nelemy to test that. It\u0027s supposed to be more fuel efficient than our original one.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENelemy: \u0022Cool, Dude!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022The third ship will be a 3-kerbal version of the BirdDog. You know that our replacement crews are going to be half scientist-astronauts, so they wanted that ship here so a pilot-astronaut can ferry the eggheads around to different sites.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Who gets to test that one?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThompbles: \u0022Me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the four Reusable Rocket launches of the payloads for constructing Train #1: A nuclear Tug; a fuel tank payload (with Refueler Topper to refuel the Tug, which uses fuel to pull the sustainer into orbit, as you may recall); another nuclear Tug; and the R.A.P.I.E.R. spaceplane/NAMOR payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MLO5QHs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MLO5QHs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA closer view of the R.A.P.I.E.R. spaceplane. It has the same basic structure as the Ladyhawk spaceplane, but with the newer engine on the back instead of a turbojet. Also, the docking port has been relocated to the center of mass to make it easier for a Tug to push the plane around in orbit, if needed (the Ladyhawk\u0027s docking port is located ahead of its center of mass), and there are two vertical stabilizers instead of one to make docking easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe odd structure attached to the plane\u0027s docking port is a \u0022Saddlebag Deorbiter\u0022 that was designed after the Ladyhawk was already on its way to Laythe, just in case the Ladyhawk proved to be too marginal as an SSTO spaceplane. The Deorbiter would be used to deorbit the spaceplane, and then it would detach and accelerate back up to orbital speed (later returning to Laythe Station for refueling). This would allow the Ladyhawk to land with completely full tanks (instead of using any of its fuel for deorbiting). The Saddlebag Deorbiter could also be used for by the new R.A.P.I.E.R. spaceplane (the arrangement of Rockomax 24-77 engines is such that one pair can be turn off to allow thrusting through the CoM of the Ladyhawk, while all four would be used on the R.A.P.I.E.R. spaceplane). As it turned out (we now know because of the Ladyhawk\u0027s success in Part 23), the Saddlebag Deorbiter will not be necessary...but the boys at KSC don\u0027t know that as of the time of this flashback). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe NAMOR 21 marine rescue vehicle is behind the spaceplane (since this rocket re-uses the same payload configuration as used for the Ladyhawk launch). And it will be nice to have an extra NAMOR, just in case. This one has had its tanks properly tweaked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/405Eeib.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022405Eeib.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, after three dockings (with some rearrangement of parts), Train #1 is complete and fully fueled for Jool, and the four radial refueler pods are jettisoned. The pods are deorbited using RCS and crashed on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WRG8ult.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WRG8ult.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, the four launches needed to assemble Train #2: Nuclear Tug, Fuel, Nuclear Tug, and the R.A.P.I.E.R.

This was designed to be as small as possible. It has a four-kerbal Hitchhiker Can for the crew, four R.A.P.I.E.R. engines, and eight parachutes for landing. Its center tank is a Rockomax X200-16, and there are four FL-T200 tanks around that (which have their oxidizer levels tweaked down a couple notches so that excess oxidizer doesn\u0027t need to be carried aloft). Corfrey Kerman was able to barely get a prototype into a 75 km orbit around Kerbin, and (using the rest of its fuel and almost all of its RCS monopropellant) brought it back for a parachute landing at KSC. So it should work better at Laythe...and a small FL-T100 fuel tank was added to the nose to give it an extra margin of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/M6XbF5T.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022M6XbF5T.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final docking in the assembly of Train #2 is seen below.

This plane uses exactly the same basic structure as the BirdDog (so that it can use the same GasStations for refueling). It has two single-kerbal lander cans added on either side at the center of mass behind the ram intakes to keep the aerodynamics as close as possible to that of the BirdDog. Some parts (batteries, solar panels) have been relocated to the underside or sides of the plane because it is suspected that the original BirdDog\u0027s tendency to pitch up at high angles of attack is probably due to the parasite drag of all the parts that were on top of the plane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Airedale weighs more than the BirdDog (by about 1.3 tons), but testing at KSC indicates that it lands just fine, even with a full load of fuel. In addition to their use in carrying one extra kerbal each, one of the single-kerbal cans is fitted out internally with lab equipment, and the other one is fitted out as a habitat module, to give crews more comfort (one at a time) on exploration trips. As with previous BirdDog payload configurations, the Airedale is riding on top of a GasStation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ik1Kjzz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ik1Kjzz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Train #3 is complete and ready for sending to Jool (the three refueler pods that were mounted on the GasStation\u0027s booms are seen drifting away after being jettisoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AJOvwi8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AJOvwi8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...that took twelve more launches of the Reusable Rocket. I also checked to be sure the upgraded landing legs work on the Reusable Rocket. I always have MechJeb bring the sustainers back to KSC, and all twelve landed safely (but a couple came close to landing on something that would have toppled them). The landing legs of the sustainers were set to have locked suspensions, which worked fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xYc1Fyn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xYc1Fyn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also followed down a set of the side boosters to be sure that they survived landing on the upgraded legs, but in this case I left the leg suspensions unlocked. Below, one of the side boosters touches down safely under its parachutes with no damage (you can see another of the four boosters landing off in the distance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EPpgKRQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EPpgKRQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith my version 0.23 install, I have switched from using my favorite Maneuver Node Improvement mod (which has had its development discontinued) to the Precise Node mod that provides the same functionality. Precise Node seems to work great. It has the all-important feature that collapsed maneuver nodes can be opened using the O key, and its user interface seems somewhat better than that of the Maneuver Node Improvement mod, except that Precise Node uses red color to highlight buttons...and red does not show up well at all against black for colorblind ol\u0027 me. But I found tweaking the node values to be easier in this mod, and it lets you easily change the number of conic samples as well as the conics mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrecise Node has a \u0022Focus on Vessel\u0022 button that is not particularly useful to me because I use the keyboard shortcut (the Backspace key) to do that same thing. What I would REALLY like is if that button was replaced by a pop-up menu that let you pick which planet/moon to focus on (in addition to your vessel), since that still gives me difficulty sometimes in the Map interface (trying to focus on a planet may instead result in you focusing on a ship that is orbiting or landed on that planet...I guess the guys at Squad did not test the behavior of focusing on planets when they had lots of ships around them). Below is the standard targeting of Train #1 to the Jool system so you can see Precise Node in action. The ellipse oriented at 90 degrees on the screen are the paths of the three Tugs returning from Jool (and the outgoing orbits for the previous batch of ships, which would be here at this time, are not there because I\u0027ve already jumped ahead and delivered them at Jool previously).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/22hbo0Z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002222hbo0Z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used my standard two-pass escape burns to send the three trains off to Jool. Below we see Train #1 doing the first half of its burn (which is burned until it had 10 minutes left to go); and then Train #2 far out from Kerbin after the first half of its burn, dropping its empty rear tank; and then Train #3 during the second half of its burn when it dropped its rear tank. Doing the burns in two parts gives better fuel efficiency because the burns take place closer to Kerbin with enhanced Oberth effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gjUIjAp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gjUIjAp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plot below shows the orbits after the first parts of the burns (just after the burn for Train #3... you can see that I stopped when it had 10 minutes left of the burn). Note that Train #2 (the SSTO rocket) required a longer burn, so it is going out further. Happily, the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn did not interfere with any of the burns. BUT, the long trains were very wobbly under physical time warp, so I could not use it (so that was about one hour of total burn time, and that doesn\u0027t include the setup time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Gl5us8H.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Gl5us8H.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second parts of the burns, I targeted then as close to Jool as possible using Conics Mode 0. This involves changing the focus to Jool, then orienting the view close in at Jool but with the node visible off in the distance so it can be tweaked (and, as I said, the interface in Precise Node for tweaking the node values with the buttons works very well). The ascending nodes of the transfer orbits were all close to Jool (for Train #1 it was even inside Jool\u0027s sphere of influence), so they will not take a lot of fuel when the time comes to do them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/86pJBhO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002286pJBhO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the result of my efforts: three nice outgoing transfer orbits to Jool (and the very close together orbits of the returning Tugs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JKRYv6m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JKRYv6m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock, of course, is also my friend. Below you can see the alarms I set up for when the returning Tugs would reach Kerbin\u0027s SOI, and when the outgoing Trains would reach their ascending nodes (or when Train #1 will reach Jool\u0027s SOI). With all that set up, I was ready to fast-forward out of this flashback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/531yMWH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022531yMWH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 24 Proper\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the future! Here we are back to the \u0027present\u0027 time. Emilynn has just completed here first test flight of the Ladyhawk, and we are ready for more fun on Laythe... but the first alarms that come up are for the Tugs returning to Kerbin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OP9uqv2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OP9uqv2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Tug 7 falls into the Kerbin system toward its aerocapture target altitude (set up when I targeted the encounter after leaving Jool). No tweaking was needed, but (as always) I made sure to sneak the ship across the Sphere of Influence boundary at 1x speed to preserve the fine targeting. Tug 7 was targeted for aerocapture at 28.6 km (it reached a maximum speed of 4,990 m/s at the start of aerocapture), and ended up in an elliptical orbit with approximately 1000 km apoapsis. While far out, I did a plane correction to get its orbit to 0 degrees inclination, then made an aerobraking pass to drop its apoapsis. Finally, at apoapsis, a burn was made to get the Tug into a stable low orbit, ready for refueling and re-use (except that this older Tug has only standard docking ports, and I tend to prefer the Senior ports for interplanetary transfers now). If only my kerbals could add struts during EVA, I could upgrade these older tugs to have Senior docking ports. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UdyIE6Y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UdyIE6Y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4IvfedZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224IvfedZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NrVuHbQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NrVuHbQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, Tug 8 returned and was captured.

This one is more valuable because it has Senior docking ports, so it will be easy to re-use the next time I want to send a train out to Laythe. In the first image below you see the Tugs falling in toward Kerbin with the cool clouds and city lights mod, so Kafrica is showing up well on the night side. Aerocapture target altitude was 29.7 km, giving an initial captured apoapsis of 1763 km...followed by aerobraking and raising periapsis out to a stable orbit. All of the Tugs that returned have between 95 and 150 units of fuel left, so they can maneuver to better orbits for refurbishment later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uzgm4qp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uzgm4qp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HvarL0s.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HvarL0s.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, lots of nuclear Tugs are sitting in orbit around Kerbin, waiting for re-use.

He did this while still fairly low, because the plane responds to direction changes much quicker in the thick atmosphere than it does higher up.

The rear jet fuel tank still had over 56 units of fuel, and the FL-T400 tank had almost 80 fuel and 105 oxidizer. The two FL-T200 tanks on the sides were still completely full. MechJeb reported that the ship had 2567 m/s of delta-V at this point (the first test flight made it into a lower orbit with 599 m/s of delta-V left -- but how much of the difference was a result of changes in the program, and how much was a result of the better flight profile, I can\u0027t say). Wow. They really could fly over to Vall and back, or even home to Kerbin, maybe -- if they didn\u0027t mind be very cramped for months on end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DR1qVfA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DR1qVfA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a plane-shift maneuver (not shown) of 24 m/s, and one orbit around Laythe, the Ladyhawk was in position to make the two maneuvers shown below to match orbits with the Vall ship, currently sitting in a low orbit where Emilyn and Hellou left it hastily when fleeing to Laythe\u0027s surface ahead of the radiation storm. Since it was going to take about 366 m/s of delta-V to circularize into low orbit, that\u0027s roughly the amount of delta-V that had been wasted during the overly-long rocket burn getting to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/camrYoF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022camrYoF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m confused by the lighting in the picture below.

I had MechJeb\u0027s surface and orbit data displays showing during the ascent, and I just plotted the data I captured in screen shots made along the way. I assume there must be a KSP Flight Data Recorder mod...maybe I\u0027ll look into that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ascent took 16 minutes from takeoff to rocket engine cutoff. The dark blue line shows the altitude, and we see that I could have been a lot smoother with my ascent. The red line shows the speed, and I keept that increasing almost the whole time, so that was good. The gray line is the throttle setting, scaled so that 100% is at 20,000 on the left axis (just to keep that line down out of the way). Similarly, the green line (I think it\u0027s green) shows the intake air reading (which I did not have displayed at first, so it starts when the intake air was at 0.06 and falling) -- it is scaled such that 0.05 is at 10,000 on the left axis, again to keep it out of the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most interesting line is the light blue line showing the predicted apoapsis. I was surprised to see that way it starts shooting upward at around 760 seconds. That is NOT the point where I kicked in the rocket engines (that happens after 900 seconds, and the even steeper increase in the apoapsis line is not even seen here, since it is way off the top of this chart by then. I guess that point (at 760 seconds) where the apoapsis line starts going up like crazy is the magical moment for a spaceplane...and it\u0027s a place I\u0027ve never reached before, even though I\u0027ve gotten SSTO spaceplanes to work in the past (just never this efficiently). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure WHY the apoapsis line starts rising so quickly at that point...the speed is not increasing all that fast, and I was actually losing altitude at that time. Also, the orange line shows that the predicted periapsis became positive at that same time (and actually drops back down a little when the rockets are kicked in). I suppose that up until that point, the energy was going into raising the periapsis to a positive value, and then the energy started going into raising the apoapsis once the periapsis increase stalled out.
