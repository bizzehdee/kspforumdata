The way we do it now on a plane is shifting fuel around, but now it seems using a fuel balancing mod like TAC fuel balance (which I have nothing against but shouldn\u0027t be required) is going to be our only choice with FAR.

I wouldn\u0027t mind seeing something like B9 has for tanks, where you can select your tank options dynamically (LF, LFO, Monoprop, etc). That would help reduce parts, but I\u0027m not sure if that actually removes textures from the game since a texture for each tank type is still required (I think). Wings are a sensitive topic for me, I hate procedural wings. While they may be a lot of parts, I personally wouldn\u0027t want it any other way. A TweakScale type implementation would also reduce parts, but If it were my choice, I would want that limited to items on the Structural tab and MAYBE the cylinder fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kofeyh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kofeyh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, saddened that we have migrated back to \u0022we\u0027re doing some stuff\u0022 type cryptic updates again.
