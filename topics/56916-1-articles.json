I eventually started repeating experiments, and kept getting the \u0022report already stored\u0022 errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice if there was a better interface for reviewing the reports stored in a module. Right now you have to click \u0022Keep Data\u0022 for each report in sequence, and with 30\u002B reports it takes forever! A nice spreadsheet-style GUI would be nice, with sortable columns would be even better! You should be able to click-and-select one or multiple reports, and dump them all together. A warning before dumping reports would also be nice!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a suggestion to make SCIENCE! a bit better!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Minarkhaios","CreatedById":58867,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T20:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m no one special but a approve this message.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027dramatic election music\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrikeStriker","CreatedById":140129,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T03:00:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETotally agree!!! hehehehe. I edited for my personal use the Sample Radial Bin mod from Silverarm74 (GREAT JOB MATE!) into a minilab hehehehe. Its a simple Goo container, but for store samples. The problem is that... after 2 laps around kerbin, i departed to the Mun!! with my probe plenty of experiments! Thermometer, Gravity sensor, ScanSAT scanners (x3), Solar particles, magnetometer.... all experiments i can carry hehehehe (around 10 diferents!), imagine... when each experiment returns data from 1 biome. Now, multiply that amount for the number of biomes you will fly over... I HAS 120 experiments only in Kerbin!! and today i will reach the Mun, so I expect another 120 or so on...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be GREAT the ThirdHorseman idea!!! At least... just using SHIFT\u002BCLICK or control\u002Bclick... or something\u002Bclick!!!.. in Keep data, will keep all and close the annoying window hahahaha. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei forgot to add the link to the great job of Silverarm74!!! \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220361-sample-return-bin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220361-sample-return-bin\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T04:28:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi StrikeStriker,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree, would be nice (especially with the new biomes) if the science was a little easier to manage in-flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease also note that this thread is two years old.
