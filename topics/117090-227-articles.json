Densified fuel = MORE FUEL not a new ratio.  That being said, the discussions I have had with [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) re tank capacities tell me there isn\u0027t much left in RW volume you can add.  Lowering the temperature of RP-1 would only give you a tiny fraction more.  Further, lowering your LOX temperature would see an even smaller incremental increase in Fuel capacity.   The important thing here to note is...   Using Densified fuel does not change your burn ratio.  it however CAN change the ratio of fuel to Oxidizer in the tanks themselves.\n\n  A Key thing to ask is WHY it was important for SpaceX to densify their fuel.   AKA did someone screw up their LOX to RP-1 fuel ratios? (and the answer is **YES they did!**)![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\n  Knowing a \\*\\*\\*TINY\\*\\*\\* bit about coding, I can see a LOT of work for a very limited use feature.   Since SSTU tanks already conform to the \u0022standardized\u0022 fuel ratios, there is no need to densify the fuel. Had SpaceX done a better job managing/estimating their LOX boil off they probably wouldn\u0027t be trying to cram more fuel in.   But that is just my opinion.\n\nPS before anyone jumps on the \u0022you hate SpaceX bandwagon\u0022 please note I think SpaceX is a large perccentage of the future for the US in space... maybe even BIGGER than NASA itself.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-08T20:10:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2017 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Pappystein**\n  \nminor grammer fixs"},{"CreatedByName":"cadillac","CreatedById":123978,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-11T12:42:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 8/1/2017 at 3:54 AM, JeeF said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Have anyone witnessed a bug where when trying to attach a SSTU fuel tank to any other part, the fuel tank doesn\u0027t attach, jitters like crazy and causes a game crash?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Never seen anything like this before, seems to be only affecting fuel tanks.

You are, of course, free to do so on your own for your own games, all of the functions needed for it exist already in the plugins/modules.  (Check the existing configs for examples, or possibly poke [@JoseEduardo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/127759-joseeduardo/) as he has played around with the StationCore and solar panel stuff quite a bit and probably knows more about how to set some of it up than I do at this point; you might even be able to talk him into adding more options to the PWR module as part of his station-expansion packs)\n\nAlso -- that ISS panel simply won\u0027t work on the DOS-PWR module; the PWR module only has a single solar panel mount point on the top, and the ISS panel will not fit appropriately in that position (it would look very strange / asymmetrical, hanging far off of one side when folded up).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 43 minutes ago, Pappystein said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Would it be possible to have it and other Solar panels as unlocks for DOS-PWR?\n\u003E \n\nYes and no.   \n\nYes it is possible to add more solar panel options to the StationCore parts -- simply define the solar panel model defs, and add them to the part config.  (See info above...)  \n\nThe problem in this case is lack of appropriate models for alternate options; that part has very special constraints for what solar panels would be viable options (only a single mounting point on the top of the module).  The only other models that I currently have that would \u0027fit\u0027 are the MAX multi-axis panels, and they are all far smaller/lower power output than the existing DOS-T panel being used.  Technically it could include dual side-mounted solar options as well, but that is not the intention of the part; see below.\n\nThere is also the point of that part (the DOS-PWR module) being modeled after a very specific proposed Russian DOS segment module for the ISS, the NEM module ( [http://www.russianspaceweb.com/nem.html](http://www.russianspaceweb.com/nem.html) ); that is the sole reason that the DOS-PWR part/model/module exists, for the mounting of that solar panel.  I have never had any intention of adding other panel options for it, and originally had it so that the solar panel couldn\u0027t even be enabled/disabled.\n\nIf you are looking for secondary/supplemental/alternate panels to go on the side of the PWR module, well, that is what the stand-alone solar panel parts are included for.   You are free to use the stand-alone solar panel parts and attach them to the module using standard KSP surface attach and lego mechanics for whatever use or look that you desire (e.g. I cannot possibly accommodate everyone\u0027s customization desires in a single part/module/set of configs, thankfully KSP still allows options for those times using standard construction methods).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On Sunday, January 08, 2017 at 8:51 AM, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Given the scaling ability in SSTU, I\u0027d expect Tweakscale to be mutually exclusive as it\u0027s trying to do something similar to the parts.\n\u003E \n\nIndeed, TS should not be needed (or used) with SSTU parts.  Having it installed -shouldn\u0027t- create any problems, but it shouldn\u0027t be needed specifically for SSTU either (and adding it to SSTU parts that include scaling is just asking for problems). \n\nIf simply having TS installed -does- cause problems... that would point towards some incorrect patches in one of the mods being used (or some other low-level plugin-code incompatibility/conflict).  If anyone can confirm that TS is causing problems with SSTU parts by simply being installed, please let me know and I\u0027ll do some further testing to see if I can track down what/where the problem is.\n\nDevelopment on SSTU has been a bit slow as of late -- I\u0027ve been quite busy working on finishing up the KSPWheels system and working towards re-introducing the Kerbal Foundries mod (yay tracks!).  Probably have a couple of weeks worth of work left to do on it, or rather will likely be busy working on it for a couple of more weeks.  Things are looking pretty good though... wheels are quite usable, and the UI/UX end of it has vastly improved over the last week.  Am aiming/hoping to push out the initial KF release sometime over the weekend, but still quite a bit left to do after that initial release (more UI/UX work, reintroducing some features from the old KF plugins).\n\nAll of this work with wheels will pave the way for (and be used in) the upcoming BaseCore, ProbeCore, RoverCore, and reworked LanderCore series of parts.  I know its not that exciting at the moment... but it will be a bit down the road ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nWill also try and take a bit of time this weekend to push an updated SSTU release -- mostly it will consist of updating CRP to the latest, but will also contain a few other minor fixes and balance updates that I\u0027ve done in the past couple weeks.  Will try and sneak in some time to look at/fix up the PartUpgrade handling for the EngineCluster module as well.  No guarantees though as it is entirely dependent on me having extra time after finishing up the wheels stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-12T21:21:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 15 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Because it is intended to be surface mounted onto trusses ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022).
