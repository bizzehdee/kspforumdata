But I like simulation, building, planning missions aspect of the game more than the physical control part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know of a mod for controlling the kerbs when they go EVA? Pick a target while in space would be great.. I have lost a few in orbit, and the one I did manage to rescue took like an hour of fiddling to get him back into the capsule..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mod like mechjeb for when your eva would just make the game that more enjoyable for me. When on a planet its not so bad, but in space just the slightest over correction and your floating off.. Even if could just use as way to get back to ship would be great! But if could use while on ground as well would be even better, pick rover as target for example, or give instructions like 100 m west, 50 m east or actual coords to go to would just be fantastic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf no possible currently, some links to tutorials on best way to control while in EVA would be great - is setting camera to chase seems to put you behind and below the kerbal the best view while on space eva?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
