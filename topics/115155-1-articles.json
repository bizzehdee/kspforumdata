Let\u0027s see... Kerbals have acquired learning disabilities so now you have to lug 3 of them around instead of just 1. The tech tree is wider and longer, there\u0027s more stock stuff on it and everything for a given set of parts is divided up between more nodes even less logically than before, so you need lots more science overall than before. And thanks for aero/heat being things now, you can\u0027t just ignore airplane stuff anymore because you at least need the heatshields and fairings in there. Oh, and science in general has been pretty much deleted from the whole contract thing so now you have to do a bunch of grindy stuff to make money to go fly largely unpaid missions to get science. (Did I mention I am not at all a fan of either Kerbal classes or the 1.x career system?)\u003Cp\u003EOn top of this, I\u0027ve chosen to play this game with a few other constraints, such as the CustomBarnKit, which significantly increases the cost of upgrading KSC buldings, but OTOH allows you to set a low, fixed rate for \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Epressganging\u003C/span\u003E, er I mean \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ehiring\u003C/span\u003E-----er, I mean accepting eager volunteers into the space program.

Basically, it lets me continue to believe that Kerbals are fungi and can go into suspended animation when they run out of supplies, and they only requires \u0022supplies\u0022 which can be anything.

From the get-go, without having sent Kerbals there, although there was a SCANsat there by this time. Minmus\u0027 low gravity makes it amenable to hopping biomes relatively easily so I decided to make a major expedition out of it and see how much science I could get. The Mobile Processing Lab can also generate science these days so I decided to give that a try as part of this.

Otherwise it was mostly 1 big fuel tank so that, upon landing, it would have about 2800m/s for jumping around. The Boffins hoped this would let it hit 4-5 biomes, the OTC at this point in time not even being able to locate Ore, let alone process it. This mission would have been much more effective if this lander could have been refueled But hitting 4-5 biomes in 1 go was still better than grinding each individually, and as the pricetag for the whole expedition was nearly $400K, it would have broken the bank to send out a wad of fuel tanks and a Claw-equipped rover to refuel the lander. But that can be arranged later if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the few neat things about 1.0.4\u0027s science stuff is that individual scientists can reset 1-shot experiments (Goo and Materials mostly, plus a few DMagic things). So the plan was for the lander to hit a biome and return to the lab. The resident scientist would then put the data in the MPL for processing and reset the experiments so the lander could go hit another biome.

In fact, all you need is 1 lander with a scientist aboard and enough fuel (either in the lander or in space) to hit the desired number of biomes. Having the scientist aboard removes the requirement for returning to the MPL between biomes, which essentially doubles the number of biomes the lander can hit on 1 tank of fuel. So if I\u0027d just left a (rather smaller and simpler) crew return ship in orbit and sent down only the Biome Hopper and scientist, I probably could have hit every biome with the fuel in the 1 lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T19:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EEPISODE 2: Pillaging Minmus Done Better\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the Boffins were pretty disappointed with MinEx-1 and decided to go back for the remaining 4 biomes only without the MPL.

First, as usual with OTC designs, the single LFO lifter stage got to orbit with a fair amount of fuel left. Rather than just waste this as usual, the Boffins decided to burn it to put the Jool COMMsat Carrier into an elliptical orbit to shorten the burn time (and save fuel in) the transfer stage. Getting this done ahead of time allows doing only the last part of a multiple-pass transfer burn at the time of the node, making the burn more accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/vyWC4a\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/510/19407131479_f397cd22b9_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219407131479_f397cd22b9_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis seemed to work pretty well so has been adopted as standard when circumstances permit. The technique is to get into a circular orbit to start with and create the transfer node several days in advance. Then burn the lifter\u0027s remaining fuel when the ship is passing the node so its Pe will be there when the time to burn the rest comes. Then scrap the original transfer node and create a new one in the same spot for the same time but using only the remaining dV needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, the Jool COMMsat Carrier also adjusted its orbit to meet Tylo for a braking gravity assist rather than try to aerocapture (this game has 100% reentry heat, which is stupid I know but I\u0027m doing it just because). With the tools available (not PreciseNode because it\u0027s still stuck on 1.0.2), al lthat could be done was to get the orbit about tanget to Tylos, but no closest approach markers appeared.

This rocket was powered by 4 of the new Atomic Age dual-mode LANTERN engines, although constrained to work in LF-only mode. Given as this mod comes with a lot of radiator parts, the Boffins were curious to see if they were really needed.

Simulations of operations on Moho, however, have shown that ships (and especially EVA Kerbals) can get hot just sitting there, so radiators will probably be necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a few hous, all these ships left Kerbin\u0027s SOI and set up their mid-course tweaks.

Remembering the problems Bob (and Scientists) in general had with EVAs, the Boffins had this time installed a \u0022training wheel\u0022 ladder system. 2 normal ladders led from the pod and across the 2.5m adaptor. At the end of the lower ladder, the path forked and then joined a circle of rigid ladder segments all the way around the reaction wheel unit just above the Universal Storage science array. By hitting A or D at the appropriat point while climing on and/or arround these ladders, Ansen could easily switch tracks. So he\u0027d climb down to the fork, then go all the way around the rocket, take the other fork back to the main ladder, and thus regain the pod. It worked like a champ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Boffins were by now fairly confident that the 1st Duna Expedition would get its paychecks before the Eve transfer window. However, they decided it wouldn\u0027t hurt to get some more money just in case, so they accepted several more jobs within the Kerbin SOI. Besides, this gave them something to do while waiting for 1DF to arrive. To make the time pass more quickly, they only accepted missions with long travel times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1st such mission was to build a base on Minmus. The Boffins pointed out that the OTC already had one they didn\u0027t need and were quite willing to sell, but the Scientists threw so many spitwads and shot so many rubber bands across the office that the Boffins relented and agreed to build a new one if the customer was willing to pay. Thus was born the Great Flats Base, which was set up in pretty much the same spot Bob had visited on his 2nd trip to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/vUfEio\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/536/19625664472_3743b91ef1_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219625664472_3743b91ef1_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother mission was of much more interested both to the Boffins and the Scientists. This job, which paid about $500K, was to get science from near and on a Class C asteroid. There was no need to divert the asteroid, nor even return the ship. This latter requirement suited the Boffins just fine as it allowed a smaller, cheaper rocket and thus maximized profits. The Scientists whined that they wouldn\u0027t get as much data that way, but were eventually beaten into submission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it happened, a handy Class C asteroid had just been discovered on a path that would impact Kerbin in about 28 days.

Kaching! But between launch and arrival was quite an adventure. Due to the 2-Body Gravity Glitch, the probe kept falling back into Kerbin\u0027s SOI every few seconds, then popping right back out again. This happened 20 or 30 times in rapid succession, then finally the Roid-Sniffer got stuck in Kerbin\u0027s SOI on a highly elliptical open orbit with a 250km Pe. So the mission seemed doomed at this point and the Boffins wrote it off and went on to do the mid-course burns of the various interplanetary ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy then, the Roid-Sniffer had gone on around was about to escape Kerbin again so the Boffins decided to give it a look and see what, if anything, could be done about it. And surprisingly, the Roid-Sniffer seemed to have gotten a gravity assist off Kerbin was still heading to meet the asteroid more or less on schedule at more or less the same distance originally planned before all the SOI shenanigans. A slight burn cleaned up the intercept and the Roid-Sniffer accomplished its mission with 2 days to spare before the asteroid entered Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Roid-Sniffer, being merely designed to sniff roids, was utterly incapable of affecting the asteroid\u0027s trajectory or even orientation in the slightest. It was just along for the ride, \u0022But hey, a science-return is a science-return\u0022 as the Boffins reminded the Scientists. The asteroid would hit in the northern hemisphere about 45^ latitude and just on the pre-dawn side of the terminator, so the big question was whether or not it would land in the water. Based on prior experience, the Boffins predicted that the thing would weathervane so the Roid-Sniffer would use the rock as a heat shield, and then parts of it might survive after the rock rolled over on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/vVgpLP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3786/19637127211_d55a6db658_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219637127211_d55a6db658_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this was not to be thanks to the 100% reentry heat setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/vVgpJ4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3802/19637127051_2fff7513d2_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219637127051_2fff7513d2_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter hitting the atmosphere at about 3200m/s, there was no weathervaning at all. The rock began heating first (#1 above) and totally vaporized at an altitude of 43km (#2 above). The Roid-Sniffer itself was on the verge by that point and began to break up at about 30km (#3 above) with its various parts continuing to burn and explode in tight formation down to about 25km. By then, all that was left of the Roid-Sniffer was its 1.25m service bay, everything inside of which had already exploded (#4 above).

Then it was right back to Duna where the DISCO put itself into a 250km orbit so that Ansen wouldn\u0027t be tempted to raid the pantry of the DUMBASS when it arrived in the near future. This was done without aerobraking to save the heatshield for Kerbin---DISCO has beaucoup fuel. The probe core then computed the return trip to Kerbin, which wouldn\u0027t start for another 140 days, so Ansen watched Duna go by through the windows a couple times and then went into hibernation. He felt fortunate actually to be coming home eventually. After all, he had accomplished his missions already so the OTC had no real interest in him anymore. They could have just left him there to rot. What he didn\u0027t know was that the Scientists wanted him back so they could dissect him to learn what going to Duna had done to him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this was accomplished prior to the 2nd COMMsat doing its burn, and right after that happened, in came the DUMBASS. Putting DUMBASS into Duna orbit was worth another $770K to the OTC. Despite being the slow boat to Duna, the DUMBASS turned out to be quite sleek (especially for a station module) so actually had to make the lowest aerocapture pass of the whole flotilla, with a Pe set at 14km and going down to 13.5km in actual use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/wh2aue\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/556/19871994001_77a83b62b9_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219871994001_77a83b62b9_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, even that low, nothing got at all hot and the DUMBASS captured with an Ap about 2/3 of the way out to Ike. That by itself was enough to cash its check but the Boffins had sent a bigger wad of parts than the contract required because they thought it might be useful in the future. Thus, they had it do 3 burns to raise its Pe to 100km, fix its inclination to 0^, and then circularize without bothering to hit the atmosphere again. At this point, the DUMBASS jettisoned both its transfer stage and its nosecone, both of which then exploded from TAC Self-Destruct charges.

All the ships stopping at Eve arranged to come in fairly polar for the benefit of their probes. The Moho SCANsat, OTOH, aimed to pass Eve on the retrograde side and a bit below the equator to get flung into an orbit approximating Moho\u0027s orbital plane. This maneuver, which would cost about 200m/s, would bring its perhelion down to about Moho\u0027s aphelion. The result was as if the probe had burned straight for Moho to intercept it at its aphelion, but cost just a bit more than going to Eve, a substantial savings on the transfer burn. Of course, it will require some more tweaks and will try to gravity brake off Moho the 1st time by to pull its Ap down from the vicinity of Kerbin\u0027s orbit. But the plan is simply to reduce the dV needed to capture at Moho, and see how long such a flight takes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/vvbs64\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/372/19364563533_3b399c6a33_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219364563533_3b399c6a33_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile these ships were en route to their mid-course tweaks, the Boffins decided to make some beer money doing a couple contracts on Mun, one for a surface survey that required a rover, and one for planting a flag.

Because they\u0027d left about 1 day apart, they also arrived about a day apart so there was no hectic juggling act upon arrival. First to arrive was the Eve SCANsat. Once in Eve\u0027s SOI, the Boffins determined it would take about 1700m/s to capture into a 150km orbit. Given that the probe\u0027s carrier (not even considering the probe itself) had about 2500 left in the tank for just this purpose, the Boffins decided to capture into an elliptical orbit with a 2.5Mm Ap and then aerobrake from there. After all, the ship had a heatshield and fairing so might as well use them. In fact, the whole flotilla was that way so this became the plan for all. So SCANsat Eve burned into its parking orbit to wait for the rest of the flotilla to arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/wu3tig\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/548/20008046981_c398833199_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220008046981_c398833199_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext to appear was SCANsat Moho which was just doing a retrograde flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/wbXGxm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/333/19814735538_6a53dcae6e_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219814735538_6a53dcae6e_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce back out of Eve\u0027s SOI, the \u0022not quite aligned\u0022 post-flyby orbital plane would still require nearly 1400m/s to fix after about 3/4 of a solar orbit.

After doing the rquired science in high and low orbits, it then had to remain in position for over a month to complete the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was now time to play with aerobraking, starting with SCANsat Eve. Deciding to be gentle with this, the 1st attempt put the Pe at 85km, just 5km into the atmosphere. This took about 40 units off the heatshield and got the radial RCS tanks rather warm, but absolutely failed to make any noticeable impression on the ship\u0027s Ap, which remained nearly 2.5Mm. So next time arround, the Boffins tried a Pe of 80km.

Granted, SCANsat Eve was quite sleek with its long fairing, but all the atmosphere was doing was creating heat, but no friction. Strange. So the Boffins abandoned all hope of aerobraking and did everything else with burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis meant the fairing was no longer necessary so the Boffins jettisoned it to reduce weight and thus get a bit more dV. And they learned an important lesson: retract the radiators before staging the fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/wc5U6i\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3669/19816140179_08bf4736ea_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219816140179_08bf4736ea_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the probe had its own radiators and nothing was yet getting hot anyway, so things continued. And pretty soon SCANsat Eve was on station scanning for resources, which work best at a low altitude. The UKS mod has a resource scanner that looks for everything and also functions as a stock NBS. And thus we see why the stock NBS\u0027s GUI has that resource button, tapping which cycles through all those you can see. In this case, the probe could see Ore, Karbonite (even though I don\u0027t have that mod), Karborundum (ditto), MetalOre, Water, Minerals, Uraninite, and Substrate. The latter can be used with the rest of UKS to make everything from life support supplies to rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/wrg8Cm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/325/19976567776_f1610812bf_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219976567776_f1610812bf_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was then time to deploy the Eve COMMsats.

In fact, the probe core and attached RTGs were quite hot and the whole ship, in the thermal display, was glowing orange. This just from the sunshine in low Eve orbit--running the engines didn\u0027t get the ship this hot and it had had time to cool off from that, not to mention having 3 radiators out the whole time. Pointing the heatshield at the sun and opening the service bay doors had no effect on anything.

Something was definitely wrong here. It was also annoying because the Boffins intended to crash the carrier vehicle to learn about reentries on Eve. If it was already hot, it might not last as well. But OTOH, if all ships near Eve get hot, then this might provide good data afterall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the Boffins had the carrier vehicle retroburn for a 30km Pe (starting at 120km) and sat back to await results. The ship entered the air and started heating up. Again, there was no immediate, or even delayed, reduction in speed. So the Boffins started running the engines to help slow down faster. They\u0027d left the radiators out and they finally blew off at 69km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/vwyykQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3794/19380193534_fb11b3311f_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219380193534_fb11b3311f_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the radiators gone, the Boffins shut off the engines and let nature take its course from here on. Everything started getting warm and the heatshield started going away but things were still OK. But strangely, one of the 3 radial engines started getting hotter than the others. So the boffins rolled the ship a bit and it cooled off but another started getting hot. Pretty soon, the Boffins had the ship continually rolling, with the engines alternating getting hot as they passed through a position of about 8 o\u0027clock if you viewed the ship from the front. It was a mystery why this one spot got hot when the corresponding 4 o\u0027clock position didn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, despite the rolling, the engines got hotter and hotter with each pass through the \u0022hot zone\u0022 with each revolution.

I don\u0027t think KAX has electric props but if it does, I might consider switching because Firespitter is a bit questionable at present. Its main dll is required by a lot of other mods (and has some great modules in it that can be applied to stock parts via ModuleManager), so the dll has been updated to 1.0.4 (I think by Roverdude). However, Snjo, the original author, hasn\u0027t had the time to bring all the many parts in the mod up to 1.x standards, although some, like the electric props, apparently have been. So what I do is get Firespitter for the dll and only use a few parts from it: a cockpit, a 2-seat 1.25m crew cabin, a tailwheel, the seaplane pontoons, the electric prop, and an info pop-up part for notes, such as reminding me which action group does what. The latter is especially important for complicated vehicles with lots of action groups but which might go weeks of real time between launching them and using them at their destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Firespitter electrc props have always produced heat but at the same time have a unique (and rather nifty) air-cooling mechanism built in. Each engine consumes not only EC but also a resource called \u0022FScoolant\u0022. FScoolant is created from the atmosphere via an intake integral to the engine, so the rate of FScoolant production works like IntakeAir for jets--a function of atmospheric density, intake area, and speed. Prior to 1.0, the electric props would just flame out like jets if they got too high and too slow. Now, however, the engine will keep running on EC alone, but without FScoolant it will get very hot. Usually it won\u0027t itself explode, just eventually shut down from overheating, but it can cause whatever it\u0027s mounted on to explode before then \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this works quite well on Kerbin and Eve in terms of limiting the engine\u0027s performance. However, this engine REALLY likes conditions on Duna. The gravity is low, the air is thick enough for a moderate amount of wing to fly in it without much thrust but thin enough not to slow the plane down. Because of this, the electric prop can get moving fast enough to keep itself supplied with FScoolant even above 30km (of course, the air is too thick up there these days, which is a factor).

Total: 5370m/s from LKO to LMO, and a travel time of 1 year, 253 days (426x 6-hr year). The transfer stage still had 520m/s left in the tank. The dV Map shows 4120m/s for this trip which I have never been able to figure out. This 5370 trip is by far my best to date. The Boffins were quite proud of this achievement and immediately began getting seriously drunk \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the fuel situation wasn\u0027t the only concern on this mission, the other was the heat from Kerbol just a stone\u0027s throw away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/vNSXow\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/290/19564847014_cd5e078abf_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219564847014_cd5e078abf_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m now using the HotSpot mod which changes the F11 temperature color overlay to make it WAY more useful. With this mod, yellow is about 1/2way to maxTemp instead of just about to explode. Anyway, the 3-minute capture burn got most of the ship warm, besides the intense sunlight. However, after a few minutes, the radiators cooled everything down to a comfortable 700-odd degrees. All the part thermometers went away except for some on the more delicate instruments, but the temperature did stabilize at a survivable level. The Boffins were quite glad they\u0027d put radiators on the ship, and were also glad that the transfer stage was still attached as it had 2 more radiators that the probe alone wouldn\u0027t have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just as the Boffins were congratulating themselves over the success of their gamble with SCANsat Moho, news arrived that the SENTINEL had completed its task.

They missed about 1/3 of them, however, which never seem to have appeared on the map, or were there so briefly that they were gone by the time the Boffins got the warp slowed down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at those they did manage to track, the Boffins saw something interesting. They\u0027d found a couple of short-period comets, one with an Ap between Jool and Eeloo and the other slightly beyond Eeloo. There was also a sundiver going from about Kerbin\u0027s orbit down to way inside Moho. But all the others were in more-or-less circular orbits about the size of Kerbin\u0027s, but inclined. And the really interesting thing was that they all, even the comets, crossed Kerbin\u0027s orbit at about the same place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/wthvA9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/407/19999469760_60f94a29ac_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219999469760_60f94a29ac_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile all this had been going on, the 3 shps bound for the outer planets had all done their mid-course tweaks.

Due to the aforementioned problem with the calendar, Ansen had not taken nearly enough supplies with him, and the last transmission received from him, about 80 days before, had been that his last month\u0027s worth had fallen out the airlock. Ansen had thus gone into food-deprived hibernation and had no ability to control the ship (USI-LS, not fatal). But he was, after all, just a science grad student, not a pilot, so DISCO had been equipped with a probe core to do all the flying anyway. The probe core wasn\u0027t at all hungry, thanks to several sources of power, and it duly sent DISCO on its way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/vNSXff\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/400/19564846534_e3983f1c34_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219564846534_e3983f1c34_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to the completion of the SENTINAL contract, the OTC now had over $11M in the bank.
