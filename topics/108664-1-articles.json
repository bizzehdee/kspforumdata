So even when returning the sample it gives me %80 of its worth. Does this mean i need to take another sample from the same location? Or just take 2 samples at the same time? Or maybe its because my scientist has 3 stars and i need 5 stars to get the %100 from a single sample?\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

You can\u0027t store two of the same sample in one crew container, so you have to transmit the first one."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:09:18Z","Content":"I\u0027m fairly certain that you are getting the full value there. Transmitting the experiment will decrease its value, processing it (in 0.90, haven\u0027t done so in 1.0.2) will increase its value (for transmission, it should still be less than 100%)\n\nRecovering your craft will give your the full 100%.

If you want to do this all in one go, you\u0027ll need two (or three, if you go for three samples) crew capsules to store them in. This is because one capsule can only store one copy of an experiment from a given location.\nNote that there doesn\u0027t need to be any crew in the spare capsules - it\u0027s just extra storage."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:41:43Z","Content":"Updated the imgur album with 2 more images that shows this. Yeah it seems i need to do 2 or 3 runs to same places or carry 3 capsules... Well i know %80 is more then enough to complete tech tree but i just don\u0027t feel right getting objectives %80 done..."}]}
