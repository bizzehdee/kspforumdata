First, is there an easy way to remove the size vs. tech limitations for tanks and structural parts? If not, I would like to request that those limitations be moved off to a separate file a la Stretchy SRB so that this could be done easily. The my reasoning for this is firstly based off of the fact that engine size progression in RO \u002B RPL quickly outpaces the tank sizes as described in the tech levels, leaving you with large engines that you can\u0027t use because you don\u0027t have acceptably large tanks to attach them to and secondly because fuel tank size never really seemed like a limitation for the early rockets, after all, we were building large pressure vessels long before we were building them to launch into space.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough tech limits on the size of tanks isn\u0027t very realistic, I feel that there should be some kind of tech limitation just to keep the \u0027game\u0027 aspect going. After all... if you launch a career mode you expect some kind of progression not just to \u0027win\u0027 without a single click.

Having to spam procedural tanks one on top of the other, in my opinion, defeats the actual purpose of Procedural Parts.
