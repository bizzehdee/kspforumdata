Gone through all of the comments on Steam and Twitter. I\u0027ve got very little faith this is going to be anything close to the release maps for KSP1 and even stands a good chance to end the company if continuously mismanaged. Not something I want at all, I love the franchise and have given it hundreds upon hundreds of hours. But I can\u0027t deny its one of the worst releases I\u0027ve ever seen and I remember all the way back to the NES releasing... I booked the whole week off for the origional release that got pushed back, glad I didn\u0027t again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving played myself have to say its a sorry state and just led to hours of wasted time (more than half of the bugs reported aren\u0027t being addressed).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly as I\u0027ve read in multiple places now the cost was worldwide way higher than expected, and definitely a disapointment to all. Myself included. If I couldn\u0027t pay in three, I would not have been able to justify and honestly don\u0027t feel I can.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd to repeat others again, If this patch isn\u0027t absolutely stellar! Well, its gonna damage the reputation more. I personally can keep coming back to check but the less players that do, the less worthwhile it all becomes and many a projects have ended before they should have thanks to player engagement tanking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is undeniable we were promised better by now, its why it got delayed multiple times and the posts have even been referenced here. The QA dept definitely has some explainin to do to investors at the least. Even if the game survives, its never going to make what it would have and that also means were likely to see microtransactions which will drive away even more players from the origional without grabbing a close to reasonable amount of new.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease. Do this right. If you don\u0027t, its not us that loses its the teams behind, their friends and families. Think about them before cash grabbing in future. And hey, shareholder profits too! They definitely got diminished here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T09:04:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224258761\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214319\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678783666\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227790\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wayne Bruce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, Wayne Bruce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmore than half of the bugs reported aren\u0027t being addressed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224251030\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214319\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677872414\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205123\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nate Simpson\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/3/2023 at 8:40 PM, Nate Simpson said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur first Early Access update, which is planned to take place in the next couple of weeks, will contain the following fixes (\u003Cstrong\u003Eas well as many other improvements that we\u2019ll break down in more detail in our patch notes when the update goes out\u003C/strong\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s that\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224258761\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214319\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678783666\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227790\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wayne Bruce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 minutes ago, Wayne Bruce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if the game survives, its never going to make what it would have and that also means were likely to see microtransactions which will drive away even more players from the origional without grabbing a close to reasonable amount of new.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNMS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LoSBoL","CreatedById":174038,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T09:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224258761\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214319\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678783666\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227790\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wayne Bruce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n29 minutes ago, Wayne Bruce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got very little faith this is going to be anything close to the release maps for KSP1 and even stands a good chance to end the company if continuously mismanaged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s a bit of a glass half full or half empty assessment in how one looks at it, it\u0027s also very easy to find confirmation bias when digging through all reactions which may strengthen feelings.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing is definitely for sure, KSP2 needs to prove itself of being a worthy successor of the original.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess I\u0027m more of the half full glass type of guy and remain hopefull, there are a few thing I think about when being hopefull.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off how KSP developed after T2 bought the IP from SQUAD and directed which way SQUAD needed to develop KSP further since then. There was quite a rouse when T2 bought KSP and much fears were posted, but in the end looking at KSP when it was SQUAD\u0027s is a totally different beast than what it is now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor four years KSP was further developed by SQUAD under T2\u0027s umbrella, and some huge vision changes were made. T2 did with KSP what it wanted to do with KSP2, and that was bringing it to the masses. People easily forget that KSP did not give you any tools, there was no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E calculations in either \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or Flight, so it was eyeballing, doing the math of getting mods. There was no transfer window planner, no alarm clock, no much needed in flight readouts, no maneuver tool, no burn time indicator, no in flight action group management, no EVA construction, no Steam workshop, no cloud save.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose were not just QOL features, those are features to change the game from a nerdy one, to one that is accessible for the masses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow why did T2 do that? Not for the love of the game, but like any company, for the money, by making it sellable to the masses, which it did.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat we didn\u0027t get are micro transactions, just like has been declared over and over that it wouldn\u0027t get them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in the end, it\u0027s all about the money. The same goes for KSP2 which n\u003Cspan\u003Eeeds to sell, that\u0027s why I think that T2 comitted for the long haul, they know that when they get it right, they will keep selling KSP2 for the next couple of decades like KSP did. T2 has every reason to hang in there and let it prove itself, only that way there will be a guaranteed continuous revenue from it, which T2 wants more than anything.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy biggest concern in this is not the bugs, nor the features, my concern in T2 getting KSP2 where it needs to go, is its performance. If they don\u0027t get the performance to a level that at least an budget level game computer, it will affect the potential market they need to be selling KSP2 to.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T11:35:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224258773\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214319\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678787248\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174038\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LoSBoL\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, LoSBoL said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nconcern in this is not the bugs, nor the features, my concern in T2 getting KSP2 where it needs to go, is its performance.
