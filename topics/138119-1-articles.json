For example, an easy contract would have 3 points within 500m of each other, while a hard contract would have six points in a 15km radius.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing in that .cfg file determines waypoint placement, which is why asked if it were possible to place them using Contract Configurator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for replying.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
