I\u0027m also a fan of everything that touches space stuff. I\u0027m fascinated everytime I see the moon or the stars. KSP is pretty much the perfect game for me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m relatively new to KSP. I\u0027ve tried it out in the very beginning back when there was no map, no maneuver nodes, no nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game was really good but lacked content. I stopped playing it and last weekend I decided to give it another go after reading about all the new stuff that\u0027s been added. I figured on saturday morning that I\u0027d play it for an hour or so. I ended up doing nothing but playing KSP the entire weekend XD. This game is just way too good!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, I had an idea. I am streaming on twitch once in a blue moon. I\u0027m still trying to find a good game to stream. big maintream games gets a lot of viewers, but when you are a new streamer and dont have a good viewer base, your stream is at the very bottom, as they are ordered by viewer count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe idea I had is to start a new \u0022Adventures of a Kerbonaut\u0022 topic on these forums and start a new campain which I\u0027ll exclusively play on stream, and keep a record of what we did in the topic here, kindof like a Diary. I don\u0027t know if thats the kind of thing people would enjoy watching, but it would be fun for me to do, even if nobody comes to see the streams. \u003Cstrong\u003EPLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT ALL TIMES I PUT IN THAT TOPIC WILL BE AT MY LOCAL TIME ZONE: GMT-5.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the strum, we shall learn togheter and make progress toward reaching the far ends of the galaxy! More experienced players can come and share tips and advices, while beginners can certainly learn a thing or two about the game. Some could just enjoy the entertainment of seeing me fail (or maybe have some success, who knows!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should start this adventure tonight around 5 or 6 pm (GMT -5).
