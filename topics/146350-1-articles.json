Plus the only time I actually had the game running long enough to get a satellite in orbit my save file got corrupted meaning I wasted all my time put into any of my projects,my question is when are we gonna get a update that will stop this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-23T16:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently Flying Tiger are working on a fix. Don\u0027t hold your breath though mate even the PC version is the most unstable game I have ever played. There will ALWAYS be regular crashes and game freezes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starkiller\u0026#039;s Base Engineer","CreatedById":166682,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T08:11:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats a frequent issue here, hope they launch a fix soon\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"COOLXXII","CreatedById":168411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-08T00:21:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel your pain man, I\u0027ve lost 3 huge saved games to crashes. \u00A0For the time being, I just enjoy experimenting with builds, and don\u0027t get too attached to anything I\u00A0put in orbit because I know \u00A0it WILL crash, and i\u00A0WILL lose everything. Id advise keeping\u00A0an eye on the Devnote Tuesday posts in the daily Kerbal\u00A0forum. Also, When I build something I like, I snap a pic with my phone with hopes of rebuilding it after the patch comes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boba Kerman Fett","CreatedById":168617,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-12T03:06:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found you can upload your save file to the PS online storage. If the data file corrupts you can upload your save file. You may lose a little time but it wont be days worth lile i did\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zackattack0517","CreatedById":167694,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-17T12:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut the PS4 in rest mode and turn it back on and it will unfreeze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
