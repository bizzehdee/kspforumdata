To alleviate some of this I\u0027ll go over how to setup a kethane refinery that can generate fuel, LOX, and monopropellant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, kethane itself is routed the same way as RCS fuel. That is, kethane can move between any two points on a vessel regardless of what is between them. Stack separators, structural hard points or docking ports don\u0027t affect the ability to automatically transfer kethane. A drill \u003Cstrong\u003Eanywhere\u003C/strong\u003E on a vessel can fill a kethane tank \u003Cstrong\u003Eanywhere\u003C/strong\u003E else on the vessel. And a kethane tank \u003Cstrong\u003Eanywhere\u003C/strong\u003E on a vessel can be used by a converter \u003Cstrong\u003Eanywhere\u003C/strong\u003E else on the vessel. Generating monopropellant follows the same rule, any kethane convertor will fill every monopropellant tank on the vessel, no fuel lines or manual transfers are necessary. Monopropellant will also flow through KAS pipes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuel Lines:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel and LOX generation are more complicated though. My understanding, and someone correct me if I\u0027m wrong, is that kethane convertors work by consuming a negative amount of fuel/LOX. That is, a kethane convertor works much like an engine does, but instead of removing a positive amount of fuel/LOX from the fuel tanks, it \u0022removes\u0022 a negative amount from the fuel tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this, fuel flow has to be setup in the same way that you would route fuel to an engine. To ensure that a convertor can make fuel/LOX, fuel lines must run \u003Cstrong\u003Efrom\u003C/strong\u003E a fuel tank, \u003Cstrong\u003Eto\u003C/strong\u003E the kethane convertor, not the other way around. As long as at least one fuel tank is connected to a kethane convertor in this way you should be able to generate fuel/LOX, you may have to manually transfer it from this point though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Kethanerouting.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022Kethanerouting.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIdeal setup:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this is not the only way to generate fuel/LOX, any setup where fuel would normally flow from a tank to an engine without fuel lines or manual transfer should also work with a kethane convertor. Fuel can flow through docking ports (as long as you don\u0027t disable fuel crossflow), trusses, kethane tanks, or any other part that allows fuel crossflow. The safest way to setup a refinery though, is just to directly connect a fuel tank to the kethane convertor. You may have to manually transfer fuel to some other tanks, but it will always work with this setup. Fuel/LOX won\u0027t flow through KAS pipes regardless of how or where they are connected. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/kethaneideal2.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022kethaneideal2.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExamples:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow you can see a somewhat complex setup. The kethane convertor at the top can fill up all of the highlighted fuel tanks despite all of the docking ports, structural parts, and radial attachment points between them. Even if there were an issue or bug that prevented me from filling up the other tanks, I still have the small tank attached directly to the converter. I could manually transfer from there to anywhere else on the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/kethanerefueler.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022kethanerefueler.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it is possible that some bugs could crop up on a more complicated designs. Lots of docking ports and other parts between a tank and convertor could cause issues and prevent you from generating fuel/LOX. This is most likely a problem on the core KSP end though, and not an issue with the kethane mod itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if someone wants to add something about kethane detectors that would be helpful, too. I haven\u0027t played around with those much, I usually just identify a few sites and land at the first suitable one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUsing engines to test fuel flow:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to test your design is by assembling everything in the VAB, launching, filling up the kethane tanks on the launch pad, and checking if it works. You can use a kethane debugger part, or just edit your persistence file to fill up the tanks. You can see in the picture that the kethane converter in the top right can fill up the tanks shown with the green arrows through all of the docking ports and structural parts between them. It cannot, however, fill up the tank shown with the red arrow. The decoupler shown in yellow prevents automatic filling of this tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/kethaneflow.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022kethaneflow.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to mess around with editing your savefile, or resetting your kethane deposit data you can also use engines to check fuel flow. If you have a fuel tank on one part of vessel that you want to check, just add an engine to it (or to a part that should be connected to it). Disable all but the fuel tank attached to the kethane converter by right-clicking each tank and clicking the little green arrows on the right side, circled in red below. Then ignite the engines. If the engines can pull fuel from a tank attached to the kethane converter, then, in most cases, the converter should be able to fill up and fuel tanks attached to the engines. Below you can see the same fuel flow story. The green arrows indicate fuel flowing from the tank in the upper right to the two tanks on the left, but not the one shown by the red arrow, which is separated by the decoupler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/Fuelflow.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022Fuelflow.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should also be noted that some complex docking setups can screw with fuel flow. Using bi- or tri-couplers to make 2 or 3 point docking attachments can cause issues and might prevent fuel flow through those ports. Radially mounted docking ports can also cause issues in some circumstances. That\u0027s why it can be a good idea to test out your crafts on the launch pad before launching and assembling everything. And generally, a few struts and launch clamps can hold up even very large and complex structures without collapsing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERadial Docking Port Issues:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is an example of how radial docking clamps complicate things. On the left you can see that fuel does not flow from the tanks on top to any of the engines on the bottom, only the activated tank (far left) can supply its engine. However, kethane, for some reason does not match up exactly to fuel flow. Converted fuel can flow from the converter to the central tank on the bottom, but not the two tanks on the side. I don\u0027t know what causes this disparity, but it is something to keep in mind. And even more confusing, the side mounted engines can run on fuel from the central tank, but not the other way around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/kethaneradialissuesnarrow.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022kethaneradialissuesnarrow.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously there are issues related to how fuel flow works through complicated connections. In most cases though, these are probably due to issues on the KSP side of things, not the kethane mod. If you run into these issues you might consider using 6-way nodes instead of radial attachments. The nodes don\u0027t work the same way as radial connections and shouldn\u0027t have this kind of problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all assuming, of course, that you want to be able to automatically fill up all of your fuel tanks. In all of these cases you can manually transfer fuel from the tank attached directly to the converter to any other tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread has some examples of what does and does not (and what might not) work as far as fuel flow goes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/26660-Interplanetary-ship-design-problems?p=329049\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post329049\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/26660-Interplanetary-ship-design-problems?p=329049\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post329049\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-20T06:07:32Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2013 06:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T18:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for posting this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to clarify, it is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E always necessary to use fuel lines; most designs will work fine without them.

I assumed KAS works like a fuel line so I connected from the tanker to the drill/converter, and not the other way around in order to get the negative fuel usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Docked ships can exchange resources so I used the docked attachment mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might try other ways of doing it some other time. For now this works just fine. One thing I did notice however was that the drill/converter fills it\u0027s own tanks first and only then fills the tanker.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-19T20:34:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2013 08:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt.
