I\u0027m sure this has been done before, but if not, I\u0027d like to start it! Here\u0027s the challenge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Build 1 plane design (stock parts only, and no mods) for 2 different time trial flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Flight 1 = Take off, reach 10k meters, land at KSP runway (full stop). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Flight 2 = Take off, land at grass strip (full stop), then take off from grass strip, land at KSP runway (full stop)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be eligible, screenshots or video must be taken. Pictures for 10k need to show the log after landing. Pictures for grass strip and back need to show full stop at grass strip, and log after landing at KSP. And pictures of the aircraft during flight are always fun (but not required) so we can marvel at your superior engineering skills, or in the case of my aircraft, have a good laugh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo changes or modifications can be made to the aircraft between flights. It must be the EXACT same aircraft (on take off) for each flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor \u0022Plane\u0022 definition, Aircraft must be piloted by a Kerbal (what\u0027s the fun if someone can\u0027t tell about the experiences?). Decoupling/staging is allowed if you so choose to go that route, and all parts in the stock inventory are also allowed. Aircraft can be powered by any power source (booster, rocket, jet, ion, electric, faith/hope/prayer). There is no weight or part number limitation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor \u0022Take off\u0022 definition, it can be done at either the runway or the lauch pad, vertical or horizontal. If departing from the launch pad (or runway for that matter), use of TT18-A Launch Stability Enhancer is allowed unless the support structure is standing at a height taller than the launch vehicle stands vertical (i.e. If vehicle is 30m tall, TT18-A LSA is not to be taller than 30m)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor \u0022Full stop\u0022 definition, I understand that the speed can jump around, so it will be defined in this challenge as anything 0.4m/s or less. The aircraft can be in any status at the end of the flight (i.e. airworthy or complete wreck), as long as the Kerbal lives to tell the tale. (Remember though, for Flight 2, you have to do 2 take offs and 2 landings.) Aircraft, or capsule containing Kerbal, must come to \u0022full stop\u0022 on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor \u0022Runway\u0022 definition, it is the raised, flat surface, above the normal landscape that will be defined as the runway. The slopes on the sides do not count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScores will be on a points per second basis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For Flight 1 (10k), 4:00 is 0 points, and every second before 4:00 is 15 points. Example: 2:40 = 1200 points (80x15)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For Flight 2 (grass), 10:00 is 0 points, and every second before 10:00 is 8 points. Example : 6:30 = 1680 points (210x8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecord Holder\u0027s:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Flight 1 / Flight 2 / Points / Pilot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1) 1:40 / 3:39 / 5148 / likulapa\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2) 1:43 / 4:24 / 4743 / Apache 600\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3) -:-- / -:-- / ---- /\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 4) -:-- / -:-- / ---- /\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 5) -:-- / -:-- / ---- /\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Flight with the \u0022Mini-Valkyrie\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the roll out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dtcCLcn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dtcCLcn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight 1, 10k, log\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1nnTdQr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221nnTdQr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeaded into the grass strip for Flight 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QZX3Mwr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QZX3Mwr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrass strip full stop, squeaked it in at the end of the runway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jxdRIXA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jxdRIXA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull stop at KSP in 4:24\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Oc3bXqY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Oc3bXqY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Apache600\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T14:15:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Apache600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T18:59:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was going to head off to build for this challenge, but realized I\u0027d like clarifications on a few things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you define \u0027plane\u0027 ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre any parts from the stock selection prohibited for this challenge?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you define landing, is there any prohibited way to come to a full stop if the craft is unharmed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the \u0027plane\u0027 have to be in a single part throughout the flights or are you allowed to decouple/separate parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes it have to be manned?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apache600","CreatedById":76562,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T19:43:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the questions Johnno, Post has been updated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphobius","CreatedById":79391,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T20:07:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t wait to try this tomorrow (I\u0027m at work right now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut your rules allow for some very ... unconventional designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest you to change them to allow only runway takeoffs and landings, without any separation and without any damage to the aircraft being allowed ... in case you want something more serious.

Shedding parts may work for the 10k flight, but maybe not the grass strip flight. And a crash, yet survivable landing, is not controlled, and could roll off the runway (just make sure you don\u0027t wreck on the grass strip ... cause good looks aren\u0027t going to get you back home) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally think that \u0022serious\u0022 designs may win out here.
