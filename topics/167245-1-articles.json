They work... kind of BUT tests on Kerbin had the Kraken rear its ugly head: If a kerbal so much as came near the KF wheels, it would rocket left and right up and down like crazy, stretching out like mad spaghetti before exploding in a puff of dust. Weird thing is, the KF tracks work like a dream on Mun where the Kerbals can climb the tracks and all is fine and dandy, Kraken sound asleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI plan on a Minmus mining operation, big scale and the decision has been made to make it module based using winches to hook all the modules together. This to allow for expansions for more drills or power or battery banks, fuel tanks, cooling etc etc etc. The drill unit will be a quad drill with large ore tanks on the same unit. This unit I really would like on tracks since it might need to move around. One design has some mamoth sized tracks and the whole thing has a dry mass of around 40 tons. The fuel tank unit that will hook up to this is also around 40 tons. Refinery, PSU, coolers and battery banks will all be separate modules but again, tests on Kerbin had all the light weight modules go bananas as soon as they hooked up to the heavies, jumping around until they tore themselves apart and exploded. I have no idea but I suspect the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E calculation is not coping well with the winch but at the same time,, I do keep in mind how the KF tracks changed behaviour as described above as soon as they landed on Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, any inputs/ideas on how I should go about it?
