(Pteron, WhimChaser, etc), but none of them works with FAR/NEAR, and I\u0027m loathe to uninstall that mod just to have the cute mini spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for a while I\u0027ve been thinking about how to model a lifting body in KSP (which by default means using FAR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thought is to design a system around a single stock FL-T400 fuel tank. Give it \u0022wings\u0022 with a root thickness at or near 1.25 meters (these are essentially structural fuel tanks with lift (and less fuel than an FL-T100)). A 70 degree sweep (very stubby). Control surfaces, wing-tip winglets, vertical fins, and a custom cockpit. In all, the mod will contain about five or six parts, which are insufficient in themselves to build the entire craft. However, they will, with the right combos of stock components get one (and only one) kerbal safely home from orbit (or conversely, given enough fuel, allow for plenty of orbital maneuvering first). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using the following as inspiration:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/Gallery/Graphics/HL-10/Small/EG-0053-01.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022EG-0053-01.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor simplicity sake, I\u0027ll likely model this without the inverse airfoil, so don\u0027t expect this to be an \u0022HL-10\u0022 mod.

That\u0027s the approach which SpacePlane Plus uses. However, the very concept of a lifting body makes little sense in the stock game. These parts will be designed with the use of FAR / NEAR in mind, and stock physics support, by the very nature of the beast will be secondary.
