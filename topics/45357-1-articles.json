You have to burn prograde (the yellow circle without a cross on the NavBall) when the mun just begins to rise above the horizon in front of you. When you now swap to the map, you will see that the highest point of your orbit rises. He should point to the position the mun will have after 1/4 of its orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow burn until the highest point of your orbit crosses the orbit of Mun. Throttle down. Now right-click on the Mun and click \u0022set as target\u0022. Now you should see two arrows in rhe same color at your highest point of orbit. Now burn slowly prograde.
