In real life, you could be patient and wait for equatorial bulge to cause nodal precession, but in KSP the only ways to affect LAN is either:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- timing your launch into your inclination\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- launching into equatorial and burning normal, or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- waiting for your AN/DN relative to the equator and burn normal to equatorial, and then burning out of equatorial into the desired inclination at the desired LAN\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DreidenKisada","CreatedById":2578,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T05:43:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!

In KSP, they\u0027re the same, thankfully. There\u0027s a lot of headache in figuring how to launch to a different planet whose inclination is different, but it\u0027s only worse when your launch plane is not with the ecliptic. In KSP, you can reasonably, with timing, launch, go east, keep burning, and land on the moon no problem, or with some minor course corrections any other body. This is because your space center is on the equator so you\u0027ll launch into equatorial, and because the ecliptic equals the equator, right into the ecliptic. But Kennedy, Baikonur, Tanegashima, etc? Good luck. There\u0027s a reason why launch windows are so narrow, after all. The alignment has to be perfect just to enter a trajectory you can clean up with mid-flight course correction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-03T05:56:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2013 05:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Akane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DreidenKisada","CreatedById":2578,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T06:00:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcelent, that all makes sense now.
