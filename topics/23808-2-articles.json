So I\u0027m thinking along lines of reducing the clutter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* A smaller font would already do wonders in reducing the size of the window. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I think most of the time fuel and oxygen should be treated the same way, having them in separate groups only doubles the on screen confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You could think about a super on/off switch which serves to activate/deactivate the whole mod whilst keeping all the settings intact. (This could be reflected in the on screen icon)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA completely different approach to setting up the balancer (which might prove to be way too much work): How about a system where every tank gets either a \u0022\u002B\u0022 an \u0022=\u0022 or a \u0022-\u0022. Fuel gets divided first over the \u002B tanks then the remainder gets divided over the = tanks and the remainder of that over the - tanks. You might want to add an \u0022ignore option\u0022 which is the same as your lock right now and means the tank is ignored in the calculations. (Default would be = so when you activate the balancer via that single click default all tanks and all fuel types get balanced) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn combination with this fuel tanks could get a right click menu option to either completely fill or completely empty the tank (Setting to \u002B or -).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s one other situation I don\u0027t have a clear solution for. When sending refuelling missions I often want to keep a tiny bit of fuel left in a tank or ship for the deorbit burn. Right now that means timing a hit on the \u0022lock\u0022 button which of course is inaccurate and leaves different amounts of fuel and oxidizer in my ship. Or I do a complicated act where I use a tiny tank on the station to siphon off a bit of fuel for the deorbit burn. This situation is so specific adding gui features for it would only make things more confusing. I don\u0027t see an easy fix while at the same time keeping your gui user friendly. The timed click on \u0022ignore\u0022 would already work better if fuel and oxidizer were thrown together as one resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks for building the fuel balancer.

That way I could bring up the station and the tanker I wanted to transfer resources between without having to figure out which tanks were on the tug docked next to it. I currently get around this sometimes by using different types of tanks on each ship, but I have certain parts that I tend to use a lot and it leads to confusion when I have 14 of the same RCS tank and I\u0027m trying to find the blue glow on the correct one that I\u0027m trying to transfer fuel into.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to have two way highlighting.
