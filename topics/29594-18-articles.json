I\u0027m in the process of building a rather large interplanetary vessel with a space station that is completely reusable and self-refueling (no hydroponics, recycling systems etc... yet) with Kethane which is new since the last time I tried this in .19 and couldn\u0027t get fuel to crossfeed correctly so gave up after building a massive ship that worked great up until it ran out of fuel since the whole center was like 16 orange tanks.
