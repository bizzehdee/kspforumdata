I have a copy of Windows XP lying in a box somewhere, but it isn\u0027t installed on a computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can expect the usual anti-Microsoft cynicism from me, including remarks about crashes, lack of standard compliance, and the Microsoft monopoly. They are mostly just that, cynicism. I certainly understand that some people don\u0027t like to go against the grain of the world and use a different OS than everyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, you can also expect me to ask for multi-platform support of things. This is less cynicism and more practicality. The fact is that making things multi-platform insures against change in the future. I can easily point you to tools that will tell you what you need to do to make your .Net program run on Mono. Usually, it\u0027s little more than changing a few lines of code.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T20:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
