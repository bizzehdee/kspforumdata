I enjoy it a hell of alot and I\u0027m looking forward to all the coming features. I\u0027ve landed stock craft on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, Minmus, and placed space stations into orbit and switched crews by EVA from a distance of 20m etc, I recently downloaded Mech Jeb, and I\u0027m currently practicing landing spacecraft with in 100m with and with out Mech Jeb. The reason I\u0027m doing this is because I\u0027m planning to attempt a Constellation Program style landing on one of the new planets when 0.17 comes put.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope to be able to make contributions to the community by maybe sharing some craft designs and tutorials of proven spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T02:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Navy4422","CreatedById":27157,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T12:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums and sounds like you got a good hang on the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
