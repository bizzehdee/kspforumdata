But there is no single program or add-on which can show stuff like launch window, whether to use Hohmann or Bi-elliptic transfer ,delta V calculations or orbit calculations. You have to quit the game to make your calculations most of the time. This game\u0027s purpose is to teach science of space exploration, so having a calculator with equations needed with blank variables will help a lot, both for learning the actual science and for saving time. Game has a spectacular tool to visualize the possible outcomes of the equations, so learning the equations like of the Newtonian physics also will be a lot of fun! \n\nPlease someone consider to make a calculator add on which might work like nodes in a simulator mode for actual mission planing. This is the missing part of the game. And since its not mandatory to play the game, it wont make the game boring for trill seekers. \n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/98594803@N06/17018223156/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/98594803@N06/17018223156/)\n\nThis, shouldn\u0027t be hard to implement in game.\n\nThank you for peeking out.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T18:05:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 06:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Phoenix1945**\n  \nPhoto edit"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T22:03:17Z","Content":"Have you seen [MechJeb](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12384) (in-game) and [KSP TOT](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36476) (out of the game)?\n\nYou don\u0027t have to quit KSP; have KSP running on one monitor and run KSP TOT on the other.
