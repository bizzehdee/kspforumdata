Kellas Kerman, KSS, 8 days, ongoing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey to the program\u0027s ongoing success was the development, testing and commissioning of the Kerbal Exploration System (KES) series of three-man crewed orbital spacecraft, a versatile vessel with a maximum rated launch-and-return orbit altitude of 350 km primarily designed to ferry Kerbonauts to and from the Kerbal Space Station. Additionally, ongoing observations of Lt.s Jerski Kerman and Kellas Kerman aboard the KSS confirmed no significant or pernament negative effects on the physical and psychological health of Kerbonauts on long-duration space missions, especially in a low or microgravity environment. As such, KSA was confident that the KES series would serve as the backbone of long-term Kerbal manned spaceflight in years to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, in late Joon KY507, KSA Ground Control attempted to remotely update the Kerbal Munar Rover\u0027s firmware - specifically, new software to manage the recharge cycles of its deteorating batteries. However, an incorrect function reference instead caused the remote command to accidentally erase the rover\u0027s antenna beam pointing code, resulting in a loss of contact by the next rotation of the Mun. This, coupled with scientific and political pressures to top prior achievements was the driving force behind the first KES Munar mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Profile\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVarious mission architectures were considered:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDirect Ascent\u003C/span\u003E: A single vessel, barring lifter stages, would be flown to and landed directly on the Mun, before being flown back to Kerbin.

With the establishment of the Kerbal Space Administration, the agency considered his extensive flight experience a vital asset to the fledging space program, and thus he subsequently gained the distinction of being the first Kerbonaut to go into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ECaptain Bob Kerman - Command and Service Module (CSM) Pilot\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce mentored by Jeb in the later years of the war, Bob clocked an impressive number of flight hours in his KF-47 Ravenspear Interceptor, despite never seeing any action. He was quickly snapped up by the unified Kerbal Federation Air Force after the war to help evaluate various hardware previously used by the various absorbed former Kerbal nation-states, but was quickly relieved of his duties due to excessive snack consumption resulting in aircraft undercarriages collapsing under his weight. Initially recruited by the KSA as a stand-in whilst they searched for Jeb, the agency decided to keep him anyway after the infamous \u0022Photocopier incident\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ELieutenant Bill Kerman - Munar Lander Pilot / Flight Engineer\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe oddly quiet and mysterious of the trio.

While the KES spacecraft and the docked lander were successfully boosted into a stable lunar orbit, the injection stage quickly ran out of fuel before the orbit could be properly circularized. It has been suggested that a dedicated third stage with a LV-N Atomic Rocket Engine be added to the stack for use in the actual Trans-Munar Injection, or the Magnum-K upper stage\u0027s Rockomax LV-909 \u0022Poodle\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine be retrofitted with said atomic engine. In general, highly efficient engines would be a vital part of transfer stages for Trans-Munar or Interplanetary flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Perhaps the greatest deficiency was in the Munar Lander, which was found to lack the neccessary fuel reserves to fully circularize its ascent orbit, even with the added external LFO tanks, neccessitating an emergency rendezvous by the KES spacecraft as well as burning all the Lander\u0027s RCS reserves to extend the duration of the latter\u0027s own suborbital trajectory. An upgraded Munar lander would be required to be able to land from, re-ascend and circularize to an altitude of at least 200 km above the Munar surface, with at least 20~30% fuel reserves for rendevousing with any KES in Munar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Remedying the fuel and thrust deficiencies with the Injection and Lander stages should leave the standard KES spacecraft\u0027s fuel reserves untouched unless in dire emergencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A further possibility would be to convert Munar resources into rocket fuel to top-up the Lander\u0027s own reserves. Days after the return of KES Munar 01, the Extraplanetary Sciences working group\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E have announced the discovery of a liquid substance contained within the subsurface of the Mun, tentatively dubbed \u0022Kethane\u0022, through the reconfiguration of Kerbal Munstar 1\u0027s Gavitational Distortion Meter. Laboratory experiments have confirmed that the compound, which naturally occurs on Kerbin in very rare quantities, can be satisfactorily converted into LFO. Extraplanetary Sciences have, in conjunction with the Exploration Gateway working group\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, proposed the construction of remote surface facilities to extract and convert Kethane into LFO, as well as a small orbital outpost in the Mun\u0027s SOI to receive and store the produced rocket fuel from unmanned tankers for refueling landers. The outpost could additionally act as an orbital staging area for crew leaving or returning from the Munar surface, and as a quarantine facility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003EEquivalent to June in the Human Gregorian Calendar System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003EKerbal unification occurred in mid-KY497, following a decade-long global war between major factions led by the Confederacy, Krussian People\u0027s Republic and the Honko Hegemony that ended in mutual devastation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003ESubdivision(s) of KSA, much like JPL is to NASA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMods Used\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - SQUAD Panopticon Cupola modified to house three Kerbals (in lieu of an as-yet hypothetical proper replacement FusTek mod part )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - MechJeb: Primary guidance computer for all stages of flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - KSPX: LFO fuel tanks for Lander, Z-1K Battery for Magnum-K unmanned payload lifter variant, Escape tower for KES\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - KW Rocketry: Aerodynamic fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - B9 Aerospace: Fuselage adapters, lights, Atlas low profile engine for Lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Lionhead Aerospace: Circular Solar Panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Supernovy\u0027s Advanced Service Module\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - DeadlyReentry: Heat shields only for visual accuracy; the actual heat damage plugin was not used\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
