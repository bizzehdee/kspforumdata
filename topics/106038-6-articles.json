But gosh darn it, there is something wrong when the average person doesn\u0027t know which one they should be playing. And that\u0027s what it feels like since 1.0 hit. It\u0027s not that the changes themselves are bad. It\u0027s that I don\u0027t know how to play the game because the rules might be different next week. This kind of instability is appropriate for Early Access. Unacceptable for a 1.0 version.\n\nThat was both eloquent and very accurate, and I think an excellent summation of why a few tempers got frayed over the last week. I can only agree that the choice to not involve a community of early access players, who had already paid for the game, who were actively asking to be involved in the 1.0 testing, was a very odd decision.\n\nI do appreciate that many fixes and patches appeared pretty quickly after launch - which is not as uncommon as it should be - but my personal worry is that the 1.0.2 changes to aero are now going to stick, despite being an obvious emergency-tweak and not really being for the better in any other scenario than capsule re-entry. We now have to face that we\u0027ve either got a sub-optimal aero model forever, or that it will change again in the future and potentially invalidate existing ships for a second time. This is not the fault of the testers, since they were limited in number and presumably weren\u0027t given scripts to ensure they covered many scenarios; rather it was a lack of engaging the wider community. \n\nBased on this experience, I would like to politely urge Squad to consider using Steam\u0027s beta-opt-in to enable interested folks to continue to help with play testing for future adjustments of this ilk before they become mainstream."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:32:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Based on this experience, I would like to politely urge Squad to consider using Steam\u0027s beta-opt-in to enable interested folks to continue to help with play testing for future adjustments of this ilk before they become mainstream.\n\nI very much agree with this. Such an approach would address many of the concerns the community currently has with the development process (i.e. ignoring the presence of the early access community to help beta test the single most important release in the game\u0027s life cycle) and help vet any future changes while still providing a stable game for new players or players who don\u0027t want to beta test. Obviously the community should be final tier of testing before release, the current system merely just needs to be extended to allow the community to get their hands on the release so the devs can see what breaks in time to fix things properly without having to rush knee-jerk fixes like 1.0.2. The QA and Experimentals teams did an amazing job given the circumstances, but there still isn\u0027t really a substitute for a large-scale community beta test to ensure that the official release is as stable, balanced and bug-free as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:35:31Z","Content":"The discussion circle comes around again, asking for more testers, in hopes more bugs would be caught. There\u0027s close to 100 in the \u0022experimental\u0022 test group, (I\u0027m not one) drawn from users of this forum. That seems a fairly large number to me, a good cross-section of players who care about KSP. \n\nHypothetically, if you *(anyone not now a properly signed-up KSP tester)* had private build access and knew something was broken, did due diligence and filed the bug...

We\u0027re going to keep on with the bugfixing and tweaking as we move into development of version 1.1.\n\nAfter seeing and filing a bug based on your hypothetical access to development builds, and seeing it appear in the \u0027final\u0027 product for reasons outside your control, I think you might even be *more* frustrated, than if you didn\u0027t know it was coming ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nOne of the problems that interrupts the steady process of building, reporting, [deadline hits, have to ship] new build with fix [oops, missed the deadline - patch time] - is the word \u0022deadline.\u0022 Someone has to decide when to stop the internal iteration of builds, and publish.

(\u003C--- Not sure if this would count as a personal attack ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)) As someone who has been playing computer games since 1987, let me be the first to tell you that compared to what was once shoved out the door as a completed product is NOTHING like what has happened here. In fact, let me be the first to say that in the 80s, the latest computer game was either passed onto you by a friend on a 5 1/2 floppy OR you entered each line of code in DOS, saved the file, and hoped to God that some editor or programmer at PCWorld Magazine copied the code PRECISELY as it was given, otherwise, you could spend days debugging nearly 2000 lines of code to find that one command was wrong and it was why you could not slay the cube that represented a dragon or other target... or the program would give you the awful beep and the dreaded \u0022syntax error\u0022 message... At least KSP has been fairly stable since I began playing it under whatever version it was when I first joined. \n\nI have been a big fan of Sid Meyer\u0027s Civilization franchise since I first bought the original version\u0027 Civ V had so many bugs that when I installed it, first ran the game, it immediately gave me a warning box and began to download 43 patches - and that was with the game only being out for two weeks and me spending $45 US on it! In fact, SimCity 4, SimCity 3k, Simcity 2000 were all similar - had many fixes before the game could even be played halfway decently. X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter had similar issues with dll files that made playing with a joystick very unjoyful. To play any of those games, you simply did what you had to do - go to the website of the software company and downloaded the patches. At least with KSP, it does it fairly automatically - and I want to thank the team for that.\n\nThere has never been a \u0022bug free release\u0022 of any software package much less one that is a game. I doubt there ever will.\n\nI would love to volunteer my services to be a \u0022slave tester\u0022 as someone put it. KSP is probably my favorite game since Civ III or Civ IV; even with some of the issues I currently experience, I am glad to have had the opportunity to see this game evolve. Just thinking about how far this game has progressed in 2 years is just truly astounding; I stand in awe of some of the graphics mods, the amount of detail and attention given by Squad and some of the modders, as well as some of the really great people I have met in this forum.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T23:15:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 11:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wooks","CreatedById":101499,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T23:18:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Let me preface my comments by saying ...\n\u003E ...It\u0027s not that the changes themselves are bad.

Look, if you change 1 thing in one line of code, what does that single change do for line 120343 or line 343043? do you even SEE the effect right away? is the effect good or bad? is it subtle enough to be not seen until someone not on the design team or QA team does something that was unexpected and made it pop up? \n\nIt is delusional in all sincerity to think let alone expect or demand a 100% flawless product. No product is perfect. There is always a flaw somewhere. Perhaps its so minor that it doesnt matter, like say a small bubble in the glass that makes up a glass coffee mug, or perhaps its severe, like say something that causes that glass to shatter at the first cup of coffee. Look, coding isnt easy. if it was, we ALL would do it. Squad is a SMALL design house that is infact NOT a design house by original design, it is an advertisement firm iirc. Heck, even a MAJOR design house like say UBISOFT has launched products that have had multimillion dollar design budgets with odd glitches. Doubt me?

Yes, it wasn\u0027t done in time to be released with 1.0, but I hardly call that a reasonable excuse to be up in arms over that. There is still a plethora of videos and guides online to help, made by slave laborers(since that term seems to be popular in this thread, I use it only in jest, of course) out of their own time with no call from Squad to do such.\n\nIf you are honestly expecting a manual, then I have to ask...what game in the past 20 years has actually released a manual with their game (that at least was actually expected to be read)?\n\nThe closest thing KSP has to a manual is its wiki, which has admittedly fallen into neglect. One thing to remember is the wiki is not run by Squad, but by regular people who contribute what they learn. You are more than welcome to do your part to help bring it up to date, as is anyone else out there who have rode KSP through the Early Access ride and can contribute relevant information to help the next guy.\n\nThere is a sad explosion in the number of self-entitled players who feel the need to point out problems, bugs, or things they don\u0027t like (even if those things actually work), but will do nothing to actually help remedy the issues. Criticism is fine, as it tends to mean that problems are being pointed out with details laid out to help find the problem. Complaints are just pointing out problems or disliked features with zero submission of details, ideas, or even civil response. If we actually want to see KSP become a functional and fun game for at least most players, then we need to see a lot fewer base complaints and more actual contribution to finding the bugs.\n\nJust because KSP is out of Early Access, that doesn\u0027t mean we have to stop chipping in to help fix the issues. It sure as heck doesn\u0027t stop players doing so with games that never see Early Access. If you can\u0027t contribute constructively to issues with the game, bugs, glitches, and exploits, then keep it to yourself.

Let folks not under NDA test for a week or so before it comes out. They may find nothing. They may find the showstopper that slipped past the two other teams.\n\nThe question just is: How useful could that be in the end? \n\nLets face it - the general community is pretty lazy when it comes to submitting bugs, are they not? Also versions can change a few times per day on qa/experimentals so how to keep track of users and their bugs? People may submit already solved bugs and keep people busy finding this stuff just because they were no longer up to date. It may sound trivial, but that would be a major problem i guess.\n\nIts just the old manpower problem. What 10 people do in 1 hour cannot be done by 600 in one minute.. There is a certain threshhold beyond which the amount of testers would become ineffective if not a burden on the (streamlined) process that has been established a few ages back. \n\nOf course people could find gamebreaking bugs, but they\u0027d so so on the final release... and then? Well, if you create a hotfix one day after release or during the \u0022third stage of testing\u0022 would come to the same point: You have a fix for a problem, dont you? \n\nI dont want to be rude or arrogant here, but in general the whole testing business is quite streamlined and people work like a clockwork during testing periods and just putting a ton of unexpierenced testers could be a burden on our back rather than help."},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:59:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Admittedly, I didn\u0027t read 15 pages of responses... but here\u0027s my opinion for what it\u0027s worth. \n\u003E I saw a few bugs... but it was largely a vast improvement over .90.\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t believe that crying, whining, or being aggressive helps anything.\n\u003E \n\u003E I seriously doubt moderators or Squad reps can come into our community, one that\u0027s built up around this game... sure... but still made up mostly of fans, and with a few words cause people to stop being the way they are. You cannot control others, and I doubt that being whiny or angry is against forum rules (nor should it be in my opinion) it\u0027s just people sharing how they feel. If someone gets nasty and posts things that violate the rules, that\u0027s one thing... but it seems silly to come in here and essentially say \u0022Stop being so mean!\u0022. If what you mean to say is \u0022Hey, we have feelings too... we don\u0027t get paid for this... we do it because we think you guys are awesome... and we\u0027re doing the best we can, so stop being so mean\u0022... well, that\u0027s a different story... but you have to accept the fact that people will still be who they are (for better \\*and\\* for worse).\n\u003E \n\u003E Lastly, there are probably some people that it\u0027s best to just ignore... I\u0027ll leave it to you to figure out who they are. I haven\u0027t had any problems with what squad has done so far, but trying to control free discussion seems a bit... much. It\u0027ll blow over, just do the best you can... I think that\u0027s all most of us ask.\n\u003E \n\u003E Oh, and the percentage of people who have complaints that post them is far higher than the percentage of people who don\u0027t have complaints post just to say \u0022no problems here\u0022.\n\n\\*Claps\\* I also have no problem with the QA team and the Exp team because they are volunteers. They expect hard work out of washing this release from it\u0027s bugs, and they do miss a few so they don\u0027t have their whole day consumed by just one thing. Also, I\u0027m guessing that 90 is the new number of workers working on bug fixing a inde game suffering from not enough bug fixers, at least according to the offensive post everyone is quoting from."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T11:08:43Z","Content":"Squad *used* to release the experimental versions to the community, and back when KSP was small with a close knit community of technically minded players who understood the game was in development and would contain bugs, this was perfectly fine.\n\nThen KSP gained wider appeal, there were more members, the concept of early access to an unfinished game eluded them.\n\n0.14.0 was released.\n\nIt was an absolute, unmitigated and complete disaster.\n\nThe forums were absolutely hammered with endless screaming and abuse, many players expected, *demanded*, fully working and playable versions from a game in the early days of development.\n\nWhat we\u0027ve seen the last few days has been nothing in comparison.\n\nSquad realized then that public releases of experimental builds were no longer tenable, the testing team was set up and only versions that had passed them would go to public release.\n\n0.15 was playable, so was 0.16 and 0.17 and so on, every update has been playable.\n\nIf you were given the experimentals, or worse, the QA builds, and saw everything break and all your saves and craft destroyed you\u0027d flip your lid, the testers know they can\u0027t expect things to work which is why they are on the team.\n\nThanks to them you can actually play KSP.\n\nPublic access to experimental builds is never coming back, and with good reason."}]}
