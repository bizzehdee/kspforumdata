Once the stages burnt out I jetisoned them, with the parachutes deployed. I then continued with the launch, keeping an eye on the stages. Then they dissapeared. I wondered if I didn\u0027t have enough parachutes on and they had all exploded on impact. So I relaunch and this time after jetisoning them I focus on them instead of the ship. The ship had plenty of fuel, it should have kept going for a while. On impact the stages survive no problems, but when I go into map view the main ship is gone. Just like the stages were before. Persistent debris is set to 250. The game auto saved, so now Jeb and Bill are just gone, they are not in the crew roster under any of the tabs or anything \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP V1.0.2.842\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshot: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=451972134\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=451972134\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T14:00:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is no bug.
