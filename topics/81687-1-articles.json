They hooked me as a kid with the \u0022Hystar\u0022 demonstrator at Expo \u002786, when heavy lift airships were just a few years away from transforming the logging industry (no more logging roads, and selective logging will be so cheap there\u0027ll be no more clearcuts!). But cargo airships have remained \u0022just a few years away\u0022 for the 28 years since (Hystar\u0027s main business since then appears to be moving its headquarters from New Brunswick to Maine to Delaware to Nevada). I was up in the arctic when Discovery Air, a moderate sized charter operator who, to their credit, run services with oddball aircraft like their trio of Dash-7\u0027s, announced they were going to buy a fleet of hybrid airships from the UK, but by then I just didn\u0027t believe anymore... and lo and behold, it didn\u0027t happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey\u0027re crazy if they think it will be able to compete with road based transport cost-wise. Fuel and pilot costs alone would make that just about impossible. There might be a niche for hard to reach places where runways aren\u0027t feasible, but it\u0027s a small, small niche.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EMight be a case of very forward thinking. At least, the future of America\u0027s roads is very much in question right now, and we don\u0027t have a top-notch rail system to fall back on.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe availability and cost of energy for transportation use will be a problem before the roads fall apart. You can\u0027t save long distance transportation in North America (Canada has the same problem, only worse!) with a system that consumes \u003Cstrong\u003Emore\u003C/strong\u003E energy to move the same payload the same distance. If airships can\u0027t compete on a cost-per-ton-mile (or cost-per-passenger-mile) basis, an all-powered VTOL has no chance. Nevermind passenger rail; if you want to enjoy the future, pound tracks for freight rail, NOW.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-17T01:35:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2014 01:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Justy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
