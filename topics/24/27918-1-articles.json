As such, there are no requirements or expectations (other than a sense of humour).

Some of the games we have been playing recently include: KSP, Neverwinter, Garry\u0027s Mod, Alien Swarm, Borderlands 2 and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are interested, don\u0027t hesitate to sign up at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.jimbobslimbob.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.jimbobslimbob.com\u003C/a\u003E - where I also have some images of some of my (and other users) brilliant KSP creations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"austin4050","CreatedById":66368,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T20:56:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello and welcome to the Kerbal Space Program forum!
