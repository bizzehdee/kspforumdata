I\u0027ve used it a few bit, but more intensive play since November 11, 2013 (v1.0.5.1028) playing every afternoon (I\u0027ve a lot of time to waste because I\u0027m unemployed), after a new/fresh install on my PC. I\u0027m newbie here (I\u0027ve joined this forum yesterday). Other favorite games are Flight Simulator X, pinball simulations (Future Pinball, The Pinball Arcade) and infiltration games (Splinter Cell series).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFavorite addons for KSP are MechJeb2, KER,\u00A0Kerbal Alarm Clock and, for docking, DPAI. No problem with these addons. I\u0027ll plan to try KIS, seems to be an interessing addon too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve started a career mode (normal difficulty) - in parallel with sandox (for launcher validations), for now, I\u0027ve (only) reached Duna orbit and Ike landing... but wanting more science points to unlock ion technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope we can exchange ideas, help or something here!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreetings from France.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDominique\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T22:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum, DomiKamu.
