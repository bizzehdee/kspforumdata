I am RedstoneWizard22. I bought Kerbal Space Program on steam after it went on release\u00A0and have so far played 73 hours on it. So far I have got to the mun and back (After 5 failed attempts), Minimus and back (With the\u00A0loss of Jeb (Don\u0027t worry he\u0027s floating in space, I just need to find a way to rescue him))\u00A0and blown up on Duna. I play 75% of my time in sandbox creating useless contraptions and 25% in career mode, and am now playing a lot with the\u00A0BD Armoury mod.
