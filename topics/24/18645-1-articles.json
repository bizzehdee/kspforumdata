Of course, being a fan of space exploration, I had to watch Star Trek the Next Generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then Stargate(The first movie) and Stargate SG-1 were made, and I was an instant fan. Though the real space exploration was a bit on the side line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut a couple of weeks back, when NASA JPL released their 7 Minutes of Terror video for the Curiosity rover, I remembered why I like space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I remembered that Notch was making a space game(0x10c), looked around to see how far along the game was. Sadly not in playable form yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I searched for \u0022games like 0x10c\u0022, and I came across this top 10 list and it had Kerbal Space Program on it. Tried the demo and the next day, when I managed \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto pry myself from the game, I bough it. I just don\u0027t have any words for how much I like the game, and I can\u0027t wait till the next update(0.17).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dusty926","CreatedById":34077,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T21:27:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome, Happy Launching\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHehe, beat ya to it Capt n\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T21:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi The Stinger, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is great isn\u0027t it?
