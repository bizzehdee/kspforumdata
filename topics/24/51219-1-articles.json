I think i will use that design to try and get to duna or the mun! If you can which planet is easier to get to for a new player?

Minmus is easier to land on and return from because of its size and low gravity, but its orbit isn\u0027t a perfect circle in line with Kerbin\u0027s equator, meaning you have to adjust your course a little more to actually get a good encounter with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us know how it goes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lolkillalevi","CreatedById":90916,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T04:26:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t gotten to trying to go to minmus, I tried once...I ended up falling back into where i keep reversing, I throtteld up and it just made it reverse faster ??!?!?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aceassasin","CreatedById":20841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T04:37:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, I would reccomend going to the Mun; just remember to burn when the mun is on the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T07:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun is a first good challenge, though so is Minimus for different reasons.
