Ya, the mechanics are a bit rusty but come back quickly. Still working through the Training, got as far as landing on Mun today. First attempt was my first \u0022Kerbal Massacre\u0022, second attempt was successful. Only issue so far seems to be a known bug from what I could find. Happens in the Training when your asked to click on your orbit and do a maneuver. Most times the orbit wasn\u0027t blue/purple and I couldn\u0027t click it. Tried the fixes or suggestions I could find and all that seemed to work was quitting, and rebooting the system. Other than that I had a blast.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
