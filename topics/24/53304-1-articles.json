I\u0027d say, uhh, about a month now. In-game, I foucus on playing in a progressive sort-of style- First Sub-orbital, Full Orbit, Orbit the Mun, Land on the Mun, Ect, Ect, along with not abusing the transmissions, with a maximum of 5 per flight. I also never go two tiers beyond any incomplete tier on the tech tree. Example:I want to learn \u0022Electricity\u0022. I look back two tiers, and find that I have not yet learned \u0022General Rocketry\u0022, so I limit myself in that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... going off-topic in the original post...
