I fly in real life by hand [but, not to space], so it only seems natural.

All my Mun landings are a circus act with at least one cartwheel - performed at 2-3m/s, slow-mo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how other folks are getting video of their KSP runs. Though, I admit, I\u0027m not computer savvy, anymore. Ever since they introduced this little \u0022mouse\u0022 thingy on the side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure that thing is a fad, though.

That means that the prograde and retrograde symbols on your Navbal now are in relation to your target instead of in relation to Kerbin. Thus you simply find the right marker (Yellow marker with the tri-cross inside) Burn facing it and your relative speed to target will shrink to zero. Your ship is now hanging out parallel-ish to your target. From here you re-orient to face your target and do smaller burns and jumps in the same manner trying to get close to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeaving Kerbal is fairly simple. You leave the planet while in orbit closer to the sun and your orbit is counter to solar orbit so you\u0027ll fling against the flow and go deeper toward EVE and Moho. Leave orbit while facing with the flow of solar orbits and you will be flung outward toward Dres, Jool and Eloo. (Manuever nodes will be needed to really aim anywhere and you should also check out the guides on Orbital Transfer Windows for the best way to get to each planet)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T02:42:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, thanks, Xactar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took me three read-throughs to figure out all of what you said but, they all make sense, now.
