XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I\u0027m not really one for long-winded boring intros, but I got into the game due to my overarcing interest in astronomy and astrophysics; while KSP isn\u0027t a full-out space sim, it\u0027s also surprisingly fun. Current projects include a long-term mod-based station around Jool and a distant station project just outside the orbit of Eeloo. I\u0027ll probably post pictures of them at some point in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSuperintendnt","CreatedById":47102,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T16:56:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice post and welcome to the forums!
