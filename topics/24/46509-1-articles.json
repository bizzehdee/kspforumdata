And I must say, even though this is still an alpha after (2 years of production I believe), the game still feels fresh and the replayability is amazing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s incredibly the amount of hours one can spend on simply building a station in space while completely forgetting what time it actually is IRL... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow onwards to try out an SSTO- Starwars style (the one where the craft docks in a ring located in orbit), and explorer the solar system... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I do have a few questions and I would really love it if somebody could answer them right away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I\u0027ve tried messing with the resolution, I saw some posts on reddit and the steam forums, that the game supports multiple monitors. However when ever I try setting a 5760x1080, the game itself dosn\u0027t change, however in the settings menu in-game, it sets it to 1024x768 but only in the displayed text the actual resolution is 1920x1080. Any explanation to this, or tips as to get it working ? (GPU: Asus Radeon 7870 @ 2Gb)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When ever I do a time-warp of more than 50x, I somehow loose control of my SAS, in the way that I become unable to activate/deactivate it. This happens with all crafts and no matter the settings I use. However a friend of mine never sees this, even if we built the exact same crafts. ???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESry if this one seems confusing, but I\u0027ve tried to spell it out...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I\u0027ve seen people on youtube using the structural panels, where they are able to get them to curve/bend in the opposite direction of eachother (While using the symmetry mode), however I only seem to be able to have them move in the same direction. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYoutube - /o\\ - @0:45 - 0:52\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-c9wggLlKE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe - /o/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere \u0027 / \u0027 is a panel and \u0027 o is a cylinder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T08:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there Yilmas and welcome to the forums! I think your best shot to getting an answer on your first question is in the Gameplay Questions forum. As for your second question: once you enter timewarp you lose complete control of your ship. The exception is physical timewarp (1x, 2x, 3x and 4x). This is becase for the timewarp to function the ship is unloaded from the physics. The third issue you\u0027re having is probably due to the difference between the VAB and SPH\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GraviTykillz","CreatedById":60694,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T18:48:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
