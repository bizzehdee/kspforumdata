Most of the Time i would do simple Flybys of the Mun to enjoy the view. My first actual landing was when i bought the Full version 0.16 with the 3 person Capsule (i don\u0027t like to send Kerbals alone) and it worked on the first try! My first rendezvous and docking was in 0.16 too using the incredible ORDA mod. I care very much for my Kerbals and every manned rocket i build has a fully tested abort system. Currently i\u0027m building a Mun base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts nice to be back on the Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: please forgive my horrible writing.
