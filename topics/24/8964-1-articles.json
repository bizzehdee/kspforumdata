I had so much fun with that I just decided to go ahead and donate and get a proper version. So far I\\\u0027ve been just messing with the stock parts and attempting to learn what I can. There\\\u0027s definitely a bit of a learning curve involved with this...rocket design, orbital mechanics! ??? Since starting I\\\u0027ve been able to get as far as completing a successful lunar (Munar?) orbit and return to Kerbin. That was a little sloppy, but it got done!

It seems like no matter how careful I\\\u0027m trying to land, my legs wind up snapping off, the ship falls over and the CM breaks off. Are the stock landing legs just that brittle or am I doing it wrong? I\\\u0027m not really landing on rough terrain as I\\\u0027ve been shooting for craters. Should I switch to the fins?

After several failed attempts at landing I finally managed to land successfully and return to Kerbin safely. What helped me out in a big way was using a directly overhead view and using the RCS thrusters to manage my lateral movement. Once I nailed that, touching down just became a matter of throttle control to do it gently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst image from the Munar surface!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/21exqpw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002221exqpw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturned safely!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/2ch6ctc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222ch6ctc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next goal was to actually pick a landing site, instead of just landing wherever I happened to come into orbit over.
