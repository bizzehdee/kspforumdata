But I had two problems\n\n1) when building a ship there\u0027s no \u0022blueprint\u0022 mode or anything that could help me align objects correctly, eg an additional fuel tank on sidemounted detachment thingies\n\nand (more importantly)\n\n2) I have two monitors, had the game full screen on one monitor but the game didn\u0027t constrict the mouse cursor to the game, which I found annoying.\n\nAre those things addressed in the full version, or are there plans to do so?\n\nAlso - will there ever be a sale? I\u0027m like a bum with a computer and 40\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC is too much for a game for me ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\ncheers,\n\nSoWe"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T02:37:18Z","Content":"hello sowemeetagain you might find the tutarails section beter sutide for this and can you please be moar specifice with your questioons?"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T03:05:40Z","Content":"1 - When doing side-mounted (radial) attach, you can get some alignment help by grabbing the entire craft, (shift-click) and drag it part-way below the floor.

Very helpful ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) so now I know that the monitor problem wasn\u0027t just me and if I ever get the full version I know how to better align stuff.\n\nBut - what about future planning on these things? Is the issue with the monitors known, is it going to be addressed? Is there maybe a list of upcoming features and bugfixed I could look at?\n\nAnd a new question - I looked around the mods and saw some things which I definitely would want - more realistic air drag and such. But the mods said \u0022no 64bit windows\u0022 which I do run ... What\u0027s up with that? Again: will these things be addressed, is there a list of upcoming features and/or bugfixes?\n\ncheers"},{"CreatedByName":"Ten Key","CreatedById":123319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T16:40:31Z","Content":"The \u0022no 64 bit\u0022 thing relates to the old 64 bit version of Kerbal Space Program for Windows.

So far, we expect an entirely new starting level for the space center. We expect it because work had started many months ago, they aren\u0027t starting from scratch.\n\nCurrently, the game has three upgrade levels for each space center building (things like the Vehicle Assembly Building, launch pad, tracking station, etc.) Each building can be upgraded independently in a career game. So it will go to four levels, but the top level and abilities stay the same. \n\nIf you just want to mess around with building rockets and trying to go places with no limits except what air and gravity let you get away with - sandbox mode puts you straight into that top level with all rocket \u0026 airplane parts available."},{"CreatedByName":"SoWeMeetAgain","CreatedById":145256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T11:55:46Z","Content":"Thanks guys.

(Sorry, Basic!)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThe good news about the 64-bit version is that the devs have been making positive noises about bringing it back once they move from Unity 4 to Unity 5. Unity 4\u0027s 64-bit offering is apparently bad enough that they couldn\u0027t make a version stable enough to maintain (always worked perfectly for me, but apparently I was in the minority). Some mod developers (at least Ferram, as you noted) finally gave up in disgust and prevented their mods from working in the 64-bit version, which is probably part of what prompted Squad to withdraw that version. I would expect that version 1.1 (which we\u0027ve been given to understand will probably be the first Unity 5 release) or some release shortly thereafter will include 64-bit for Windows."}]}
