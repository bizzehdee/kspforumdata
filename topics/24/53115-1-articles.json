Some of my background helped a lot and some was a bit of a hindrance. I already had a working knowledge of orbital mechanics, Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, mass/DV budgets, etc. So I already new about Hohmann transfer, phasing orbits, efficient staging, and all of the various terminology (periapsis, apoapsis, ascending nodes, etc.). So it was very easy to jump in and head to the Mun, Duna, etc. However, I also know that for the most part in real life you stacked rocket stages vertically because of the aerodynamic implications ... which don\u0027t matter in KSP and made most of my early rockets wobbly and prone to unplanned dis-assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T20:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022 However, I also know that for the most part in real life you stacked rocket stages vertically because of the aerodynamic implications ... which don\u0027t matter in KSP and made most of my early rockets wobbly and prone to unplanned dis-assembly. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEyup.
