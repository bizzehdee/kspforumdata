I recently discovered KSP via reddit and became obsessed with the demo (after 24 failed launches) and had to buy the game.

You may really need something later you may not be aware of now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Try to plan ahead, for example. I have a really cheap and small standard probe launch vehicle I use for sat contracts. I always have at least one science gathering device, power, and comms on it. You never know when you might want to use that later. I have one on Duna\u0027s moon right now. Every once and a while I get a contract offer to send science data from the surface. So, I switch to that probe , read the temp and send the info via comms. I get the money for that one over and over even though you get no more credit for the science. Dont turn down easy money. I think it cost me around 4000 to launch that thing, so far Ive made nearly 400,000 from it. You got to love that. You can do similar things with other craft in other places. This only works for contracts that dont require you to build a new space craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-12T15:13:31Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2015 03:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kevin Kyle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thearkhitekt","CreatedById":152107,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T14:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the tips.
