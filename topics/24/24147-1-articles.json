I also have many (presumably) exciting and interesting ships as well as ideas I\u0027d like (am forced by our shareholders, who are totally not moon rabbits) to share.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T03:59:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello watsas.
