I am just getting started and I have been taking care to keep my Kerbals alive while I explore the near Kerbin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was very proud of the fact that I recovered Bob from a hopeless out-of-fuel situation in an elliptic orbit of Kerbin with apoapsis out past the Mun and periapsis 2,800km from Kerbin. I tried mounting a rescue mission: first I had to acquire enough science to get the Stayputnik, then I constructed an unmanned craft with an empty command pod for Bob to come home in and sent it up in to a roughly circular orbit at 2,800km. It got an encounter with the stranded craft; I got it within 2km. Bob got out and started to make his way across. But because the orbits were so different within a few seconds the speed differential became too great and however hard Bob accelerated he could not catch it. He had to turn around and fly over 2km back to the stranded craft. I thought the situation was hopeless then I read that Kerbals can use their EVA RCS system to push things! Since the stranded craft was just a command pod I tried it. Bob waited till apoapsis then got out and pushed. He had to get back in and out again to refuel his suit six times, and looked really scared when he was outside pushing. But eventually he got the 170m/s of delta-v needed and a few hours later was descending through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. He looked so happy and excited to be home!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the next day I killed Bill in a silly EVA mishap. He was just going on a short jaunt to explore Kerbin\u0027s polar region. At apoapsis, well above the atmosphere, he went for a quick EVA to gather some science. Disaster! As he got out he was ripped from the pod and flew off into space. Oh no! He activated his RCS, righted himself and flew back towards it. But re-entry was approaching! As he neared the craft atmospheric drag pulled it away and he was left to re-enter by himself; no pod, no parachute. And that last omission was fatal a few seconds later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubsequent investigation revealed a design flaw with the ship. A communotron antenna on the outside of the hatch meant Kerbals getting out fell off. The flaw was corrected, but not until after I had killed Samwell in an almost identical mishap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA flag at the north pole commemorates them: \u0022In memory of Bill and Samwell.
