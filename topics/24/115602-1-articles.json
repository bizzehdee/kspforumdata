After that, you will probably want to try landing on another world. I recommend landing on Minmus first because although it is further out from kerbin, it requires less delta-v (rocket power) to land on and return.\n\nYou might already know this, but one of the best players of KSP is on YouTube: Scott Manley.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEkUeJRCh083UT-Lq5ZIKI75\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nA final note: The game might seem intimidating at first, but is easy and fun to learn. It even comes with some tutorials! I bought the game only about a year ago, and now I can say I\u0027ve made round trips to the Mun, Minmus, and Duna!\n\nI hope this post helped you. Happy landings! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nEDIT: If you want to plan your missions without just winging it (pun intended), [Kerbal Engineer Redux](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-4-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-17-0) is an awesome mod. It automatically tells you how much delta-v your spacecraft has, so you don\u0027t run out of fuel or overpower the craft. A diagram displaying the amount of delta-v needed to travel to any destination in the Kerbol system can be found [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96985-1-0-4-WAC-s-Delta-V-Map-continued-OPM-now-included-%28July-4th-2015%29).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T02:18:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 02:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by livefree75**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ninjamarr","CreatedById":147850,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T02:06:57Z","Content":"That\u0027s nice to know!
