After that, you will probably want to try landing on another world. I recommend landing on Minmus first because although it is further out from kerbin, it requires less delta-v (rocket power) to land on and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might already know this, but one of the best players of KSP is on YouTube: Scott Manley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEkUeJRCh083UT-Lq5ZIKI75\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA final note: The game might seem intimidating at first, but is easy and fun to learn. It even comes with some tutorials! I bought the game only about a year ago, and now I can say I\u0027ve made round trips to the Mun, Minmus, and Duna!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this post helped you.
