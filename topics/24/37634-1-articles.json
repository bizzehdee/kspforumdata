It all depends on the performance of the rocket you are building. My, very light, probe launchers usually only have an ascent stage and on orbit stage. So i don\u0027t drop anything until i get to orbit. However, some of my much bigger payload lifters have 4 or 5 stages that all drop at different times before i even get to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI highly recommend you watch Scott Manley\u0027s tutorial videos on youtube.
