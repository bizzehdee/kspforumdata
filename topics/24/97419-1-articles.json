The former will provide you with rich informational readouts on factors like your Delta-V (how far your rocket can carry you, essentially- although I suggest checking the KSP Wiki for a more complete/complex definition), your Thrust Weight Ratio (TWR) on the launchpad, and your orbital parameters (orbital period, apoapsis/periapsis etc.) without having to switch to the Tracking Station or Map View...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly enough you\u0027ll hear MANY, probably MOST players here on the forums throw around the terms TWR and Delta-V, yet strangely some players refuse to play with MechJeb2 or KER, which are the only methods I know of to actually obtain this information in-game without having to sit down with a pencil-and-paper and calculate them by some very convoluted methods (you need to figure out the exact fuel mass of your rocket to do it that way, for instance...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb2 also comes with some nifty autopilot and flight-assist functions that can make the learning curve for KSP much less steep, when you can rely on the autopilot to do some of the flying for you (trust me, it can\u0027t do it all- and some thing you\u0027ll quickly discover you can do much better yourself) so you can focus on learning how to build successful rockets and spaceplanes in the first place before tackling trying to become a skilled pilot as well as rocket scientist...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-90-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-14-6-12-27-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E Ferram Aerospace Research\u003C/a\u003E, I *highly* suggest starting off with that mod *As Soon As Possible* because the devs have announced stock KSP is due for an Aerodynamics Overhaul in the next update. FAR is without any contest the BEST (and in fact, to my knowledge, the ONLY) mod that accurately and realistically simulates aerodynamics in KSP at the moment. Installing it will get you in the habit of building realistic rockets now, so that when the stock Aerodynamics Overhaul arrives, you\u0027ll be fully-prepared for the more realistic aerodynamics (right now, we have a stock aerodynamics model where you can literally drop a lead ball and a feather *inside the atmosphere* and as long as neither is a wing part, they will fall at the *exact* same rate...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, FAR comes with a lot of informational readouts and displays- but you can effectively ignore those. They just provide you with useful information/statistics on your plane/rocket\u0027s design so you can build your rocket/plane to be it\u0027s stable BEFORE you launch it. But when you\u0027re first starting at KSP, crashing regularly is a ritual of the learning-process every rookie goes through (yes, even me, who made it to orbit on my first launch through a bit of beginner\u0027s luck- my 2nd launch crashed and burned miserably, as did my 3rd and 5th...) and half the \u003Cstrong\u003E!FUN!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you think KSP isn\u0027t hard enough, you should really try \u003Ca href=\u0022http://dwarffortresswiki.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDwarf Fortress\u003C/a\u003E some time.
