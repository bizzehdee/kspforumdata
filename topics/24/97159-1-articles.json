I had a difficult time figuring out how this game works, but many hours later i\u0027m starting to understand the basics. Starting without SAS or manoever nodes was really hard! I actually downloaded 0.25 to understand the differences and found out it became a lot harder to play trough carreer. Anyway... I now know how to place sat\u0027s in orbit and I managed to rescue an orbitting kerbonaut! For me, it felt like the worlds greatest achievement. (LOL) I know it\u0027s not much, but that\u0027s why im here!

I am playing now kerbal with my friends with the DarkMultiplayer mod on a server i\u0027ve set up for it. This doubles the fun of failing!! We\u0027ve set up a few space stations around Kerbin and the Mun, i really love this game and the game itself is getting more interesting by the day. Especially using parts in different ways is a big challenge. Would love to get more people to join on my server now and then, if you are interested send me a PM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
