This software is so highly addictive, it\u0027s insane. I used to fly alot in Orbiter, space shuttle missions to the ISS, moon or mars missions, lots of fun stuff. But after some years it became boring and there simply was no alternative, until KSP came along. Same theory as in Orbiter, not that technical but the best part: build your own rocket withouth photoshop and modelling software \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after a week in the KSP sandbox and severe lack of sleep I\u0027ve put a huge 3-stage station in a 270km orbit around kerbal which also acts as a fuel station and made several SSTO ships that are able to dock at the station, yesterday I landed for the first time on Minmus with the latest ship I\u0027ve designed. The latest 3 SSTO are also jump jets, they can start and land vertically on Kerbal or a Moon. And I\u0027ve already so many new ideas, 2 more Stages to complete the stations, some spy satellites around Kerbal, never build a rover until now and then there\u0027s the rest of the system to explore. I am pretty sure I\u0027ll be busy for a looong time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pics. If someone\u0027s interessted in the craft files I\u0027m happy to share, I\u0027m not sure yet though if they follow established standards as I do everything as I think it\u0027s right. I pay attention to TWR, fuel consumption, gravity, force and so on (as much as it\u0027s possible in KSP), but I think that some \u0022solutions\u0022 I found are only possible in KSP because of the very basic implementation of aerodynamics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut so far, everything I\u0027ve build works together in harmony, the lifter can bring all station parts into the 270km orbit, the station itself is highly modulized, meaning you can completely reconfigure it in space. Every stack of modules attached to the main structure is docked and can be undocked, has a Mechjeb, remote control, batteries, RCS and an engine and there are still enough docking ports left for as many fuel tanks as you need to traverse the galaxy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 1 of the Station on the way up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pic-upload.de/view-22377733/stage-2-lift.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www7.pic-upload.de/thumb/25.02.14/iz52tf3sdut2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iz52tf3sdut2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 1, 2 and 3 (Fueltanks) of the Stations joined together and the SSTO docked:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pic-upload.de/view-22377735/station.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www7.pic-upload.de/thumb/25.02.14/typi8bw9jfq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022typi8bw9jfq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVertical Launch of the SSTO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pic-upload.de/view-22377741/vert.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www7.pic-upload.de/thumb/25.02.14/2n8gfljxmh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222n8gfljxmh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanded on Minmus - flight in two phases: SSTO and dock on the station, refuel, Hohmann to Minmus and vert land:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pic-upload.de/view-22377744/moon-land.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www7.pic-upload.de/thumb/25.02.14/frew39yh6c93.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022frew39yh6c93.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FanaticalFighter","CreatedById":77314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T12:41:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!
