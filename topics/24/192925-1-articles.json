Off the top of my head:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Kerbal home system is 1/10th the scale of our solar system, with planetary densities adjusted to get similar surface gravity to our solar system. This means that the delta-v (how \u0022distance\u0022 is measured in the wonky world of orbital mechanics) required to go from anywhere to anywhere is roughly half to a third of what it would be if the Kerbal system were at a realistic scale.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTo compensate for the above, all the parts (tanks, engines, etc.) in KSP are much heavier than their real-world counterparts. There\u0027s a running joke around here that, instead of using aluminum and carbon composites, Kerbals build their rockets out of lead and rebar. This makes Kerbal rockets less performant than real-life rockets, which partially offsets the sub-scale solar system.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe orbital mechanics themselves are simplified somewhat compared to real life. KSP makes use of something called patched conic approximation - basically, you assume that the ship you\u0027re plotting a course for is only affected by the gravity of one body at a time. This assumption is accurate 99% of the time, but you lose out on some fun N-body interactions (for example, Lagrange points).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe aerodynamics aren\u0027t so much simplified as modeled in a way that produces odd results sometimes. Aerodynamic forces are modeled on a per-part basis (instead of over the entire vessel as a cohesive unit) with some heuristics for occlusion tacked on to make lift and drag behave more or less as you\u0027d expect.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere\u0027s no life support, and Kerbals are perfectly happy to spend 50 years in a space suit strapped to a chair on the side of a rocket.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll rocket engines in KSP can be started instantly, shut down instantly, throttled anywhere from 0% to 100%, and restarted an infinite number of times in any conditions. The same is definitely not true of real rocket engines.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere\u0027s no light-speed delay when controlling probes in deep space over a radio connection.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStructural failure due to aerodynamic heating is all-or-nothing. Or, in other words, KSP doesn\u0027t model the way the strength of a material changes with temperature - it just makes parts explode when they get above some threshold temperature.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBatteries are modeled as tanks that hold electricity.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA few parts have stats that are even more off than usual. The worst offender is the Dawn ion thruster, whose thrust is ~1,000x what it would be in real life.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a long list, and I definitely left some stuff off. But don\u0027t let it dissuade you from playing the game. \u0022Easier than real life rocket science\u0022 does not imply \u0022easy\u0022. The simplifications aren\u0027t there to make the game easy for new players - they\u0027re there to make the game playable at all for new players. And, if you\u0027re looking to learn something in the process, the stock game has plenty to teach about the broad strokes of rocket design and orbital mechanics, even if it might fudge the fine details in the name of playability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Retro Starship","CreatedById":200667,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-06T15:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EWelcome to the KSP forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/203754-truckmen/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022203754\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/203754-truckmen/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@truckmen\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EWow every one up above that left comments are so correct.
