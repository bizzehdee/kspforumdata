Decided to actually start getting active in this community considering I\u0027ve been playing almost non stop for a month. I was never really into rockets as a kid but loved space. Always found it to be such a waste spending so much on a rocket only to have none or almost none of it re-used. When I saw this game on a certain image board I thought it looked really neat. Being an Ace Combat fan and love for all sorts of flying machines I was instantly hooked on the fact I could actually make my own planes with such ease. Granted the stock parts in this game I\u0027m not too much of a fan of (specifically fuel tanks) the old C7 flight pack took care of my limitations and let me start to run wild with my designs. But theres only so far you can go in a single player game without communicating with other players. Hope to be bouncing ideas and designs around sometime in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T12:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
