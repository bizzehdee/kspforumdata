Well that is what i am doing it seems to work really well to haven\u0027t been to minmus yet i only got to mun yesterday, and i have been playing since 0.12, the stock parts still aren\u0027t boring for me yet. even if you like mods here are some tips that can increase the enjoyment of the stock part, while a part is selected you are able to rotate in various ways by pressing the q,e,w,a,s,d and shift keys. you can change the control sensitivety for your rockt/plane by hitting the \u0022CAPS LOCK\u0022 key, when in orbit when you light the engines to go you will effect the opposite side more, and for the greatest affect try to do it near the periapsis or apoapsis (or however you spell those)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell those are some tips from me you can follow them or not but that is jus thow i like to play\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-03T01:00:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elet\u0027s see (sorry, no download links, too much work)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKosmos pack - great stylish parts and folding solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESilisko Edition - Nova\u0027s set of parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBACE pack - some space station parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbodobodyne - fer makin space probes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDamned Aerospace - propellers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecrewtank - a part than can hold three kerbals, and comes empty\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDamned Robotics - Movable servo parts and claws\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZoxygene - a sort-of-broken-all-the-time life support mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecamera pack - little cameras you can place on your rocket and switch to with F8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecomsat relays - set up a communications relay network and use it to control craft! _ I really like this one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMapsat - generate maps of the altitude of the planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb - autopilot, and a dependency of many other mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-03T15:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
