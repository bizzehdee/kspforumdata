I was 11 years old watching Apollo 11 land, and then all the other missions. As a result, I wanted to be an astronaut as a boy. Thanks to the very hard work and great inspiration by Squad, I can now live that dream!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Can a fully loaded space stations with multiple landers and rovers attached orbiting in Kerbin be pushed out to a Minmus orbit? Or a planet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) What happens to the actions I set up once two craft are merged by docking? Do they come back when separated?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Can I launch ships from Kerbin that have some tanks empty with the intent of refueling them once they dock at the station?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If I try a burn with this SS having all but one engine turned off, can I still circularize the orbit after other ships are attached to the SS?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks folks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T22:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) You can move anything as long as you move it carefully enough at low accelerations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Action groups have stayed set in detached ships for me, but I don\u0027t want to promise that it will work for you because there are occasional weirdnesses that still need to be worked out of the docking system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Yes, but you have to burn off the fuel or use a mod to empty the tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Not sure what you mean, though as I said, you should be able to burn the engines on a fragile ship if you are careful and stick to low accelerations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LunaTrick","CreatedById":77902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T05:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy space station has lots of vehicles. I bet there are 75 boosters there. I only want to fire ONE booster to circularize, or to move the orbit. Any more than that would rip the station apart. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I can click 74 boosters and disable them. I was hoping the opposite could also be done - tell the SS to only burn with ONE user selected booster?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
