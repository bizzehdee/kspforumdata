The names Scurge and I\\\u0027m an Electrical Engineer. I found this game on a blog I watch daily called HackaDay (I\\\u0027m sure a few of you are familiar with it) and have become completely addicted after only a couple days playing. I\\\u0027ve got several crafts into space, a few orbiting Kerbin, and a few orbiting the sun (missed the mun). I absolutely love this game and cant wait for the completed game to come out. I do have a couple questions, but I\\\u0027ll post them in the proper threads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-04T19:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kevinlacht","CreatedById":14955,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-05T11:09:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome at KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plaatinum Aerospace","CreatedById":30569,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-05T16:40:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the community!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaatinum Aerospace Technologies \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
