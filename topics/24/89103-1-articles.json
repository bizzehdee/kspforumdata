Guess this is an intro, so I should introduce myself! I\u0027m new to the forums but have been playing KSP for a while by now! I love space and engineering, as well as military technology(Missile trucks that destroy VAB\u0027s anyone?)! I\u0027m going to stop exclaiming things now! Can\u0027t wait to have some fun discussions. I like to(attempt to) write science fiction sometimes, and almost all of my writing seems to center around artificial intelligence or futuristic warfare. I\u0027m great at thinking of ideas, though not carrying them out. I\u0027m practically addicted to mods, I can\u0027t live without FAR/NEAR, and it\u0027s hardship without realchute. You know, the essentials. I also like ID Skillful, and I make fighter planes, which Firespitter helps with. I\u0027ve tried interstellar, but it confuses me like crazy! It\u0027s all an avalanche of mods. Anyways, I hope I fit in well to this community! Have a nice day, and remember, Curiosity could not have killed the cat, because it was on Mars the whole time. It has an alibi. So leave Curiosity alone. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T11:54:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome Solarspaceprobe!
