Back then there was Kerbin, and there was Mun, and if you wanted to land on Mun you laid your rocket down really gently and, if you were really really really good, not only did you not blow up, but you could actually start up again and go back home! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0027t that good. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve just come back to it, and as you can probably tell by my ribbons I\u0027ve already made a few accomplishments in Kerbin\u0027s local system. That Kerbol ribbon I\u0027m not really sure I\u0027ve properly earned, as that was a satellite intended for Kerbin orbit that I somehow way overshot, but I guess it counts anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got lots of plans for Kerbin\u0027s local system before I go gallivanting about the rest of the solar system, though: I want a functional space station, a Mun base, and dammit I will get a lander safely to touch down on Minmus if it\u0027s the last thing I do! (Ironically I think it\u0027s the really low gravity that makes it so hard for me, I end up drastically over-correcting on almost every maneuver.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far my proudest moment was the (mostly) successful V\u0027ger mission, a relatively simple craft that visited both Mun and Minmus and dropped off a probe at each moon before returning on a sub-orbital trajectory to Kerbin (although I stupidly forgot the parachutes so can\u0027t claim the return chevron on my ribbons just yet). Each probe was itself a two-part probe, leaving behind a small comm satellite in orbit while sending a lander down to the surface. I touch down on Mun safely, then spotted an anomalous rock formation not far away and decided I had ample fuel to hop over there; screwed that up, toppled, and blew up. My lander on Minmus had a really great approach until it caught a really bad bounce on touchdown and in my panic to save it I over-corrected and it crashed down head first; ironically the only part that actually exploded was the probe body itself, the rest is now debris scattered across the ice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I do it again though I\u0027ll have to solve the issue of V\u0027ger\u0027s center of gravity being way screwed up after dropping the first probe -- that burn to get from Mun to Minmus was almost impossible with all that mass hanging unbalanced on just one side!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d most like to know about is two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Any tips for someone who\u0027s managed a fair number of successful missions, but might have missed along the way? Especially any controls I might not know about, like maybe a way for finer-grained control over engine acceleration (that was perhaps my biggest issue when trying to set down on Minmus, the slightest tap on Shift sent me careening upwards again!) or things like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Space planes! They certainly look cool, and on that aspect alone I\u0027ll definitely eventually build and use them. But do they have any actual practical benefits over rockets?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T00:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome back Kromey, I\u0027m sure you have many more proud moments to come \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFine throttle control would be so cool, but as we don\u0027t have it we can get by with RCS for fine tuning the descent on low-g worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun landing, and fly safe!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T02:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
