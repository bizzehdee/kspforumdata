to follow.\u00A0To avoid this confusion, it\u0027s better to post in a current thread than to start a new one.\u00A0Even if you can\u0027t find a current thread, your new thread might still get merged.\u00A0We have a bunch of \u0022mega\u0027 threads on the forums, and we often merge new threads on the same topic together into these preexisting threads.\u00A0If that happens, don\u0027t

don\u0027t, it\u0027s not a big deal and\u00A0we can easily move it later, but it\u0027s easier for everybody if it\u0027s in the right place to start with.\u00A0It might take you a little time to get a feel for where each type of thread really belongs, so don\u0027t worry if we do move your thread without warning.\u00A0Each time we move a thread, we\u0027ll leave a link to it\u0027s new location.\u00A0But these links only remain for 24 hours, so if you don\u0027t visit the forums in that time, you may be wondering where your thread went.\u00A0If so, click on your avatar and look at your activity stream,\u00A0 because this will show everything you have posted and\u00A0you can find the thread there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBe
