Liked and subscribed! It looks like you are progressing well. Remember launching to the east (90 deg heading) will give you a free 175m/s because of the rotation of kerbin. ASAS is a heading hold and SAS is just a \u0027kill rotation\u0027 when it\u0027s activated. Keep launching and keep pushing the limits of your space craft! I will be watching! Also, I have a few vids up as well if you\u0027re interested!
