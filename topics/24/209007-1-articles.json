I\u0027ll post them up in the Mission Reports area of course, if I get positive feedback here. Or maybe I\u0027m just more excited than the average player and want to share more than you\u0027d like to have me share LOL!\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EI\u0027ve been dabbling with KSP on and off for a few years, but never anything serious or for more than a day or two, then it\u0027s off to other things. This time, however, I figured I\u0027d give it one more go - but stick with it for a little longer. I\u0027m relatively familiar with the basics of the game and have installed a few mods, particularly\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP1, as I find it more satisfying than a base install.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI\u0027ve started and re-started a career several times over the last few weeks, sometimes because I need to do IRL stuff and by the time I get back to the game, I\u0027ve re-thought how I could approach things - like settings, mods, design, research decisions, etc., and other times because I did not like how I was progressing, or some minor detail like the pointiness of that last rocket was irritating.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also tend to do a LOT of reading on tech specs of historical rocket body design concepts.\u00A0 It usually goes something like, Oh, let me put this fin here... wait... let me look that up... 6 hours goes by and the browser tabs are 50 deep.

I know, I know. I can hear the collective groans and tongue clucking. I am enjoying this phase of the game, though! I\u0027ve made literally 20 iterations of an idea, trying to squeeze every ounce of delta-v and performance from my rockets. Then I start over and do 10-20 more.
