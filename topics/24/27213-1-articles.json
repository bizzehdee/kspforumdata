Basically just the command pod and some engines\u002Bfuel for navigation. I usually enable RCS to get the space craft oriented, disable RCS and enable ASAS to hold it\u0027s position.

ASAS uses other parts like wings, RCS, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, Yes. The way ASAS reacts to your rocket is normal and an inevitable issue. Solving this problem includes a packet of maths and the ability of the game to change the part files continuously.
