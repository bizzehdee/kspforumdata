Don\u0027t really have a question I can think of now, been playing the game for a couple months now and lurking here learning how to do so, that and the YT tutorials. The wiki is very useful also but all three are necessary to really learn how to play the game, and every once in a while I\u0027d want to chime in here and now I can. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, just wanted to say Hi but also have to say that I\u0027m a member and Mod over at Dyxum.com, a photography site devoted to Sony/Minolta Alpha cameras. We like to say and believe that we\u0027re the friendliest site on the web and I gotta say this forum ranks right up there. Everyone here is very courteous, knowledgeable, patient and helpful so Kudos to the membership and the admins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for having me,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERob Suits\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T00:26:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELuke, I am not your father.
