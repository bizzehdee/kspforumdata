You need to create another stage in the staging diagram (which is on the right in the VAB but on the left in the flight screen), and make sure you move the parachutes to a separate stage above the engine. If you don\u0027t, the parachute deploys at the same time that the engine fires, leading to unfortunate results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JackBush","CreatedById":149535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T14:45:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Starhawk, but in the tutorial, the ship is already built and on the launch pad.
