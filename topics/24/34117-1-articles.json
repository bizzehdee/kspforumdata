I remember seeing a trailer for KSP several, several months ago, but to the best of my knowledge, wasn\u0027t released yet... or at least I couldn\u0027t find it. I happen to have been lucky enough to find the Demo version a couple of days ago. Wow! Completely better than I\u0027d have expected and more options and parts than I know what to do with. ... ... Needless to say, after I finished drooling on my keyboad for two days, I had no choice but to buy the full version. I\u0027m now more mezmerized than before, and I think my brain exploded 3 hours ago!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found several excellent tutorials and videoes (really impressed with Scott Manley\u0027s YouTube Videos) and have had the time of my life experimenting with different parts and getting to know the controls and screen layout. I\u0027ve made it to orbit quite a few times and even circled the moon once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is truely amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that I can\u0027t seem to find much information on however is, \u0022Adding Manuevers\u0022 via the Map. When adding a manuever, several \u0022draggable\u0022 icons pop up. Anyone have a link to better info describing what these do in a more \u00223rd grade level\u0022? I\u0027m certain they have to do with changing and altering your orbit and trajectory, but am having a difficult time understanding them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you so much, and happy flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChris.KFQD\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"unwisemonk","CreatedById":65953,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T22:05:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont have a link but if you experiment with them it isnt too hard to figure it out. The green one without an X is the prograde or will make your orbit bigger. The One with the X does the opposite. The purple triangles are used to change the inclination of your orbit. (If you use the purple nodes I believe you have to do that at the ascending or descending nodes.
