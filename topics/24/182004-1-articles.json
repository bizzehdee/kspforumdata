A lesser and easier challenge is to build the lowest mass craft that can get to a stable orbit about Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-08T04:42:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, the full version is totally worth it, and what it does best is to give you an intuitive feel for orbital mechanics that you did not have before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022orbital_mechanics.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022289\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/orbital_mechanics.png\u0022 width=\u0022439\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
