All this in a five stage monster of dubious construction! I feel like the King of Orbital Mechanics! I am rendering the video now in Sony Vegas, and as soon as its rendered and uploaded to YouTube, I\u0027ll pop it here. I think I\u0027ll be around \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A320 shorter on payday as I\u0027ll be buying this fantastically fun game! I had watched pretty much ALL of Scott Manley\u0027s videos on YouTube, became interested, downloaded the demo, and became hooked! After only a few sacrificial Kerbals I got into a stable (if rather eccentric) orbit, made some maneuvers, and completed a safe return. I still feel pretty stoked up about this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a quick warning, the name for my five stage monstrosity is a wee bit erm... adult?
