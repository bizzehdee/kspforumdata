It goes back to the design and a lesson I learned once before when attempting a similar rescue on Minmus. Hard lesson learned and one I hope I don\u0027t forget again which is \u0027be careful which piece you place first\u0027. Don\u0027t know what I was thinking when I did it either, the rescue craft had a Probododyne attached to the docking plate. Which was the first piece I placed and then built the rescue craft around that. I un-docked from it after I landed, meaning that I basically un-docked from the ship and crashed it. This happened because I was trying so many different designs for the rescue craft, this one looked right, \u0027eureka I finally got it\u0027 went off in my head and in the excitement I launched without thinking it totally through.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybit","CreatedById":84298,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T23:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis won\u0027t work either...although it would be nice if it did. Once I undock the two, the lander becomes useless. I could try a rendezvous in orbit around Kerbin and dock the two there then undock and land the lander once I get to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.ngamestudios.com/Images/KSP_V002.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_V002.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T20:55:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm... I think I know what might be going on here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking another look at that second design, what you might want to do is to have a probe body on \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E craft. You can tuck an OKTO2 between the main capsules and the docking ports, which should allow you to remotely control both craft (as long as you still have power, of course). Alternatively, you could put a remote guidance unit on the service module of the orbiter and just above the RCS tank on the lander. Just make sure you have them oriented correctly relative to the craft; if you mount it upside-down, your navball will tell you your ship is upside down \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as long as both craft are within 2.3km of one another, you can switch between different spacecraft using the [ and ] keys, if actually selecting the craft is your problem. You can also pick \u0022Switch To\u0022 on the map mode; the craft will stay visible on the map if there\u0027s some sort of control pod, so the game won\u0027t treat it as debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybit","CreatedById":84298,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T22:53:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks I\u0027ll give it a try and let you know.

I stated that Jeb and the crew have been on Duna for like 600 days, I noticed tonite that moving between the broken lander\u0027s changes the time for the mission. Since I\u0027m not quite good enough to put an \u0027unmanned\u0027 orbiter into orbit around Duna without it being captured by Ike. I\u0027m thinking of moving this over to the Mission thread.
