It\u0027s the best worst game for me, open ended sandbox and lots of things to try and figure out and a lot of fun. I\u0027m an engineer, so that makes it hard to quit playing, especially looking at all the data that MechJeb and Telemachus puts out. Data!! I\u0027ve mostly been tweaking a lot of explody rockets to make them less explody and more orbital. So far I\u0027ve been able to get to the Mun and back and I now have a fairly decent lift vehicle. I was starting to work on an orbiting fuel depot as a first step for a multi-ship Duna mission, but then I saw a thread here with big reusable ships ... so I figured I\u0027d do that instead. Last night I sent up a SpaceBus to get all my Kerbals out of orbit before de-orbiting everything. Tonight the Kerbals will start construction on the Icarus 1. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorpi15","CreatedById":34189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T06:27:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!
