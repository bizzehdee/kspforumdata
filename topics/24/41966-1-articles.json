Just thought I\u0027d check in on the forums and make my presence known to the community. I\u0027d been watching various let\u0027s plays of KSP on Youtube for a while and finally decided to buy it about a week ago when I saw it on sale on Steam. I\u0027ve been enjoying it quite a bit- reading various tutorials on the wiki and basically learning the ropes. I\u0027m currently practicing docking two ships in orbit but I still have quite a ways to go. For your entertainment, I will now relate a silly story about a newbish mistake I made while attempting this endeavor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow DancinDarunia Screwed Up Yet Again\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter two failed missions, I had finally managed to maneuver my ship within 1 km of the satellite with which I was attempting to rendezvous. My hopes were high as I deftly worked the RCS controls, inching ever closer to the docking port which was my objective. After several tense minutes of maneuvering I finally managed to line up my approach. This was it! Finally my goal was within reach! Surely I would soon have the two ships coupled together fastly as a pair of lego bricks. And with these bricks I would begin my construction of my space station, glory of the heavens! I carefully throttled forward, approaching the port at an excruciatingly slow 0.1 m/s. The two ships came together in perfect alignment...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBump!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two ships bounced apart like a fat pair of colliding walruses. Baffled, I realigned my vessel and tried again. Even more carefully I approached the docking port. Once again... bump! Concerned, I now zoomed my camera in closer to my docking port. Then I saw the problem. After reaching orbit, I had decoupled the nose cone on the front of the ship to free the docking port beneath it. However, when designing my ship, I had neglected to note which direction the decoupler ring was pointing. Yes, foolishly I had placed the ring upside down where it was still covering my docking port. Sighing deeply, I resigned myself to once again return home, my mission a failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoral of the story: Don\u0027t be a moron when planning your ship staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fyzzi","CreatedById":31686,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T12:58:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Man... that is worth a warm welcome to our community...
