New guy here and well I have to say I am hooked. I picked up the demo and managed to get one of the Kerbins stuck in a very elliptical orbit. Of course since he was my first guy in orbit I feel like I owe it to him to send a rescue ship. Took me a long time to build it using the demo only but I have a ship with a couple of extra capsules and the fuel to rescue my guy. Now I just need the spare time to map out the mission. I will of course pick up the full version here soon, but am enjoying the challenge of getting my guy back home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T21:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescue missions... we\u0027ve all been down that road before \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I\u0027m betting it\u0027s Jebediah, isn\u0027t it?

It\u0027s actually Ronbo. I am playing the demo version at the moment so my tools are limited, but to me that\u0027s part of the challenge. I have a ship that I can get into orbit and I actually placed two extra capsules along with their own boosters alongside the main capsule with my rescuer onboard. My plan is to meet up with Ronbo, get close enough to get him out of his current capsule, and then into one of the spare capsules and then set it up to make a deorbit burn. Then separate the spare capsules and everyone lands happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s amazing how much time it takes just to try some little change and fully test to see if it will even work.

With a periapsis at 50km, you\u0027re hitting atmosphere, which is going to slowly eat away at that 12000 km apoapsis (but only if you\u0027re actively in control of the ship while it is passing near Kerbin), provided you can avoid an encounter with the Mun.

At an apoapsis of 12000 km, it won\u0027t take much to lower your periapsis deeper into the atmosphere. EVA a kerbal, turn on his jet pack, move him prograde, and then push the ship in the retrograde direction. It should only take one push, as anything below a 40 km periapsis will degrade much faster, and anything much below 30 km will cause an immediate reentry at the speed you\u0027ll be going.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warpedone","CreatedById":83414,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T17:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eric S\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eric S\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESecond, you can get out and push. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much delta V does the jetpack have? could you land on one of the smaller moons from orbit with it and get back??

I am going to keep trying to save Ronbo then. I am still amazed at not only the realism of the program, but how well it\u0027s put together. It really makes you think back to the early days of the space program and those guys were calculating this with slide rules. It\u0027s just mind boggling when you really think about it, and then try and put something like simple orbit burn into action. I have always been fascinated with space and KSP really nails it. I spent hours the other night designing this rescue craft, and am pretty darn proud that I could get it into a similar orbit with enough fuel to get my guy home if I can get the timing right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo speak to the physics programmed in the game, I am noticing that with my rescue craft, when it comes back closer to the earth, the apoapsis is being reduced by the close periapsis, but at a different rate than the other guy in just the capsule. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all of the suggestions.

But it\u0027s funny how I take some of these simulations seriously. For instance I remember once sitting at my computer screen for hours during a cross country flight simulation just to say I did it. I could have easily warped ahead, but didn\u0027t want to ruin the experience for myself, boredom and all. In fact when I got my first guy into orbit and had a four day orbit I considered setting the alarm on my phone and letting the simulation run real time. I know it sounds goofy, but I think it\u0027s pretty cool. My wife gives me that \u0027I think I married an insane person\u0027 look when I tell her I am thinking about leaving it running full time just because I can. In the end I decided to warp ahead, and of course ran out of fuel just seconds before the de-orbit burn was completed, getting me in this mess. Funny thing is, I can\u0027t just leave these two out orbiting at warp speed to catch up with each other since one end of the orbit is so close, the program runs the warp back down to 1x as I get close.
