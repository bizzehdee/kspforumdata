This allows you to always return to ground with your parachute safely at the end of every trip, assuming you don\\\u0027t get stuck in space. In case you are ever close to being stuck and you are almost out of liquid fuel, just do a retrograde burn and your orbit should decay and you can return to earth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-16T13:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
