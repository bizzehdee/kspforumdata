I really enjoy KSP and the addition of Mun has added some much-needed direction to my rocket-building. Y\\\u0027all crack me up and I love it.

Will it be ISS/Mir-style where parts are launched and assembled bit by bit over time, or will it be Salyut/Skylab-style where you have one go with a big rocket?[/li]\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E[li]\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EIn-Orbit Vehicle Assembly:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis is kind of a follow-on to the previous point: I\\\u0027m curious if, once a station is established, I will be able to carry parts for a \u003Cem\u003Evehicle\u003C/em\u003E (not a station) to be later assembled and launched from my station?[/li]\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[li]\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMultiplayer:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this one has been talked about a lot and HarvesteR has said that it\\\u0027d be difficult, if not impossible, to implement. I am no CS-major (mechanical engineering ftw!) but I have friends who play this and I love the idea of--once more stellar bodies are implemented--being able to work with them on the construction of stations and vehicles and bases to further explore the universe and possibly profit from joint-ventures.; even something as simple as an Apollo-esque system where someone is in the lander while another is in the orbital module.

There\\\u0027s a \u0027cost\u0027 box under every part, so how would I make money to buy them? Would the bases I build turn profit? Would I have to resupply the astrokerbals I hire (I mean, they can already stay in orbit for years and still smile at me)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again.
