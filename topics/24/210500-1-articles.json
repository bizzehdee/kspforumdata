Or do you hold it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI seem to have the issue (if its an issue at all) that when turning, i tap the Yaw button to to start to turn east, the rocket turns a little and then it bounces a little back automatically in the opposite direction, and then when i still have to turn more, i press it again, and of course the rocket then ends up woblling to and fro. Is there any option so that it turns smoothly or am i doing something wrong? On the YT videos everyones turns look so smooth and similar. Not sure what im doing wrong\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank in advance for the help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-07T20:00:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can briefly disengage the heading assist by holding the F key while applying attitude corrections.

Rockets are effectively rotationally symmetric about their roll axis, so there is no inherent difference between \u0022pitch\u0022 and \u0022yaw\u0022. For this reason, the more well-known term \u0022pitch\u0022 is commonly applied to both. In fact, when YouTubers \u0022pitch east\u0022, they most often do so with the D key, the same one you were likely using already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-08T02:44:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYaw or pitch are your choice.

Through some quirk of the original design when you spawn parts into the Vehicle Assembly Building they are orientated so that the underside (the side under a Kerbals bottom) is facing north and the top side ( the side above a Kerbals head) is facing south.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have 2 options, if when you launch from the pad, you would like to be able to pitch forward/down towards the East.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1st is build your craft and then click on the root part (usually the cockpit if that is what you spawned first) while the\u00A0 rotational tool is selected, and then turn it 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis. So the nose of the rocket stays pointed at the ceiling and the hatch (of the Mk1 pod as an example) ends up facing the back wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2nd is ,after launch use the rotation control to turn on the vertical axis so that the underside is now facing East. Do this while you are still going straight up and then you will be able to use the pitch control to lean East as you rise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost people find it easier to pitch East than yaw east due to having played flying games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
