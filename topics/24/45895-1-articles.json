Sadly, I found that I didn\u0027t understand most of the maths (I was crook in school when they were teaching integrals and differential calculus, so I kinda had to restart from a very late start. So I bought everything I could lay my hands on : Robert Goddard\u0027s book, which made some sense at last! Unfortunately, I\u0027m still a maths cripple, so things that come naturally to many space buffs takes a looooong time to get \u0022under my belt\u0022. But I\u0027m trying!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve even bought some manuals on celestial mechanics and space dynamics and mission planning and so on, but they\u0027re in a different orbit althogether! So I bought Newton\u0027s Principia to help me understand the basics, and when I got lost in there, Euclid\u0027s Elements helped. (Told you I was a maths dunce!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m 50 years old, semi-retired from computer design and support, which I still do as a hobby when I can. As an ex-biker, I had a couple of personal experiences with inertia and uncontrolled landings, thanks to a careless driver. As a result, I have quite a lot of titanium prosthetic elements holding my spine together. Oh, and a pump administering opioid painkillers directly into the spine, and even a neural stimulator to take care of any extras. That\u0027s the reason I\u0027m semi retired, naturally! It means I have a lot of time on my hands, but not a heck of a lot of it vertical. So laptops (Macbook Pro and Compaq Presario) are my best friends. However, I\u0027ve just installed KSP on my core i5 2.8G system running W7 x64 on a very nice studio setup. So it\u0027s there if I want it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t begin to describe how cool it was to finally understand in my bones manoevers like rotating, rolling, and escape velocity when I fired up KSP for the first time this afternoon. It took me 19 attempts, but in the Kerbal X it all finally fell into place (I\u0027ve flown planes (real ones) before, but not quite as high). I\u0027m still grinning from ear to shining ear!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope to have many accidents, impacts, burnouts, crashes, and just plain fun, and I\u0027ll do my best to add to the \u0022You\u0027re not going into space today\u0022 thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHanks for reading all this crap.
