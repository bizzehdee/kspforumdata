I first downloaded KSP on the day 1.0 was released. I heard about it reading an article by Elon Musk, that he enjoyed this game.\n\nFrom a brand new players perspective, the game is difficult, sometimes frustratingly so, but this is not a bad thing... it means my achievements mean that much more to me.\n\nI make mistakes, lots of them, I overbuild, I am trying and failing to teach myself that less is more.\n\nI tried some mods... but quickly deleted them. I don\u0027t want cheats, I don\u0027t want to make the game easier, the only mod I kept was Chatterer for a while, I am now playing with that as my only mod.\n\nThe largest problem I have with the game is re-starting, ( which is me, not the game ). I restart.... a lot\n\nI started in sandbox... and quickly deleted that game, It was like playing Minecraft in creative mode... no thanks.\n\nSo I tried Science mode ( easy ), got to Orbit, did a Mun flyby, did a Minimus flyby, landed on the Mun, and restarted.\n\nI felt like I was cheating.... so I started a Career mode ( easy ), this was better, but I was quickly right back to having more money and science faster than I could put them to use. I was advancing too fast.\n\nso I started Career mode ( normal ) with a few tweaks, Got all the way to Ike with a lab orbital station later met by fuel a fuel tanker and later by a lander, made it to the surface of Ike .... but I felt guilty about the tweaks.... I restarted\n\nNormal Career mode, no tweaks to the difficulty... and then a release happened that seemed to change everything, my parachutes were being ripped off from G forces, landing even on the Mun became much more difficult ( this is also when I happened to get a new much more powerful gaming rig PC at home. I don\u0027t know what happened but everything that worked before, was failing now.\n\nI restarted again. I felt like I needed to re-learn after that update, or perhaps it was the drastic increase in my PC\u0027s processing power. Health problems kept me from playing for a few weeks, but I am back at it again.\n\nNormal Career mode, no mods, no difficulty tweaks, tonight I will be launching my first Mun lander ( again )\n\nI cant say enough positive about this game, I cannot fly a spaceplane well, and I don\u0027t ever see myself actually landing one, ( the jets I fly I have to eject my command pod with a parachute ) but I don\u0027t want it easier. The charm of this game, is the challenges it puts before you.\n\nI can only play in Career mode, everything else feels like a cheat now. \n\nBut hats off to the KSP team... I am hooked."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T22:46:41Z","Content":"Hello again Dwight, and welcome to the forums!\n\nI replied in the other welcome thread as well.\n\nWe have all gone through the process of relearning the game (three times!) since version 1.0 came out. But it\u0027s all about the learning, right? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI hope you do learn to land a spaceplane eventually. I enjoy building and flying spaceplanes immensely. There is just so much to learn here, and it\u0027s so much fun learning it.\n\nI\u0027m sure you will keep loving this amazing game, and I hope the forums provide much enlightenment and enjoyment.\n\nHappy landings!"}]}
