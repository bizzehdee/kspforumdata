I first downloaded KSP on the day 1.0 was released. I heard about it reading an article by Elon Musk, that he enjoyed this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a brand new players perspective, the game is difficult, sometimes frustratingly so, but this is not a bad thing... it means my achievements mean that much more to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI make mistakes, lots of them, I overbuild, I am trying and failing to teach myself that less is more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried some mods... but quickly deleted them. I don\u0027t want cheats, I don\u0027t want to make the game easier, the only mod I kept was Chatterer for a while, I am now playing with that as my only mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe largest problem I have with the game is re-starting, ( which is me, not the game ). I restart.... a lot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started in sandbox... and quickly deleted that game, It was like playing Minecraft in creative mode... no thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried Science mode ( easy ), got to Orbit, did a Mun flyby, did a Minimus flyby, landed on the Mun, and restarted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI felt like I was cheating.... so I started a Career mode ( easy ), this was better, but I was quickly right back to having more money and science faster than I could put them to use. I was advancing too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso I started Career mode ( normal ) with a few tweaks, Got all the way to Ike with a lab orbital station later met by fuel a fuel tanker and later by a lander, made it to the surface of Ike .... but I felt guilty about the tweaks.... I restarted\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal Career mode, no tweaks to the difficulty... and then a release happened that seemed to change everything, my parachutes were being ripped off from G forces, landing even on the Mun became much more difficult ( this is also when I happened to get a new much more powerful gaming rig PC at home. I don\u0027t know what happened but everything that worked before, was failing now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI restarted again. I felt like I needed to re-learn after that update, or perhaps it was the drastic increase in my PC\u0027s processing power. Health problems kept me from playing for a few weeks, but I am back at it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal Career mode, no mods, no difficulty tweaks, tonight I will be launching my first Mun lander ( again )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cant say enough positive about this game, I cannot fly a spaceplane well, and I don\u0027t ever see myself actually landing one, ( the jets I fly I have to eject my command pod with a parachute ) but I don\u0027t want it easier. The charm of this game, is the challenges it puts before you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can only play in Career mode, everything else feels like a cheat now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut hats off to the KSP team... I am hooked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T22:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello again Dwight, and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI replied in the other welcome thread as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have all gone through the process of relearning the game (three times!) since version 1.0 came out. But it\u0027s all about the learning, right? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you do learn to land a spaceplane eventually. I enjoy building and flying spaceplanes immensely. There is just so much to learn here, and it\u0027s so much fun learning it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure you will keep loving this amazing game, and I hope the forums provide much enlightenment and enjoyment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
