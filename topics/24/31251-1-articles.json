My interests are astronomy, physics, and WWII. I studied much of WWII growing up, learning old Sub sims (Silent Hunter), and ALL the flight sims (Aces over Europe/Pacific, to falcon 4.0) Other than that, I had the consoles to play the usual mario and such, but being a physics/astronomy guy, never really got the \u0022calculation\u0022 intensive release that I kind of longed for deep down (Battlecruiser 3000 A.D. anyone? No?!) Not only has Squad filled a hole in my world that needed planted, they do it with lighthearted humor, and a true support of the community (or is it the other way around?) Ennyway, I wrote the Hotel Hades 2 and 3 mods for Legend of Grimrock, know some LUA coding, some blender for modeling, even some animation (no really, i suck. . .). I\u0027m just poppin in to let you guys know that I LOVE WHAT YOU\u0027RE DOING. N that goes to the Dev\u0027s, and the community. Kudos! I\u0027m gonna be around, may fall enough in love to start building parts/mods, although, from outward appearances, things like mechjeb and MAPSAT are way beyond my skills, I see this going VERY FAR. Squad, if you guys see this, a couple of things, I would say to you from ground level: 1: Keep the humor/disconnect part of it, NEVER take it from this lighthearted, \u0022serious\u0022 fun, to \u0022Serious /Serious\u0022. And B: I think youve reached the time in Dev, that the foundations are laid for the external physics/exploration part (I know, theres SO much to DO!) but I really think, the next step, for these hardcore guys/supporters, is an interior AVAILABILITY. Large command capsules for space station/moon bases, that can be walked around in, EXPLORED. (The current engine would be fine, even. Although a \u0022planted on the ground\u0022 approach would be an awesome start for everyone that you could tweak later) with a couple of consoles that can be interacted with/cause catastrophe for humor. Let em BE Jeb, and Bill. This is NOT conceivable from a dev standpoint, but from ground level, new fan status, what if, one day, I can BE bill, in the command pod, eating the last yogurt, and leaving a note on the dashboard for Jeb. (Use the 1 Person command pod with radial viewports if you dont know what im talking about, in fact, it\u0027s quite blurry, and I may have misinterpreted it. Dialogue welcome on the subject!) So, nice ta meet ya guys, I\u0027m 2 weeks in, and JUST tnite, cracked the nut of how to stage long term missions. You must make a refueling station, in stable orbit, that can refuel your large ships after using so much deltaV to break orbit. You use a space station to replenish before leaving for Jool. I was actually to the desperate length of building 17 stage rockets to pull it off, wasted time, but MANY engineering lessons. ANOTHER great point about this game/community! Okay, I\u0027ll save that for a later rant \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Nice ta meet ya!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T21:36:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad to hear you\u0027re enjoying the game. I definitely agree that KSP has filled a niche I\u0027ve been wanting to see filled myself for a long time. I\u0027ve always wondered what it would be like to build and launch my own rocket into space, and I\u0027ve been a science fiction fan as well since I was very young. I also cut my teeth on some of those older flight sims, although my particular poison was \u003Cem\u003ERed Baron\u003C/em\u003E from Dynamix back in the day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of a more interactive IVA experience has certainly been bounced around the forums a bit, and I think the developers have mentioned they do want to eventually give your Kerbalnauts the ability to move around and interact with elements inside the spacecraft. I wouldn\u0027t worry too much on that front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong-distance missions are fairly simple once you understand that the timing of the mission matters just as much as the rocket you\u0027ve built does. There\u0027s tons of resources on conducting interplanetary transfers listed on the Drawing Board (link in my sig), as well as many other tutorials, guides, and references as well, intended for players of all skill levels. You can also enlist the people over on the How To forums to help troubleshoot specific aspects of design or piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I\u0027d like to suggest breaking any future long messages into paragraphs. Large walls-o-text can be rather hard on the eyes when you\u0027re reading from a computer screen, and breaking your message into small chunks by topic helps give it a little structure and makes it a little easier to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T19:54:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
