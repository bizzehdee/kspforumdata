I can\u0027t play anything else, i stay up until 2am and wake up at 7am to take the kids to school before work. Oh, sorry, my name is Emilio, i am 35, married, two kids, construction company owner, i live in Argentina. I am addicted to KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore the questions, this is how i play: i have Kerbal Engineer Redux, Waypoint Manager, and Kerbal Alarm Clock. Nothing else. KER i find essential, while the other two are convenient. I understand MechJeb does maneuvers automatically, plus some more things, but i haven\u0027t installed it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am playing Career on my first playthrough. It\u0027s a good thing i think, since if i had all the parts from the beginning it would have been mind numbing. I have raided the mun and minmus, set up modular roverized bases on each, set up a nice 5 part space station orbiting Kerbin. I am proficient with rendezvous, docking, understanding WTR and DeltaV, ejection angles, etc. I use the cheat sheet on the wiki for DeltaV planning, and KER in flight assistance for ejection angles and stuff. I have never in my life used the SPH or the runway for more than fooling around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I am planning my first trip to Duna, but i can\u0027t find the minimun WTR needed to lift off from Duna with my return vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Does it make sense to set up a drill and converter on my lander, so that i land with fuel tanks almost empty and generate the fuel needed for return?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I think nuclear propulsion is the best for transfer and orbital stages?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If i set up a drill and fuel converter on the Mun, what is the best way to transfer the produced fuel to a ship? it seems docking in the Mun surface is very complicated, especially aligning docking port height, i haven\u0027t yet figured out a way to dock vertically from underneath a ship . . . Is it even desirable to produce fuel on the Mun? i have plans to keep my transfer stage parked and fueled on the Mun, and launch from Kerbin only my landers and/or payloads, dock with the transfer on the Mun, and work from there. Is this overly complicated? Nuclear transfer stages are pretty expensive so i would like to reuse them if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If i put a drone core and enough parachutes on each section of my booster stage, i can recover those empty tanks and engines. Is there a way to activate the parachutes automatically once those parts reach a certain altitude?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- if i want to post pics on the forums, can i embed them from my dropbox public folder?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that is enough for now! thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T14:02:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum, Tazin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - You can use KER to switch the body that KER is simulating when designing your rocket in the VAB. Select Duna and all the technical readouts (eg, TWR) will change to suit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - It\u0027s a valid gameplay option, yes. But you\u0027ll need to see whether your lander is lighter with the return fuel or with the drill/converter and thus which is cheaper / more efficient overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - The nuclear engines are very efficient, so yes, very good for transfer stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - A lot of people use the Klaw to \u0022dock\u0022 on the surface, but beware the Kraken. Alternatively you can use KAS/KIS (mods) to connect pipes between ships. Minmus is considered a better option as a refuelling base due to the MUCH lower DV required to get to/from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 - Don\u0027t know\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 - Don\u0027t know; imgur albums are supported by the forum though which is what most people seem to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a fantastic trip to Duna!

Just click the button that says Kerbin and set it to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether taking a drill makes sense is part of the mission planning.

It\u0027s not usually efficient to integrate it into your ship (although it can be if you are doing a lot of biome hopping). However, if you plan to leave it on the surface for future missions then I think it\u0027s a great plan. Using ISRU effectively means planning the minimum amount of fuel to reach your destination so that carrying the extra weight of the mining equipment doesn\u0027t get too expensive.

Kerbal Attachment System is probably the most widely used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunching from the Mun is a valid plan, especially if you drop down into Kerbin\u0027s gravity well and give your trajectory a nice kick. Minmus is an easier location to refuel from because of it\u0027s low gravity, you just have to plan a little more to account for the inclination and great orbital distance from Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tazin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tazin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- If i put a drone core and enough parachutes on each section of my booster stage, i can recover those empty tanks and engines.
