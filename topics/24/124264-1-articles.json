I recommend you look into a mod like Kerbal Engineer. It displays all sorts of information to help you build efficient, effective rockets. As with anything unfimiliar, it can take a while to get used to the rules of rocket science. But don\u0027t let that ruin the game for you. As for your spinning out of control problem, use rocket fins or an engine with a gimbal (that information is displayed when you right click on a part in the VAB). Think of it like a lawn dart. When it\u0027s thrown up, it naturally wants to point it\u0027s nose into the airflow. Any stage that is used in the atmosphere is much more stable due to that. Keep at it, and I\u0027m sure you will be a regular von Braun in no time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink to Kerbal Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-4-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-18-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-4-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-18-0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T23:55:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey dude!
