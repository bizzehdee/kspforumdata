I just signed up for the forum today. I have been around for a month or so. I have only put in about 125 hours into the career mode. I\u0027ve made several landings on mun and back and have made it to mars and back. I have only played stock so far but im now thinking about downloading a few mods. I want MechJeb more and more. I\u0027m currently working on docking which I have yet to successfully complete. I look forward to working with everyone here on our space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T17:39:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello rebel4988.
