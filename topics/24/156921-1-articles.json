I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a while now, and only a little recently have I joined the forums. I would say i\u0027m not bad at KSP, but I could still learn some new things, like gravity assists and definitely mod help. I have had some experience with making mods, but it is very limited. I barely know how to make a cfg file for a part!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, nice to be on the forums!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-25T03:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi CompletedPi.
