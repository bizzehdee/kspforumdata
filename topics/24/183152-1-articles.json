This only works on a few small moons but Minmus is one of those. Just* hop in the air, give it forward thrust, and keep thrusting \u0022up\u0022 to clear terrain. Whenever you\u0027re in a safe moment stop thrusting, switch to map mode, and check your trajectory. Once it starts looking like an orbit you\u0027re close, and just need a bit more forward to make it one.
