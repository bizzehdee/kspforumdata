One of the other amazing parts is the community, which is a one in a million type. You can\u0027t really find a single troll or general ass-hat around here, as all seem to respect each other. And this is the first time on the internet, where I have experienced that people value my opinion just as much as theirs, even though I\u0027m only 16. This forum is so fantastic, also because people tend to do something out of their grammar, and what they write, whether they are 50 or 13. That\u0027s a genuinely rare thing today, especially on the internet, so welcome to your new home my fellow Kerbal, better wrap yourself in a blanket and secure the seat-belt, because you are in for a long ride.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T21:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I take my interest in space a little overboard.
