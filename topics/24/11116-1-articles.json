Simple, but effective.\n\nso just a good half hour ago i tried something ... Look at the image..\n\nThree tanks on a radial coupler, but each tank is separated by a stack decoupler...\n\nI figured it would make a lot of sense... it didn\\\u0027t .\n\nI should have seen it coming, but the second I tried to decouple tank 3 from 2, they collided and exploded. \n\nHowever, it does make a lot of sense... Once a fuel tank is exhausted, jettison it for less mass and still keep the same engine propelling you with another tank. \n\nanywho, i\\\u0027ve got my next idea in the works to link each fuel tank separately by radial decups to the main thrusters but link them with fuel lines to the tank below.. We\\\u0027ll see how that goes..\n\nI will enjoy being a part of this sim and community.."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T16:17:29Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nHappy Launching!\n\nArrr!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T16:24:03Z","Content":"I don\\\u0027t see how your fuel lines could get to the next stage.
