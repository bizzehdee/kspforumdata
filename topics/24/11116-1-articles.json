Simple, but effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso just a good half hour ago i tried something ... Look at the image..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree tanks on a radial coupler, but each tank is separated by a stack decoupler...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured it would make a lot of sense... it didn\\\u0027t .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should have seen it coming, but the second I tried to decouple tank 3 from 2, they collided and exploded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it does make a lot of sense... Once a fuel tank is exhausted, jettison it for less mass and still keep the same engine propelling you with another tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanywho, i\\\u0027ve got my next idea in the works to link each fuel tank separately by radial decups to the main thrusters but link them with fuel lines to the tank below.. We\\\u0027ll see how that goes..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will enjoy being a part of this sim and community..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T16:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T16:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t see how your fuel lines could get to the next stage.
