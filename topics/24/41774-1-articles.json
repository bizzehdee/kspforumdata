My name, or rather my internet handle, is Dinjoralo. So far, I\u0027ve managed to get three kerbanauts to the Mun, only for everything but the command pod to blow up, leaving them stranded. Then I sent a rescue vehicle, only for it to be really far away from the landing site, leading to one kerbal dying on the way and me decommissioning it. I\u0027ve also got a satellite around Kerbin, which I am sure will be of no use to anyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oEutVSR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oEutVSR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also can\u0027t figure out how to change my signature, and I seem to be locked out of changing my avatar, so if anyone could help I\u0027d appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xiphos","CreatedById":60680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T15:45:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi and Welcome! Congrats on your accomplishments! Precise landings take lots of practice. Try to use F5(quicksave) and F9 (quicksave reload) so you can try the landing again. (A good place to get practice doing precise landings is on minimus, because you can use the same ships to get there and the gravity is low so landing is easier) Also, when you get 5 posts, you can change your sig and avatar no worries. Also, that docking port in the picture is on backwards....Happy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-09T15:51:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2013 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Xiphos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T20:17:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the forum figures out you are not a spam bot, those features will be unlocked.
