So I\u0027ve tried it but for now I\u0027d like it to be a bit more realistic to make the game harder !\n\nThus, I looked to the Realism Overhaul addon. However, I had some problems when installing the Realism Overhaul plugin for KSP v1.0.2. Installation was done \u0022by hand\u0022 by placing the files in the KSP/Game Data file.\n\nMy question is : **Which plugins are you using to make Realism Overhaul working properly on KSP 1.0.2 ?**\n\n**Without using CKAN.**\n\nI\u0027ve downloaded the plugin Realism Overhaul v10.0 alongside with it\u0027s dependencies :\n\n- The Advanced Jet Engine v2.2.0 for KSP 1.0.2\n- CrossFeedEnabler v3.3 compiled for KSP 1.0 (which is the latest release I\u0027ve seen)\n- The Ferram Aerospace Research v0.15.3.1 (up to date version) compatible with KSP 1.0.3\n- Kerbal Joint Reinforcement v3.1.4\n- Module Manager 2.6.6\n- Module RCSFX 4.1\n- Real Fuels v10.2 for KSP 1.0.2, I assume ?\n- Real Chute v1.3.2.3 for KSP 1.0.2\n- Real Solar System v10.0.1\n- Smoke Screen 2.6.3\n\nSome previous versions of Module Manager (v2.6.1, v2.6.3, v2.6.5) were included in some plugins too.\n\nPS: I\u0027m running the KSP 1.0.2 on a windows 64bits. Realism Overhaul seems to stop the game when files are still loading.\n\nI\u0027m completely stuck with this so any help would be highly appreciated !\n\nThanks !\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T22:30:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 10:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by niubi**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T05:09:19Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums, niubi!\n\nI personally don\u0027t use Realism Overhaul myself, but I should probably point out to you that Realism Overhaul isn\u0027t really aimed at newcomers to the game. My recommendation is to start with fewer, simpler mods, and get a more substantial feel for the game before tackling RO.\n\nIf you do insist on getting RO to work, you should probably ask for help in the official thread, as the users there would be more knowledgeable about your issue:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99966-1-0-2-Realism-Overhaul-v10-0-2015-167](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99966-1-0-2-Realism-Overhaul-v10-0-2015-167)"},{"CreatedByName":"niubi","CreatedById":147242,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T09:44:58Z","Content":"Thanks for the feedback."}]}
