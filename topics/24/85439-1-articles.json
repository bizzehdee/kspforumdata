Loving the new career mode. The science part was a bit of a drag early on but now I\u0027m starting to get contracts that give me a decent amount of science too it\u0027s picking up, and the contracts provide a great way of getting in to the game as you need to think about how you\u0027d test each part which gives a fairly good progression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What I hadn\u0027t realised is what a massive time sink this thing is, I\u0027ve been glued to it for hours the last few evenings \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My tentative steps so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPretty much reached the limit of science I can achieve on Kerbin and in orbit with EVA observations, ground samples, temperature readings and mystery goo, I\u0027ve been trying to land in different places every time for soil samples but not sure if I\u0027ve covered everywhere.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBuilt a vertical launch (no wheels yet) jet plane which has been very useful in performing contracts to test stuff in atmosphere (parachutes, decouplers, engines etc), and with 4 radial chutes I can recover it intact so it doesn\u0027t cost me much.

Craft or debris that are in atmosphere (not on ground or in vacuum) are automatically destroyed about 2 km away from your active vessel. This includes craft on suborbital trajectories that are not in focus. (Note that there is a quirk (bug?) of the game that allows orbits of non-focused craft beyond 2km from active vessel with periapse above 30ish not to be destroyed or encounter aerobraking despite technically being within atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least one mod (I think there\u0027s another if you search around) allows recovery of non-focused stages and craft provided they have parachutes and/or fuel and engines capable of landing themselves: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Squad is adding a few more Kerbal characters in the next update, so hopefully a friendly Chris Kerman will come along some day (along with customizable Kerbals, maybe?): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.shacknews.com/article/86391/kerbal-space-program-introducing-administration-building-to-career-mode\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.shacknews.com/article/86391/kerbal-space-program-introducing-administration-building-to-career-mode\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterFister","CreatedById":85686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T18:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPigpiling: StageRecovery, mentioned above, is a very great mod, and it\u0027s designed to work hand-in-glove with another mod by the same developer, Kerbal Construction Time. On both of those mods, the learning curve SEEMS a lot steeper than it is. Backup your savefile so you can revert as with any mod, but after a few launches it really does become very intuitive.

If, however, you wanted to actually \u003Cem\u003Efly\u003C/em\u003E both stages of an aircraft, the closest I\u0027ve seen is with a mod called FMRS, found at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292-0-24-2-Flight-Manager-for-Reusable-Stages-(FMRS-v0-2-00)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292-0-24-2-Flight-Manager-for-Reusable-Stages-(FMRS-v0-2-00)\u003C/a\u003E. Currently being explored by YouTuber Tyler Raiz, it\u0027s a mod that \u0022splits\u0022 your quicksave. First you pilot the primary / payload stage to orbit, initially allowing your secondary / spent stage to crash and be destroyed. The mod saves your progress with the payload, reverts back to the stage separation, and you then take control of the spent stage (while your payload crashes.) When you\u0027re done, the mod merges the two versions of progress into a new quicksave and loads it, so that your end result is two stages, manually controlled, safe and sound. Quite genius, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T19:03:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe urge wears off after maybe 6 months to a year.

Drogue parachutes make SSTO rockets a lot easier because they reduce the descent-rate to 40m/s or less before you need to fire the engine for final landing. Just aim for ~4,800m/s deltaV instead of a standard-launch 4,500m/s, so that you have fuel left for de-orbit and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA T30 can\u0027t SSTO much of a payload (roughly 1.1t) with the approach above.
