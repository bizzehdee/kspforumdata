The second one was the rough copy from the wiki. I was not satisfied with its power, so I built Serious **** MK3, the three-staged one. This one is less maneuverable, but provides moderate takeoff, enough fuel to mess around with on the orbit and the landing stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I tried landing on the mun for the first time. In fact, I did, but everything except the command pod was just a little bit disintegrated (was too lazy to kill the horisontal speed). I have also performed a mun slingshot around the sun twice, both times accidentally (the second time I had a chance to get to Kerbin again, if not for Space Kraken). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is the question: how do I get my takeoff stage to activate its parachutes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-19T20:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Ascimator and welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll want to make sure the chutes are not in a stage with stuff like engines, and that they are above most other things, usually they will automatically go in the stage with the command capsule, but if that is not the case, you can drag them from wherever they are in the VAB or hangar side bar to another stage, you can even add a new empty stage in the VAB or hangar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to put mine at the top of the stage list so they are always the last thing to activate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascimator","CreatedById":41138,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-19T20:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have dragged them in the stage I am decoupling, but when I decouple it, they do not seem to activate, neither if I put them in the stage the corresponding decoupler is in.
