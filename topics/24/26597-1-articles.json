Am truly impressed with the scope and potential of this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that bothers me is this: I have really much trouble handling atmospheric flight. Even if I copy really simple jet plane design (two tanks, a tailfin, delta wings, canards, and the control thingy, Sas? And of course landing gear and engine), after takeoff, I have really much trouble handling the plane. I mostly tried flying with keyboard, and even tried joystick, but even on fine controls, and when the plane is inherently pretty stable, controlling the plane is diabollicly hard. If I look at videos from other people, the seem to handle their planes pretty good, rolling with ease, landing smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it just me or is there something else to it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played more than a few flight sims in my days, and handling a plane in a game is normally not completely impossible for me, but this game is putting me really to the test. Does somebody has some thoughts or advice?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T00:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game\u0027s current aerodynamics system is a placeholder with many flaws and weirdnesses, and while it is possible to build stable planes, it\u0027s rather difficult. One thing that helps enormously is including the \u0022avionics\u0022 guidance piece. It\u0027s made especially for aircraft, and is a sort of fly by wire assist that helps smooth maneuvers and hold heading/altitude. It does need to be turned on with the T key to call upon SAS mode, though.
