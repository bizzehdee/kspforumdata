This is a very cool game which consumes a lot of my time and my thoughts even I don\u0027t play it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been a Minecraft player for a few years and I\u0027ve administered a mid-sized server. But now, the hype on Minecraft has passed away... Time to go to new fields of exploration !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI came to KSP by watching Scott Manley videos, through Elite Dangerous playlist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell time to blast some kerbals !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been to the Mun twice, to Minus three times and managed to send a double mission to Duna and Ike. I\u0027m waiting for my Sun Explorer to come back and while waiting for an Eve window, I decided to plan some sort of Jool-5 challenge of my own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m planning to build a big refueling station around Laythe (because it\u0027s nicer...) bring some orange tanks along, a station tug, and a passenger return vehicle. I plan to have 5 landers (all are SSTO) to be capable multiple missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe full mission will fire 12 rockets which shall go by their own to the orbit of Laythe and be assemble there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m quite bothered with my Tylo lander...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I want to build a SSTO capable of gathering basic science. Trucked from the space station by a dedicated tug, it will have fall (let\u0027s hope for a controlled fall...) from orbit and get back to be trucked again by the tug to Laythe station for refueling and debriefing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy basic design is a 15T, 6000 d-v ship with 2 LV-N engines. I used 4 LT-2 landing struts because I failed to master the cubic struts trick. I added a material bay and a goo canister. The Tylo-TWR is 1.02 up to 2.17.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think this strategy is viable ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx for the help\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T18:46:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6000m/s for a Tylo landing and ascent is going to be marginal, especially with such a low initial TWR. Are you sure it need to be SSTO? It\u0027s much easier to make a two- or three-stage lander for there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T18:50:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes I know, maybe I\u0027m too greedy for the first Jool visit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T19:59:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaha, awesome.
