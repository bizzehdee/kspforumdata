This is a very cool game which consumes a lot of my time and my thoughts even I don\u0027t play it.\n\nI have been a Minecraft player for a few years and I\u0027ve administered a mid-sized server. But now, the hype on Minecraft has passed away... Time to go to new fields of exploration !\n\nI came to KSP by watching Scott Manley videos, through Elite Dangerous playlist.\n\nWell time to blast some kerbals !\n\nI\u0027ve been to the Mun twice, to Minus three times and managed to send a double mission to Duna and Ike. I\u0027m waiting for my Sun Explorer to come back and while waiting for an Eve window, I decided to plan some sort of Jool-5 challenge of my own.\n\nI\u0027m planning to build a big refueling station around Laythe (because it\u0027s nicer...) bring some orange tanks along, a station tug, and a passenger return vehicle. I plan to have 5 landers (all are SSTO) to be capable multiple missions.\n\nThe full mission will fire 12 rockets which shall go by their own to the orbit of Laythe and be assemble there.\n\nBut I\u0027m quite bothered with my Tylo lander...\n\nSo I want to build a SSTO capable of gathering basic science. Trucked from the space station by a dedicated tug, it will have fall (let\u0027s hope for a controlled fall...) from orbit and get back to be trucked again by the tug to Laythe station for refueling and debriefing...\n\nMy basic design is a 15T, 6000 d-v ship with 2 LV-N engines. I used 4 LT-2 landing struts because I failed to master the cubic struts trick. I added a material bay and a goo canister. The Tylo-TWR is 1.02 up to 2.17.\n\nDo you think this strategy is viable ?\n\nThx for the help"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T18:46:22Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!\n\n6000m/s for a Tylo landing and ascent is going to be marginal, especially with such a low initial TWR. Are you sure it need to be SSTO? It\u0027s much easier to make a two- or three-stage lander for there."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T18:50:53Z","Content":"Yes I know, maybe I\u0027m too greedy for the first Jool visit."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T19:59:28Z","Content":"Haha, awesome.
