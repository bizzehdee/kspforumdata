To find where your KSP install is located, just right click on KSP in your steam library and click properties. Go to the \u0022local files\u0022 tab and click \u0022Browse Local Files\u0022. I myself just made a shortcut to this folder on my desktop for easy access. This folder is the exact same as the one in the KSP Launcher so all mods are compatible regardless of the store used to purchase it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T10:53:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESteam places KSP in a folder located in C: Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\Common\\Kerbal Space program. Since Steam is not required to run KSP, it is recommend that you copy the Kerbal Space Program folder to another location on your computer, doesn\u0027t even need to be on the C drive, open the copied folder, create a shortcut icon to KSP.exe, and place that shortcut onto your desktop. From there, you can add mods to that copy leaving the Steam version untouched so it can be updated automatically. You are allowed to make as many copies of KSP that can be placed anywhere, even on other computers, so long as those computers are for your own personal use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T11:37:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe installation chapter of \u0022Induction To Construction\u0022 tells you where Steam puts KSP, recommends copying it out of there (as SRV does above) and explains how to get and install mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany people have more than one KSP install so they can use different combinations of mods and/or keep a stock version as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
