I have been playing KSP for the past week and i quite enjoy it. I was searching for some good addons and downloaded a few. I have been trying to land on the mun, and i once almost made but crashed at the last second, so i checked for some addons which would help, then i came along mechjeb. I have tried to use the autopilot but each time, it would say that it has engaged but the rocket would always fly out of control \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.

I seems as it if mechjeb is not providing any control inputs to correct the flight direction. I added a rcs fuel tank with 4 rcs thruster pods. I attached the mechjeb pod on to of the command pod, with a parachute on top. Is there something i am doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grand Lander","CreatedById":31521,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T12:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eas long as there isnt too much weight on one side of the craft.
