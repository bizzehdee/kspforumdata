Recently I bought it after it was brought to my attention once again and I\\\u0027ve been playing for around a week. I\\\u0027m still not very good, but the main problem I am having is controlling my rocket once I am in the air. I know about the SAS modules and all that, but I\\\u0027m talking about an issue I am having due to the ability to move the camera. If I were to press W while flying, the rocket will turn away from the camera. However, if I were to move the camera to get a better look at, say, the Mun, pressing W would now turn the rocket in the same direction as before, but not away from the me as it had done before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can make controlling it rather difficult after moving the camera. Am I missing something, or is it not currently possible to have the rocket turn in respect to camera position?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ping111","CreatedById":8679,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-22T04:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECamera is for pretty pictures.
