Newbies like me are faced with a very steep learning curve so a lot of help is needed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I have landed on the Mun 7 times (the last 4 were successful, the crews survived the first three attempts but weren\u0027t going to be going home in the lander they arrived in so those flights were reverted). I have sent a probe to Eve and several to Duna. I am currently working on a Duna lander (the first attempt did reach the surface but \u0022landed\u0022 doing something above 300 m/s due to having run out of fuel early in the descent). Eventually I want to land Kerbals on Duna, and, if they are lucky, return them to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T18:59:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome, Cool name! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun and always remember, if something doesn\u0027t go wrong, your not playing right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T01:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!
