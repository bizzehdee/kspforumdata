My name is Blake Gates (obviously \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ) and I\u0027m pretty new \u0027round these parts. And loving every second! I first heard and read a small amount of information about KSP a couple months ago, and never really paid any mind to it then. Which, as I\u0027m finding out now, was a huge mistake. But, in hindsight, I didn\u0027t really have the time to dedicate to gaming or anything of the like because my RL business started to pick up big time at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, I am absolutely loving KSP. I bought it last week because of a number of reasons. One being that someone I follow on Twitter mentioned something about it and then posted a picture of this crazy contraption setting off into orbit. I saw it and thought to myself, \u0022Wait! That looks *bleeping* amazing! Man, I read about the game but wish I would\u0027ve explored it more!\u0022.... The second reason being was because the next day I happened to hop onto Steam after not firing it up for quite sometime. A friend of mine told me that the Summer Sale was going on and they had some really good deals (as they always do). So, never-the-less I fire it up and what is the very first thing I see at the very top of the page? Yep! Kerbal Space Program only 12 bucks! Thought to myself, \u0022it\u0027s time. I gotta have it now\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd boy, I absolutely do not regret that decision to buy it. I have had more fun in the last 7 days (well, the time\u0027s I could play in that time frame at least lol) than I have had on a game in a long time. I mean, yea, it\u0027s still labeled as a \u0022game\u0022, but Holy BeJesus, it\u0027s so much more than that! I\u0027m a huge fan of anything space and astronomy, it is something that has absolutely fascinated me since I was a wee little boy. In fact, for a very long time, and really the reason why I haven\u0027t fired up Steam in a long time or have really played any other games, was because about a year ago I came across an MMO PC game set entirely in space called \u0027Eve Online\u0027. I am still a die-hard Eve Online fanboy and play it consistently and talk about it quite a bit, but up until now, there has never really been any other games out there that really caught my attention and have kept it and will keep it (in terms of my newly-found drug, KSP lol) like Kerbal Space Program and Eve Online. Funny as hell they are both based around space. I just can\u0027t enough of either game. It\u0027s nice having dual monitors so I can engineer and build rockets, planes, rovers, landers etc. etc. on one screen, while running my space corporation and alliance in Eve Online on the other lol... Just glad my beautiful fiance absolutely loves my complete and utter nerdiness lol \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anywho, enough of my ramblings. I am so glad and actually fortunate to be a part of a community like KSP\u0027s to learn from and share ideas with and enjoy such a great game that these fantastic developers are working and have worked so hard to create. I look forward to many more discussions with anyone and everyone, and letting you know I\u0027m here to stay!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee everyone in space!
