It\u0027s a lot more scary and confusing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a question, I\u0027ve downloaded Mechjeb and a tutorial on how to get into orbit around the Mun, but when I open Kerbal, the tutorial doesn\u0027t come up! It\u0027s currently in my downloads folder and I\u0027ve unzipped the file. What do I need to do to get it to appear?
