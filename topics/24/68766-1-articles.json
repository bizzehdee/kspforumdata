It takes around 4,500 m/s to get orbit for instance, 900 to break free of Kerbin and then 2,700 or so to get to Jool. These things I got from playing the game too much but there is a map of these values ssomewhere as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need a mission goal, return from Duna, land on 3 of Jool\u0027s moon\u0027s and return, rove in a buggy on Eve etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you need to build with a certain amount of delta v for each stage and then go do it.
