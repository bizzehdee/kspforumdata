I\u0027m only 14, and am quite interested in physics, mathematics, and astronomy. As for creative work, I play music and make pixel art from time to time. I\u0027ve been playing KSP for something like half a year, but I definitely haven\u0027t done as many things on it as I would like to. I\u0027m also a brony. So yeah.
