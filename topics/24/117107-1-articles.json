I\u0027m Tiberium and i am completeley hooked on KSP. A friend of mine introduced me to it some months ago, but because he could never got to orbit, i thought all you could do i launch rockets... that blow up. Later i found some youtube vids and got interested... a whole galaxy to explore. Turned out, my friend did not have the patience to learn to get into orbit! Now here we are... few months later and i am building my first mun colony!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T22:02:10Z","Content":"Yes, there\u0027s more to the game than launching rockets that blow up before reaching orbit. You can also launch all kinds of ships that blow up before getting to all kinds of places, planets, and moons. \n\nWelcome to the forum. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T22:19:25Z","Content":"Yeah I\u0027ve blown things up all over the place."},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T00:21:52Z","Content":"Hi, welcome to the forums! I also felt more combined in my early days of KSP than I was. (One example; I didn\u0027t know that you had to be going fast to the right to get to orbit for a while, so all my flights were either sub-orbital or escaped Kerbin. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T03:52:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E i thought all you could do i launch rockets... that blow up.\n\nI know a lot of people who still enjoy this style of play. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nWelcome to the forums!\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
