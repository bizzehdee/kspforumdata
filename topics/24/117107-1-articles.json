I\u0027m Tiberium and i am completeley hooked on KSP. A friend of mine introduced me to it some months ago, but because he could never got to orbit, i thought all you could do i launch rockets... that blow up. Later i found some youtube vids and got interested... a whole galaxy to explore. Turned out, my friend did not have the patience to learn to get into orbit! Now here we are... few months later and i am building my first mun colony!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T22:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, there\u0027s more to the game than launching rockets that blow up before reaching orbit.
