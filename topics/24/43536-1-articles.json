I was so excited I started installing it right away. The first problem I had to solve (other than configuring Xorg for the Nvidia driver) was that I suddenly had no audio... After getting really complicated with my attempts to fix that I finally realized I needed my user to be in the \u0022audio\u0022 group. I should have remembered that from setting my laptop up... Apparently people have lots of audio (especially Intel audio driver) problems after installing GeForce cards (HDMI sound does funny things I guess), but I seem OK now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I downloaded KSP and started it up (the 64 bit Linux binary).

I spent about 10 launches blowing up since there didn\u0027t seem to be any rhyme or reason to how the booster rockets expended fuel.

Very strange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went back to the build stage and looked at the thing for a while until I figured out that the fuel tanks were attached to each other in such a way that they should empty in a certain order, except that the little pipes weren\u0027t symetrical at all. I must have somehow broken that while turning the thing about or something(?) So I reloaded the thing and then I was able to launch.
