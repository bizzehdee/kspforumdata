It is the spirit of adventure to travel to other worlds on the whims of science. To explore and fly and build limited only by your own imagination, the dev\u0027s are building a core experience so loved: people devote hundreds of hours building and flying their own creations into the unto told depth\u0027s and hundreds more hours building mods to make that experience even deeper. This is what is defining a new generation of creative entertainment and even charity work. the names now associated(at least that i know any way) HOCgaming, Scott Manley,Macey Dean, EnterElysium, Thor LP, Shaun Esau, Heretic391 , Kurtjmack, so so many others who make this a entertainment vessel filled with information about how to play better and build bigger longer funner missions. The charity events are amazing i have never heard of getting so many so very young people involved in the global problems. the recent CharityWater live stream event Broke it\u0027s expected Goal three times! raising over 9000.00 Dollars US$ ! in five days! This game is something i promote actively to my friends and family, (there are five sales that i know for a fact happened because of me.) you know another player when you overhear \u0022my next space mission\u0022 and then spend hours talking about thruster to weight ratios, DV, Playload allocations, failed moon missions and rescue effort\u0027s for stranded Kerbals.(which happens a lot) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Has the feeling this game will do more for promoting space travel than the moon landing by simple constant engagement of the populace. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplus we now have a chance of knowing what the heck scientists are talking about when they talk about space mission\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T01:26:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
