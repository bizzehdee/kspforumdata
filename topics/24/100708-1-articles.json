How the heck could I get an SSTO to eeloo much less Kerbin escape\n\nit\u0027s actually quite doable if you refuel in orbit. And of course not landing the entire SSTO also helps. A few designs that come to mind:\n\nMkII or MkIII spaceplane with LVN atomic engines and a cargo bay containing a one or two-man lander: fly it to orbit on a combination of airbreathers and rocket engines (possible the nuke engines if you can manage it), refuel and use the nukes to go interplanetary. Go apollo-style with the lander and you shouldn\u0027t have too much problems ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nrocket-style SSTO that uses a couple big powerful engines to push a lander to orbit (the SLS-type engines come to mind), refuel in orbit, use nukes to get to eeloo and again do an apollo-style landing and return to mothership in orbit.\n\nNever say a thing is impossible! It just hasn\u0027t been figured out yet ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T13:05:26Z","Content":"I endorse the lander in a cargo-bay idea.
