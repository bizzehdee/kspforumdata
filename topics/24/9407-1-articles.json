(i have buddies at both places that could easily get me a job). in game i have landed on the mun with vanilla parts with one ship, then i made a new one that had an ion thruster, heat sinks, uulage boosters...8 and lunar lander mods (before .14 was released) and made it there and back, nowadays i am trying to figure out how to make a cool yet successful mun rover with the newer mod KSP cart, i haven\\\u0027t played with it too much, just some on kerbin experiments\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-10T02:50:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Twinky827","CreatedById":17455,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-10T02:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECOLORADO FOREVER WOOT!!! - Welcome I live there too, except in Denver.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"R4TCHET","CreatedById":21763,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-10T04:15:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBorn and raised right here in boulder. i have always loved it here... no i am not a hippy lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-10T04:53:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELead trumpet, eh?

My highest note was the D above the D above the staff (6 lines above the staff) and that was at the end of Dancing Men by buddy rich during a performance. in The Longmont Allstars we played a lot of old school easy dancing swing songs. we would however play very long sets ~3 hours, 4 was our longest and we always ended with \u0027in the mood\u0027. Im not playing this semester however i will be next semester, i have not lost my range but i have absolutely lost all my endurance. i am thinking about minoring in music, but im still not sure if i want to deal with the extra work load. don\\\u0027t worry... i will still play in jazz if i dont minor in music \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei totally think my trumpet (\\\u002776 E-Benge professional jazz trumpet) was a lot of the reason i could play high... not only could it hold on to notes way up there where other trumpets i played on couldn\\\u0027t, but it would help keep them in tune too. when i first started lead i went from a 1.5C mouthpeice (i know... it hurt a lot), to a shilke 11A4A which is a pretty average lead mouthpiece my, then senior year to a bobby shew lead mouthpeice which was the most shallow thing in the universe but had amazing tone quality for a shallow mouth piece and really just expanded my endurance so i could play higher for longer, the old lead in allstars had one and told me to get one because we started switching off songs my junior year and his senior year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eone of the reasons i was so good senior year is because we didn\\\u0027t have any good players the class before us, so my friend and i were forced to become section leaders junior year which is when i first started lead (we weren\\\u0027t bad though). we had 5 trumpets, 4 alto sax\\\u0027s (i think) 2 tenors, and 1 bari, 3 trombones(1 kid played bass trombone), and a hand full of kids in the percussion/guitar section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s. i could go on for ever lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-11T08:56:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, when you\\\u0027ve got a small, shallow mouthpiece like that, range gets a lot easier. I personally play on a customized Conn 1.5C; it\\\u0027s had its throat touched up on a lathe a bit, so not only does it have great tone in the lower and mid range, it also makes high-range playing really nice.
