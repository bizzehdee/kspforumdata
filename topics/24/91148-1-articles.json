I started playing KSP with the demo version and eventually got the official game on 16th September 2013 (I was playing 0.21 at the time). I haven\u0027t been as far as Dres or as close as Moho so I\u0027ve still got some planets and moons to see. I\u0027am currently trying to get to the Joolian system with it\u0027s 5 moons. I do play with mods, such as the Visual Enhancements (which is currently my favourite mod), but I usually just play without mods. I\u0027am also trying to get better at creating planes, however, it is very tricky because I think I need more lift. I would love any advice you have for building better planes and getting to Moho, Dres and further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll enjoy my time here on the forums with the awesome KSP community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E .\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T18:46:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard and good luck with getting to Jool, it\u0027s an incredibly fun place to navigate, plan flight routes, and take screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"damburgah","CreatedById":130046,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T21:11:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey EvilPanda! Good luck getting to the Joolian system. I\u0027ve never been to Dres or Moho myself, but hopefully I\u0027ll get some Kerbals out there one day. As far as plane design goes, I think you\u0027re right, increasing lift usually helps at getting off the ground.
