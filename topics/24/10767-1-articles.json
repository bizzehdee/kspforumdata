Now this made me even more exciting for discovery.\n\nAfter hearing this, I also had an idea which might be cool to be implemented in the game. Though I don\\\u0027t know on which subforum to post it.\n\nCould someone let me know where to post \\\u0027game feature\\\u0027-idea\\\u0027s?\n\nRegards,\n\nCrunch0r the Dutch rocket-scientist!"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T04:07:50Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nHappy Launching!\n\nArrr!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager"},{"CreatedByName":"Trekkin","CreatedById":23636,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T05:11:33Z","Content":"In response to your question, feature suggestions go in the development board.\n\nI\\\u0027d search first, though, to make sure someone hasn\\\u0027t suggested something similar.
