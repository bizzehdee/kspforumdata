I am not a very experimented rocketeer, but i already did some things I was proud of (first orbit, first munar landing, put probes on every planet/moon orbit and finally first docking)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most \u0022impressive\u0022 (experimented players are allowed to laugh) thing i did was a probe that went to jool, collected science in high orbit and low orbit of every moon and finally crashed on jool to study it\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost pityfull : Never landed a plane. Even without FAR... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thanks go to Squad, the community (WE are awesome !), and the creators/maintainers of the mods i use (FAR, Deadly Reentry, TAC life support, procedural fairings, Kethane, SCANSat, Kerbal Engineer Redux, RealChute) and the mods i will use in the futur (can anyone recommend another mod ? Maybe you can guess what kind of mod i like from the one i use - mainly realism - I am also looking for a good mod for the creation of a planetary base, i found some but they where outdated).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and sorry for my bad english, i am french (this nearly explains that).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T08:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour English is fine, and despite claiming to not be very experienced, so is your piloting/shipbuilding.

No need to be experimented to do that : i didn\u0027t know how to dock or how to use maneuver points. I had luck with easy intercepts within the jool system, though (got Tylo and Vall while trying to go to Laythe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost complicated thing was to put that out of kerbin\u0027s SOI (as always ?). That was without any mods (don\u0027t know if i my ship would have done it with deadly reentry, for exemple)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hardly consider myself experimented : i learned how to dock only two weeks ago (it took me a whole sunday). But now that i know how to dock, the universe is mine : i can do anything i can imagine !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sesni","CreatedById":50625,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T13:11:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Champ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Champ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost pityfull : Never landed a plane.
