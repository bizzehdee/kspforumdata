My friend showed me this game last night, and as a boy who used to dream of being an astronaut I was instantly hooked. I\\\u0027ve played Orbiter before, but this game seems more \u0027user-friendly\u0027 and doesn\\\u0027t end up scaring you off with all the hard science all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also am greatly drawn to the rocket design element in addition to the actual flight element. Makes you feel like the NASA scientists from the 50\\\u0027s and 60\\\u0027s. As an occassional CAP Aerospace Educator this program could serve as a great tool for teaching cadets and adult leaders alike and I will definitely spread the word.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I\\\u0027ve accomplished reaching a stable orbit, deorbit burn, and splashdown. Now I just need to work towards landing on the Mun. I think I\\\u0027ll go the Apollo route and work on getting my transfer and a few orbits first before working towards an actual landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-04T02:14:03Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2012 02:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Kaufman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt0570","CreatedById":13414,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-28T06:38:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe best way for me to transfer orbit to the mun is to orbit west(take off heading right). and get in a stable 100km orbit. when the mun rises, burn prograde until your apoapsis is as high as the mun\\\u0027s orbit. You should see your orbit change to show the next semi-orbit around the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-28T17:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
