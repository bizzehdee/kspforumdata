I decided to actually introduce myself after putting a post up about a really bad SSTO (lol). basically i am pretty crap at ksp, so naturally i decided science mode was the way to go to learn. lets just say... it is difficult. currently i have a kethane scanner around Kerbin and the Mun, and planning a probe lander for the Mun (i really need the science lol)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips to get me going in science mode?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T02:52:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome, bgrif59! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas for your question, Minmus. Lots of easy science there. Get lots of science from every biome. Then move to the mun. Theoretically you can max out the tech tree with just that. But after that go for duna, and then eve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bgrif59","CreatedById":80103,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T07:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!

The transfer takes a little more delta-v (about 50-60 more usually) and you have to do a plane change in Kerbin orbit. (First off, set minmus as the target. If you don\u0027t know how to match planes with the target, there are lots of good tutorials, both on here, the wiki, and on youtube) Getting to orbit around minmus takes a bit more finesse that it does on the mun. Landing, however, is much much easier. Your orbital velocity is less than half that of the Mun, therfore slowing down for landing is much much easier. And once you\u0027re near the surface, if you kill all velocity, you have ample \u0022float time\u0022 To make corrections. Taking off to orbit is simple enough, and returning is also simple. It takes just as much delta-v to return to kerbin though, so I reccomend either escaping Minmus and orbiting once to apoapsis, and then making the burn, or you could be ambitious, and try your first gravity assist. Use manuever nodes, so you can plan it out. Use the node to lower your kerbin periapsis to the Mun\u0027s orbit. You want to come in just ahead of the mun, so that you escape the mun across the light side. With some tedious maneuever node work, you can get a perfect return trajectory for a lot less delta-v than just burning home. Either way is your choice, it all depends on planning. I can look up some tutorials and give you links to them if you wish. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
