Just crashed on the moon though so I figure I\u0027m up to speed enough to join the community, so hi!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunny theory I\u0027ve got about planet kerbin, there\u0027s only 2 space centers and nothing else on the planet, yet there are a ton of kerbals. To me that means they\u0027re entire civilization is based on space travel which is pretty awesome if you ask me. This theory goes down the drain when they enhance Kerbin later but for now, their entire evolution and civilization progression has been devoted to becoming space travellers (note they have no unmanned missions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T19:11:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Potato and welcome to the KSP community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongrats on reaching the Mun, you now just have to work on your landings \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like your theory, I think it\u0027d make a much better game if the whole civilization was working towards space travel, rather than just a government or two, we\u0027ll have to see how things pan out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T19:13:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Potato","CreatedById":38798,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T19:32:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, also wanted to thank KSP for getting me to review my physics notes.
