We\u0027ve successfully put three manned vehicles into orbit and returned them! Well, the vehicles, anyway. Well, 2/3 of them. Currently Caldos Kerman is out on, shall we say, an extended EVA in orbit around Kerbin at 86km, while his ship, the Please Don\u0027t Explode II, holds course at a very, very different orbit. I\u0027m afraid he was out sick during jetpack training, so it\u0027s entirely his fault. We\u0027ll rescue him once we feel like he\u0027s learned his lesson.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, we\u0027ve also successfully executed an orbital rendezvous in order to rescue some other sad sacks on the three-man orbiter mission Please Don\u0027t Explode Again, which ran out of fuel burning retrograde to return home. Since there was an empty seat (Our third man had decided to test the theory that he could survive an EVA re-entry to Kerbin*), Jebediah Kerman successfully EVA\u0027d from one orbiter to the other mostly just for fun and to bring over some snacks. After realizing that proper planning would have involved sending only one Kerbal and two empty seats on the rescue mission, and then trying to physically ram the stranded vehicle out of its orbit and failing, we remembered it was equipped with a full RCS system and could thrust retrograde long enough to re-enter the kerbosphere. Everyone made it home safely, and they all had a story to tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I would say our experience now fully justifies a Mun mission. Onward and upward!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Footnote: EVA atmospheric re-entry is surprisingly survivable, despite the scary-looking flames. The surface impact, not so much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jjwb22101","CreatedById":64078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T21:40:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPermission wholeheartedly granted! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T22:04:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
