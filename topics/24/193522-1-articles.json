Landing in Minmus is routine by now, so it was time to send a crew to do surfacebased science on Minmus. The flight, inclanationburn and\u00A0trip to Minmus were\u00A0a breeze, just like the landing. I set up the groundscience with my scentist present and then went to sleep since the groundscience takes some time. I like keeping my Kerbals on the surface for more then a day anyway and dont use timewarp when I am landed somewhere. But this morning i had a bad awakening. During the night my landed spaceship drifted in to the experiments somehow and exploded. Killing the two kerbals on board and leaving my scientist stranded alone on Minmus. Now I\u00A0noticed that\u00A0spaceships glide a little bit after landing ore even rotate very slowly. Did not take that to serious and saw it as a gameglitch.
