There is work being done on them to bring them up to date and actually become more helpful, but that is going to be a ways down the road with more focus being on upgrading to Unity 5 and related projects. In the meantime, Youtube is a fantastic resource for getting pointers, and if you do have KSP on Steam, there are groups there to join in and find players to give you help as well. It should be said, though, to not go in blindly. Sadly, Steam is vulnerable to hackers and the like who take over gamer\u0027s accounts to scam you for your own and any info you can give to aid them fill their pocketbooks. Unless you know them very well, act warily if you get asked questions that should not be asked. Common sense aids you in this, do not ignore it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I suggest practice, practice, practice.

But that doesn\u0027t mean a little help now and then is not to be passed on. Scott Manley and kurtjmac are two folks I definitely recommend.
