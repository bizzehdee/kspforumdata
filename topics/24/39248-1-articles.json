Rendez-vous and docking manually are something that take far too much time and effort from me to make me consider building 10\u002B launches for a station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, the reason for my coming today on these forums is that I have a nasty problem that seems to be mod related, but that I can\u0027t uite figure out, so I posted it in the mod section, hopefully at the right place.
