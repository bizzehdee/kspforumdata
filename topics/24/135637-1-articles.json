Not that I haven\u0027t wanted to before now; it was just real life, if you know what I mean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was introduced to it in a funny way; I\u0027ve been a long-time Orbiter player and write S-F in my spare time.\u00A0I\u0027d frequently ask the fora I frequent science-based questions about space ships and technology-mainly concerning the physics and math; \u0027Is this realistic?\u0027 was the common theme.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne day, I was asking about spinning a ship to provide artificial gravity and as luck would have it, an argument erupted among several highly skilled members. One of them inserted a video to make his point: a video of a long, segmented ship spinning enough to provide .5G at its ends. I was intrigues, and asked what the sim was: KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it was pretty, but I wasn\u0027t really interested; I was hooked on the realism aspects of Orbiter. However; one day I\u0027d heard enough about it that I decided to try it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fell in love instantly; those little green guys are hilarious and it\u0027s a much, much different challenge from Dr. Schweiger\u0027s sim. Unfortunately without the internet at the time (and without a whole lot of other things), I didn\u0027t have the resources to get it but continued to have quite good fun with the demo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI must say; I got extremely good at one particular maneuver: carpet-bombing the Space Center when my horribly-overbuilt rocket ripped itself to pieces a kilometer up. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m back in a time of life when things are good again; I have security, work, home, etc. and can now enjoy luxuries; and KSP is pretty near the top of the list.

I manage to find something that it seems I just can\u0027t do, and headbang until it flies like a dream. I have yet to go to Moho, Dres, or Eeloo, and I\u0027ve not visited all the moons of Jool, and though that challenge calls me I find the time involved in lining up the transfer windows a put-off. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Someday I\u0027ll get bored by Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus, maybe, and I\u0027ll try to go out there again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EOh!

My initial attempts were - as Starwhip said - based around \u0027bigger is better\u0027 which, since my computer ain\u0027t your average supercomputer, slowed my performance to a crawl. (A\u00A0first stage made from 18 6-tank rockets surrounded by 30\u002B solid rocket boosters...not so much a first stage as a first bandstand.) A second with 9 8-tank rockets \u002B 2-tank droptanks; a third...well, you get the picture. All to support either a single-stage lander/return vehicle or a capsule plus separate lander Jeb would have to EVA to reach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecently, I\u0027ve been sending Jeb out with a much smaller, sleeker vessel with just enough fuel to get to high orbit over\u00A0(insert rocky body/confection of your choice) and perform a retro burn that brings the capsule to a perikerbin altitude of 36 Kms. Then once he\u0027s in a 1K orbit and safely playing Kribbage, I\u0027ll launch a second craft with an empty lander and a Stayputnik bolted to the nose. 2nd. ship RV\u0027s with Jeb who climbs over, undocks and jettisons the probe. He then makes his landing, plants his flag, has fun, runs out of MMU fuel, slides down a mountain, has to trudge back to the capsule for two hours, eats, and lifts off to RV with the first ship. Jeb floats back over, floats back to the lander, grabs the keys he forgot, returns to the first craft, boards, waves bye-bye to the lander and burns for home. He has just enough gas to enter the atmosphere; he has to slow down in a series (usually 4) of aerobrake dives. He uses his last traces of gas to deorbit (one of the primary reasons the ground crew stocks the capsule with dehydrated beans for the return journey) then ejects the last engine and enters. If I time it right, I can land pretty close to\u00A0KSC - my personal record is about 10m from the flagpole at the center of the complex.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup - I can\u0027t wait for the full game; but the demo\u0027s plenty fun too! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-04T13:48:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2016 01:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by NorthernDevo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
