My problem now is I have no idea what to do! I go to the Assembly building but there are no parts to build with, I go to the plane hangar and still no parts to assemble, and then I go to the Academy and I can not manipulate any of the astronuts. I am running a MacMini with extra memory installed and all the software types match the install criteria. Am I missing something? I tried to go to Youtube but the tutorial says that I should have parts to build with???
