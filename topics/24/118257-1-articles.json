I\u0027ve put a few satellites into orbit, come inches (probably literally a few times) from death flying spaceplanes and crashed countless craft. Currently I\u0027m attempting to orbital rendezvous and dock my first 2 craft. I tried once, but wasn\u0027t able to get the orbits lined up and ended up putting my 3rd satelitte into orbit. Also, I have a pending application to Sparrowhawk Aeronautics, hopefully I get accepted (PLEASE TELL EORIN TO ACCEPT ME PLS PLS PLS).\n\nX9 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nP.S. \u0022Please don\u0027t crash...\u0022 is probably my most said phrase in the past few weeks, \u0022DANGIT\u0022 being the second.\n\nEDIT: I\u0027ve been accepted into Kerbal Minds Corp.
