As for the wings, the fact that they made your craft harder to control is proof enough that they actually do work - as they did have an effect. Wings produce lift, but whether or not they\\\u0027ll help or make your craft unstable will depend greatly on your craft and where you place them. I\\\u0027d suggest taking a look at the \u0027How to..\u0027 section of the forum, lots of explanations there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-11T12:54:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
