I\\\u0027ve stumbled onto this little gem through friends and being a massive space-buff (both sci fi and actual real exploration) instantly fell in love. Slight problem though, I\\\u0027m travelling South America at the moment and all I carry in computing power is the absolute cheapest netbook I could find. (think 1ghz atom processor, 1gb ram of which 512mb is shared video mem). Still I soldiered on at relativistic framerates and have now landed a stock rocket on mun. It\\\u0027s been one way missions so far since landing in any kind of non explosive way at 1/2fps is really really difficult \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E At least the kerbals survived in their little pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunny anecdote, the other day I was in a very bumpy bus ride from Medellin to Bogota (lots of mountains in the way) and tried to build and launch a rocket. I now know what being jeb feels like on every mission since with every second bump in the road i\\\u0027d accidently press some wrong buttons (mostly igniting and seperating booster stages at the wrong times). That was funny and I laughed.
