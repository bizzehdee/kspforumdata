I\\\u0027m so excited to have joined the space program. I always knew I had a knack for spaceflight, and was pleasantly surprised when I was able to reach orbit on my fourth launch, with my second rocket design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy third design (from the vanilla options/kit) allowed me to enter a planetary orbit (orbit around the sun) with a little help from some slingshotting. That crew is still out there, I guess. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the sixth launch, with that same design, I was able to enter a close orbit of the Mun. I managed to get into a very low (650m / 20km ) eliptical orbit that provided some great mountain-top-skimming action on the close approach. I achieved this orbit with only a TINY bit of fuel left, though, so my choice was either stay in orbit forever, or allow my kerbals the honor of being one of the first kerbal-made pockmarks on the Mun. I chose the latter, of course!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-20T20:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jirikisunta","CreatedById":14824,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-20T23:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I did it. Landed on the Mun and then back on Kerby, alive, all with just a two-stage rocket. Was kind of amazed at how manuverable and well-powered my 2nd stage was. Posting a pic of that build. It uses parts from the pack that has 3 full rockets including a Saturn-type with an Altair moon lander. I, however, just landed in an Altair rocket, sideways (very slowly).
