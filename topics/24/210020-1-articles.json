It\u0027s a pleasure to be here. I do not usually join discussion forums, maybe half a dozen throughout my life and far fewer than that have I participated in the forums but I wanted to document my Kerbal experience here as KSP is one of the few games I have really been able to enjoy. most games I get bored of, lose interest in or just fall away from before I\u0027m close to even a 1/4 of the way through yet over the last decade I\u0027ve started and restarted KSP half a dozen times, getting as far as fly-by\u0027ing or orbiting the Mun a couple of times but never landing on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time I focused on career mode, rescuing\u00A0 45 Kerbals in various orbits, launching 4 space stations, 1 mun base, capturing a C class asteroid with a fuel mining station into Kerbal orbit, creating 2 AWESOME ships (I\u0027m very proud of lol) within my fleet of vessels and AND... having the entire tech tree unlocked after hopping around the Mun and Minmus during one mission thus gaining enough science points to open up the last half of the tech tree. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022^_^\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 title=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a gamer I\u0027m happy to have found a game I can enjoy so much, I love gaming but it\u0027s so hard to get attached to any game for more than a few hours before falling away. =,(\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy current mission is to take a tour with all 48 Kerbals in an attempt to level them all up, I can\u0027t see any reason to upgrade the scientists as I\u0027ve already unlocked everything in the tech tree but the engineers I very much want upgraded as my next objective will be to design a new ore scanning probe and lander, a new ore mining platform as well as a fuel transport\u00A0 craft with the knowledge I gained capturing an asteroid with a mining station. By the time i had my 2 piece mining/fuel station \u0022tower\u0022 constructed on the asteroid... I had mined all the resources!! Not gonna lie that was kinda a bummer lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell this was just an introductory post, my post with pictures on my \u0022most current and most dedicated play-through\u0022 will be posted at a later date, hopefully within a month. I look forward to scanning the forums for stories, tips and especially pics of the amazing ships and vehicles the Kerbalnauts of this community have lovingly built. See you... out there... =P\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-07T06:37:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/223177-bigemugamer/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022223177\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/223177-bigemugamer/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bigemugamer\u003C/a\u003E!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:happy:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/happy.png\u0022 title=\u0022:happy:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-07T07:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy no pics of the two proud ships?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rutabaga22","CreatedById":221143,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-07T11:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome!

I just plumb forgot I just joined this forum last night! =D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I want to upload my progression in a very detailed but not overly verbose post with lots of nice full-graphic-options-on pictures you can really sink your teeth into P= I want people to see the progression of my space program and the ships I\u0027ve created in order to achieve getting as far as I did, I REALLY really enjoy this game and I want to share that and have people see how much this game means to a gamer like me who has a hard time connecting with games anymore. And just a little teaser I\u0027ve saved mostly all the main, prototype and/or historic vehicles I\u0027ve created so I think It\u0027ll be a cool little story line guiding the reader through my own unique play style.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I *promise \u003Cem\u003E(*Disclaimer, promises not legally binding)\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027ll get that thread up an running soon, I\u0027ve already taken pics a week ago of the early research phase of my space program and that was about half of the pics needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell...
