I\u0027ve been playing KSP since October \u002713. I\u0027ve been to most of the planets now though I haven\u0027t returned from all of them. My career consists mostly of getting there and crashing or getting there and then running out of fuel on the return. I love this game and it has really renewed my passion for space. My latest accomplishment has been orbital rendezvous and docking. My latest failure was building a Jool ship to explore the system and drop and retrieve probes on each moon. Everything was going well except I should have checked on the launch pad to see if I could undock my probes. Nope. Now I\u0027m just going to skim the space near each moon, do the science, and return home. Can\u0027t wait for .24 to start career all over again! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T21:04:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
