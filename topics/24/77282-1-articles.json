Thankfully I made an Alt\u002BF5 save prior to my burn, but still....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere should I go from here? What would be good things to practice to become proficient at IPT?

Interplanetary is just more of the same, Hohmann transfer and lots of messing-about with the nodes to get an intercept.

Fly YOUR space craft and show you how to do specific things, like transfers to moons/planets. Rendezvous and Dock with YOUR vessel, that YOU made \u0026lt;always better to see how YOUR stuff acts in these situations rather than something another player has made\u0026gt;. With that being said, it also provides valuable information on your vessel, TWR, DV, Orbital Information and the like. Yes KER can do that last part, but, in the scheme of things, you will find that automation along WITH that information is more useful, especially when you end up being FORCED to babysit a LONG burn on nuclear engines because you had no automation, because you chose to not use MJ.
