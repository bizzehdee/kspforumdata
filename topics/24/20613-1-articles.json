The miner I landed successfully but the pilot is still stuck up there and I want to get him back. But since trying this Challenge every lunar lander I have made to try to rescue him has failed miserably. The miner could return to earth it has a chute and enough fuel, but I want it to stay there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rockets I tend to make end up heavy and take 3 hours to turn from retro to pro-grade. And on landing I just end up running out of fuel and crashing to my dismay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips or designs that you have found helped you with this task?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KxLVT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KxLVT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Miner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KbeIb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KbeIb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jJWLk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jJWLk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESatellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1370w.png\u0022 alt=\u00221370w.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ViA5v.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ViA5v.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krackit","CreatedById":21101,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T23:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found that building \u003Cem\u003Eoutwards\u003C/em\u003E rather than \u003Cem\u003Eupwards\u003C/em\u003E helps my bigger rockets fly fairly stable, and once it gets to the proper height for turning, enough weight has been shed that it can gently fall to the side without taking ages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shini","CreatedById":38080,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-28T07:07:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks I\u0027ll give that a try!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
