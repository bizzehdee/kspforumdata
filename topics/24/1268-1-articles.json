I\u0027m a sheep shaggin\u0027 Welshman with a passion for launching green men on nearly-always suicide missions into space. Usually into space. Sometimes at 200m/s towards the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had an interest in space exploration, specifically NASA and ESA since I visited Cape Canaveral a few years ago and basically learnt everything I know about the history of the space program. Right now I\u0027m dismayed to see the ISS with its days numbered and no prospect for a future space program, because I really do believe we can make it to other planets if we put our minds to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thought I\u0027d register and stop lurking to give my opinion on some things and join in the Kerbal chatter. ;D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you round the forums, I guess!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVolt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. to the forum mods, I was a little annoyed at the rather tight password regulations: \u0027Your password must be at least 8 characters long, contain uppercase and lowercase letters and digits.\u0027 My password should really be my choice and I\u0027m more likely to forget it because I\u0027ve had silly restrictions put on it. This is just a forum really, not the NATO network or something. Not trying to sound mean by the way, it\u0027s just password restrictions really get my back up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-31T19:39:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
