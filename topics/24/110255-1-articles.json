I am a hardlined PC Gamer from Boulder CO. I get a fair share of outdoors, dosed with countless hours in front of my LCD Gods. I go fish for an hour come play KSP for 10. lol\n\nI recently picked up KSP after following it and wishlisting it for some time. I must say, this game is beyond anything I expected or have gotten from a game in a number of years (and my steam library is over 200). \n\nThe community is great (modders and not), the Devs are on point. And again the Game is simply amazing. \n\nI now have an understanding of the core concept regarding Orbital mechanics, (TWR, Delta \u0027v) introductory aerodynamics. All without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars! \n\nOutstanding. \n\n\\*shuffles back to work\\* ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T16:27:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 04:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ninjahgoblin**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T16:33:04Z","Content":"Don\u0027t forget to become an active member of the forums!\n\nAnd don\u0027t forget the chutes!\n\nWelcome, you\u0027ll enjoy your time here."},{"CreatedByName":"Ninjahgoblin","CreatedById":144438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T16:41:27Z","Content":"Thanks I will!\n\nAny one who mods this game should immediately become a member of the forums.

I do a number of techniques. My favorite right now is spin fishing with a Fly on a 6ft lead with wet bobber. Pistol Petes kill it.
