When I drop off the bombs/gliders and switch control to them, why does the gimbal start all screwed up? I have to right click control from here on the guidance unit in order to get the thing right. It makes no sense. As soon as I switch to the unit I CAN control it, the gimbal is just off by like 90 Degrees in 2 directions and some of the control keys are reversed. Makes no sense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso once the bomb gets a certain distance from the plane I can no longer switch back to the plane, even if I go into the map view. Whats up with that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know my audio commentary track is a little bit off here in the video, I am still learning how to edit!!! If you guys have any feed back let me know.
