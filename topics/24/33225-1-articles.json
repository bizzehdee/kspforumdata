I looked at it, noted that it was 33% off, and then decided to, on a whim, check to see if Nerd Cubed had played it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it turned out he \u003Cem\u003Ehas\u003C/em\u003E. Not only that, watching him play it was like watching everything I have ever wanted from a sandbox game about building spaceships. It had me fascinated. My background in physics and my obsession with spacey sci-fi kicked in, and I was instantly drawn to click \u0022Add to Cart\u0022 as aggressively as one can click without breaking one\u0027s mouse. Whereas many indie games make grand claims and end up coming short, this freaking game has had me glued to my computer screen, even more fanatically than FTL did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here I am. Five hours into it and having achieved my very first successful orbital vehicle, I realized I had a problem. It wasn\u0027t the first vehicle I made that made it into orbit. . . it was just the first one that made it there with any fuel to spare. Unfortunately, I completely forgot to add a parachute, so there will be no re-entry for poor Jebediah. That, plus the fact that I am sure he is bound to collide with one of the five other things I have floating out there in roughly the same orbit, leads me to my newbie question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way for me to save Jebediah? While emotional attachment to my very first successful Kerbalnaut may be part of the equation, I\u0027m also ready to jump in to the more hardcore stuff that I\u0027ve seen people do. If you can build a space station, you MUST be able to go up and snatch a poor Kerbal from the jaws of death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo: Help me save ol\u0027 Jeb! What pieces do I need on my next re-entry-capable vehicle do I need to save him? (This is assuming, of course, that I am able to get the vehicle there. I think I can.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T15:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
