My suggestion would be that you try something like the stock game before using such radical mods. Although it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Epossible\u003C/em\u003E to treat KSP as a sci-fi \u0027space\u0027 game where you jump into any old ship and blast away to another star that\u0027s not really it\u0027s strength. Rather, it is a game which rewards finding out how to design, build and fly spacecraft starting from pretty basic.
