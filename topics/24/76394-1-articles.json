When landing, learn how to use the retro marker on the navball and how to keep your orientation centered on it using the WSAD keys and no RCS. As you slow down under 10m/sec, keep orientating to the retro marker until it becomes centered to a vertical decent. When you can keep it that way descending at under 5m/sec, you will have eliminated most of the horizontal drift that will flip your ship upon landing. This will take practice but will soon be second nature. Once you have mastered landing on the seas of Minmus, you will find landing on the more uneven surface of Mun with its higher gravity much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on Minmus with tons of fuel left;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bsOBUav.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bsOBUav.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanded on Mun with a probe not designed for landing;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kz3WA4a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kz3WA4a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDemo ship landing on Mun.
