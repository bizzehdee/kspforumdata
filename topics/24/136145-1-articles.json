Without seeing yours I can only guess, but it sounds like a drag force problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is drag at the top of your rocket, and drag at the bottom. The drag at the top of your rocket makes it want to flip over-- the drag at the bottom makes it want to fly straight. You can visualize it by thinking of your rocket as a broom, with the bristles representing the payload at the top. Drag force can be approximated by adding weights to the broom at the top and the bottom with lengths of string. If you pivot the broom around its center of mass, all of the weights will remain pointed straight at the ground. The weights at the top are going to try to force your broom to tip over. . .the more it rotates, the more rotational force is added. The weights at the bottom have the opposite effect. They will try to keep the broom from tipping.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat was happening to me (and I assume to you as well) was that the attached boosters were adding a significant amount of drag to the bottom of the rocket. I lost that drag when I dropped them, and suddenly the drag at the top of the rocket wasn\u0027t balanced, and it gradually overwhelmed the rocket\u0027s steering ability (or \u0022control authority\u0022).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solutions are to add more drag to the bottom of the rocket, reduce the drag at the top, add more control authority (reaction wheels, RCS, winglets, whatever) or just slow down a little bit. Drag is especially nasty right as you approach terminal velocity (the mach effects on the rocket are a clue) so if you\u0027re shedding your boosters right as you\u0027re breaking the sound barrier, that\u0027s probably a big part of the problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet us know any if that helps or not, and if it doesn\u0027t\u00A0a picture of your rocket would help enormously.
