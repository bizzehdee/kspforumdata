If you have a laptop/computer, KSP is always good there, as it allows easier modding and the like, and less peasantry. But I won\u0027t name you as a peasant, as you seem to be a pretty cool guy. Especially since you can spell. Hope you have fun, and if you\u0027re looking to be involved more in the game \u0026amp; it\u0027s community, such as Rocket Builders, Spacecraft Exchange and the forums that generally tend to show screenshots and craft download links, then laptop/PC is you\u0027re only way, but I won\u0027t go on too much to you, I hope you like it here and have fun! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T05:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!
