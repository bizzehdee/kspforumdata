Enjoy being an active member. It adds quite a bit to the experience of being on the forums. I used to lurk in order to find answers to my gameplay questions, but after I joined the forum became a lot more for me.

Already have incorperated the Orion logo from Nasa into my flags, as I\u0027ve been a big follower of this last launch. Doing this is a lot like being up there. Yes, although I\u0027m 40, as a kid being an astronaut was my dream. I too am also from Ohio, and can\u0027t wait to see the 1.0 version release. Hopefully they will do something with the aeronautics of the game once you enter the atmosphere to make it a bit more, realistic. Right now, every plane is like pushing or pulling a brick with a motor, and fails to respond correctly... as for the rockets, loving every minute of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T21:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard Finox!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
