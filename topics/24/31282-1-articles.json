Is it possible to put just a few animals in game to serve the great kerbal space program, like there was in the old days, with the Russian dog Laika or the american chimps they used on unmanned orbiters, they dont have to look just like they do in real life, they could be more kerbalised \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E, and even is possible have a few in capsule animations like our astronauts, the dog could for example lick the camera or the chimps could pick their nose , etc etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain tks for this great game, love it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T12:14:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can post your idea in the KSP Development forum, but before read what not to suggest list. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T19:41:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MajorThomas","CreatedById":94499,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T18:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like a good idea for a mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d make a large \u0022probe\u0022 module (allow remote control of the spacecraft and rocket) that contains a special Kerbin animal, and you see an image of it during flight similar to the Kerbonauts.
