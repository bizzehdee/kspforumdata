Been having a blast.. quite literally with KSP. No questions or anything, just giving a shout out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I have 3 satellites, 2 of which stopped working because I didn\u0027t know about batteries. I have debris all over the place from my \u0022Master Exploder\u0022 space initiative. and have finally crash landed 2 Kerbals on the Mun.. no, they didn\u0027t survive. I feel my \u0022Wat Me Worry?\u0022 program is doing better with only one Kerbal stranded in the Mun\u0027s orbit.. I am working on sending me \u0022Kill Bill\u0022 team to someday fetch him.
