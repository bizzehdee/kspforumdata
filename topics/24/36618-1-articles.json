And then I found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/Robbaz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERobbaz\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s KSP videos and boy he sure makes me laugh \u003Cstrong\u003Eso hard\u003C/strong\u003E! I LOL (seriously) when he crashes but the Kerbal lives and he says \u0022Success!\u0022 hahaha!!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I\u0027m quite happy to have found the forums. I\u0027m sort of biased to multiplayer games as i have always thought that was the only way to really randomize certain circumstances or to engage in heated battles that you can\u0027t predict... But KSP has shed new light on the idea of turn based gaming since people share saves. I think it kind of brings everyone together in a way that is unique from other games, but then the game is so awesome itself you can\u0027t help but be addicted!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m new to my 30\u0027s but KSP is like when Doom II came out for me! I haven\u0027t done much more than dock once despite multiple attempts and land on Minmus. I also realized recently that the game is most enjoyed when you have a mission plan (I write mine down) and follow it through more than just one setting. It took me a while to realize this, but now I am orbiting 3 planets and I love using the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/remotetech-3/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERemoteTech\u003C/a\u003E mod and watching all the satellites talk to each other. It\u0027s very interesting to me in what I have been learning and figuring out related to sending up ships to match orbits but then Kerbin has rotated so your polar orbits have different headings.. I\u0027m just an I.T. guy so this is all new to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoving EVERY SECOND of this! Well worth the money, too bad most people I know don\u0027t have the patience for a game like this as I sure could use a nearby friend who likes this and iRacing.com (you should see my triple monitor and cockpit setup, but this is the wrong section for a post like that.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xiphos","CreatedById":60680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T12:09:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022knotbeer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022knotbeer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI haven\u0027t done much more than dock once despite multiple attempts and land on Minmus.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!

Anymore.... BUT it took me some time to figure out what I was doing wrong. My first issue was with RemoteTech command pods, I didn\u0027t realize how to get the signal from Kerbin out to my probe, so I would inevitably run out of contact as I left the Kerbin SOI. Interestingly enough, when I did figure out how to use the sat dishes, I kept forgetting to open the solar panels and then I was running out of energy. After many trials, I have landed a manned craft on Minmus, but only through the use of a manned capsule. My intent is to have a fully operational interplanetary communication network, and add at least one comm base on each planet prior to building a manned colony. I have never attempted a return flight, so that is likely next. I have to start learning how to accurately determine my landing site, aiming for it correctly, and also working out the bugs in my own flight plan as related to necessary craft that I have not accounted for; such as docking ports for satellites that I may want to dock with prior to returning to Kerbin... In the future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also don\u0027t know how far to go as I\u0027m excited to see the release of KSP beta version 0.21 so I\u0027m just biding my time. I do have a question about stock parts, but I\u0027ll post that in the proper forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily I started browsing through the forums and started learning how to accomplish so much of what I am reading about so now most of my questions are answered and I just have to muster up the time and brainpower to build a rocket that can do what I ask. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T18:28:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
