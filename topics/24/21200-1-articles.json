I discovered the game last week after a colleague showed it to me, and I fell in love with it! It\u0027s simply amazing, and it manages to make orbital mechanics look really cool!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a Ph.D. student in astrophysics, so maybe I am biased a little. However, I can tell you this little game made the last few days much more bearable than they would have been otherwise! You see, I\u0027m currently in Hawaii to do some observations for my thesis, but the weather has been absolutely horrible. Instead of rolling my thumbs, I used those long hours to send Kerbals to Mun instead! And I can\u0027t wait to explore the rest of the system!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis fall, I\u0027m one of the teaching assistant for the Classical Mechanics class at my university. I\u0027m seriously considering giving them the challenge to get to the moon an back with the demo. That way they\u0027ll get a much more intuitive grasp of the notions we\u0027re trying to teach them! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thanks to the makers of this little gem, I hope you will have much success with it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T12:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, Kulzar!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat does sound like a very good idea, KSP is an excellent (and fun) teaching tool for the basics, or even sometimes the intricacies, of orbital mechanics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you enjoy your stay at the forums. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulzar","CreatedById":53515,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T13:39:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the welcome!
