There are two things you can do to simplify it.\u00A0\u00A0You can leave the inactive ship parked so that its docking ring is perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. That maybe he hard to visualize, but what it means is that from the perspective of the approaching ship, the inactive ship\u0027s docking ring will be rotating in a stationary position, making it easier to hit. But that won\u0027t help if you\u0027ve already got the ships positioned. So the other trick is to from time to time go in and out of time warp. This is a cheat because it breaks the physics simulation, but it makes docking easier because it cancels any unwanted rotations of the target ship. My advice would be to save the game, try to dock, and keep loading the save until it works.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceman.Spiff","CreatedById":209133,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-02T18:04:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224027129\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204639\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221630567268\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212999\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Elon Tusk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Elon Tusk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was doing science on dres, using Apollo style.
