I only made it into orbit on the demo thanks to scouting around Youtube, and am still working on it in the latest version. Well, I was wrong: There\u0027s definitely something to be said for getting an orbit just right, or getting your crew down safely anyway when you realize you forgot the parachute and/or decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was quite a bit smaller I had dreams of becoming an astronaut.
