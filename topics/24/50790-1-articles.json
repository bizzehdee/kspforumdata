I was in career mode, now, I\u0027m not the best at building crafts to land on the Mun, I keep running out of fuel, anyway, back to the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got Bob in kerbin orbit, and prepared a mun encounter manoeuvre and set off for the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a quick (and close) flyby, I decided to put Bob in orbit for a while, and do some experiments, this was risky, as I had very little fuel left, and didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d make it back to Kerbin. I did it anyway, and a few experiments later, I decided to push out of Munar orbit. It required a 250m/s burn, and my fuel was likely a little over 140, this burn would put me on a direct landing course (or collision course) for Kerbin, and it was the only way. So I burned in the hope that maybe, JUST MAYBE, i\u0027d make it.... 100m/s burn away from hitting the course and bam, the fuel runs out, I\u0027m set to orbit Kerbin, but not land... until I remember, I fitted those little radial thrusters to the side, a little blast from them and I got set back on course! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy writing doesn\u0027t do it justice, I just felt so happy to get Bob back to Kerbin, after an albiet sticky landing (my landing struts were on a different, now jettisoned stage) I got myself some science and headed back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love this game, best \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A318 I\u0027ve spent in a while!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T12:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to Welcome Aboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T17:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt will be an even bigger thrill when you actually land on Mun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T22:38:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESoon as you have the parts, land a probe on Minmus.

If you are mindful of drift, which will be indicated by the movement of the retrograde marker on the navball when you slow way down, and counteract it by tilting the probe to match the retro marker, you will not need to use lateral thrusters to stop that drift which can tumble your lander and break off legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FdzWGjm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FdzWGjm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arcadiax","CreatedById":90507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T21:58:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
