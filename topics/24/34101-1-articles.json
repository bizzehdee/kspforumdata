I just stared playing ksp, and I\u0027m enjoying it, although I\u0027m missing a few hair clumps now. I can\u0027t figure out building efficient rockets. Does anyone have any tips on doing so? I calculate all of my delta v, account for weight loss through staging, calculate my thrust to weight, but I still can\u0027t get a lander on the moon. I can get sattelites into orbit, but I can\u0027t find an efficient rocket to get a lander to the moon. Any ideas, tips, or avenues to try?

It is not quite necessary to calculate Delta-V when going to the Mun because you only need ~1km of Delta-V from a 70 Km orbit. That is to get an intercept. Remember you should start your burn when the Mun is rising when in a prograde orbit, but if you have a low T/W, you might want to start earlier. For me, getting better at KSP was a matter of trial and error (My current save name!) and watching youtube videos and tutorials.
