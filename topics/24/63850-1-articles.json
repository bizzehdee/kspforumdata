As soon as I get to about 14k-15k, I get a message saying both Bob Kerman and Shelbert Kerman \u0022were killed\u0022. No explosions, there were no decoupling events, nothing happens except passing that altitude. What can cause both of them to suddenly die like that, with no events?? I\u0027ve been playing this for months and never seen astronauts suddenly die for no reason like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T05:41:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you playing with Asmi\u0027s ELCSS? If not, then find a folder named that in Bobcat\u0027s soviet pack, and delete that.

I do have the soviet mod and mechjeb installed. Those are the only two, and I just installed them yesterday. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried deleting that ELCSS folder but it didn\u0027t help.

With Mechjeb. Then attempt to go to orbit. If that works, attempt your next mod. Unfortunately this sounds like a mod issue and it would probably be better for you to speak with the specific mod maker.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
