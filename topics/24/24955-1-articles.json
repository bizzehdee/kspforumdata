I was pelasantly suprised seeing how much more content the game had compared to the demo! A truly pleasant suprise. Beent rying to launch a satellite in orbit and managed to do successfully so today!

I really like that engine for small course-corrections. Next projects are to bring a satellite in polar orbit \u0026amp; another in a geostationair orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a little question, currently the second stage(debris) orbits Kerbin as low as 30 km, will it eventually get enough drag \u0026amp; crash, or will it keep orbiting?
