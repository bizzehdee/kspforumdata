I\u0027ve been playing Kerbal since the early days on and off. I am an IRL science geek with a love of space, which is why I got into this game in the first place. It\u0027s fascinating to learn some stuff about orbital mechanics and how things really work. Look forward to meeting/playing with some of you. By the way, is there a teamspeak or something of the sort where people will gather and talk while playing?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T01:38:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 01:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RexProcer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:43:31Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums! \n\nI don\u0027t know of a teamspeak, unfortunately."},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:45:23Z","Content":"It\u0027s a singleplayer game, so I don\u0027t think so.\n\nBut you can use the forums!\n\nBTW: Welcome!"}]}
