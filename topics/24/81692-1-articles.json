As many after watching some youtube videos (possibly by some of you) I learned a lot more about the science involved in space travel and manoeuvring and this gave me a boost to want to play more. Fast forward to today and I\u0027m still no expert but am loving every new update and the fantastic MODs the community creates for us to use and play with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started streaming KSP some months ago and this also really helped me improve thanks to all the helpful hints, tips and suggestions the viewers from the community suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m very proud to have been chosen to stream for KSP TV and am looking forward to meeting more of you over the months to come. I may also rely heavily on yuo to help me finally get to places like Jool and Eeloo, something I\u0027ve still not accomplished yet.
