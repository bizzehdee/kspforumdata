I loved KSP and it\u0027s delightful Kerbals\u00A0and had no idea that I\u0027d stick with this \u0022game\u0022 for more than 7 months with 380 hours and counting. I got into adding mods around the 150 hour mark of gameplay, mostly visual mods then. Now I have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, Beyond Home(A work of art if I do say so myself), Restock, and Near Future Systems and many\u00A0others, including MechJeb, Kerbal Engineer Redux, and Fly By Wire for my joystick.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started my KSP experience with very experimental craft, such as pods that rotate with canards instead of using chutes. I adapted to the new way of perceiving space quite quickly once I realized how realistic I could be.\u00A0Once I learned the basics rookie mistakes hardly ever happened again. I still fooled around sometimes, but I remember an integral, yet accidental part of my learning experience happened. I installed Geforce Experience to get some drivers for my GPU, and the Alt\u002BF12 button stopped working. I didn\u0027t realize it at the time, but the Alt\u002BF12 button was bound to something in Geforce Experience and it stopped enabling the cheat menu in KSP. This tested my ability to get to places\u00A0with only my skills and my craft\u0027s capability. My first\u00A0Munar lander was horrendously over-engineered, but it got the job done, except for me breaking the engine upon landing. Bill, Bob, and Jeb were rescued by Val in two trips so it was a happy ending after all. The craft is called the Oak in the steam workshop, and it has a very unorthodox lower stage design. It did work though!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been switching between preferring to build spectacular craft or to explore the universe with my ion probe.\u00A0\u003Cs\u003EYeah, I\u0027m patient.\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0I\u0027ve had to go back to 1.9 to play the Beyond Home planet pack, but it was very worth it.
