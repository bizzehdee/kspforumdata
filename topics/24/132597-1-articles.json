I have a general understanding of a fair bit because I\u0027m an awesome lurker, but there\u0027s one thing in particular I\u0027m looking to learn at this moment.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow much deltaV do I need to enter a geostationary orbit? I\u0027ve read that it\u0027s 2,868 Km, and a cheat sheet I saw said it takes about 4,500 but I find I need 4,500 just to get into LKO. My ascent profiles tend to aim for 35-45 degrees after about 15Km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T04:44:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159001-nukeknockout/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022159001\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159001-nukeknockout/\u0022\u003E@Nukeknockout\u003C/a\u003E welcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m afraid you\u0027re rather outdated then, the way to ascend changed radically in 1.0. I suggest you look up some \u003Cstrong\u003Epost\u003C/strong\u003E 1.0 tutorials on ascending, I know Scott Manley on youtube has a good one. The key is to turn early (once you reach 100m/s) and follow prograde smoothly. You should only need 3000-3500m/s to reach a parking orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe numbers for a geostationary transfer and circularization haven\u0027t changed, though: 800m/s or so for the transfer and apokerb kick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T15:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello Nukeknockout, and welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNathan\u0027s got you covered on the ascent profile.\u00A0 I always assume 3200 m/s to make orbit when I\u0027m designing ships.\u00A0 Glad to have you aboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T15:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like to allow 3,400m/s of atmospheric Dv so it goves me a little spare for flight errors and also to deorbit the last stage (I use stagerecovery).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0060ve heard of people doing it in under 3,000m/s but I have yet to do that myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-23T02:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile it can sometimes make sense to do something like averaging the atmo and vac delta V from the first stage, by the time you\u0027re on any further stages your air pressure is so close to vacuum that you might be at most like 1% away from vac Isp.
