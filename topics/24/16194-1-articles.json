It is capable of landing and returning from ANY airless moon small enough that it\u0027s T/W ratio is greater than 1, and performing an unpowered glide landing on Kerbin (it has parachutes for emergency braking). I imagine it will come in handy for interplanetary missions when .17 comes out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vehicle uses four stock jet engines combined with X 7/9 scramjets for operation up to about 12,000 meters, and then three Aerospike engines for operation up to around 30,000 meters, after that it coasts to a sub-orbital altitude of around 120km and uses whatever fuel remains and all it\u0027s ion engines to achieve orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/tb9e0xr30k68yss/screenshot76.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot76.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/tb9e0xr30k68yss/screenshot76.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot76.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, it makes use of a lot of mods;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectrical Energy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowertech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -DynaThrust Ion engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKosmos Space station parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep space mission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFloodlights\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBigtrak\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovapunch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.5 scale stock parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX 7/9 Scramjet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC7 Aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasterfin","CreatedById":21147,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-06T11:23:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe images don\u0027t seem to have loaded properly, but if you right click on the question marks you can open them in a new window or tab\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nibula","CreatedById":12289,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-06T12:19:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImages dont seem to work and welcome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meritania","CreatedById":36934,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-06T14:25:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to say \u0027wow\u0027 to the concept.
