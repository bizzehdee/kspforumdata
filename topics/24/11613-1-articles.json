I love it!\n\nI have only tried vanilla so far, but I played for about 4 hours total. I had so many launch failures and so many successes. I got to stable orbit, left for the mun, stable orbit there, and returned after about 20 successful orbital launches. \n\nI never imagined I would have so much fun in a space program. \n\nNext stop - full version and mun landing!\n\nSo now I\\\u0027m here to stay, probably going to play very often, optimizing all the time!\n\nKroden"},{"CreatedByName":"Z00111111","CreatedById":21199,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T05:03:59Z","Content":"Just wait until you start using some of the mods.
