I can name all the 7 Mercury astronauts and I\u0027ve watched \u0022From The Earth To The Moon\u0022 HBO series all the way through 4 or 5 times now. I consider myself a veteran PC gamer, going back well over 20 years, by I am only a fledgling rocket scientist (the \u0022bottle rocketeer\u0022 forum title is quite apt). So I totally love this game so far - I am already up over 130 hours since I bought the game after Thanksgiving weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo don\u0027t be surprised to see my noob questions from time to time.
