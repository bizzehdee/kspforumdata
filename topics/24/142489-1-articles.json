I can get a screenshots of the ship I built if anyone is interested.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI \u00A0am going to be working my way through some ideas for ships but primarily I am going to play in Sandbox or science mode. But will give the career mode a go at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah I also want to build a space station / satellite network.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook forward to looking at your most interesting designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny mod to the game suggestions or challenges welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the best,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRick\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T19:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum, and the game! First orbit is sweet. Wait until you land a Kerbal on Mun and bring him or her home. That\u0027s an experience right there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you\u0027re wise to steer clear of career (that rhymed AND included alliteration. I feel accomplished!) for the time being. Science Mode in my opinion is a much better introduction to a new player. You are slowly doled out parts as you need them (more or less) but have all the freedom to make your own goals (which you will have plenty of). Career is more for when you\u0027ve met your own personal goals and want to just try things of various challenge levels, and reap the rewards of success. And pay the price for failure. Sandbox is good as well but if you start feeling like there are too many parts, head right back to Science mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want ship ideas, check out the Spacecraft Exchange which has an endless supply of amazing craft, and for mods, it\u0027s hard to recommend without knowing what you like/want/need, so I\u0027ll steer clear of that.
