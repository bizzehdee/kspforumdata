I live in Sweden and I\\\u0027m 19 years old. I have always loved astronomy and everything around it. When I first discovered KSP I was blown away, way out of orbit. It was like a dream comming true. \n\nI made my first orbit around earth today (YEAH!) but it was so out of shape that I almost went in to orbit around the mun! But it\\\u0027s still orbit! \n\nI got so excited that I made a video with my phone calling the mission \u0027ApeX1\u0027 in my head.\n\nAnyways.. gonna try for the mun soon!\n\nOver and out!\n\n//Linus"},{"CreatedByName":"madmat","CreatedById":16054,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T22:27:07Z","Content":"Gday Linus,,Welcome to the neverending calamity that is KSP.
