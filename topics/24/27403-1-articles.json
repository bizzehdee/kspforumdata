I am a long time flight sim fanatic (and this is taking away from THAT hobby! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E) and have been experimenting with the program. I do have some questions though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Quicksave. Is this for only when your currently in the game, or can I quicksave, shut down, come back later and pick up where I was? Seems this \u0022Quicksave\u0022 is unlike any other quicksave I\u0027m accoustomed to. If this quicksave does not behave like others, is there a way to do so? Sometimes my job interferes with my hobby and I cannot dedicate time for a full flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. RCS. Obviously, (from experimenting) I cannot simply add thrusters to the side of the rocket and have them work, what am I missing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I have downloaded, (and successfully installed) several rockets from the site and question what the \u0022author\u0022 was thinking! One is a rocket with a Gemini capsule within it. Rocket does not work properly (unless I\u0027m doing something wrong) when I get into orbit. Not sure what I\u0027m supposed to DO with it! Some rockets are obvious as to their operation, others are a mystery. Perhaps the author should post what their intentions were?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I\u0027m sure there are MANY more questions to come! I\u0027ve been hooked on YouTube videos and such.

Quicksave will do the same thing, but it can also return you to the quicksave point from before the exiting autosave.

Quicksave \u003Cem\u003Ebefore \u003C/em\u003Eextending the legs.
