I have been playing KSP now for about 3 weeks. All I can say is how great it is and how exciting it is to play. I have not gotten into any mods quite yet, so I play with stock parts but with that said since I am a Mechanical Engineering student with an Aerospace minor in the works I can not deny that I have been doing most of the math involved in getting my rockets up out of Kerbin when I feel like it. I look forward to being an active part of the KSP Community now, and even more once I get off a laptop and onto a desktop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T01:02:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of us start learning the math after finding the game, so you have a big headstart. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Welcome to the game, and to the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rampage","CreatedById":97041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T02:53:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, and the great part of it is that I am currently using KSP to study for my Introduction to Aerospace final, so thank you KSP for letting me play and study!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MilkToast","CreatedById":82136,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T06:57:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rampage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rampage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you, and the great part of it is that I am currently using KSP to \u003Cstrong\u003Estudy for my Introduction to Aerospace final\u003C/strong\u003E, so thank you KSP for letting me play and study!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGosh, I wish my classes let me play games to study.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut no, seriously, welcome.
