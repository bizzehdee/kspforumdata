First an orbiting mission, to determine the proper landing sites, and then landing. I crashed it the first time on the night side, but I saw how those rocks glow in the darkness far into the hills and mountains and I was hooked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy way of playing is without mods. To this day, I still have to master docking and I wish it could be made easier. It\u0027s way too complicated and I think it\u0027s a bottleneck for many players that simply leave the games, frustrated. For these reasons, I use large rockets with plenty of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this is an awesome game/simulator and I hope it will stay peaceful. I cringe when I see ideas for wars and weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope it will remain in the field of exploration and science. I\u0027m ok with career mode being opened in the future, as it will open economic aspects, but as long as this stays about peaceful missions, without bad influence of typical games today, it will hold that special KSP feeling we all know and love. It\u0027s good to have such game available. I was dreaming of this since I was a kid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T19:43:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Naten","CreatedById":70923,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T18:37:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.

A lot of players find docking difficult to master, but once you get your head around how it works and what\u0027s required to perform a docking, I don\u0027t think anyone would ask that it be made easier.
