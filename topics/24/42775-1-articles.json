Don\u0027t forget the parachute and stack coupler if you are flying Kerbal command capsule. Do gravity turns on the suborbital. Add a booster to the suborbital ship and go for orbit and recovery. Continue building bigger and better as you extend missions and become familiar with controlling your ship during your missions. Most of all, enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T19:41:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
