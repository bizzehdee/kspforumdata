I have found some videos that helped me find my way into building effective rockets, and I tweaked them a bit to use the lander can as I like those a bit better.... better windows. Currently I do not run mods on the, but I do have MechJeb and Protractor downloaded but I have only used them while practicing and not on my actual missions. I have done 2 Mun landing and a Minimus landing (one of the mun landings and the Minimus landing are on my youtube channel), but I am having difficulty going further. The major problem is making a ship that can both travel to other planets, land, and return without docking. Why no docking you may ask....well short answer is I do not feel confident doing that yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that might be for a different thread.... Any help would be welcomed as I know some have been playing for a lot longer than myself. Also, unless I make a signature tonight, if you want to see my terrible videos I have made so far I will send the youtube link in a message, or post it this thread if it is ok to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI leave you with my very first successful, though awkward, Mun landing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/253/6q0x.png\u0022 alt=\u00226q0x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T04:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore they introduced docking parts, we used to fly multi-ship missions.

It\u0027s A LOT of work, though, especially getting multiple ships to arrive at around the same time.

I wonder if an unmaned pusher docked with a lander might be doable. Basically a probe with atomic engines and lots of fuel to push the lander to the next planets orbit, and the lander docking refueling before returning home.... or planet hop before heading home (Kerbin to Duna then to Eve then to Kerbin). Now I am in trouble as I have ideas, and those can always be bad!

I will also just send up refueling missions once it returns to Kerbin, most likely switch out the crew for other missions and returning the one who landed back to Kerbin. 700NitroXpress on here was kind enough to help me on bettering my design of the lander, and now it is atop its tug waiting to go into space. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59747-My-single-crew-Duna-Lander-in-need-of-help/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59747-My-single-crew-Duna-Lander-in-need-of-help/\u003C/a\u003E is where my lander talk is going on right now, and everyone here has been very helpful showing me how I over planned the design.

I did have to break down and use MechJeb for docking for the time being as I do not feel that confident with my skills yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
