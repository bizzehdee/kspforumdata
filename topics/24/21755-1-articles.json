I made my own OCS, oh yea I didn\u0027t want to use the phrase KSS because I didn\u0027t want to steal someone else\u0027s idea so I call it the Orbital communications station, or for short: OCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there is a certain aspect of the game that alludes my knowledge. I know it may sound stupid, but I can\u0027t get to any other planets or minmus without the help of mechjeb. I really don\u0027t like using mechjeb because I like enjoying the physics part of the game.

I managed to get to duna on my first attempt with no mods.. by sheer luck.. The solar orbit took the ship past duna\u0027s orbit, and I managed to score an intercept on the return leg... barely.. I think the closest peroaposis I could get for the the intercept was like 1.6 million meters.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your like me, and dislike the mechjeb easy mode, I pretty much run a vanilla install except for two mods.
