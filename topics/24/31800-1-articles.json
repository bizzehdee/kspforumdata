I add more fuel but it usually makes the rocket longer and a bit more wobbly. It feels like a never ending battle of adding fuel, which weights down the craft, so ir needs more fuel....etc etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m also hoping to use less propellant for the RCS thrusters as they seem to run out quickly too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Anyways, glad to be here, and I hope to have some flags planted soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Margaul","CreatedById":69414,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T05:04:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at some of the tutorials on the wiki site.
