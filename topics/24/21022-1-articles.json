Full version is definitely worth it. If you like the demo, the stuff currently in alpha make it well worth the money. Considering the cost vs the entertainment time, I am glad I got it early.

However the good mods all sort stuff by folders that you just need to copy contents into the matching folder in ksp. Is very intuitive and mod friendly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Any recommends?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Personally, the Novapunch/kw rocketry are nice addons that don\u0027t take any work. Also the kosmos station components with powerdyne. They add alot visually without breaking game balance/challenge etc The larger parts also means less components making it more enjoyable in many cases because of reduced lag from fewer parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -How to get to orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MOAR BOOSTERS! Seriously. Burn fast and pitch to horizon and keep burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Which is better Basic jet engine or Turbo one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At current, most of the time the turbo ones. The basic ones have less thrust, need more air (peak altitude lower) but the advantage is they are shorter so they are harder to break off on takeoff. Once a cost/income system gets implemented, they are lower cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Is the mun landable? Or the other planets?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E yup, except gilly which has a bug causing you to explode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -How can i get my spaceships stable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Struts, balance and proper thrust positioning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -What intakes do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Look purdy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -What nose connectors (spikes) do?

Or rockets?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Pods are easier for booster connection, circular symetry and also exits vertically.
