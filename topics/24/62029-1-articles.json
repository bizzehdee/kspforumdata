I been playing it like crazy.... first few days were epicly sad failures and designs and now I\u0027ve landed on Duna,Dres, and many others and came back. I\u0027m pretty big on mobile stations/bases and recently started to dive into building a MunBase. I\u0027ll show you guys my first \u0027Tug Rover\u0027. Is it decent for a simple base tug?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i60.tinypic.com/2b2moo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222b2moo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T09:29:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, Welcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContinuing on: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes that is a very nice design there! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I would say is to test everything on kerbin first to make sure your docking port is at the same height on the rover as the port on what you want to tow. Otherwise, things can go very wrong very easily. It seems you have found the mods already, considering the amount of LLL parts on that rover. There is plenty of stuff around if you find yourself getting bored, some mods even change the entire solar system up to real size. If you don\u0027t mind my asking, is that landed on Mun or Dres? Either way, I am impressed, many new players find it very difficult to get to either one. (Truth be told, I have yet to go to Dres myself.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Whoops! I should read things more shouldn\u0027t I? You very clearly said Mun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also, it can be easier to have a rover which fits under the base modules, and carries them on it\u0027s back. It isn\u0027t usually as stable, or as fast, but it is often the easiest one to make work. Just something you may want to consider. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
