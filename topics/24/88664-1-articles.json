Figured it was about time to sign up for this and maybe hit up some challenges. Dont know exactly what version I started playing but it was quite a while before career or science mode for that matter. I\u0027ve got a couple hundred hours on it and Im still horrible, lol. Im more of a sandbox player myself. Its funny, I wanted career so bad now that its pretty functional with money and everything I would just rather set my own goals on what I feel like doing without worrying about science and cash (stranding jeb on laythe comes to mind)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I like mods like near/far, deadly re-entry, remote tech, kas, etc. Tend to stay away from parts packs. I like KW rocketry but never use it anymore, b9 has *way* too many parts for my taste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway thanks for having me and I look forward to getting a bit more involved with the community here.
