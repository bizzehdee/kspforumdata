Some research so far has focused on the Alternative Energy, Biotechnology, Educational Materials, and Telecommunications industries, and I think there is a fair amount of prior work on early aviation and aerospace innovation, since innovations in both often required substantial public investment, and public funders (sometimes) have the power and incentive to make subsequent innovations more \u0022shareable.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, in the early 1900\u0027s, a rapid development of many innovations for powered flight had lead to \u0022patent thicket\u0022 that made it difficult to impossible for any one aircraft manufacturer to successfully license and integrate all the inventions into one aircraft. This was a big problem because the country was about to enter World War 1 and we needed the most cutting-edge aircraft available. So, amazingly, the government actually \u0022stepped-in\u0022 and insisted that everyone share their patents with their competitors. Better planes were made and arguable the industry was advanced faster than if the patent thicket had remained.

The U.S. government, as a result of a recommendation of a committee formed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, pressured the industry to form a cross-licensing organization (in other terms a Patent pool), the Manufacturer\u0027s Aircraft Association.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll aircraft manufacturers were required to join the association, and each member was required to pay a comparatively small blanket fee (for the use of aviation patents) for each airplane manufactured;of that the major part would go to the Wright-Martin and Curtiss companies, until their respective patents expire. This arrangement was designed to last only for the duration of the war, but in 1918, the litigation was never renewed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPerhaps it\u0027s time for these Peer Production scholars to look at Copenhagen Suborbitals, the Rocket Madsen Space Lab, Kerbal Space Program, and the communities supporting and innovating with and around them! \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to Kerbal!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Copenhagen_Suborbitals","CreatedById":62764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T23:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are in good company\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://qz.com/322481/why-rocket-scientists-are-in-love-with-a-goofy-rocket-simulation-game/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://qz.com/322481/why-rocket-scientists-are-in-love-with-a-goofy-rocket-simulation-game/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CG_Kerbin","CreatedById":117777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T12:16:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHell that\u0027s cool welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hunting.Targ","CreatedById":141427,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T10:06:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027trebuchet ms\u0027;\u0022\u003EVery interesting piece of commercial history.
