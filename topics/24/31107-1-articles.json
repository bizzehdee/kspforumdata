Sometimes, for larger rockets, the adjustments it makes to stay on course produce a torquing effect strong enough to overcome the rotational torque of the command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your question about Mun landers: It\u0027s actually quite easy in KSP to make a direct-ascent lander (take the whole craft with you, rather than a separate CSM and lander), but I\u0027d still recommend learning to dock. It\u0027s one of the hardest things to master in the game, but it\u0027s absolutely worth it because it opens up so many other options. If you need help with docking or any other aspect of the game, take a look at the Drawing Board (link in my sig) or ask questions in the How To section of the forums. We\u0027ll try to get any of your issues as squared away as we can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImages in messages: Since you have a new account, they\u0027re disabled (along with a few other things) until you have a bare minimum of posts and have been verified as not being a troll, spammer, or bot by the moderation staff.

Feel free to look around and jump into any conversation that interests you; you\u0027ll probably be vetted in no time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T18:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
