Which is only the 3rd time I\\\u0027ve been drawn to pay for an Indie game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have both a question and a suggestion for you people. First the question; at precisely what height does my rocket break out of earth\\\u0027s gravity. As for the suggestion. My fiance has been watching me play, and asked mentioned that she thought it awesome if you could make this multiplayer. We really like the idea of flying space missions between us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway keep up the good work guys, I can\\\u0027t wait to see where this project is going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW my current rocket has managed to get to 4500 k and is still rising.
