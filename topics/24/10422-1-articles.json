I have used mods like MECHjeb and that other command and control mod (the name escapes me) but I\\\u0027m not really a fan.\n\nAlso my favourite thing is to see some form of mothership or a reusable launch vehicle as I cant build them myself but I want to learn.\n\nAnyways that pretty much sums me up so yea. I hope i get to know you all and become good friends!\n\n-Adam\n\n(BF is infinity better than any call of duty game excluding cod 4 which was meh)"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T20:05:37Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nHappy Launching!\n\nArrr!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager\n\nfnord"},{"CreatedByName":"Cool_Frood","CreatedById":24920,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T20:08:24Z","Content":"Wow you are very quick in your reply\n\nI commend you!"},{"CreatedByName":"madmat","CreatedById":16054,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T20:39:48Z","Content":"The Capt\\\u0027n has an extra sense when it comes to the welcome aboard thread.
