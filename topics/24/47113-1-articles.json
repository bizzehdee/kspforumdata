It seemed impossible. It gets easier. A lot easier. Like, extremely easy. Take it step by step. Get orbiting down pat, and once you\u0027re good at that (try to actually do it yourself, watch Scott Manley tutorial videos on this), use maneuver nodes to get to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. You could go to Minmus first as someone else suggested, but I would recommend going for the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. The reason being that landing is another step altogether, and you should learn to actually get an encounter first (in my opinion). You\u0027ll likely either fly past it or smash into it, but at least you got within the vicinity of it. You can use F5 to quicksave once you\u0027re within the sphere of influence (SOI for short), and try as many times as you like to either get into orbit, land, or both (through reloading by holding F9), as long as your ship is physically able to do these maneuvers.
