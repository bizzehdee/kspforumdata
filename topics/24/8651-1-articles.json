After playing with the Demo since months yesterday I finally purchased a License for KSP having in Mind to finish the Fireworks stage and do some serious Orbiting / Mun travelling science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first attempt after getting the License to achieve a stable Orbit was successful. After passing the Mun very close somehow the trajectory changed and now my brave Kerbonauts seem to be on a pretty stable trejectory around the Sun. I hope they have enough food with them to survive long enough just in case they cross other planets in the Future. They still have a little bit of fuel left, maybe I can land them safely some time in the future. But until now new Projects have started and I\u00C2\u00B4m happy that there are so many Kerbonauts waiting to step into my rockets ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-25T10:30:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-25T16:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are happy to have you aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-25T17:46:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-26T06:42:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X9YGM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022X9YGM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ewar\u003C/span\u003E forums (note, there has been wars going on in the RP forum).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-26T06:59:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations on buying KSP, I hope you enjoy it! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"madmat","CreatedById":16054,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-26T09:22:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the madhouse.
