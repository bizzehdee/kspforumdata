Good news is that my Puggy-sitting duties have doubled! Eve, my daughter, saw someone advertising that she needed to re-home their 8-month old Pug because their two-year old had become allergic to dogs and cats. It wasn\u0027t near here, but Eve had been thinking Lola should have some company. After a \u0027meeting\u0027 it was decided a trial week would be a good idea...it took three days.

This isn\u0027t exactly the \u0022Blair Witch\u0022, but since it runs from my house I thought it would be a good start. There a another public footpath at the other end and a few people walk their dogs, and a few \u0027doggers\u0027 too. Met two older ladies with a two terriers and there was some growling and running about, but she was brilliant. Comes straight back when you shout to her and follows Lola most of the time. She is still a puppy and now has some new experiences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat brings me to Molly never meeting a cat. We have six.

Peter Cushing is my favourite. Too many Hammer movies growing-up made me a goth and the first \u0027boobies\u0027 I ever saw...Countess Dracula!

My grandmother almost fainted and stormed off saying, \u0022I\u0027m going to bed, this is just filth.\u0022 A slammed door and silence.

Mr. Price didn\u0027t even have to articulate himself on screen! His gestures rule. My son grew-up watching the same stuff I did and when he was 11-12 he would stand at the top of the stairs and when my wife would ask him what he wanted for tea would clench his teeth, hold a fist to his throat, and say, \u0022Ah, Gulnavia...\u0022 He couldn\u0027t do a \u0027v\u0027...try it.

Anyhoo, many of the opening scenes from Hammer films, and Dr. Phibes were recorded in Highgate cemetery. As members of the National Association of Cemeteries we get to go all the places the lower orders are not allowed. However, due to disrepair I was unable to pay my respects to Ms. Christina Rossetti while I was allowed to wander about. If this isn\u0027t teaching you to suck-eggs I thought you might like these pictures of the Egyptian Corridor...when I can work out how to add them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
