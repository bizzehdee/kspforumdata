I think when .19 came out (just after KSP went to STEAM)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot much for forums, I\u0027m old school internet nerd and am a big believer in John Gabriel\u0027s \u0022Internet $%@%wad Theory\u0022, so I tend to stay away from forums.. but the KSP community is pretty darn awesome on the whole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use MechJeb, originally for just information but once I figured out how to do standard maneuvers I swapped to using it for guidance, then once I figured out docking I switched to using MJ for docking when I\u0027m feeling lazy, even though it\u0027s slow and seems to waste a bit of mono. I\u0027ve read there\u0027s a few different types of KSP players out there.. Pilots, ship builders..etc.. I definitely fall into the ship building/project management side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to wipe my slate clean every time an update comes out just because every time I re-design my \u0022operations\u0022 from the ground up they get more streamlined, smaller part count and better lifters with more stable stages. It\u0027s fun for me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI treat it somewhat like career mode.. No kerbal left behind, use satelites to scout first..then unmanned voyages and finally a manned landing.. Then we start into orbital stations and as of late.. I\u0027ve been doing orbital kethane processing, just finished getting an operation on minmus going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeen to duna, eve and a couple of moons..but that\u0027s it! Don\u0027t like doing things half-way so I take my time and enjoy it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong intro, going to try to be more involved as I love the shape the game is taking. Thank you to all the regulars who have already shared their experience and knowledge (and craft files), you\u0027ve probably helped more people than you know enjoy this game. And another thank you to the active (and past) mod-makers who inspire creativity and just make life fun. Keep it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough mushy stuff. Peace all!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Custard Donut (In Space)","CreatedById":58058,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T22:07:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI too save every Kerbal i can, welcome to the forum \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T01:11:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
