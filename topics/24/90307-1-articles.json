I put the game away to wait for a more structured game, now its there i have decided to start again but i can\u0027t remember any controls so naturally i click on tutorials to learn the basics again. First was the science tutorial, interesting, new and completed so next tutorial. This is where i have problems, it is the first orbit tutorial and on the very first dialog box it says \u0027i hope you have done the basic flight training\u0027......errrrr no. I came out of the orbit tutorial to find the basic flight but I cant. Ive gone through the menu slowly and still cant find it. Knowing me I have most likely just overlooked it but I\u0027m getting very frustrated now trying to find it. So please enlighten me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FunnyBunny14","CreatedById":128892,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T22:29:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe basic flight training might not be there anymore. I think it got integrated in the orbit tutorial, but I\u0027m nit sure. Anyway, just do the tutorial, and see if there is anything you don\u0027t understand afterwards. As far as I remember the basic training was very, very basic, so you should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T13:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022spider12689\u0022 data-cite=\u0022spider12689\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...i can\u0027t remember any controls...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wiki will possibly help you most: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_bindings\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_bindings\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best place to find tutorials on the forums is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Drawing Board\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a logically-structured set of ships and missions instead of the insane tech-tree, or just some designs to (re)practice with try the tutorial in my signature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
