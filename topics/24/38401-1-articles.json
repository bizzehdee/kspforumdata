I love the fact that you can build pretty much anything you want and that you\u0027re free to do what you like. It really is a sandbox! In the past few days I\u0027ve managed to put a station together around Kerbin and also a lander mission out to Minmas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve read a lot about plug ins for the game. Are there any standard set that everyone uses? I\u0027ve seen MechJeb and Kethane mentioned quite often. Are these commonly used or do most people play the vanilla game? I\u0027ve been having a lot of fun with just the basic game, some of these things like mining resources sound pretty cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flightmaster","CreatedById":32617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T11:00:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EG\u0027day and welcome to KSP, it is indeed a pretty sick game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the mods you mentioned, a lot of people prefer a pure, vanilla experience in order to try and make it a bit harder, however, I myself prefer to use several addons that I believe add to the game\u0027s realism. Mechjeb is an absolutely amazing mod, I can\u0027t begin to list all the features it has. Kethane is a good mod for when you\u0027ve finished exploring planets and want something different out of the game. There are so many mods out there that it would be impossible for me to try and list all the good ones, if you just search through the add-on section in the forums then I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll find plenty of mods to your liking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d suggest trying out various mods and, if you don\u0027t like them, you can simply delete them and enjoy the game without them. That way you understand both sides of the argument regarding playing the game stock vs modded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy exploring!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dogface","CreatedById":75396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T11:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got KSP on the Steam sale too.
