I hope you enjoy it here. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSSTOs are very difficult. I mean, really difficult! I myself have built only two designs of SSTOs that actually can get int orbit, and one that could even get back to Kerbin.\n\nSome tips for making money? One technique I\u0027ve been using is to keep the price of your rocket less than what you will gain the contract you are trying to accomplish. Of course, this isn\u0027t always easy, so think outside of the box for your designs! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Career mode definitely forces me to use totally different parts and building techniques I would otherwise never use in Sandbox.\n\nIt\u0027s a shame Kethane is no longer supported. Why must the best mods end so abruptly? Anyways, a very good alternative I have heard is [Karbonite by RoverDude.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87335-24-2-Karbonite-Ongoing-Dev-and-Discussion) As a matter of fact, Karbonite, or a variant of it, will be made stock in the next update!\n\nWelcome! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T12:46:30Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!\n\nFor making money, reusability of large parts of your spacecraft helps bring back a lot of the cash you spend on rockets. SSTOs will definitely help with the price tag, but do remember that SSTOs can only lift a small percent of what expendable systems can use, so I\u0027d say that the best way to make money is to keep doing those high-profile exploration contracts of the other planets. Those are big money-makers!"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T13:55:06Z","Content":"Hello and welcome to the forums!\n\nAs for making money: stay on \u0022regular\u0022 staged disposable rockets until you can comfortably afford an SSTO. SSTO\u0027s save money with each use, but are very expensive to build. Also, solid rocket fuel is cheap, don\u0027t be afraid to use nothing but solid rocket boosters in your first stage."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T16:43:57Z","Content":"SSTOs are easy and low part-count up to payloads of 100t - 150t but use a lot of fuel (which is cheap, so who cares).\n\nThe first rocket in \u0027Exploring The System\u0027 is a SSTO, as is the 40t launch vehicle in Chapter 7.\n\nSpaceplanes are, of course, a completely different thing and probably not worth working on in 0.90 as 1.0 will change the aerodynamics completely. If you do want a flight-simulator and don\u0027t have too much invested in your current designs you may want to install FAR for a better model.\n\nKarbonite really has pretty much replaced Kethane but, again and as mentioned by others, 1.0 will change all that by making resources and mining stock.\n\nQuestions, questions:\n\nKSP is awesome.\n\nKethane is obsolete.\n\nSSTO means Single Stage To Orbit.\n\nMods are too many and varied to make a single statement, apart from that they can add a lot.\n\nIn career mode try to complete as many contracts as possible with each launch. READ the contract and don\u0027t accept any you don\u0027t think you can do. Part-testing contracts are easy - engines don\u0027t need fuel, just need to be \u0027activated by staging\u0027, as do decouplers, etc. - even if that seems pointless ^^. For satellite contracts make sure you go the same way around as the \u0027dots\u0027 on the target orbit; many, many people make the mistake of just getting the height/inclination right while going in completely the wrong direction. \u0027In flight\u0027 test contracts and most EVA ones aren\u0027t worth the effort until you have a (Kerbin) aeroplane that can easily land nearby (check the terrain)."},{"CreatedByName":"lance0625","CreatedById":139939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T20:40:12Z","Content":"Well thanks you guys.\n\numm what else...\n\noh yea\n\nI did just installed far.\n\nIll be starting a new career mode.\n\nI don\u0027t know if by replying to \u0022reply to tread\u0022 mean I can reply to all.\n\nalthough I ask for a tip for money making,I\u0027m in mid game(Kinda) with almost 1m and I need like 6m(something).\n\nAs for SSTO\u0027s I did manage to get one in orbit but with saber engines but I hope far would help me out in future.\n\nwell,thanks and have a great day"}]}
