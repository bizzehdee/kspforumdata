SSTOs will definitely help with the price tag, but do remember that SSTOs can only lift a small percent of what expendable systems can use, so I\u0027d say that the best way to make money is to keep doing those high-profile exploration contracts of the other planets.

Part-testing contracts are easy - engines don\u0027t need fuel, just need to be \u0027activated by staging\u0027, as do decouplers, etc. - even if that seems pointless ^^. For satellite contracts make sure you go the same way around as the \u0027dots\u0027 on the target orbit; many, many people make the mistake of just getting the height/inclination right while going in completely the wrong direction. \u0027In flight\u0027 test contracts and most EVA ones aren\u0027t worth the effort until you have a (Kerbin) aeroplane that can easily land nearby (check the terrain).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lance0625","CreatedById":139939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T20:40:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell thanks you guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eumm what else...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh yea\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did just installed far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIll be starting a new career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if by replying to \u0022reply to tread\u0022 mean I can reply to all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealthough I ask for a tip for money making,I\u0027m in mid game(Kinda) with almost 1m and I need like 6m(something).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for SSTO\u0027s I did manage to get one in orbit but with saber engines but I hope far would help me out in future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell,thanks and have a great day\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
