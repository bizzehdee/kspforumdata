Every time I post a quick reply it says that it has to be approved by moderator of the forum, and only then it will appear. But \u0022regular\u0022 replies to the thread appear immediately.\n\nIs it because I have a low post count, or I have joined just yesterday?\n\nCouldn\u0027t find anything about it in the FAQ.
