I sent a big rocket to orbit with 7 docking ports, 4 of which are for me to dock boosters on it. After I docked the ship/ booster to the rocket I didn\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t rotate it into place in the same way I saw people online. Is there a solution to this or is that feature only for PC cause of mods. If so will it ever come to KSP on PS5?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-20T04:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, what was it you were trying to rotate?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, welcome to the forum. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-20T05:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you mean rotate the dock?\u00A0 I know there was an issue with that new functionality and can\u0027t remember the resolution or if there was a workaround.\u00A0 I disable/lock the stock dock rotation and use the DockRotate mod in its place because of that bug.\u00A0 I think it was mentioned the bug will likely not be fully addressed in KSP1 as nearly all effort is going into KSP2 now\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
