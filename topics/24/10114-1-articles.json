Truly stimulating. I get to think, learn, blow up. Do again, because I can\\\u0027t stop now.\n\nPut down the eminently reasonable $15. Tried a mod (MechJeb). Getting better.\n\nMy XBOX hates you. My Laptop is happy I\\\u0027m back. (PC\\\u0027eeee!) \n\nProgram seems quite friendly to my 3yr old machine w/ no graphics card.\n\nLooking forward to many journeys in the the Great Beyond!
