Right now i am still playing the free version but would like to buy the updates. I was wondering if the tutorial worked in the latest version and how detailed it was. I am currently able to get a rocket up and into some sort of orbit. But that is it. I was wondering if the tutorial would get me educated enough with the gimble and what all of its markings are and with the pitch, roll, and yaw buttons.? Next issues is, I am playing this on a non graphic intense laptop, I can run this game but as soon as I open another window, like youtube, my computer slows down quite a bit. So my question is, how low can i turn down the settings in this game cause i would imagine once plenty of things are flying around it would be taxing on my computer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be grateful. Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"trbinsc","CreatedById":10144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-18T19:24:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the current version, 0.16, the tutorial is the same as the demo, but in the next version, 0.17, one of the main focuses is to make a proper tutorial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, somewhere on the forums there is a modified settings.cfg that really increases performance on slow computers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-18T19:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-18T19:29:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi VengfeulVermin, the tutorial is a bit boarder in the alpha as it has to cover the aircraft and some other things, but I can help a bit with the navball (its proper name in KSP) there are two yellow/green icons, these show your current direction of movement, and its reverse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe purple markers show the direction towards and away from the lauchpad, well they should but they actually point towards and away from the second KSC on Kerbin in the alpha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other markings show the angle in degrees you are tilted at, and the angle you are facing, with 0 being north, and 180 being south.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pitch, roll and yaw indicators are not terribly useful most of the time, but in the alpha we have Trim to make flying aircraft easier, with Alt\u002BW you can add up trim, this is reflected in the trim indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP \u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C/em\u003E run fine for you, but if not you can lower the OceanPQS MaxSubdivisions values in the settings.cfg, there are 3 of these and they are set to 6, by setting them to 3 you will lessen the load on the CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RayneCloud","CreatedById":11227,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-18T21:21:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I see the team already got to you!
