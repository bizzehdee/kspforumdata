I think I played the demo for a couple hours before I bought the game and haven\u0027t looked back.

I spent a huge amount of time with it yesterday. arghh... time killer! ha. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway.. decided to go out to visit Duna. With time accel, should be a piece of cake. No? No. I enabled the unlimited fuel cheats, put together a tiny nimble craft, and off I went to demonstrate my complete lack of orbital mechanics \u0027feel for it\u0027. Chased that red sucker around it\u0027s orbit for a while, got it together, and popped in for just a flyby. Decided that a landing was just not in the cards because of time.Then spent some time chasing Kerbin around, and managed to bring the boys home ok. Success! Of course the kerbins were gone so long their skeletons probably disintegrated when the chute opened, but ok. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then I tried out a stock spaceplane. Accidentally went EVA and found flying around EVA to be somewhat glitchy. Was unable to match trajectory with my plane and had I not quit would have eventually burned up a kerbin on re-entry. whoops. How about mag shoes or a tether? :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s my report for the moment. Interested to see where I go from here. Obviously I\u0027ll probably start a real campaign mode game and try to get things done. For Science. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDwen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI learned a vital lesson about delta vee on a mun landing. Sure, this engine can utterly defy this mun\u0027s gravity. That does not mean it can deaccelerate on a dime and will save Jebediah\u0027s ass from his existing delta vee.
