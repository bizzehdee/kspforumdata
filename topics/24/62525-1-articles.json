Gotta say I love KSP. First got it when .19 came out, a friend gave me a copy and I\u0027ve been hooked ever sense. First started and ended up blowing things up right away. Found out about the debug menu and dabbled a bit in infinite fuel and such. Now that I understand the game better, I\u0027m able to perform many different activities without cheating or using any auto-pilot mods. I do love to mod and use mods to simulate realism in the game such as SerCom, FAR and Deadly Re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like working under the general designation UKF, United Kerbal Federation. And I may have a bad habit of over-naming my ships with mission designations such as my Munnar lander series of missions, designated Cascade. I have about 15 total ship designs used in over 45 missions. And yes, I do sub-designate (Cascade 15D the last ship I\u0027ve put on the Mun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, Just wanted to say hi and hope to get to know a lot of you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T19:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello nala2624.
