Since that applies to memory addresses and a 32 bit number can only access 4GB of ram, 4GB of ram is all the game can use. The reason KSP can only use 32 bits is down to problems with the Game Engine (Unity 3D) that KSP is built on - Unity 3D does have 64-bit versions for Windows and OSX, but they have some very weird bugs and are too unstable to use for a big game like KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully Unity Corp will fix the bugs and this situation will be remedied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil then, we have to be careful about how many mods we add to the game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T23:06:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Curaodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Curaodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there any: \u0022If your game crashes like mad, check for these things\u0022 -thread anywhere on this forum?\u003Cp\u003EOr do I have to read through every post in every mod-thread for clues?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is in the Support forum \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24536-Self-help-for-crashes-look-here-first-if-KSP-crashes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESelf-help for crashes - look here first if KSP crashes\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever that forum is for non modded ksp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFew things to check however:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ksp.log in the main folder.
