I picked up KSP during the Steam Summer sale and I\u0027m really enjoying it. It\u0027s also incredibly frustrating at times too but I\u0027m really getting value for money out of it. 45 hours spent so far, managed to get to the Mun and Minmus, hopefully get to Duna once I get these interplanetary transfers figured out and yes I have watched Scott Manley\u0027s video on it but it doesn\u0027t help because he knows what he\u0027s doing and I don\u0027t. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-09T22:12:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2014 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jade Falcon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T22:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome! Don\u0027t worry about being frustrated, once you get the hang of the game it\u0027s very rewarding! And also, only 45 hours and you\u0027ve already gone to the Mun and Minmus?
