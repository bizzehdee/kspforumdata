I posted a thread on Yahoo! Answers but received no responses that really helped. Here is my Computer:\n\nI have a Lenovo G505s laptop. \n\nAMD A8 Quad-Core Processor \n\n6GB RAM \n\n2.10GHz \n\nVideo Card: \n\nRadeon HD 8550g \n\nVRAM: 768mb \n\nI don\u0027t want to spend $30\u002B if I won\u0027t be able to run it smoothly on this machine.\n\nAlso, (Sorry for the long post) I saw the AMA on reddit explaining how this game doesn\u0027t necessarily need to be played for hours on end to get decent progress. I was just wondering from anyone\u0027s experience if playing for long periods of time truly helps or if I should be OK with just playing it every once in a while.\n\nThanks!![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:17:26Z","Content":"You\u0027ve got plenty of hardware there for KSP.\n\nI\u0027m playing on a Mac with a 2.3GHz Intel i5 and 4GB of RAM.\n\nIf I recall correctly, KSP only runs on one or two cores and cannot make use of all 4. Also, I\u0027m not an expert on computers, so I\u0027ll send someone over who is.\n\nAs to the progress- it\u0027s generally a sandbox game, so you can make as much or as little progress as you want. You first few tries might get you nowhere, but you can always come back to the forums for help. If you get bored, I find that it\u0027s helpful to take a break and come back refreshed. You can also try career mode, with procedurally generated goals- imagine a sandbox with tasks to complete."},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:26:11Z","Content":"A) it would work the performance is something else entirely and i\u0027m not an expert on AMD stuff so i cant tell you that.\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) play as you like- some have thousands of hours and others play casually play how you like it to try it and see what you like dont ask us do whatever you feel like!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:54:23Z","Content":"Oh, yeah, that\u0027ll run KSP nicely! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWelcome to the forum, JPG!"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:39:13Z","Content":"Welcome to KSP! Anyone know if the old demo is still available? You could try it (it\u0027s old, and not optimized) and if it runs OK, know that retail KSP will actually run better.\n\nFor most people, the CPU is the bottleneck as KSP is physics heavy. But you seem to have enough juice. That Radeon is 2 years old?
