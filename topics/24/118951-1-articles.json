I also didn\u0027t know where to post this, so let\u0027s let er\u0027 rip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis past Sunday, I lost the charger to my Mac I\u0027m using now. I couldn\u0027t use it even if I had Wi-Fi, so I couldn\u0027t talk to you guys for a week. Now though, I found the charger again, so I\u0027ve got tonight to be here. However, tomorrow I am getting on a plane to Orlando, Florida. I will spend a day there (without Wi-Fi), and then I will go on a week-long cruise (with \u003Cstrong\u003ENO WI-FI!!!\u003C/strong\u003E) Then, finally, I will have access to here again. (But even then, I will be attending my duties in September again, so my activity won\u0027t stop, but certainly slow down.) So that\u0027s all I have to say, and goodbye. Cheers, Raincrafter. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ffffff;\u0022\u003ENow I have to PM this to my friends.
