Do the cfg files need to be copied out and into RealismOverhaul folder? Parts? Plugins?

I have the cfg file, does this go into RealismOverhaul folder or the RPL_Tweak_Pack/RT2_Settings_Files(DeleteOnceMoved)? Or somewhere altogether different?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems to be about it, thats what I have left to merge into the realism pack that I will copy into a new KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far the majority of my ksp time is spent figuring out my rockets can\u0027t get to space.... so I add a couple more rockets and fuel...still cant, add some more boosters...still can\u0027t....asparagus staging does the trick for now but tends to spin alot. Note that I haven\u0027t figured out how to use the dV numbers and calculations just yet, sort of getting the idea, so all my rockets need to be physically tested for minutes until they just don\u0027t make LKO...\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DYJ","CreatedById":8636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T19:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have questions regarding specific mods I suggest you ask in their threads or ask in the #Kspmodders IRC channel on espernet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T23:35:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all mods go in the gamedata folder.
