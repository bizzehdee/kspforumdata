I wish I would have found it sooner, honestly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently a college student studying Robotics Engineering, and I was thrilled to find that terms like roll, pitch, and yaw along with much of what I know about physics and mechanical systems is extremely applicable here in the game. As much as I\u0027d love a couple of extra parts features in the game (come on, please, one hinge is all I want) I prefer to play mostly vanilla.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, if anyone has any suggestions for any awesome non-gameplay changing mods, I wouldn\u0027t mind trying them out. I currently only have Kerbal Engineer installed. (Delta-V calculations were getting tedious, and it gives you lots of numbers without adding anything unnecessary)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I have lurked a bit on the forums, and have finally decided to join you all. Maybe my rovers and ships might be more appreciated here! (My roommates just don\u0027t get as excited about a stable VTOL rover as I do) As far as KSP experience, I have completed the science tree, and have been to every one of the inner planets and moons. (No Jool system or Eeloo yet) I have a decent handle on orbital rendezvous and docking, and can get lined up and dock in a couple orbits. I am not very good at spaceplanes, but I\u0027m learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry about the wall of text, but I\u0027m excited to be a part of the forums and share/receive knowledge and experience about KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#252525;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E- \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A7\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MartGonzo","CreatedById":65764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T22:35:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Infernal Robotics mod is a must, it has various translating and rotating parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-23-5-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Parts-Infernal-Robotics-0-14-stable%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-23-5-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Parts-Infernal-Robotics-0-14-stable%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I highly recommend Deadly Re-entry:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54954-0-23-5-Deadly-Reentry-Continued-v4-7-5-5-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54954-0-23-5-Deadly-Reentry-Continued-v4-7-5-5-14\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit is gameplay changing but it makes the game more realistic and challenging, so it\u0027s hard to see any down side to that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso mods like Kerbal Alarm Clock and Precise Node are very useful without changing the gameplay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786-0-23-5-Kerbal-Alarm-Clock-v2-7-3-0-%28April-9%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786-0-23-5-Kerbal-Alarm-Clock-v2-7-3-0-%28April-9%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-0-23-5-PreciseNode-0-12-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-0-23-5-PreciseNode-0-12-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand all the beautification mods your pc can handle, I like this one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79345-Astronomer-s-Visual-pack-V3-BETA-is-out-and-it-looks-great!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79345-Astronomer-s-Visual-pack-V3-BETA-is-out-and-it-looks-great!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatGalaxyMan","CreatedById":111176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T23:59:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the recommendations!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfernal Robotics is exactly what I was thinking of.
