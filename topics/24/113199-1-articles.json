I\u0027m wondering- since I\u0027ve just come back from a break- if there\u0027s any way to get these tourists on regular, Sandbox mode. After a couple of Google searches, I\u0027ve seen mention of sending tourists up on a Sandbox ideas thread, but haven\u0027t been able to find any elaboration on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny and all advice is appreciated.
