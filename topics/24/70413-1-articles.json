He enjoyed the demo and said it was the game he\u0027d been looking for for years, so I bought it for him on steam as a gift (I\u0027m the only bread winner until he gets good enough at German). He\u0027s been playing it every hour of the day since then. I decided to buy it for myself as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been enjoying it quite a bit. It\u0027s so difficult finding games which are genuinely new and interesting. I also like learning new skills, even ones which are useless in every day life like orbital mechanics! I\u0027m taking it slow and trying to get really good at each stage before I move on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaelath","CreatedById":106084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T00:46:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, welcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad you and your husband are enjoying the game like we do. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy launching!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T01:47:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello.
