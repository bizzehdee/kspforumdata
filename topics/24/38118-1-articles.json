A game that has already made such an impact in my life that my view of the world would be lesser without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDevs/Community\u003C/em\u003E - The devs brought to the world an amazing platform that allows (fairly) pure science the avenues to explore ALL of our collective creativity. What makes this game great is that it\u0027s an open universe, filled with open source objects: Objects conceived and constructed by the very people experiencing that universe. Objects that are newly available daily, FOR FREE, rather than quarterly for an obscene price. Each time I open the forum, game or spaceport I\u0027m greeted with new and interesting content and rich discussions about physics, astronomy, math and so many other things for which I need my children to know about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is with great humility that I submit an album of pics from my first planned mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/a6bHa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ER-7 Semyorka Test Flight\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving run through the tutorials, I decided to make my first mission a test flight of what\u0027s widely considered to be the first ICBM (and the first rocket of the \u0022space race\u0022), the R-7 Semyorka!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to take the shots at various points of interest to outline the mission.
