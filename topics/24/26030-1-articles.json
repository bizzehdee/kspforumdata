A few of us here are really interested in this game, we study at the aerospace engineering faculty and it was really fun to mess around with this game, i heard about it from a friend who thought i would like it, hes the kind of guy who tells you things you don\u0027t care about most of the time because hes not in aerospace and thinks everything you can link to it must fascinate you haha, but in this case he was quite right. i torrented it to see what it was all about, and before i knew it i was planning moon bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen i get moments like that its my cue to buy it, so i did, and here i am. its really interesting to apply the knowledge gained in the study to this game to see the outcome. for a game, it is surprisingly well made. obviously i thought it was strange a kerbel could reenter atmosphere in nothing but his suit and survive until the ground, but its alpha stage, i don\u0027t expect everything to be perfect yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei think i may make a tutorial on how the industry keeps debris down, i see a lot of peoples mission view screen and there is tons of garbage, with only a few missions in the mix, you guys are in trouble. my mission window has 0 debris that isn\u0027t on the ground or on trajectory for reentry, and maybe this is something i can share. i expect there will be a few other aerospace ppl in here so i look forward to the conversations. currently i like mods like ISA, that\u0027s my field, earth and planetary observation. so it was fun to make mapping satellites to select proper grounds for bases and outposts. if i have time i would enjoy expanding on that mod to include instruments currently being used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eim a fan of the sentinel program so i might start there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecurrent project: moon base is dark in eclipse, need battery and solar array bank to store enough power for complete eclipse cycle. working out how many batteries in need and gonna store up power during day and discharge so the base is lit while dark on the mun\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vespasianus","CreatedById":26881,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T15:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JaySmoka","CreatedById":60988,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T15:53:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!

However in ksp debris that reenter are simply destroyed. as the mechanics change i will have to keep watch. but for now ill make a few posts or vids. starting with the basics, and moving on to the advanced techniques for interplanetary, fun things like pre planned jettison retro-boosted gravity-assisted collision with an asteroid (my favorite).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nyrath\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nyrath\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003Cp\u003EDid you see how these gentlemen used KSP to do a mission control simulation?...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat, is awesome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptainBlue\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptainBlue\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...You should also see this: Copenhagen-Suborbital-joins-KSP\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis excites me, to think that we are entering an age where even the types of games you play can create connections between companies and new engineers. imagine, getting into a debate with the head of a company about which launcher they should use on the forums for fun, and he offered you an interview. that\u0027s the kind of thing i hope this world is heading for. the internet is a more powerful tool for helping the world than i think even most ppl realize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks to the rest, looking forward to seeing everyone\u0027s creativity\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
