I have been playing KSP since version 0.14 or so. I was introduced to the demo back at a state-wide annual LAN party and bought it immediately thereafter. I learned basic strategies watching KurtJMac and later, Scott Manley. Through him I\u0027ve also followed other YouTube channels that devote some or all of their talents to KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current game is taking an approach that is a kind of mix of Scott\u0027s \u0022Interstellar Quest\u0022 and \u0022Reusable Space Program\u0022 series\u0027. I have a plethora of mods installed (using 0.23.5) for both realism, ease of use, and beautification. I have most all of IQ\u0027s mods installed except for Interstellar (sticking to more traditional fuelling methods), Deadly Re-Entry (couldn\u0027t find a 0.23.5 compatible download before it updated to 0.24), and some of the chute mods. I also have scansat, chatterer and mechjeb loaded, to help keep it fun as opposed to tedious in the later stages of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t been the best at taking screenshots regularly for story telling but so far I have successfully unlocked the first 5 tiers of the career mode tech tree (except for heavy rocketry and the Klaw), and I\u0027ve set up two comsat relays around Kerbin and the Mun. My next goals will be to put a science lab station around the Mun so I can use it as a lab/goo processing-resetting junction before bringing the research back to KSC, and also putting up an additional comsat network around Minmus, mining for Kethane and setting up a refuelling station for interplanetary transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for listening to my intro and I hope people get a kick out of me sharing my story!
