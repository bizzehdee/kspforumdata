I started checking it out and I liked the demo so I bought the program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the things that intrigued me, aside from the game itself (which I love) is the fact that it is still in the development stages and I have an opportunity to help in its production. From game suggestions to de-bugging. Its just fun to be in at this stage I suppose and to imagine just how much more awesome it could become.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve been messing around with it and enjoying the career mode. In fact, just yesterday, I managed to pull off a successful rescue mission... I stranded one of my kerbals in orbit and I was able to rescue not just him but his capsule too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...then my five year old killed him.
