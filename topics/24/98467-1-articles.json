The map view can give you a very rough estimate of where you are going, and is easier to see orbital information. The navball is really the bread and butter of this game, its very useful. and about everything maneuver, or target or general flight can be done with it. Two tips that will help. When you go into map mode, and set a maneuver node, the navball shows a blue target, place it directly in the middle, and your plane/rocket/whatever will execute that node. Stop burning once the right side is near 0- or green, green isnt always perfect, but its a good way to get close for most orbital maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the contract, i strongly reccomend doing those with airplanes or gliders or some form of winged craft. Rockets may work, but are awkward to pilot, especially if yiu have had any previous experience with aircraft games (flight sims ect). While the aerodynamics and not that great (ok lemme be straight they SUCK as of now, 1.0 looks very promising though), and turbojets are overpowered imo, a plane still flies more or less like a real plane, minus stuff like stalling ect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metl","CreatedById":82406,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T01:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExtract this mod to your KSP/GameData folder.
