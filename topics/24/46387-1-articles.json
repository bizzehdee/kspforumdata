I have been playing around with some rocket design trying to figure out efficient designs and such. I have gotten a few probes in orbit around Kerbin. I have figured out how to turn on all science devices (though I presume they are useless right now?) I have figured out what RCS thrusters are for! (That one took a good day or two). I have even successfully gotten some Kerbals in to orbit around the planet! (Super proud of that one!) But my biggest achievement I think is getting a probe to the mun! (That took a few tries and a youtube video!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that leads me to my question finally....What should I do now? I want to build a space station. I want to get a probe to Minmus. I want to land on the Mun. I want to land on Minmus. And eventually I want to go to Duna I think its called? But what do you guys think would be the next logical step? Another Mun probe? Once could be a fluke but repeats are proof right? Maybe an unmanned lander to the Mun?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, forum related, what are with the graphics at the bottom of peoples posts of planets and ships and such?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I am totally enthused to be playing this game and I look forward to collaborating with you fellow space enthusiasts!
