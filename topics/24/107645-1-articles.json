The learning curve is a little overly inclined but the cute factor really helps with it.\n\nIm not going to publicly admit how many hours Iv played in 4 days... but this could seriously damage my Keurig.\n\nSome sounds of the Kerbals talking (and screaming in terror lol) would be great.\n\nThus far I have found a few mods that help with the GFX, and performed an unstable and widely eccentric orbit. \n\n(next up is a total redesign of the rocket to allow enough fuel for a stable orbit) \n\nTo the Devs...\n\nDONT STOP!\n\nMORE! MORE I SAY!\n\nThere is so much potential in this game it is mind blowing.\n\nHow can I support the continued development of this fantastic game?\n\nI mean, Iv already purchased it, what else can I do?\n\nHow can I help?\n\nNow if you excuse me, I have to sit at my desk at work and count the minutes until I can play KSP again....."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T14:00:20Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Community!

Welcome to the KSP Community! Also, Some Advice: Each time your ship crashes and explodes, you\u0027re one little step closer to success. And, this game doesn\u0027t have a learning curve.
