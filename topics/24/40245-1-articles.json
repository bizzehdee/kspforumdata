That\u0027s great! Now the next best thing to do is get familiarized with a few people one in particular goes by the name Scott Manely. He has great videos on building and flying in KSP. Kurt also has good videos on KSP (he\u0027s not in .21 yet but still good). If you want to see funny stuff look for Danny. Also might want to look into getting mods. Seeing by what you posted I can assume you would like them. You may have to wait though because they are just starting to update to 0.21.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elvianoth","CreatedById":76900,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T11:54:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely, Scott Manley is my KSP mentor, first thing I did after I tried the game for the first time was getting something to fly... didn\u0027t go well.
