What can I say?\n\nI liked it straight out of the box, no mods, 32 bit.\n\nI ***really*** liked after I got a feel for it and added mods, like FAR, Deadly Reentry, Remote Tech and SETI, to name some of my favorites.\n\nIn fact, I liked it so much (and got so tired of RAM crashing) that it tipped the scales in favor of taking the time and energy to dual boot my native Windblows 8.1 with Ubuntu so I could run KSP in all its 64 bit glory.\n\nIt was a royal pain in the backside, but...\n\n***OMG!!***\n\n**It. Was. Totally. Worth. It.** \n\nSo, my fellow kerbonaughts, if you have the time and the inclination, and you\u0027re sick of dealing with the RAM ceiling in the 32 bit version, install a supported linux distro, delete Active Texture Management, and pile on all the mods your wee hearts desire. It\u0027s a good time!\n\nNOTE: If you try this at home, and you have MAJOR graphics issues in KSP, turn off Edge Highlighting (PPFX) in the graphics settings.

It\u0027s water-cooled, i7 quad core, 16 gigs of RAM, HDD, etc. It\u0027s pretty sweet. But, it\u0027s at a desk in my home office and I like hanging out on my couch, not at a desk. ;-)\n\nSo, I mostly play on my laptop, which is a mid-grade Toshiba with eight gigs of RAM and and integrated Intel HD4000. It\u0027s modest. But it\u0027s more than enough to run KSP, Sometimes I hook it up to the receiver and run it through the TV and stereo with a wireless mouse and keyboard. Can\u0027t do that in the office...\n\nThat\u0027s why I was so frustrated... reading logs that say I ran out of memory and crashed - with ***gobs*** of unused memory just sitting there.\n\nI guess a lot of folks don\u0027t use many mods. But, I\u0027m running 22 or so, I believe. So, I had to use ATM and the texture replacer and all that drama and still crashed every couple of hours. \n\nNow, I can play for hours and hours and barely slow down, even with a lot of scene switching and the resuling memory leaks.\n\nI\u0027m stoked!!\n\nAnyway, I think I\u0027ll sneak in another mission before real life comes barging back in.\n\nHave a good one!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Welcome to the forums! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Glad to hear you\u0027ve been enjoying the game.

You may have a great graphics card and processor, and be able to play at full-graphics and with huge vessels without lag, but you will \\*NEVER\\* be able to exceed the 32-bit limit on RAM usage (even if you had 2 \\*trillion\\* GB of RAM) no matter how good your rig.\n\nYou only hit this memory-limit with mods, but some mods are quite memory-intensive. ScanSat takes 1 GB alone, for instance- and IIRC, RemoteTech isn\u0027t much better for RAM usage... KSP-Interstellar (which is a great mode I use, help develop an [Extension Config](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111159-WIP-0-90-KSP-Interstellar-Extended) for, and highly recommend) also can get quite memory-intensive if you have a large Microwave Beamed Power network in place as it basically performs some of the same calculations as RemoteTech for Microwave Beamed Power...\n\nLinus 64-bit is the way to go if you really get mod-hungry!

ScanSat and Remote Tech are two of my favorites. That explains a lot. No wonder I could only play a couple of hours at a time. \n\nIt would never go above 3.5 gigs, though, if the application cleaned up after itself. Obviously, this is just poor programming. Memory leaks are (almost) always human error."}]}
