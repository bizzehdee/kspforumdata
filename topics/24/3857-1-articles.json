I got pulled in by the gravity of this thing called the Kerbal space program (shiny things that go boom very very high up over ground).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I come from a long career with Orbiter, so the lack of information is somewhat unfamiliar, but not necesarily a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to build my own contraptions for flying of parts made up of pieces just lying around is great fun. And being able to maybe contribute to add in usefull ideas is intriguing.

It\u00C2\u00B4s focused heavily on the engneering bit, and have a 4 layer techtree sollution, where the pieces are specified by the player, and only theorys/overlaying technology can be researched. And where proper testing of the engineered parts will be a good thing. And if I\u00C2\u00B4m lucky, there will even be graphics in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u00C2\u00B4m here, and fun is about to be had.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"your mom","CreatedById":2028,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-14T13:25:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello welcome to the forums. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-14T14:56:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
