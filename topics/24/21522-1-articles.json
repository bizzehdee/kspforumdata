I would have bought the full version earlier, but I figured the Kerbals wouldn\u0027t want me to control their space program until I had at least orbited Mun. Well, I accomplished that and promptly bought the game. I\u0027ve been having a blast using all the new rocket pieces, but I\u0027ve not made it back to Mun yet. In fact, my mission to Mun is partly why I\u0027m making this post. After much trial and error and the lives of a few Kerbals were lost, I finally got my Mun rocket into orbit. When I decoupled my atmospheric stage, something went terribly wrong and it did some serious damage to the rest of the rocket. A few fuel tanks were destroyed, but that\u0027s not the issue. Along with the fuel tanks went all of the thrusters! I\u0027ve got three Kerbals orbiting Kerbin with no way home now. For this reason, I decided to put the mission to Mun on hold and go about rescuing those brave souls. I figured I would construct a rocket (actually, just a modified version of my first orbiter) to go up and rendezvous with the remains of Mun II, have the Kerbals space walk over to the rescue vessel, then land safely back on Kerbin. I soon found that that would be much more difficult than I had thought. At first I thought I would just be able to add another crew capsule to my rocket, but that can\u0027t be done. So my next plan was to just have two of the Kerbals jump out on the landing pad, but that presented more problems. The first was the issue where my Kerbal left the rocket and went splat on the launch pad. Second, even if I figured out how to get the Kerbals safely on the ground, I don\u0027t know how to regain control of the rocket while one of my crew is on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo can anyone provide me with tips on how to rescue the Kerbals before they go insane or starve? I feel terrible that I managed to cause such a problem so soon after joining the Space Program, but I intend to do all that is within my power to fix the situation!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Accidentally posted this thread twice.

I had one of the stranded crew ready to go on EVA and rendezvous with the rescue ship, but it never got any closer than 600m. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d be able to actually make it, so I put the Kerbal in back in the cockpit. While trying to get closer, I made the rescue ship\u0027s plane shift a bit from the target so I gave up as it took me quite a while just to get as close as I did. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went back and looked at my Mun rocket to see what was wrong, and I think I discovered it. Some of the parts were clipping into each other so I think they collided when I dropped the stage. Fixed that and launched again. This time I was much more successful! I discovered another problem while on my flight to the Mun; a fuel tank on my lander was blocking the door. That meant no EVA, my Kerbals were sad \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E . I decided to land anyway just to get a taste of that. My lander lacked any RCS system so I think it was a little more difficult to land than it should have been. I just had two of the smaller thrusters that can vector on my lander. Lacking finesse, I managed to set my lander down while only destroying some of the fuel tanks and both thrusters. Also, I ended up sideways instead of on the landing gears. Oops. Anyway, with the fuel tanks destroyed my Kerbals are enjoying low-gravity strolls on the Mun until rescue arrives(if it ever does...)! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i50.tinypic.com/iy3muw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iy3muw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
