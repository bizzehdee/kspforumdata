It. Is. Awesome. \n\nSeriously I wanted to get it back when it was in beta stage but didn\u0027t have the money, I literally bought the game with the first paycheck I got from my new job (I\u0027m a Network Operations Center technician at a datacenter in SE Wyoming). Since then I\u0027ve been playing almost nonstop, I\u0027ll even play it at work during the after-hours standby shift. \n\nThat being said I\u0027ve been lurking on the forums to pick up tips on how to rocket, but I figured I should at least introduce myself. \n\nSee you space cowboys!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T22:55:01Z","Content":"Welcome to the forum Auriga\\_Nexus. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"carneyvich","CreatedById":147880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T23:56:42Z","Content":"welcome!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T16:18:19Z","Content":"Hello!\n\nRumour has it that Bill has some experience in kind a bullriding.

They need someone there 24/7 on a just-in-case basis, but as long as no one calls and none of our servers explode there\u0027s literally nothing to do once you\u0027ve patched systems and run backups, and these are 10-hour shifts. In fact KSP is a good game to play in this environment cause once I get my rocket into orbit, I can leave it circling if something crops up.\n\nPlus, seeing as my senpai at the workstation next to me is usually on Old Republic most of the night I don\u0027t really see much of an issue ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T17:03:24Z","Content":"I found a pic with Bill and a Lawnmower made from another Forummember, maybe you can find it some pages ago in the Spacecraft exchange thread... \n\nThis is a deadly machine, beaware of using it ... never use it in careerplay... never...!\n\nIts the mighty ***LAWNBULL 9001 GRASSBURNER HEXATURBO*** ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n![9vl5PE2.png](http://i.imgur.com/9vl5PE2.png)"}]}
