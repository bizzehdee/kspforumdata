I also lingered long in Kerbin\u0027s SoI, becaming really good at Mun and Minmus landings. For some reason I pushed going interplanetary away, every time finding a good excuse to launch yet another Mun or Minmus mission. But trust me on this one, nothing gets your blood pumping when you get your first Duna encounter. And after that high you really need some more, what better than your first Duna aero-capture and subsequent landing? You\u0027re in for the longhaul buddy, this game will consume your 2015.......\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
