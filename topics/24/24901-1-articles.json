I have been enjoying the demo for sometime now. The engineers in the space center keep submitting proposals for more research funding, but alas are being denied. But there is hope that soon funding may become free to be appropriated to R\u0026amp;D. But in the mean time they have managed to do fairly well, including several successful missions to the Mun and back, including an emergency rescue mission. And there is promising research and experimentation on atmospheric capable vehicles, though they do have a limited range and not so pleasant landings. Again the need for more money for research needed to make a suitable landing gear for such an endeavor they keep telling me, but the flights are fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a couple shots, the first, the reason for the rescue mission, though the pilot did get a nice view of the sun rise from the Mun, including an eclipse. And the subsequent building and landing of the rescue lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1280.photobucket.com/albums/a493/mvosters/2013-03-26_00006_zps5315c5d1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-03-26_00006_zps5315c5d1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1280.photobucket.com/albums/a493/mvosters/2013-03-26_00027_zpsceb31c41.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-03-26_00027_zpsceb31c41.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1280.photobucket.com/albums/a493/mvosters/2013-03-26_00026_zpscefc2a94.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-03-26_00026_zpscefc2a94.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the Falcon series of craft, starting with the Falcon 1, then Falcon 2, which had an increase in range and stability, and finally the Falcon 2 XRV which is orbit and return capable (as well as longer surface range for exploration).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1280.photobucket.com/albums/a493/mvosters/2013-04-01_00007_zps22291375.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-04-01_00007_zps22291375.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1280.photobucket.com/albums/a493/mvosters/2013-04-04_00002_zpsb55fff94.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-04-04_00002_zpsb55fff94.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1280.photobucket.com/albums/a493/mvosters/2013-04-29_00002_zpsca434925.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-04-29_00002_zpsca434925.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T18:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
