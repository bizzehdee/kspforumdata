Being in this group means that every post you make will go straight to the moderation queue for approval by a moderator before they appear publicly. Being in this usergroup also prevents you from editing your avatar, signature, and some other profile elements. Those measures are there to prevent at best spambots to access the forums. After writing your three first posts, your title will automatically be changed to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBottle Rocketeer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and your permissions will automatically become the same as every other users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have problems with your permissions on the forums and believe those actions shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be restricted to you, please contact a member of the moderation team.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
