When ascending, keep an eye on your intake air (top right Resources tab). When it starts getting really low, shut them down and fire up the rockets. This can be done fastest by messing around with the action groups. You don\u0027t wanna wait until intake air is at zero, because the jets have a nasty tendency to not flame out in sync, which will put you into a spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, make sure your wings are big enough to give you lots of lift. You\u0027ll be re-entering without much, if any, fuel, so you should be prepared to glide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if addons and mods are your thing, I recommend checking out the B9 Aerospace pack. It\u0027s so good that SQUAD hired the creator, and its parts are geared towards aircraft and spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25241-0-20-2-B9-Aerospace-Pack-R3-New-pods-IVAs-engines-fuselages-structures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25241-0-20-2-B9-Aerospace-Pack-R3-New-pods-IVAs-engines-fuselages-structures\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T03:42:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to take a look at the Drawing Board (link in my sig) and see if any of the tutorials and guides there address any of your issues.
