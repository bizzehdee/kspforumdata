I\u0027m a science fiction and fantasy writer still trying to establish myself, though other than one self published book containing a pair of short stories, I\u0027m still unpublished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also someone who dreamed of being an astronaut since childhood. It was quite a blow when I first found out they don\u0027t take disabled people into space, but the dream remained. So, when I found this game in Kurtjmac\u0027s YouTube playlists a few days ago, I knew right away that I\u0027d found the game for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to my disability, I haven\u0027t been able to play as much as I\u0027d like, but I love what I\u0027ve experienced so far. My first day, after a few attempts, I managed to get a satellite into orbit. Today, I decided to go for a manned mission. Since my first rocket barely had enough fuel and thrust to get into orbit, I kind of overcompensated. I made it to orbit with my final stage still full of fuel. So, I went to Mun and back. ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s my experience so far. I think, after the patch, I may give the campaign on the wiki a try. Right now, I\u0027m playing around with mods, but I\u0027ll probably go fresh (except for MechJeb, which really helps me compensate for my disability) after the patch hits. At least, for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T18:42:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T18:56:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou did all of that on your first couple of tries?

As for my quick successes, I think it\u0027s more that I just saw Kurt fail over and over and over again (and his occasional successes) in his videos and figured out where he went wrong. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (Also, the maneuver node system is a big help.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next skill goal is going to be pinpoint landings.
