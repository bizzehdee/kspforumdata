Beware of a very long post!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see my nickname is Raticon, i\u0027m 25 years old and live in northern Sweden, deep in the woods. I have always had a big interest in space and space exploration in general, but the Soviet space program in particular. Why? First and foremost i think their craft looks more remniscent of \u002760s Sci-Fi movies and got some touches from \u0022The world of tomorrow\u0022, i might have a slight political bias too... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E but in general i have always seen space exploration as the achievments of mankind as a whole and not any particular ideology or nation, regardless of what the nation itself think about it. Gagarins orbit and the footprints left on the moon by Aldrin and Armstrong is all a part of of history and hopefully a future where cooperation is the guiding principle instead of competition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a space-nut i have always sought after good space-themed games. Be they realistic simulations, action packed space combat arcade or massive strategy-games i have almost everytime found a liking to some particular aspect of the game but disregarded the simplicity of it all. Don\u0027t get me wrong, i know a game has to be user friendly to attract new players but i think that games with focus on space are too simple. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceflight in most games are simple Starlancer \u0026amp; Freelancer-style \u0022\u003Cem\u003Epoint with your mouse and hold W to go to warp speed\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 or \u0022\u003Cem\u003Emount this giant laz0r bigger than your ship and blast some worlds to pieces, then hold W to go to hyper-warp\u003C/em\u003E\u0022. I had huge hopes for the space-part of the game \u0022Spore\u0022, and in my fantasy i saw carefully assembled landers and calculated orbits as my crew of frog-eyed purple tripedals descended trough the atmosphere to meet aliens or collect samples. The dissapointment hit me in the skull like a sledge when i simply rolled the mousewheel and clicked somewhere and in 5 seconds i was orbiting some volcanic world in a distant system and got hit by huge rocks ejected from lava-geysers on the world, taking away 1 hitpoint out of 700 of my ship... Endless Space seemed like a good strategy-game that started out small and \u0022primitive\u0022 and ended in warp travel, wormholes and whatnot. I tried it out but i became frustrated about the fact that it\u0027s bacially a take on all the other similar games in the genre: Space Empires, Galactic Cililizations, Masters of orion and all those. I don\u0027t mean to disrespect these games and those who makes them, but i really think that they need some revitalization to the genre, it becomes a gray matter of repetitiveness and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrustration. Anger. Tears (almost). ALT-F4 spammed and games deleted. In this disgruntled mood i searched the web for simple queries. \u0022Space simulation\u0022 \u0022Space exploration game\u0022 and so forth, until i one day stumbled across a simulation most of you are familiar with, i suppose: \u003Cstrong\u003EOrbiter\u003C/strong\u003E, the god of...well, orbits and physics i guess \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fired it up as soon as i got it home and tried it out, anticipation was on the top after viewing \u003Ca href=\u0022http://timmhumphreys.vidmeup.com/view?q=4eb984dc89504.flv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETimm Humphreys Orbiter video about a Soviet Lunar landing\u003C/a\u003E. At first i couldn\u0027t get off the launchpad. Once i sorted that matter out i had a hard time getting into anything that with even a kind mind could be called Low earth orbit. I downloaded a couple of mods and started hanging on the forums, learned the basics of calculations related and dusted off my calculator to try them out with mixed success. That was a long time ago and i am now quite capable of recreating simple missions like Vostok 1 and Sputnik as the Interkosmos-nut i am \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne day people was starting to talk about some new game on the Orbiter forums, \u0022kerbal space program\u0022 and most players seemed to like it, some were less enthusiastic, as was i to be honest. I took a quick look at it and though \u0022Bah! Too simple, a kids game with phony physics!\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E. But more and more youtube-videos got me fired up and the game progressed fast. Especially Kurtjmac\u0027s videos on Youtube got me excited and got me laughing lots of times. I though that \u0022if Kurt, who\u0027s quite the adept gamer fails at this and his rockets, shuttles and silly constructions break up like lego and tumbles violently into space and into the earth again, it must be a good game!\u0022 so i downloaded the demo and had both tears and laughter. But i wanted more, watching all those videos and reading all those stories about 0.16 and all it\u0027s splendor and features and the upcoming 0.17 version made me buy the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm addicted like crazy now. Hooked to the game in such a bad way that it has dominated my mind for the last weeks or so. As i work in 7-day workshifts far away from home with a 7-day free time in between the shifts you can guess how many mad plans i have drawn up on my weeks away from home. Munar landings, Minmus transfer orbits and building a decent rocket which won\u0027t explode on the pad or break up in the upper atmosphere is all challenges that almost reach out and grabs Orbiter by the tail, and does a great job of making it both fun and interesting in the same move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESquad\u003C/strong\u003E, you have made the ultimate game for me. It\u0027s fun, it\u0027s difficult and spaceflight and orbits now require calculations, timed burns and a lot of nailbiting and prayer to not make you crash or making you that famous pile of broken up lego in orbit. You, with this masterpiece strayed away from the gray flock of games and simulations that have degenerated spaceflight into simple point-and-hold-button type of games where everything happens by the whims of the AI, you boldly ventured where no man has gone before (pun intended) and made me the game of my dreams. Noone will ever see a product like this come from one of the bigger \u0022houses\u0022 as it has too few aliens, too little laserbeams and you actually have to use your brain and some math to make that flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou rule! Thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAccomplishments!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s two pictures of my most recent accomplishments. It took me two weeks to accomplish them and countless of designs. I will post a pic of my Minmus rocket later on. I have not used any mods or Mechjeb at all during my program as i like to keep it stock. In a streak of egocentricity i named all my earlier crafts to something beginning with \u0022Rat\u0022 and ending with something taken from the Soviet array of crafts, Soyuz, Zond, Vostok and those. Hence, the lunar orbiter i made before the landing attempt was dubbed \u0022Ratzond\u0022, and was basically this craft except the landing legs and with a bigger engine. The rocket for this lander is therefore named \u0022Ratyuz\u0022 and the lander is the one thing that broke the naming conventions and traditions and, somewhat disturbingly, performed best of all crafts. I will present a full list of my space program so far in a separate post below, if that\u0027s appropriate \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELander:\u003C/strong\u003E the \u0022\u003Cem\u003EMunik\u003C/em\u003E\u0022, a homage to the Mun and Sputnik who celebrates 55 years this very year! It\u0027s a rather simple design in my eyes but it took me down safely to Minmus in my first and only attempt so far and the Mun in 2 out of 5 attempts! I know that lander isn\u0027t perfect, especially not with those wings attached to the top which creates a lot of drag and instability, they are there mostly for show as landers without them tend to look rather silly and.... phallic? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E.

The program has been running for about 1 week of effective time and 1 week of planning and sketching time. I use no mods in my game as of yet, not even MechJeb because i want to do stuff myself and get a grip of things. But i do suffer from a lack of Rovers and will give those a shot soon with Tosh\u0027s rover appealing to me the most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe naming conventions and my affinity for standard designs need some explanation as in my above post. In a streak of egocentricity i dubbed all my rockets and systems something that molded together \u0022Rat\u0022 or \u0022Ra\u0022 and then something from the Soviet program, which fascinates me very much. Thus, the rocket system that carries my landers and pods to orbit, the mun and beyond is named \u0022Ratyuz\u0022 with 1, 2 and 3 denominating the numbers of stages and complexity involved. thus, Ratyuz 1 would be 1 stage w/ boosters for simple orbiting op\u0027s and taking minimalistic pods and such to orbit. Ratyuz 2 would be a medium sized rocket with 2 stages \u002B boosters with the second stage consisting of 6 stacks of liquid tanks \u002B rockets circulating the inner one by radial decouplers totalling 7 rockets with the outer 6 decoupling in orbit and the center stage carrying me to the mun, as i discovered like many others that long stacks are unwieldy. Ratyuz 3 is my Minmus-and-beyond system consisting basiacally of another Ratyuz 2 mounted atop of the first Ratyuz 2 stack totalling... a lot of rockets and awkward staging procedures. This is the system that has caused me most headache...

Ratyuz 3 is much more capable but overly complex and expensive for munar missions. Work must continue to ensure a better system for Munar missions. The \u0022Raturan\u0022 shuttle-program is underway and the results are going to be interesting.

Congrats!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I totally agree on your third paragraph of the first post. Most space-themed games either insult our intellegence, or are impossible for a normal user to.. use. I agree that KSP has been the first to find teh middle ground between realism and fun. Rarely, on ANY game, do I say that. More props out to the sqaud dev *and* community teams. Some great minds, and great people out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried orbiter. This is how it went: Launch game. Look at earth. click mouse buttons. click keyboard buttons. close. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I could\u0027ve given it another chance, but if they don\u0027t even have a title screen, I don\u0027t know why I\u0027d play the rest.... On second thought, It might\u0027ve just been loading... uhhhh, might want to try it again now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your ships, I\u0027d say nice move on using stock parts. Mods are great for opening up new types of spacecraft, and (of course) more parts to mess with. IMO It\u0027s best to be creative with the stock parts first. Using mods to get to the mun gives *way* less satisfaction after an achievement (such as landing on minmus).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome pointers for your spacecraft: avoid fins on your lander (unless you like the look of them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). They add weight, and actually a bit of unstability. As of now, drag is only partially implemented. So a fuel tank added to the side of your ship adds a bit of overall drag your ship, but inline fuel tanks add the same amount. So, as of now, the best way to do staging is by adding each new stage radially. I usually add fuel lines from outer stages to inner ones, so only the outer tanks are being drained, but every engine is firing, all the time. (If you\u0027re up to it, calculate the F/W ratio. Around 2.0 is best for sea level). You can find theads with complicated math in the \u0022challenges\u0022 section of the forums. There are many more forum users that are *much* better than I am at that kind of stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, try not to get too attached to a certain ship. With the constant updates, you are likely to need to re-create your ships, due to saave files changing and new parts replacing old ones, and stuff like that. Best way to do it is to just keep making ship after ship; give them simple descriptive names. You\u0027ll still want to save them, though. I had a ship that launched fine, but simply exploded once it got to a certain altitude. Saved it as \u0022time bomb\u0022 and started from scratch again. Later, I found out what part causes a lot of problems. (large in-line decoupler). I I edited the time bomb to re-enforce that part, and it works great as a lunar lander now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, hope you have lots of fun in the future, and as Capt\u0027n skynky said: Happy launching!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raticon","CreatedById":42185,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T12:43:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you Newt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took your advice and modified my lander and rocket a bit by removing those fins from the top and placing them at the bottom with the booster rockets. The ascent phase is a bit less dramatic now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. My rocket had the radial-liquid fuel rocket system like you described but i hadn\u0027t toyed around with fuel lines and the centre stage firing with the radial ones yet, so i pulled some fuel lines from the outer 6 stages to the centre stage and set the centre engine to fire simultaneously as the radial ones. Works like a charm and that little extra bit of thrust i get saves me some fuel once i get into orbit. The rocket still needs some work as it has a tendency to start tipping over and wobble insanely due to the slightest adjustment in trajectory before hitting 30km up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also, quite tearfully and dramatically loosened my grip on my beloved standardized systems and begun planning for the future, a future when i actually have to adapt to changing situations and new updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, Orbiter has a very clumsy interface and no map like KSP has, making orbital corrections very difficult as in stock.
