Solid boosters are a single thing, but liquid boosters need both an engine at the end and fuel tanks ontop of the engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you are using the plane fuel tanks (plane tanks have only liquid fuel.

Solid boosters don\u0027t need to be throttled because they always fire at 100%, but with liquid boosters you can deceide yourself how hard the engines burn. Shift throttle up, ctrl throttle down.
