It rolled and bounced for what seemed like an eternity, but it landed on its wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quickly decided to whizz over to the nearest mountain to get my bearings. I reached the top, found which way the \u0027day\u0027 side was and started heading towards it. Little did I know that due to the lack of any strong gravity on the Mun, 30m/s was too fast to descend such a bumpy hill. It took off, rolled, bounced again. I (mistakenly) raised the wheels so that they wouldn\u0027t interfere and so that it would land right way up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was not to be. After many, many bounces, it teetered on the brink of salvation, before collapsing on to its roof.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt now lies there as a reminder of what I have accomplished so far, and how far I have yet to explore this wonderful game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T22:57:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi SimonC6R and welcome to the KSP community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really glad you are enjoying KSP so much, it is an amazing game and it just gets better with every update, speaking of updates, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/15757-KSP-0-17-Update\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u0027s what you can look forwards to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T15:34:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
