KSP is probably the best game I will ever play in my life, (and I\u0027m thirteen for anyone who asks). And please don\u0027t be surprised that a person so \u0027young\u0027 could understand this game, because youths know more than you think... And yes, I do understand Orbital Physics. I\u0027ve been reading this forum since a few weeks after I got KSP, so I think that kind of know the place, but I do know that this is an amazing place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just a question, Is anyone else here from Trinidad and Tobago?
