My name is Parker and I just bought the game recently. I wanted to introduce myself to the community and just try to get a feel for the people who also play this game and maybe learn some important or even rather helpful tips or information. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I\u0027ve launched my first communications satellite and built a space station core with all the extra docking part bits, and got that into orbit too. I\u0027m running into issues where I have lots of derbies in the same orbit as my probe and station, and I\u0027m currently trying to construct a vessel that can safely de-orbit them without ramming and exploding them into bits. I\u0027ve since learned to add remote control systems and electricity and all the bits needed to do it myself without need for crew member on board, but the older stuff is still out there and quite bothersome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways I just wanted to introduce myself and share a bit about my experience so far in the game. I\u0027ve watched Youtube videos for a quite some time before buying the full game on Steam (bless them sales) so I have a general idea of good habits to have and bad habits to avoid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Parker\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaOC9danxNo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T17:19:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
