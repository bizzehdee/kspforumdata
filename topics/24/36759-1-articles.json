This is a really fun game but it has a sort of steep learning curve. I am grateful for everyone who has taken the time to make tutorials to help me learn and understand (especially Scott Manley, whose videos have been SUPER helpful to me!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little about me: I live near \u0022the Pitt\u0022 but I grew up somewhere colder than space itself (Buffalo, NY). I\u0027ve always had an interest in space exploration and science fiction and I remember watching Columbia\u0027s first launch on live television... I was in an astronomy class in college when Challenger exploded... and I had a dream about a space shuttle crash a few weeks before Columbia went down. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I\u0027d never qualify as an astronaut but I\u0027m as fit to crash rockets as any of you! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I\u0027ve only done a little in the game. I built a simple rocket and sent Jeb up 833km before he came back down. I put Stayputnik into a tidy 200km orbit. I watched a video and sent a mission to Minimus, whereupon I crashed directly into the surface because I had time acceleration turned on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really enjoy the mission packs, they give a sense of continuity and economy and are a good example for what career mode should be. I have tried MechJeb and find it helpful. Even if I don\u0027t always use it I don\u0027t understand the purists who think it spoils the game. As someone observed: \u0022The Apollo astronauts didn\u0027t have to freehand it to the Moon, why should you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope to be able to contribute to the community here.

So here are a couple of valuable lessons I\u0027ve learned in my first couple of days:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Q: Why won\u0027t my engine start back up to circularize my orbit at apoapsis?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A: Likely answer - you\u0027re flying a probe, right? I\u0027ll bet all electrical power drained while the engine was off. Try adding a solar panel and/or a battery pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Q: How the frak do I get my solar panel to open, then?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A: You need to add the actions. Click on the little blue \u0022Action Groups\u0022 gear icon along the top center of the VAB (next to the Parts button), select one of the Custom actions and click on the solar panel. Then add the actions from the third column by clicking on them. Now, when you\u0027re in space (preferably outside atmo, but I\u0027ve safely deployed them at 50k altitude over Kerbin) you can right click on the solar panel housing and select the blue button for \u0022Extend Panel\u0022. Best to retract them when you\u0027re ready to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope these little lessons learned save some other rookie pilot from crashing what would otherwise have been a successful mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceisbeautifulul","CreatedById":68592,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T04:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor question 1: another common mistake is not hitting the numpad period to bring up the navball on map view.
