Not sure where to post this, but I\u0027ll try here because I think people will be nice!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve been playing a couple of weeks now, and have done sample returns from Minmus and the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy latest mission is a \u0022routine\u0022 Mun sample return, but I woke up in the middle of the night and realised I forgot to put the additional radial parachutes on my lander (Science jnr \u002B 2 T200 tanks and engines). So I only have the one nose-cone chute, which is not going to land me on Kerbin safely. I think I need some kind of rescue mission! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy objectives are: 1) get Jeb back safe 2) get all the science back safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I can see there are 3 options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Send another Mun capsule to do a rescue on the moon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Return the lander to Kerbin orbit, and attempt a rendezvous and eva rescue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Attempt a hybrid parachute/ rocket slowed landing on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if I can transfer all the science in a rescue mission, so I\u0027m thinking of going for option 3... but it seems risky! Half tempted by option 2, but I\u0027ve never done a rendezvous before and again I don\u0027t know if I can transfer all the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doozler","CreatedById":103369,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T09:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I went with the gung-ho chute\u002Brockets landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA single chute was actually able to hold pretty much the whole craft, I just had to get the speed low enough for the chute to open fully. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb made it back safe, with enough science to unlock docking ports and the extendable solar panels.

You then have to unlock the parts in Science and Research if this is a career game or they are readily available in sandbox. You then should look for a small container box that is silver and flat in nature, this fits to a bracket on the side of your ship and you right click it and can manually add numerous essential repair parts, in this case, radial parachutes, which you can then take to your capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you ever run out of fuel, you can use this same procedure and set up a refuel line in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!
