I started KSP shortly before 0.9 and saw a bunch of changes till now. I love to play KSP, but since 1.0.3 all of my Probes explode during ascent. There is a heat warning, even if i put it inside fairings. Usually at a height of 46-50km the engine starts to \u0022spitting\u0022 (?) an finally all what went up is breaking apart.....\n\nI am rather helpless now.\n\nHas someone expirienced similiar things or even has a helpful hint? ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)\n\nActually it is like \u0022Gravity\u0022 - all my communication satellites (RemoteTech) are lost. I don\u0027t like the new thermodynamic. All I have put in space will probably collapse due to overheating of - listen - girder segments. My Space Station lost all of it\u0027s solar panels and is now without energy, which is a problem because I am using TACLS, too. I don\u0027t like the idea of restarting from the beginning, so I am going to quit. Or not.\n\nMessage to Squad: Will there be Thermal Insulation Shields like used on Skylab? Make them KAS/KIS working so I probably can rescue at least my Space Station.\n\nAnd make more IVA interiors!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T12:31:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 12:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tranquil**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T13:41:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Usually at a height of 46-50km the engine starts to \u0022spitting\u0022 (?) an finally all what went up is breaking apart.....\n\u003E I am rather helpless now.\n\u003E \n\u003E Has someone expirienced similiar things or even has a helpful hint? ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)\n\nI\u0027m not really sure what you mean by \u0022spitting\u0022.
