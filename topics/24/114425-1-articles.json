I started KSP shortly before 0.9 and saw a bunch of changes till now. I love to play KSP, but since 1.0.3 all of my Probes explode during ascent. There is a heat warning, even if i put it inside fairings. Usually at a height of 46-50km the engine starts to \u0022spitting\u0022 (?) an finally all what went up is breaking apart.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am rather helpless now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas someone expirienced similiar things or even has a helpful hint? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually it is like \u0022Gravity\u0022 - all my communication satellites (RemoteTech) are lost. I don\u0027t like the new thermodynamic. All I have put in space will probably collapse due to overheating of - listen - girder segments. My Space Station lost all of it\u0027s solar panels and is now without energy, which is a problem because I am using TACLS, too. I don\u0027t like the idea of restarting from the beginning, so I am going to quit. Or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMessage to Squad: Will there be Thermal Insulation Shields like used on Skylab?
