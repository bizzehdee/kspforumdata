I am Redwork. I don\u0027t generally buy games before trying them, and this one was no exception. I torrented v0.22 to see if I would like the full game. I DID! So when I found out that there was a 0.23 version, it was time to ante up, give back to the developers, and vote with my dollars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really appreciate what Squad has done, and I love the direction that this is going. There\u0027s a HUGE learning curve for someone with basically no background in physics, aerospace, or flight simulators. My favorite part? Designing effective and efficient vessels!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep up the phenomenal work guys.
