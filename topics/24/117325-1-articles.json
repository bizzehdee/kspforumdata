I love physics to the point I am seriously thinking to go to college again and study physics because I could not do it in the first time...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am dreaming to plant the science love seed in my sons once they start to understand and they start to learn... and I hope to produce 2 scientists or more \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E...
