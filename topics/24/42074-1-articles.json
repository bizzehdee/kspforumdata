Or maybe it was a coincidence, and there was some planned outage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, HI. My name is Ohlen. I\u0027ve been playing KSP since I got it in the Steam sale. From the Steam videos, I thought it was going to be a casual game, boy was I ever so wrong. I have been forced to learn rocket terminology, and am loving it. It took me a week before I gave in and sought the wiki on how to achieve successive orbits. I have since placed a satellite in synchronous orbit, and have built a rocket that can take a kerbal to a Mun orbit and back. My lander is under-powered and can\u0027t land safely, much less take off again. I am working on getting Jed safely to the surface and back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat power plant did you use for Mun and Minimus Landings?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took a break and completed the Apollo 11 tutorial from the Wiki. That rocket was very hard to get into orbit, and I had to add solar panels because I kept running out of battery after I got to the Mun. I was having difficulty having to maneuver with my main engines, and not running out of fuel. After I added the panels, though, I was able to complete the mission, and get all the pieces home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been trying to run a clean program. So far I have only 2 pieces of debris in orbit. One is left over from the satellite launch, and is in a decaying orbit. The other is the decoupler left over from the Apollo 11 mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just a typical forum lurker, crawling back into the shadows.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T01:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi.
