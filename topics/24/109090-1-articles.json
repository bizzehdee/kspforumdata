As some might think, I am not a newbie. I started playing KSP in November of 2014. I know a lot about rocket science now. I hope I get a warm welcome from you guys! Like all of us, I started as trial-and-error rocket scientist, but with the help of Kerbal Engineer, I became good at calculating Delta-V and TWR ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif) . I love playing KSP, I can play up to three hours per day:confused:. As you might notice, I\u0027m still learning english. I love both, planes and rockets, and both are fun to fly (and crash). Also, I\u0027m a big fan of Scott Manley, without him, I would not have gone FAR in KSP (no pun intendet). Bye!"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T22:56:10Z","Content":"Hey ZentroCatson, and welcome to the forums!\n\nGlad to see you made a forum account! I too have learned many things from KSP as well. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nP.S. Your English is **very** good, I would not have noticed if you didn\u0027t say so in your first post! Oh, and we do have an [International](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/18-International) section too if you feel more conformable speaking your own language.\n\nHope to see you around, and all the best."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T23:03:39Z","Content":"Welcome ZentroCatson! Good to have you aboard. I\u0027ll echo SpaceExplorer and say that your English writing is very good. Probably better than some native English-speakers I\u0027ve seen.\n\nSee you around the forums.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T00:16:55Z","Content":"Greetings, and welcome!"},{"CreatedByName":"ZentroCatson","CreatedById":143939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T07:07:38Z","Content":"Thanks for replying! Really, my english is so good? Didn\u0027t realize it. Anyway, I\u0027m actually german, but being on the english forum is more interesting. There is more going on:P!
