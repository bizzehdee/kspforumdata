As some might think, I am not a newbie. I started playing KSP in November of 2014. I know a lot about rocket science now. I hope I get a warm welcome from you guys! Like all of us, I started as trial-and-error rocket scientist, but with the help of Kerbal Engineer, I became good at calculating Delta-V and TWR \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E . I love playing KSP, I can play up to three hours per day:confused:. As you might notice, I\u0027m still learning english. I love both, planes and rockets, and both are fun to fly (and crash). Also, I\u0027m a big fan of Scott Manley, without him, I would not have gone FAR in KSP (no pun intendet).
