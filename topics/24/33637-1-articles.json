Watching a couple of video reviews, it looked like it was a really raw, unfinished game. I bought it anyway and am very glad I did. I followed the in-game tutorial and confidently took my rocket to the launch pad. However, I didn\u0027t have a printout of any controls. After mashing buttons I found that the spacebar did something, so I pressed it several times. This is without having discovered the throttle on a LFB! After two more attempts at launch and seeing my ship just jump a little and wobble in circles, I backed up a bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m greatly looking forward to seeing the game develop and expect to play it a long time.
