Welcome to the forums, if you need help getting into orbit I have a few tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Try to use solid fuel rockets as boosters to get you going and always expel them and other burnt up rocket stages ASAP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I find that having multiple engines works better than one engine (tri-couplers as an example) rocket designs. It\\\u0027s possible to get a single engine to go to the moon, but you need lots of fuel which in turn slows down your already slow spacecraft and also makes it top heavy and wobbly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Start small! The first thing I did was create a rocket that moved. Then a rocket that went up. Then punched into the next layer of atmosphere. Then into space. Then into orbit. Then to the Mun. I haven\\\u0027t made my Mun craft return (nor will I) because EVAS on the moon are so fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Get good at orbits. Specifically making them change, and try to get a perfect orbit if you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-For going to the Mun I suggest that you practice landing on Kerban first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The more tries, the more success! Try more! The more rockets you try and get into orbit, the more you will learn about what works and what doesn\\\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Use struts! You see your rocket wobbling a lot? Then use struts! They look cool and only help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ladders, pretty self explanatory but you would be surprised at how many people forget them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Learn the helpful keys such as: R for RCS and jetpack while on EVA, L for light while on EVA, Caps Lock for finer controls, T to toggle ASAS/SAS, [ and] to exchange between different objects (mainly used for EVAS with multiple Kerbans), and the all helpful X key to quickly shut down your engines (useful for orbital adjustments and landing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Screen shots! Though this doesn\\\u0027t help at all by pressing F2 to get rid of HUD and F1 to snap a pic, you can share the most precious memories to people across the globe. Not to mention yourself!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-And finally don\\\u0027t use ANY mods without backing up your save and playing the vanilla game for a few days to get used to the parts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck and now some quick pictures to end my tips!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first (and only as of 8/1/2012) Muner rocket:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotices the layers?
