Don\u0027t have the full game yet as I\u0027m between jobs with no money, but I\u0027ve been playing with the demo a lot, as well as watching a *ton* of Scott Manley\u0027s videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big draw of this game for me is that it brings back memories of the days I used to build and fly model and high-power rockets. The experimentation of working on my own designs was very similar to that in the game, although I like to think I was good enough to not have *too* many \u0022core sampler\u0022 rockets - and at least they didn\u0027t explode. I quit that hobby due to the expense and lack of time, although I *do* occasionally miss the smell of black powder (for the model rockets) and ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (used for the high-power rocket motors).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP seems like a fairly inexpensive way to relive those experiences, with the added benefit of being able to launch something into orbit. Although *some* of the sensations are missing - the sun beating down on me on hot days and the sunburn on my face after looking skywards for several hours on those same hot days. Freezing my rear-end off on cold days and wondering if I got frostbite on my toes. The aforementioned scents, but also adding the smell of balsa/bass/plywood dust, epoxy, and spray paint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway... yeah.

I wanted to be an astronaut as well. I still - barely (I was 4 at the time) - remember watching Apollo 11, which I think was the start of my interest in space, science fiction, and rocketry. As it turns out, the closest I ever got to space was flying as a passenger on a 747 across the Atlantic and back while I was in the Air Force heading to my duty station. I certainly can\u0027t afford a ticket on Spaceship Two, either, so yeah... it ain\u0027t happening. I also read a lot of SF, and in fact, one series of books has had an impact on what I do in my free time now - 3D modeling. I\u0027m currently making 3D models for a group called BuNine, who work directly for and with David Weber on background technical, political, historical, and military organizational information of his Honor Harrington books. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I\u0027ve been watching videos for KSP and playing the demo, I keep thinking it would be nice to maybe make some models for the game. Then I remember I\u0027m not good enough yet for something like that. I *can* model, but I tend to go for extremely high poly counts, which even in normal games isn\u0027t exactly welcome - for KSP, from what I\u0027ve been reading, it would be a computer-killer. My current mesh for a Star Knight class heavy cruiser tops out at over 2.6 million polys. One reason for the high poly counts is that I do all the details as physical objects, because I can\u0027t texture to save my life. So, any rocket parts I try to make for the game would be ridiculously heavy (polycount-wise), and very plain-looking. Still, maybe someday...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Specialist290\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Specialist290\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, the smell of black powder \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E gets old \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed... it\u0027s just that I haven\u0027t smelled it in a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Specialist290\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Specialist290\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFeel free to poke around and see what interests you.
