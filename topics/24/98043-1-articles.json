I\u0027ve been going to school for Chemical Engineering for a few years now. I\u0027ve always wanted to be a rocket scientist, but never thought I\u0027d be able to do it. It\u0027s a difficult job to get into, especially because the American Government keeps changing its mind about whether we\u0027re going to space or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/541882503848665287/52C03A68775F6483DA3B79B16CA452C362CDAE5F/\u0022 alt=\u002252C03A68775F6483DA3B79B16CA452C362CDAE5F\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I found Kerbal. I failed time and time again to get into orbit--but I finally did it. Then I landed on the moon (surprisingly, I succeeded on the first try with Jeb). Something changed in me on that day. I received loads of support from my wife and parents, encouraging me to go for my dream, even if it seemed unlikely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I progressed through my Masters degree, I got to be friends with several people in the rocket industry. I had several interviews that fell through at the last second due to changes at the company. But I did not give up. I kept at it, I became determined that I would be a rocket scientist, and pursued that again and again. Like KSP, there is joy in the journey--and I did not let that stop me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, I got an offer from the company building the rocket boosters for the new SLS. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to make a short story long,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHarvesteR, SQUAD, fellow Kerbalnauts--mark me down as someone who\u0027s life was changed for the better by KSP.
