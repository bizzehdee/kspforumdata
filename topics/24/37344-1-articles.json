Yes, they will (probably), part count available has increased in the past. In fact, they frequently add parts and ideas that used to be mods. Mods may or may not be compatible right away. Expect to play modless for a few days to a few weeks after .21, until mods get updated to be compatible. Bets place to watch for that is the forums, not the Spaceport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.
