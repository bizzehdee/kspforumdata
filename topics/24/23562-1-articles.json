As far as age, I\u0027m old enough to remember my dad dragging my very groggy, very young, rear end out of bed to watch one of the Apollo missions on TV (maybe it was 17) and seeing the Enterprise fly over attached to a 747 with the cone on it\u0027s tail. In short, I knew I was buying this game as soon as I read about it on Subsim and that I\u0027d be hooked if it was any good at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m hooked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gotten a ways in to the game, nothing planetary yet but probes soft landed on both the Mun and Minimus and 2 successful manned (Kerbed?) missions to the Mun. Once with a one man rocket that I landed on it\u0027s tail and the second with a 2 man lander that I built (fortunately I\u0027d found the the landing legs and ladders at that point). The hardest thing so far has been docking but I think I have it now so long as I stay patient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaring to look at mods a little now, currently just using Kerbal Flight Engineer and mainly just for delta v in the VAB and watching terminal velocity on launch to try to stay efficient. My house rules (on all games with very few exceptions) is to get things to the point I\u0027m comfortable doing them manually before I automate them, so MechJeb is likely on the shopping list as soon as I get bored and a little more consistent with my launches. Actually that is really kind of a oddball life rule for me, learn everything in a way that I understand as many of the ins and outs as possible before looking for ways to make it easier, a practice which very probably saved my life once\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a couple of questions, but I\u0027ll toss them out on the appropriate forums as they come to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy yes, it is in fact rocket surgery!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T05:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
