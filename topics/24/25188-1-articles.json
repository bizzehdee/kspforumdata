I\u0027m a physics teacher who just bought a bunch of copies of the game for my students to work through a \u0022space race challenge\u0022 over the last four weeks of our school year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Any advice you might have on putting the program together would be very much appreciated... for example, I was think of giving the kids a set of challenges and asking them to proceed through as many challenges as they can in order. Challenges could include: an unmanned rocket launch; a manned rocket launch (safe, of course), putting a Kerbal in orbit (and bringing him home safely), putting a Kerbal on the Mun, putting a Kerbal on various planets, docking with a satellite, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m also planning on having the students document their journey in their individual blogs as they go along. To that end, can anyone tell me where to find screenshots taken on a Mac? I know I\u0027m supposed to look in the /Screenshots folder inside my KSP folder, but as I have the game on STEAM, I haven\u0027t been able to navigate to the correct place (and I bet their blog posts would be much more interesting with pictures).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thanks for any hints, advice, and I\u0027m looking forward to a fun four weeks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T22:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the community FizziksGuy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinding the screenshots should be a matter of right clicking KSP in Steam, selecting Properties, then Local Files, then Browse Local Files \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure where to begin with suggestions for your class though, but it sounds like a really fun project and we\u0027d love to have updates on how it turns out \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you are on the right track though with a set of missions and defined goals, allowing your students to progress through their own space race, but you could add more to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy assigning costs to parts and payments for missions completed, you could set up a true space race between \u0022civilian contractors\u0022, with higher rewards for the first to accomplish a new mission and allow smaller \u0022companies\u0022 to pool their resources in the quest to put satellites or Kerbals in space \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething like this might be too competitive, but it\u0027d be a great way to see how private space companies might work with or against each other, as the future of Man in space is in their hands now really \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FizziksGuy","CreatedById":63006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T22:38:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWelcome to the community FizziksGuy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy assigning costs to parts and payments for missions completed, you could set up a true space race between \u0022civilian contractors\u0022, with higher rewards for the first to accomplish a new mission and allow smaller \u0022companies\u0022 to pool their resources in the quest to put satellites or Kerbals in space \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething like this might be too competitive, but it\u0027d be a great way to see how private space companies might work with or against each other, as the future of Man in space is in their hands now really \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, found the screenshots, and I LOVE the idea of throwing some finances in there as well...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T23:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Morokth","CreatedById":62433,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T06:56:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI, for one, must commend you on the real world applications of this gaming system as you intend to use it in your class room.
