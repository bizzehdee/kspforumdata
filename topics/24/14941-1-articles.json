Some tips from what I have learned in space plane design...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. try keeping your weight and your thrust as close to center as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. if you are not getting lift off then you need more lift generation (ie. wings) or less weight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. using shift \u002B qweasd to angle the engines very slightly up or down can help balance out the craft if the weight/ thrust is far from center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pushingrobot","CreatedById":11067,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-23T23:18:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\\\u0027ll never get to orbit unless your spaceplane is very balanced, both left-right and top-bottom. Once the atmosphere really starts to thin (around 30km) and control surfaces lose their effectiveness, even a small offset between the longitudinal axes of your center of mass and thrust will send you tumbling. Since your craft\\\u0027s center of mass will shift around as fuel tanks are emptied, the easiest way to keep a space plane vertically balanced is to put all the heavy parts in one flat plane (pun intended).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should really make the time to finish and post my air/space plane tutorial.
