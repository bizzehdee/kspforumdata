Some helpful words of advice:\n\nEve . . . Eve is a hellhole. Avoid it. Landing is easy but returning to orbit is a feat of engineering and piloting that even some of the best of us have yet to do. Also, while Jool has a \u0027sea level\u0027, there is nothing down there but explosions and krakens.\n\nAs you\u0027ve already discovered, this game is life-consuming.

I\u0027m about to fling some unmanned things at Gilly and Eve, but Eve does not sound like fun. Especially not the taking off bit. That might be beyond me for a bit. Going to post my Duna ship for critique shortly, I think.\n\nEach station consists of at least five launches of varying weight, largest being 30t, smallest more like five - core/habitat, comms/power, science lab, docking hub and fuel/resupply. Rendezvous and docking were really daunting at first but now I really enjoy it. Each stationa lso has a crew ferry and Mun and Minmus have reusable landers bristling with science stuff (though one LV-909 for Mun isn\u0027t fun for descent and it might need a replacement). I\u0027ve been cycling four crews through each station for XP in preparation for the Duna mission.\n\nSo much fun!"},{"CreatedByName":"Boots","CreatedById":144409,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T14:02:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Welcome!
