Than place a manouver node ontop of the apoaps itself and drag the Prograde vector until you see a dotted line emerge from the planet. That dotted line has a periaps marker. Once that is where you want it, stop dragging (you\u0027ll need to go back and forth dragging/checking a few times. But you have plenty of time while you coast).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope open the navball (in Mapview, there is an arrow middle down side of the screen that opens it. Or just go back to flight view). On the right side of the navball is new info. Node in T- (time) is when you arive at the node. Burn time is the time you need to burn to get the predicted orbit (deltaV is the amount of speed you need to add. Once that reaches 0, you are done.
