This was a few years ago. I, one day remembered that I owned the game. And i re-downloaded the game. I think it was V.20. I was amazed at the things they had accomplished, and got myself invested in the game that I couldn\u0027t enjoy much all those years ago. I am proud to own this game, and i\u0027m am glad the way things turned out with this game, and I hope that all Squad\u0027s projects will turn out as well as Kerbal Space Program did!\n\nI also live in Australia, South Australia, Adelaide. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAnyway, Good luck in everything Squad, and I am glad to be a part of this community!"},{"CreatedByName":"Coffeeman","CreatedById":69966,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:09:03Z","Content":"Well, welcome officially. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:34:36Z","Content":"Belated welcome aboard!"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T14:08:54Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums!"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T14:58:37Z","Content":"(Belated) Welcome!
