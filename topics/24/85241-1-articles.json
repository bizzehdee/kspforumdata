I\u0027m a new KSP player. I\u0027ve played the demo and then bought the game a few days ago. In career mode I did my first Mun landing (and return \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E), but I was frustrated by not having a record of my flights.

It is still a bit messy, but I hope it will give some of you a nice nostalgia for when you still was a clueless beginner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, onto my newbie question! I wanted to calculate the max payload to LKO (75km) for my newly designed lifter. How do I do this? I\u0027m using the Kerbal engineer mod, so I know the Delta-V, TWR, I_sp, etc. I should be able to derive max payload from those right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T04:50:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalculating payload is tricky; how much delta V is needed to reach orbit is a complex function of TWR and flight path, and how much delta V is available is a function not just of fuel carried but of how long you spend at what pressure in an atmosphere. As a general rule you should add payload until you have 4500m/s of *vacuum* delta V available; if you fly a decent ascent, that should be enough to get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceCars","CreatedById":123026,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T09:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh right, the ascent profile is also a factor. I looked into how to solve the Delta-V calculation in vacuum for mass, but with staging and having to calculate the remaining fuel after each stage it became a bit complicated. So I just added weight until I had 4500m/s remaining according to engineer. That was really helpful, thank you! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T11:36:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93958-How-do-I-calculate-payload-mass-to-orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHow do I calculate payload mass to orbit?\u003C/a\u003E is hidden in the tutorials section of the forum instead of gameplay questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch capactity (tonnes) = ((Launch_Ratio * Mass_Dry) - Mass_Wet) / (1 - Launch_Ratio)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere :-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch_Ratio = EXP(4,500 / (Isp * Gravity))\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceCars","CreatedById":123026,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T11:47:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh thanks for the link!
