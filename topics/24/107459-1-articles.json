I have been playing solidly for 4 days since downloading it last week. Love it and go to bed dreaming of orbits and planets and tweaking my spaceships. I have also found some mods. Love the Chatter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only issue I am having is that the graphics on the space center (the main interface screen) compared to the rest of the graphics in the game are awful. They are blocky and dull. Once I enter the various buildings they are fine. When I am in Orbit the spaceships and planets are awesome. I am running everything on \u0022max\u0022 settings I think - so don\u0027t think I am missing anything, but when I have seen other peoples screenshots they look like proper buildings with intricacies you would expect to see on buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing something, do I need a mod (although I have tried to find anything for \u0022space center\u0022 without luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help me please?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T17:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, Pinchy!
