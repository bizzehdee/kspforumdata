Fairly new to the forums and just started playing KSP last week. I\u0027m having a blast playing it! So-far I\u0027ve just sent some probes to the Mun and Minmus, have put up several Kerbin satellites in various orbits, and even had a manned docking in Kerbin orbit (which was a huge challenge). I\u0027m thinking my next steps will be getting a successful probe landing on the Mun (hopefully with a rover), then going for a manned Mun mission and a manned space station... Then it\u0027s on to the other planets! It is a blast just planning what to do next, let alone actually trying to execute it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still trying to figure out how to get the TWR just right on my rockets (I seem to end up with HUGE rockets that are slow to launch), but I\u0027m sure that will just take some practice and more examination of some of the example rockets out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick question though: where do you edit forum signatures? I don\u0027t seem to have the option anywhere in my profile or settings. Do you have to copy/paste your signature in manually every time? I like the ribbon generator and would love to have it auto-tag to my posts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ribbons.cgagnier.ca/redir.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ribbons.cgagnier.ca/image.php?user_ribbon=557\u0022 alt=\u0022image.php?user_ribbon=557\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MattLugar","CreatedById":70130,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T14:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENevermind on the forum signature question...
