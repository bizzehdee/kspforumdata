I\u0027m a moderately-educated end-user (I can fiddle with .cfg\u0027s, but don\u0027t expect any new parts), and I like building simple, compact rockets. I like NovaSilisko\u0027s SIDR\u0026amp;SD pack, Sunday Punch\u0027s Wobbly Rockets pack, and my final stage almost always contains the Micro Tank and Engine, and the RocktCo Hidra Parachute (which is awesome). When I\u0027m not playing KSP, I\u0027m a (soon-to-be) junior in high school (year 11 of school), who plays several instruments, is interested in a career in engineering, and likes 2-string kites and road bicycles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Damonjay","CreatedById":5117,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-17T06:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewelcome to Ksp forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
