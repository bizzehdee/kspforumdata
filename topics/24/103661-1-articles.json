This is only the second internet forum I have joined, however I am sure I can fit in with the rest of you. As for my KSP skillfulness, I have never gone interplanetary (at least, not on purpose). As well as KSP, other games I play include star citizen, minecraft, spaceengine and civilization v BNW. I also have great interests in real life space exploration, and I have previously closely followed curiosity, dawn, rosetta and most Chinese and SpaceX missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T02:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Chris.
