Could you please provide\u00A0some tips and tricks for the subj? I\u0027m ok with circular orbits, but I do not understand how to perform\u00A0rendezvous on elliptical orbits and more important with large orbital period? I mean, I can perform such\u00A0rendezvous pretty accurate, but it can take crazy amount of time to synchronize orbital period, any advices on how to perform such task, and how to plan the burn?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-08T23:36:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2018 11:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Andrey.gr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-09T01:31:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the difference between the orbits is great, you either spend a lot of time bringing them together or burn a lot of fuel. There\u0027s no way around that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor elliptical orbits, the first thing I do is burn to bring the line between periapsis and apoapsis around to align with that of the target. Once you do that, it\u0027s really pretty much the same as circular orbit rendezvous. Of course, that can be a pretty tricky first step. It may not be fuel-efficient, but I sometimes simplify things by circularizing with my peri or apo coinciding with that of the target. Then it\u0027s a simple matter to align the other point,\u00A0 match planes, etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-14T17:58:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the target\u0027s an ellipse, I\u0027m a small circle inside it.\u00A0 When the target\u0027s a circle, I\u0027m an even smaller circle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarting from there, I plan a burn to intercept the \u003Cstrong\u003Eorbit \u003C/strong\u003Eof the target, if not the target itself, then right-click the node to hide it, then click the little plus on it to move it an orbit into the future until the markers approach each other, and fine-tune from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd some intercepts are just difficult no matter what.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
