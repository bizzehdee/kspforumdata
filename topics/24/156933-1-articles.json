It\u0027s pretty much my dream game. It mixes all of my favorite aspects of games: science, openness, and moddability. I\u0027m currently having a lot of issues playing it; my graphics card fan has stopped working and the card is now overheating and crashing at about 108\u00B0C (if anybody has any advice on temporary workarounds I would really appreciate if they could post it on my other thread - I can\u0027t afford a new fan right now \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E). But when I \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E get to play, I usually make the game as difficult and as close to reality as possible; add-ons like TAC Life Support and DangIt are beautiful things.
