You just have to merge that with the one in the Kerbal Space Program folder and everything should work fine. Some addons don\u0027t include a GameData folder and with those you are supposed to put the highest level folder in the zip into the GameData folder (ie, if the zip has a folder called \u0022AwesomeMod\u0022, put that in the GameData folder so you have ..\\GameData\\AwesomeMod\\). You shouldn\u0027t have to make any folders yourself (and that is generally a bad idea to do since many addons require a very specific folder structure)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Davakar","CreatedById":118312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T01:52:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I guess that is where I am getting confused because as in the example of Karbonite, the zip I downloaded from Dropbox has several folders in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunityResourcePack, Firespitter, OpenResourceSystem, TextureReplacer, UmbraSpaceIndustries, and one ModuleManger DLL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with MKS I have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirespitter, OpenResourceSystem, TextureReplacer, TweakScale, UmbraSpaceIndustries\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd each mod has its parent folder as GameData in the zip folder.

In that case, both of those mods are from the same author and he uses the same dependencies with both. So in that case you just use whichever one has the newer dependency plugins, merge the UmbraSpaceIndustries folders, and only put in the highest version number moduleManager.dll\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
