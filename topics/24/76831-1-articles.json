I run KER, KAC and Kethane. I downloaded RemoteTech 2, Shipmanifest, LifesupportMod, KAS and Notes but will wait to implement them till I can return all my kerbals and have no more need to control my probes that are scattered out and about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the pace of learning in this game. It\u0027s fantastic. Mostly, the problem solving. I\u0027m 43 days from my first interplanetary mission and it\u0027s been a blast trying to design, determining required skills, and learning those skills. Such as, learning how to dock so I can just drop off a lander/land/rendezvous at a moon and carry on etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, hi!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T21:33:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum and to the game, J3ansley. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ucender","CreatedById":83872,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T18:04:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are so many brilliant guys in this forum, it is sometimes hard to find something clever to add.
