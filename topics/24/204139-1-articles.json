I had been looking at this simulator for a while and bought it through Steam. Mods! That is right up my alley. So now I\u0027m heavy in mods and enjoying it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI spent years creating mods for Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Lockheed Martin\u0027s Prepar3d but it took years developing aircraft and at my age I don\u0027t have the time. I hope I\u0027ll be around for KSP2.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have a Saitek X-36: HOTAS that I\u0027d like to setup with KSP. Any suggestions on how to go about this would be helpful. Also my son just got KSP for Xbox, is there anyway to go multiplayer between my PC and Xbox with the current version of KSP?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks in advance\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFestina Lente\u003Cbr\u003E\nMechanic\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-02T03:59:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowdy and welcome to the forum. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Kerbalisation Tech","CreatedById":211297,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-02T10:57:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi and welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your Saitek X-36: HOTAS, i googled it and it seems like a joystick controller.
