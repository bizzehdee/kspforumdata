Thanks to a little video game you may have heard of, I\u0027m majoring in aerospace engineering. If all goes well, I\u0027ll be formally studying aerospace engineering in Norway in a few years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve visited both JPL and the Kennedy Space Center, and the JPL visit was part of an aerospace project where me and a team of ragtag teens worked together to design a hypothetical manned Mars mission and present it. This experience was absolutely amazing and was a significant driving force towards my education in aerospace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince my absence, I\u0027ve upgraded my KSP skills, and I\u0027ve landed on Tylo (whereas previously the most difficult thing I\u0027ve landed on was Ike). I\u0027ve also been practicing a lot with planes and shuttles, which hasn\u0027t been a significant interest of mine back then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been professionally diagnosed with autism, so please be patient with me if I\u0027m not good at communicating, take a while to respond to something, or misunderstand something and need clarification. (and also please don\u0027t be mean to me about it)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI plan to mostly frequent the KSP1 subforums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-13T20:40:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome back. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-13T20:49:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd another hearty rewelcome to you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224292894\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217699\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221686688583\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201924\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LittleBitMore\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, LittleBitMore said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve upgraded my KSP skills, and I\u0027ve landed on Tylo\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo landing is one of the bigger challenges in KSP.\u00A0\u00A0 Congratulations!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sylvi Fisthaug","CreatedById":228381,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-14T09:37:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome back!
