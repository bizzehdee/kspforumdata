I\u0027ve also been going around and grabbing mods from here and there as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that confuses me is a few mods that say they\u0027re not compatible with 64-bit editions of windows. One even says it\u0027s an unstable mess. As far as I can tell (according to the task manager and some other things), KSP runs in 32-bit mode unless otherwise told to, so I\u0027m not entirely sure why something that merely adds to the existing application would need to be specific about something that it\u0027s likely not even going to notice. Generally only applications at the OS or driver layer need to be concerned about word size, as far as I know. Anything higher should only be concerned about whether the OS run it, and a plugin to an application that runs just fine on said OS shouldn\u0027t even be thinking about the OS more than the application does. Considering that I haven\u0027t seen any other plugins mention 32-bit or 64-bit besides the two addons I\u0027ve seen so far, and all of those worked just fine, I\u0027m starting to think that it actually doesn\u0027t matter and that those mods would work just fine regardless of the big warnings plastered on them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m wrong, please tell me, and in detail if it\u0027s possible. I do like to know the details of these things, so that I don\u0027t have to wonder in a similar situation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T02:39:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost mods don\u0027t have developer support for 64 bit which means that I you encounter a bug with that mod in 64 bit you can\u0027t complain about it to the developer because they clearly stated not to use 64 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad also say to use 32 bit ksp because 64 is unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods such as FAR and NEAR have even been hardcoded to disable themselves in 64 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart mods should work regardless but mods with a plugin will probably not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and I bet Vanomonde\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silvermistshadow","CreatedById":132830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T04:53:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, just the different .exes are meant there, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T11:41:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, it\u0027s just the executables.
