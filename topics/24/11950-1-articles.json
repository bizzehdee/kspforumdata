I\\\u0027m new to the forums and fairly new to the game. My brother got me the game just a short while before the .15 update and told me to consider it a late birthday present. I\\\u0027ve been hooked ever since.

I\\\u0027ve heard rumors of things like orbital rendezvous... I\\\u0027ll need lots more practice flying before I can handle that. lol ;D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you all around the forum,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Menecroth (a.k.a.
