(Not regular boredom, more along the lines of \u0022what is left to do?\u0022 boredom)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a \u0022built for purpose\u0022 rather than an aesthetic designer, and find that my creativity really shines when placed under severe restrictions. The forums at Kerbalroleplay.com helped me discover that spark, with its rule restraints and economic considerations that challenged me to rethink the way I designed my ships. I found this quite enjoyable (until the nuclear war reset the forum and wiped all my stuff \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy recent upgrade from 0.18 - 0.21 has forced me to start my space program again from scratch, and I hope that working with others here will rekindle the excitement I had when I first bought this game. I only use one mod, Kethane, and basically design all my missions around the ability to harvest my own \u0022fun goo\u0022 (interplanetary refueling mission bore me, and eat into the time I can spend playing in a far away location)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, If your interested in seeing the type of designs I create, I managed to save a few pics from the kerbal roleplay forum before the nuclear war. (Sorry no craft file, but they\u0027re easy to replicate) The satellite is a recreation of the Earth Recon Orbiter that someone asked me to design for them. It can go from LKO to a stable Mun Orbit under its own power and its docking port makes it reusable. The Launch vehicle was a project for an organization that needed to set up 3 satellites in geosynchronous orbits around kerbin. Rather than waste money on 3 separate launches, I just tacked 3 of my ERO\u0027s onto it. With a little orbital tweaking, it can set them up to cover the majority of kerbin and return the pilot safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zbP7Jm4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zbP7Jm4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dnbzta3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Dnbzta3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GUMAuu9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GUMAuu9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope to see you all around here, and If you don\u0027t see me posting, rest assured that I am still watching EVERTHING...\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorpi15","CreatedById":34189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T00:55:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEverything?
