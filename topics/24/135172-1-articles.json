I just brought this game, so please note that I am bit noobish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always had an interest in aerospace and astrophysics, astronomy and space Philosophy. I was always trying to find something from which I can explore and be lost. At first I downloaded space engine, but it didn\u0027t seem the \u0022stress\u0022 was there to get in space. So someone on the inter-webs told me about KSP, and I gotta say, it\u0027s been 6 days and I am insanely addicted to it.

Im a hobbyist so I\u00A0actually study such stuff, though\u00A0I just started with Aerospace, I have 2 huge diaries where I always note about space and my interests, study a lot so you can call me a geek. I also want to start a YouTube channel as well as I already have a site for my articles. Might sound childish but I have a dream of making an international space organisation and community so that we all can unite as species, combine best of the technology, put aside politics and \u00A0concentrate on our place in the stars and development of new tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to topic, I am finding this game a little to hard because I have failed\u00A034 times total, and would like some tips.

Your answers were really helpful and I hope I enjoy here. I have just another little doubt, I first played on version 0.25, but then switched to the new one as I had disabled auto updates, I don\u0027t know what to think about these new updates. Yea they add more realism, but now the game\u0027s rocket parts and stuff feels a bit clustered... I dunno is it my feelings doing this or something because Im not able to decide a good rocket design, as some parts are WAAAAY too\u00A0advanced and some are WAAAY too primitive...
