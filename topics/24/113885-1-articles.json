I was six at the time.\n\nHaven\u0027t tried RO myself, but [here\u0027s the thread for it](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99966-1-0-2-Realism-Overhaul-v10-0-2015-167?highlight=realism\u002Boverhaul). There are bound to be many interesting tidbits in there.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T18:40:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is Bosco Hern with a few pointers on money.\n\u003E Well, not really, but those of a certain age and disposition may get the reference...

Installation, however, is tricky. Once you start playing RO, even the small things like getting into orbit will feel very rewarding."},{"CreatedByName":"dclarion","CreatedById":146813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T19:01:46Z","Content":"In what way is installation tricky, viktor?

And would I be adding to the peril by running KSP under Linux?\n\nAs Starwhip said, RO demands several mods, and that\u0027s just the bare minimum. More mods you add, RO gets better. And about linux, if I read correctly, 64-bit KSP runs much better (if you mean that with linux) because it has much more RAM available. Alternatively, if KSP is run regularly (32-bit) in windows, you should definitely try [this convenient trick](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106356-Forcing-DirectX11-40-memory-reduction!) for memory reduction."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:19:31Z","Content":"RO can be installed with CKAN now (for 1.0.2 anyway, might need to wait for mods to update yet).
