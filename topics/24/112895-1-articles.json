Torque.\n\n2. Stability.\n\nTorque is the product of the control force times the lever arm--the larger the control surface the more force, and the farther away from the center of mass the longer the lever arm and the more that force gets magnified.\n\nStability is determined by how far the center of pressure is from the center of mass. If it\u0027s behind the center of mass (ye olde KSP axiom of \u0022CoL behind CoM\u0022) the craft is statically stable (will follow the prograde marker when you take your hands off the controls), and if it\u0027s not, the craft is statically unstable (will tend to deviate ever further from prograde). If they\u0027re right on top of each other, you have neutral stability (the plane will move neither towards nor away from prograde). The further away the CoP is from the CoM, the stronger that stabilizes (or unstabilizing) force is.\n\nMost KSP aircraft have their center of mass towards the rear, because that\u0027s where the heavy engines are. That means when you add canards at the front, they\u0027re both (a) larger than the control surfaces you usually add at the rear and (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) much, much farther from the CoM than the ones at the rear. So they provide a lot of torque.\n\nNext, because they\u0027re in front of the center of mass, they move the center of pressure forward compared to the center of mass, thus lowering stability and making the plane even *more* maneuverable."}]}
