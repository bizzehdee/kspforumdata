Anyways!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should introduce myself before going deeper in the forums. My real name is Naji (Arabian but not proud to be one), from Jordan (not proud neither, leaving soon).\u00A0I\u0027m 17 years old, and I\u0027m a space addict. I tend to say hello to the planets everyday (you know, wave at them in the sky) but\u00A0it\u0027s winter now so :/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love this game and it\u0027s developers, love the\u00A0forums and it\u0027s people and just love everything about KSP. I\u0027m a daily player but even still I\u0027m pretty bad at the game. I played Career mode for a long while until the missions wanted\u00A0bases on Duna and Eve while I still didn\u0027t even get to Eeloo or Moho or some of Jool\u0027s moons. I love exploring more than setting up bases and the complicated stuff, so I stopped playing Career and started my own space program (BSA - Beyond Space Agency) currently in Sandbox mode. Doing NASA-style flybys and landers (cuz, duh, who doesn\u0027t like NASA).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, that\u0027s about it! I\u0027m a guitarist as well (acoustic) and a League of Legends player (I doubt anyone here plays it). My hobby? Flying with Jeb!
