Read a lot around the forums, just now got around to introducing myself. Ive been to every rock in KSP, though mechjeb did a bulk of the lifting, Im still no shabby pilot though. Ive started to play with jets and ssto spacecraft. Currently on an easter egg hunt. Ive started to record and upload some lets plays now that Ive grown confident enough. Looking forward to sharing my accomplishments, and maybe a few explosions with the community at large here. Hope to hit a few challenges soon too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECosmo\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rgriffith26","CreatedById":112251,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T13:33:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!
