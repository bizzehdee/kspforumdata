Got science points WAY quicker this time, though. Getting smarter about spaceflight too. I find it easier and more efficient to get into orbit by going *really* high then burning at peri and getting into orbit quickly (having a heck of a time with gravity turns, why are they so hard?). After I did that, a light bulb went off, I realized maybe I can go to the moon this way! The problem? How the heck do I set a course? When and where do I burn? Also learning the optimal re-entry angle, although I\u0027m still figuring that out. Too shallow and it takes forever to finally get down. Too deep...well, you know...boom. I sense this has a lot to do with precision landings too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I finally got the needed 90 points for level 5 in the tree, but I\u0027m waffling on which one to take. I\u0027m thinking the advanced flight control as the RCS looks mighty tasty to me for greater control. Then there\u0027s aerodynamics, I can build a plane and go anywhere on Kerbin, right? (Except for those stupid fixed wheels creating drag). Or the fuel systems for that awesome 800 fuel tank. Or the big booster in heavy rocketry to get into orbit easily and make a moonshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETips? Advice? Good ways to rack up science points quickly and lots of them?

Racking up some points and getting somewhere now. Decided to take the aerodynamics and science nodes for 90 points each. Little did I know that the 4-Kerbonaut habitat is HUGE and not appropriate for the rockets I\u0027ve been building. Meh. Next node will definitely have to be for the FL800 tank so I never have to worry about running out of fuel again. Getting that next 90 won\u0027t be easy. I\u0027m under 100K in money too, so I can only afford so much. I\u0027m trying to fulfill a bunch of contracts, but most are pretty unrealistic for me, like planting a flag on Mun or sending data back from Duna. I don\u0027t even know how to GET to the moon yet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, I\u0027m focused on trying to build a stable flying jet so I can explore Kerbin\u0027s biomes and rack up points that way.

All those science points I amassed...*snif*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, I got to the Mun totally by accident. I designed a rocket that I wanted to take me to a super high altitude, and it did that.
