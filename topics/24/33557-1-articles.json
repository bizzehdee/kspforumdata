It helps to also time when the mun and minmus are out of the way. For some the key is to boost when you are in orbit around kerbin and kerbin is between you and the planet you want to go to. But you can also play around with the planned maneuver action to find the right spot for when to boost. You\u0027ll also know when you are right because your path will show a point where you enter the influence of the other planet you are trying to go to. Hopefully this makes sense. If not there are some great guys on youtube that can help in video form. Some I know of are Kurtjmac and Scott Manley.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"austin4050","CreatedById":66368,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T04:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have tried doing this many times with no success.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PringleMan","CreatedById":1396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T05:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust like in real life, there are certain launch windows when it is viable to go from Kerbin to another planet.

You can get as far as Minmus without needing them, but after that you\u0027ll have to rely on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1: Before you even launch, designate your target. Go straight to the orbital map and click on the destination planet. (You\u0027ve probably done this if you\u0027ve made it to Mun, since all you really have to do is wait for Mun to center in the nav ball and aim right for it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: Get into a stable orbit. Kerbin spins from West to East so aiming East can give you a little extra power. (If that doesn\u0027t help, I\u0027ve been doing something VERY wrong on my way to every planet!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3: Click anywhere on your orbit. It doesn\u0027t matter where at first. You should see an \u0022add maneuver\u0022 option that brings up a bunch of symbols. Those symbols are controls that rotate, extend, and shrink your predicted orbit (should look like a dotted line). Mess around. No, really, blindly mess with each little symbol until you pull the orbital path out of Kerbin and just zoom out. If you don\u0027t like the position you can just click on the center and drag it along your real orbit until it\u0027s in the right place. If you mess up too much you can right click it, and get the option to cancel the path. Then just start again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 4: Get into position, center the blue marker in the nav ball, and fire away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome things to pay attention to: the length of the burn, and make sure your course doesn\u0027t spear Kerbin like a shishkebab. If you find yourself making long 14 minute burns, you\u0027re doing it wrong. It may be better to set a course that lines up horizontally, and then make another maneuver or two to bring the orbit in. You\u0027ll still need leftover fuel for braking, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the easy way, but not the fuel efficient way. There\u0027s no shame in launching a wobbly 10 stage behemoth just to get to Duna or Eve if that\u0027s what it takes.
