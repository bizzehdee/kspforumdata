For easy climate and prestige, try Southern Ontario or Vancouver they are warm and have little snow. If you can find Muskoka on Google maps, anything above that latitude is covered in snow 5months of the year (November-March) on a good year. However, go where ever you need to for education.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
