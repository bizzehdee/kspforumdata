I\u0027m an engineering school dropout and had been lusting for a game like KSP ever since I had spent weeks on end playing \u0022Buzz Aldrin\u0027s Race into Space\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve been playing KSP (badly) for a while, sandbox only.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s one of very few computer games I can still play, as I\u0027ve lost most of my vision in a traffic collision a few years ago. Consequently, when I bought my present computer, I hadn\u0027t expected to play any graphics intense games again, ever. Consequently, not the hottest graphics card.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich you can see in my first KSP video.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell, more like my seventh KSP video. Just the first one that is even remotely watchable and that I didn\u0027t have \u0022Eraser\u0022 scrub from my harddrive.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat you see here:\u003Cbr\u003E\nA mission to the mun. On rockets under 500 tons.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes, the plural. I\u0027m dead certain somebody else has done this, probably when the game version was still below 1.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut here\u0027s how I did it. No engine with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E over 310s, so in the Apollo-era ballpark. Rockets weighing about half what the RSBstock Saturn V brings.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t play career mode, but if you have to make a Munar landing happen with smaller rockets, here\u0027s an option.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe mission profile: Jeb flies to the Mun, alone, in a 2-seater spacecraft with plenty of \u2206v to spare. In case something goes wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat would go wrong would be part of Valentina\u0027s flight. On a second rocket, carrying the actual Munar landing craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter flying to the Mun and landing, she goes back up with the ascent stage,\u00A0 and then heads to rendezvous with the waiting Jeb.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe rest of the mission should be obvious. Not so obvious, until I flew it for the video: Taking off from the Munar surface, Valentina had enough \u2206v left to make it back to Kerbin without Jeb and his big rocket.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I might use the hardware from this video to try a direct ascent flight in a later video. If such is desired, please do let me know.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, here\u0027s the video.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECaution\u003C/strong\u003E: The title is no joke. Clumsy is, also, not something you do with your hands. It\u0027s a state of mind. So even where I had the right idea about how to do something, I certainly did it in some way that will make you cringe so loud, your neighbors will file a complaint.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo don\u0027t watch this if you don\u0027t wanna deal with being subpoenaed over noise pollution. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9VnkSfwQ4o?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:100%;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-25T19:49:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2017 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by DerGolgo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForgot stuff.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-25T20:10:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow.
