Purchased the game, downloaded it and started to try and build stuff to throw into space. When I began to actually recognize the Kerbals, I couldn\u0027t get enough of them! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve built some giant firecrackers and have even managed to get a few of them into orbit. Landed on the Mun once, before realizing I had no way to get my Kerbal back home...(A rescue mission is currently being designed), and I\u0027ve just gotten a couple docking adventures completed. I think the last two were actually by design, but he first was more or less get close, push the I key and accidentally connect without destroying both vessels. It\u0027s a fun game, and I\u0027m glad I found it. Also, the information and direction on this site and youtube has been wonderful. Thank you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually a little concerned now though. I understand my Kerbals can actually perish and not return in the most current version. I really like those little guys. I hope my success rate increases!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cyagrdner","CreatedById":71544,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T04:57:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood luck to you and your kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phatm0n","CreatedById":60812,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T04:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s great to have you join the community!
