I\u0027m not exactly new to KSP, I\u0027ve been playing for a few months now (just passed 200 hours!) but this is my first time here on this forum. I\u0027ve spent most of my time on KSP making different variations of planes. As of right now, the only terrestrial bodies I\u0027ve visited outside of Kerbal\u0027s SOI are Duna and Ike (twice for each). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods being used: B9, Extraplanetary Launchpads, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Kethane, (Infernal Robotics sometimes), NASA, SCANSat, Spaceplane\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could actually use a little help when it comes to EL and Kethane... Can anyone point me in the right direction to creating a Mun or Minmus base for launching ships? And I\u0027ll probably need a bit of help designing a good ship/rover drill that can dock into that base. I\u0027ve been doing a fair amount of trial...with a whole lot of error haha. My game tends to freeze between launch/tracking-station/hangar every once in a while which makes the trial-and-error process a bit more tedious...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, sorry for introducing myself with problems haha.
