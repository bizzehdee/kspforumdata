I\u0027m a Kerbal names Katie.","CreatedByName":"Little Katie","CreatedById":129746,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T00:19:18Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Little Katie","CreatedById":129746,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T00:19:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI joined back in the fall but I\u0027ve been a lurker. I\u0027m a girl who plays KSP. I\u0027ve seen posts about whether girls play or not and how important or not important it would be to have girl kerbals in the game. The lack of lady like characters in KSP was something I noticed, but I honestly figured it was the kind of situation where the devs didn\u0027t think of it and it just kind of happened that way. Not a big deal, I figured it would happen eventually. I\u0027m excited about Project V! But I don\u0027t feel like my identity is affected by little green space people in a video game I enjoy. Maybe if it were children playing it would matter more, I don\u0027t know. But that\u0027s all I have to say about that. Might as well put my two cents in since it\u0027s sort of novelty for a girl to play, but I don\u0027t want it to turn into one of those conversations. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like this game a lot. I started playing last year. I was going through a lot of changes in my life after a really difficult situation. The challenge of learning this game was a really positive influence on how I got through the tough part of a messy mess. It gave me something else to think about and focus on. But I also have a really busy life and couldn\u0027t put as much time into it as I wanted. Actually, I would put in a lot of hours but I didn\u0027t know how to play very well. I had less patience for reading about it at the time. I have looked up different things about how to play but it can take me a really long time to figure it out because I\u0027m dyslexic and learn better visually. So I would also spend a good bit of time following youtube videos and making notes on them. If you want to hear something entertaining, Scott Manley sounds ridiculously funny if you play the videos in the slower speed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite thing about the game is when I go through all this trial and error to get something off the ground and I make it into space. Every time the space music plays I feel the magic and it cools my jets. The music score in the game is brilliant. I love to experience that feeling of weightlessness and emptiness when my craft orbits. It clears my mind when I watch Kerbin disappear and I\u0027m out in the middle of nowhere. It feels so peaceful and quiet. I love it when I approach a celestial body for the first time in \u0022real life\u0022. Even when I\u0027ve seen so many videos of other people getting there, it\u0027s totally different when I do it myself. I love the texture of the planets and the moons and I love to see the details appear when I get closer or fade when I\u0027m leaving. All of those sensory things are made even sweeter when accompanied by the feeling of accomplishment that comes with experiencing them. My first encounter with this game was in the demo. I had absolutely no idea what any of the parts were and I stuck things together to make a rocket that looked something like what I\u0027d seen in documentaries. I love NASA documentaries. This thing I made got up high enough for the music to play and I was so moved I welled up with tears a little bit. Ever since then I\u0027ve just wanted to get better at it. I\u0027m still not all that good but I love it regardless. There is something about space that has always touched me deeply. I don\u0027t know how to explain it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what else to say, so that\u0027s it. It\u0027d be cool to hear what compels other people to play and love this game so much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T00:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome Katie Kerman!
