(Also just binge watched For All Mankind and im just more stoked for it, and i love every kind of sci-fi)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this game is about experimenting, min maxing the budget around a rocket which barely makes the trip which it was intended for, exactly because it shouldn\u0027t waste any excess fuel,\u00A0 or parts or similar which were jettisoned in a seperate stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe i haven\u0027t searched enough on the webs, or there isn\u0027t anything like this sheet i made, but i think maybe these kind of \u0022schematics\u0022 would help some newer players like me to get over building process quickly (at least first time, and save it for later) and focus on the navigation part, because i think with all the burns, the trajectories, the delta-v stuff, and all the science, that is the more essential part of KSP. Yeah the building part too, since the science and calculations come from the base parts you put together, but still. Maybe these kind of sheets would help?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022kgUoi81.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002295.42\u0022 height=\u0022581\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/kgUoi81.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSafe journey into the black!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I know there are some built in templates to load, but those don\u0027t really explain their functions/roles for what\u00A0 they are meant for.
