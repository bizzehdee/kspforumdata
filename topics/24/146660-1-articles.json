I have been living on my own for most of this decade, and have been a fan of all things space since my childhood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I found this game first it was still in the Alpha/Demo stage. I put in a few hours and then decided i\u0027d wait and see wich direction it would go. Some time passed, and a few months ago I found the game in it\u0027s later stage of development and decided to buy it. So far I\u0027ve put in around 100 hours\u00A0of gameplay, and have been very succesfull at launching small/medium sized\u00A0rockets and other aircraft into orbit and beyond!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe career mode gave me a lot of trouble meeting the specific target for some missions, and the sandbox mode overwhelmed me with new parts. So i\u0027ve been doing a science run for most of my time in-game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI won\u0027t mod the game too much, since my pc has enough trouble running\u00A0it vanilla (x32)\u00A0at around half-specs. Any higher and it turns into a slideshow and crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure i\u0027ll be enjoying this\u00A0for many more hours, and hopefully send out my crew to the harder to reach places soon!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSafe journey\u0027s everyone!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-27T20:34:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2016 08:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DVB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-27T22:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums and your KSP addiction. \u00A0Your fellow psychologists may find you an interesting case study ;-0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I started there was only sandbox but I think you\u0027ve done the right thing going for science. \u00A0Career is far too complicated to be a good introduction for new players, with all the concerns about costs and\u00A0reputation as well as contract, strategy, building and astronaut management. \u00A0You are probably also wise to not mod much on a 32-bit machine; it is very hard to resist adding one or two (... and then three or four) though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SorryDave","CreatedById":119474,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-30T03:21:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums!
