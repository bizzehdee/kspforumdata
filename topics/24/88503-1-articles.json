I\u0027ve had KSP for a few months now, and I decided to join this forum yesterday. I\u0027ve gone into orbit, but I haven\u0027t gone to any other moons or planets yet. My orbits tend to be elliptical and not round. I\u0027ve made a few scientific orbiters and that\u0027s about it. I couldn\u0027t make planes in KSP if my life depended on it. So... yeah.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T22:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello theelectricspider39,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad to see that you have joined the community!
