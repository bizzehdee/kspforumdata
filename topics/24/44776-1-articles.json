I am happy to be here, so far I have been able to acquire orbit around Kerbin and have been to the Mun and landed.

Try to make each module light and symmetrical to give ease of launching\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Try not to have to many parts or you will be regretting it a few modules later when your running at 2 fps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. RCS is very useful for docking, I recommend using it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Make sure RCS ports are inline with the centre of mass. This will help when translating laterally with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. (general tip) Reaction wheels can turn or stabilise anything if you have enough\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Finally, I recommend putting your station core in a circular, 0 inclination orbit, as otherwise it is a pain to rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T23:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
