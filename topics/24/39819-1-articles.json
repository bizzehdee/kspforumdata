This was a game I tried to make some 30 years ago when the PC first came out and lacked the graphics and memory to do so. It encompasses everything I wanted to do and then some, very impressed here dev\u0027s!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) It\u0027s a mutha, very high learning curve. But once you finally get it figured out, you feel like you could actually fly the real thing. And at some point it become tedious and irritating to spend so much time to get so little done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) In space not so much, once you figure out docking, it\u0027s really not so bad. The big headache is simply system performance. The more parts there are in proximity, the slower/laggier the game becomes. You\u0027ll want a very high-end machine to attempt anything \u0022big\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) You\u0027ll definitely want to start your angle, I like to start at about 10km and tilt about 45 degrees in my desired direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Absolutely, though I do believe we are currently limited to the single solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Sooner or later you\u0027re going to try out Mods, mainly because you\u0027re going to be looking for more parts, more realistic parts, and/or more game play options (such as mining for fuel). I\u0027ve found mods generally cause some type of game play issue and if you remove any mod, any ship you have out there that has a component loaded with any mod part that was removed will lose that entire ship and anything that may be docked to it. So when you\u0027re ready to try some, pick the ones out you \u0022really\u0022 want to have and add them one or two at a time to see how it\u0027s going to affect your game play (if at all).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T14:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) what moment made you say: \u0022I have to buy this\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first saw it! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) How hard was it to really get going?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealy hard, back in my day, we didnt have no rockmax parts, nore a fancy map.. just getting an orbit was an achievement..
