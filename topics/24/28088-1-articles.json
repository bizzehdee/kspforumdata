I\u0027m been playing KSP for about two months now, and I\u0027m consistently overjoyed with every aspect of the game and the community that surrounds it. I\u0027m really interested in the math that goes into each launch, and will spend most of my time in the threads dedicated to this and similar subject. I hope I can be a positive influence on the community, and look forward to my many interactions with you all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKindest regards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaramel Sikes\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T17:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had a great time myself, both with the game itself and as a member of the greater KSP community. It really is one of the nicer, friendlier, and better-moderated boards on the Internet, all things considered.

I\u0027ve tried my best to gather quality tutorials and reference materials all into one convenient point of access for the benefit of players of all skill levels. The folks in the How To section will be more than willing to answer any questions you may have about the game as well. Finally, don\u0027t be afraid to just jump into a conversation if the topic interests you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T05:23:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
