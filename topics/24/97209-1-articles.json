To build an SSTO spaceplane, you need to cruise up at 20,000m altitude and reach 4-digit speeds, at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Bring higher efficiency rockets like the aerospikes or the LV-T45.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

The guides and tutorials that iFlyAllTheTime linked you are very solid and should definitely help you get to orbit. It all depends on what exactly you want out of your SSTO\u0027s though. Do you want a cargo hauler or a crew transport? Maybe an exploration vehicle with a lot of science equipment? Do you want to go to LKO (Low Kerbin Orbit) or do you want to go interplanetary?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe guides should help you get to orbit. One more tip for your flight profile with SSTO spaceplanes (this assumes you are using the stock aerodynamics):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estart with a steep (45 to 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) climb to about 15km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonce you are at 15km, level out to a shallow (20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or so) climb, keep climbing and gaining speed to roughly 20-23km. At this point your speed should be above 1000m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonce you start noticing a difference in the way your engine sounds(always use turbojets for airbreathing engines by the way, basic jet engines don\u0027t function well at high altitude) or if you notice your plane suddenly starting to bank left or right, immediately cut your airbreathing engines and switch to rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point you are basically flying a rocket. Angle up to 60-80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and burn upwards until you get out of the atmosphere. Circularize on your apoapsis and you have orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not the most efficient way of getting to orbit with an SSTO, but it\u0027s the best way to go about it for the first few tries in order to get a feel for SSTO spaceplane flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbonautics","CreatedById":136009,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T01:25:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, thanks guys.
