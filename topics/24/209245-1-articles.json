The roll axis is usually the easiest of the three (pitch, yaw, roll) to rotate around and if you have several engines which can all gimbal to exert roll control and/or lots of reaction wheels, they can easily set up an oscillation where the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E keeps over-correcting. You can disable the roll axis in engine gimbals and reaction wheels (may or may not require advanced tweakables to be switched on, but advanced tweakables is definitely worth turning on regardless- main menu settings \u0026gt; enable advanced tweakables) to try and counteract this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want more specific advice or if you\u0027re getting a different problem, screenshots of the rocket(s) and/or a video of the problem will be needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-06T23:48:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-08T17:02:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you mean by \u0022unstable during performing rolls\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you mean that pressing the Q or E key to manually roll makes the rocket unstable, with flips or other wild maneuvers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr do you mean that your rockets slowly drift around the roll axis during ascent, so that the navball rotates?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ani_27166343","CreatedById":222417,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-09T06:33:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2nd one\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen ascending my rocket start rolling automatically and don\u0027t wanna recover from roll\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
