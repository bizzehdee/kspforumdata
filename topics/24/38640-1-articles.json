I didn\u0027t come here looking for advice on docking, landing, ship building, etc... As you can see, this is my first post on the forums. I had hoped my first post would be something more impressive, but first, i need to know a few things. I\u0027m planning on posting a mission summary and/or craft showcase and i need to know how to insert pictures. I realize that i have to upload them to imgur or another similar site, but what do i put after that? This may be a stupid question that im sure almost all of you know the answer to, but exactly what should i type if i want to put in one of those imgur album spoilers instead of simply adding a link to the album? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance, and i hope to implement this stuff in my (hopefully) amazing second post!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T03:18:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efor single images, you have to instert the URL of that pic (ususlly ending with .jpg or .png) like this: \u003Cimg src=\u0022URL\u0022 alt=\u0022URL\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor imgur albums, read here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36010-Introducing-the-Ability-to-Embed-Imgur-Albums%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36010-Introducing-the-Ability-to-Embed-Imgur-Albums%21\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mont","CreatedById":36156,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T03:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T19:27:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
