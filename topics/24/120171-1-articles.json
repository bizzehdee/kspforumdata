We were discussing the fact that I calculate orbital dynamics and transit times under power for some of my other stuff (and sometimes just for fun) and he mentioned Kerbal Space Program. I checked it out on Youtube, found Scott Manley and the Orb8ter and today I purchased the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, I never expect to be like Mr. Manley. However, now I too will have Kerbals trembling in fear, well except for Jebediah who doesn\u0027t understand fear and thinks everyone else is trembling with anticipation just like he is. I\u0027ll fix him too. And if not, he\u0027ll still have a heck of a ride before he becomes plasma.

It\u0027s plug into the equations and go. It\u0027s more difficult to do transit times under acceleration or acceleration followed by free fall. I do it for some projects I\u0027m working on which involve that and some kinetic energy work. It\u0027s all hobby stuff for the most part, but I find it fun.
