MechJeb and Kerbal Engineer Redux(KER). MechJeb is basically a flight computer that you can use to help you do things or do things for you....and while some people consider it cheating, remember that real space agencies don\u0027t actually fly their rockets by joystick, they have the on-board computer do most of the work(including manned craft). If nothing else, tell Mechjeb to do something and watch it do it so you can see what you\u0027re doing wrong(and right). Most of the time it\u0027s pretty good. You don\u0027t have to use it if you don\u0027t want it(even if you put the controller on your spacecraft, you never have to activate it), but it\u0027s nice to have the option. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKER is useful because it tells you a lot of useful things about your rocket, your orbit and really gives you all the numbers you need for space travel. Most important, it tells you if your rocket actually has enough fuel to do what you want it to do(and the best pilot on earth or the fastest computer won\u0027t reach orbit if you don\u0027t have enough fuel). The alternative is to do a lot of math(though if you like doing math, knock yourself out). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn particular, Delta-V or dV something you really need to know for rocket building and it\u0027s basically your total energy allowance for your spacecraft. As long as you have more dV then required, your ship should be capable of going there(stability notwithstanding). The following link shows you exactly how much dV you need to go anywhere.
