Many people resort to using 3rd party programs like Mechjeb to facilitate things and you want to make it harder by removing the Naviball tool and making players earn it piece by piece. Do you really expect new player to be able to rendavou with an astronaut stranded in orbit or plot a transfer orbit to the Mun all in their heads without instruments or conic projections. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you trying to drive people away from the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than a game or a story you give random nonsensical missions, testing random pieces of equipment at random altitudes and speeds. Hundreds of hours of pointless cr*p before one gets a chance to do anything interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso enough of the sarcastic humour, an actual explanation of what various bits of equipment do would be awesome\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about a STORY or some TUTORIAL Missions to explain how things work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart with explaining the benefits of launching rockets from the equator in an eastwards direction in order to gain maximum benefits from MUNs rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave players launch their first sputnik style satellite and place a few low orbit communication satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntroduce other Kerbal factions, cities, shipyards etc. Give a reason for launching spy satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplain the intricacies of low altitude inclined and polar orbits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission: launch a satellite to map Kerbin and have it return the exposed film to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew equipment \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 high resolution cameras\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater on you can radio data back images to ground stations which would necessitate building additional ground stations to enable continuous communication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater you could have real time observation or introduce new technologies such as Synthetic aperture radar for your spy satellites. This could help the player find anomalies such as crashed flying saucers, pyramids, temples, faces etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice if you could add something to show your orbital footprint with relation to the ground. That way you can examine the relationship between altitude and orbit period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this you could then introduce a few missions to place satellites into Molniya, tundra and geosynchronous orbits and the practicalities of each and why different orbit profiles are used for different applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntroduce players to the naviball and how to change inclination, Apogee and Perigee using Prograde, Retrograde, Normal and anti-normal markers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissions placing communication satellites, navigation satellites and weather satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamining the effects of space travel on Kerbles or Kogs (Kogs are 4 legged pets similar to Terran Dogs)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience missions to test the effect of prolonged exposure to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a mission to launch a skylab style vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther tutorials on how to match orbits, and use the Target prograde, target retrograde markers to close range with the target and how to dock in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntroduce some missions to explain orbital mechanics, Hohmann transfers or Bi-elliptical transfers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this we are ready to begin a space race to the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can start with simple missions sending one way probes to orbit and land on the Mun and lead up to sending a Kerbal to the moon and returning them to Kerbin safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETutorials on landing on airless worlds, how to nullify your lateral velocity and land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor interplanetary missions we will have to introduce the concept of gravitational spheres of influence and segmented conics and how hyperbolic transfers are required are required to escape the sphere of influence and transition to solar based hohmann transfer orbit between different orbital bodies. Eg Kerbin to Dunas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETutorials on how to set up escape trajectories and velocities and why it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s most efficient to leave on a vector along a planets prograde or retrograde. Many people have knowledge of hohmann transfer mechanics but many tutorials fail to take into account deceleration as an object leaves a gravitational body and tend to over simplify things by ignoring this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point the sky is the limit, players can now send probes, flybys, orbiters, landers and rovers to other bodies in the solar system. Some of these bodies have atmospheres so you may want to introduce concepts such as aerobraking to make landings more efficient. Frankly the hardest thing I have encountered in Kerbal in trying to land at a given location on a body with an atmosphere as drag, angle of attack, velocity are so interrelated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther missions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravitational slingshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntercept a comet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplore the ort cloud\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntercept and destroy/divert a dino killer asteroid heading towards Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a giant interstellar antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolve the mystery of the monoliths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn earlier versions of the game you had hidden monoliths, some very hidden underground or floating in the air. Hopefully you have resolved that problem and there is a means in game of finding them say via a neutrino gravimeter etc, rather than just looking up their coordinates on youtube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as a final climax to the game assembling in orbit an giant interstellar vessel to go to the star system which the flying sausers are thought to have originated from. A slow multigenerational ship without warp travel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T18:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, a few things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: The game is indeed \u003Cem\u003EBETA\u003C/em\u003E.
