I was able to land multiple modules on the Mun but cannot get a suitable Rover assembled to start docking them together. My main problem is that, when testing the rover, I am able to 1) drive the rover undocked - 2) dock the rover with the module - and 3) support the module in cantilever fashion. However, once docked\u00A0the rover fails to drive at all. The front and rear wheels start acting weird (going pigeon toe instead of steering together) and the rover refuses to drive forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advise as to what I am doing wrong? I added a screenshot of mysetup....docked with the module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-31T05:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you connect the parts, it sounds like the assembly has a different orientation because it is figuring from a different control point. R-click on the rover\u0027s capsule or probe core and click \u0022control from here.\u0022 I suspect that will fix your problem.
