Plus nothing I build comes close to the monstrosities I\u0027ve seen here in the forums. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve enjoyed reading the forums so far, and I love seeing what people have come up with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first started with .23 and now am playing .23.5, but I\u0027m waiting on .24 until I get better at the game. Plus I have some questions for you guys. And some pictures of some of my highlights and failures, just so you can see where I\u0027m at so far. I should mention that I\u0027m playing without mods at all, although I refer to that online transfer window calculator. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll get around to mods sometime, but I\u0027m not the most computer-savvy person - I wouldn\u0027t want to screw everything up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still launching everything I build in one piece. I haven\u0027t really tried docking yet but I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a tutorial to help me when I\u0027m ready to tackle it. And even though I have the ARM patch I haven\u0027t tried to get to any asteroids yet, either. Right now I\u0027ve been focusing on landing Kerbals everywhere I can reach, whether it\u0027s a one-way trip or not. Right now my Mun and Minmus have almost 100 Kerbals each on them, dropped five, then 10 at a time. I got really brave and tried landing a 22-Kerbal colony on the Mun. It didn\u0027t quite go as planned....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, Moho has been driving me nuts for a while now. I finally landed one Kerbal repeatedly, but every time I tried more than one, I kept running out of fuel during the landing, always because I had to use lander fuel to finish establishing Moho orbit. After maybe a dozen total failures, this 10-Kerbal colony survived the landing, sort of....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I finally backed off and tried only\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool\u0027s moons are next on my list - I have sent probes and put some Kerbals in orbit, but haven\u0027t made a successful landing there yet - I\u0027ve been focusing on Moho for the moment, because the window is right and my Jool is way out of position right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here are those questions I mentioned:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to warp time fast enough to get to a transfer window while sitting in a 100-km orbit, but I don\u0027t know how. I always have to fly to a 600-km orbit and then warp. Is there a way to do it from 100km?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can land on Moho (finally) have I got enough delta-vee to land on any of Jool\u0027s moons? I know some are pretty big so I know my landers will need more fuel, for sure. Which leads to this question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to keep launching all these interplanetary missions straight from the ground, or am I going to have to start docking them in orbit at some point? I would guess it\u0027s easier to build in orbit - but I\u0027d like to see if I can do it. I\u0027ve seen some tremendous builds here on the forums, so I would guess I\u0027ve got more than a little wiggle room yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now my Jeb and Bill are hanging around on Eve, waiting for a lift home, and Bill is on Dres, in the same boat. So two-way trips are also soon on the agenda. Are landers with enough fuel to get home possible, or will I have to learn docking and go the CM/LM route?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJNH\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LongbowEOD","CreatedById":22817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T15:32:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHowdy and welcome aboard! Those are some great colonization efforts you\u0027ve got there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your questions, I\u0027m no expert, but maybe I can help a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t time warp fast enough from a 100-km orbit, try controlling a vessel that\u0027s landed on the same body. You should be able to use maximum time-warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho is one of the hardest bodies to land on, so if your ship can set kerbals down there, it can probably set them down anywhere. Tylo will still be another difficult landing. So big and so airless. Maybe find a Delta-V map you like. I use this one: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1iw30a/a_more_accurate_deltav_map/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1iw30a/a_more_accurate_deltav_map/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your computer can handle a tremendous launch vehicle, go for it. It\u0027s not strictly necessary to rendezvous and dock in space, but doing so does open many doors in terms of specializing craft for certain missions, which will get you further in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll-in-one vehicles are a handful, and I think it would be a bit of a master class in KSP to manage a kerballed Eve return with one ship. Having said that, I\u0027m sure somebody\u0027s done it, probably over in the Challenges Forum. I\u0027d say you\u0027re best bet is 2 or more vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T18:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LongbowEOD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LongbowEOD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHaving said that, I\u0027m sure somebody\u0027s done it\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKasuha did Kerbin-Eve-Land-Orbit-Kerbin-Land-Orbit-Eve-Land-Orbit-Kerbin-Land in a single launch ^^. Not something the rest of us are up for though, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Jeb - in addition to Longbow\u0027s comments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can time-warp in the tracking centre or KSC scene as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on and re-orbiting from Moho isn\u0027t too bad - easier than Duna - of Jool\u0027s moons only Tylo (highest gravity with no atmosphere for braking/parachutes) and Laythe (only oxygen atmosphere outside Kerbin - makes jets, and therefore spaceplanes, useful) require more deltaV. Getting TO Moho, and particularly stopping once you do get there is the hard part. The deltaV map Longbow linked to is your best tool, along with the transfer window planner you say you\u0027re already using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding in orbit gives you much greater flexibility and reusability but, as noted above, there isn\u0027t anything in KSP you can\u0027t do in a single launch - it just requires very big, complex and well-designed vehicles. Apart from that docking and assembling in orbit is pretty good fun on its own :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lander capable of getting back into Eve orbit is quite a challenge - one that can go back to Kerbin and land afterwards is asking a lot, but can be done. In general it\u0027s all possible depending on how you want to play things. There are a lot of people who almost only ever do single-mission, single-launch ships whereas I prefer reusable launch vehicles, space-stations, transfer vehicles and lander/re-orbiters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
