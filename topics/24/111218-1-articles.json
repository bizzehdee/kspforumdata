Just thought I\u0027d take a moment and introduce myself. I\u0027ve been a lurker on these forums and Reddit for a few months now and really absorbed a \u003Cem\u003Eton\u003C/em\u003E of info in that time. Seriously, I think I learned more in a little over 6 months of playing KSP and lurking on the forums than I did in a year of college! So far in my KSP days I\u0027ve visited the Mun, Minmus, Duna, Laythe, and Ike and set-up various orbital stations and surface bases. I have plans to reach some of Jool\u0027s other moons soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore recently I\u0027ve started dabbling in tweaks and mods for KSP and how to make them. Any resources you guys could recommend would be greatly appreciated! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve found quite a bit regarding the .cfg files and how to edit them using module manager. But, I haven\u0027t found a lot out there regarding writing full fledged mods (e.g. Mechjeb, KER, KIS, KAS), or creating parts (textures, collision mesh). Is there some beginners guide to creating mods that I haven\u0027t found (yet)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, since I\u0027ve lurked for months and gained \u003Cem\u003Esoo\u003C/em\u003E much knowledge from everyone here I thought I\u0027d finally join up and contribute. I\u0027ve created a small tweak to help keep atmospheric re-entry heating under control. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123279-Thermal-Protection-System-Tweak\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s\u003C/a\u003E the thread for download and support.
