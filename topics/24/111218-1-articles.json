Just thought I\u0027d take a moment and introduce myself. I\u0027ve been a lurker on these forums and Reddit for a few months now and really absorbed a *ton* of info in that time. Seriously, I think I learned more in a little over 6 months of playing KSP and lurking on the forums than I did in a year of college! So far in my KSP days I\u0027ve visited the Mun, Minmus, Duna, Laythe, and Ike and set-up various orbital stations and surface bases. I have plans to reach some of Jool\u0027s other moons soon.\n\nMore recently I\u0027ve started dabbling in tweaks and mods for KSP and how to make them. Any resources you guys could recommend would be greatly appreciated! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I\u0027ve found quite a bit regarding the .cfg files and how to edit them using module manager. But, I haven\u0027t found a lot out there regarding writing full fledged mods (e.g. Mechjeb, KER, KIS, KAS), or creating parts (textures, collision mesh). Is there some beginners guide to creating mods that I haven\u0027t found (yet)?\n\nAnyway, since I\u0027ve lurked for months and gained *soo* much knowledge from everyone here I thought I\u0027d finally join up and contribute. I\u0027ve created a small tweak to help keep atmospheric re-entry heating under control. [Here\u0027s](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123279-Thermal-Protection-System-Tweak) the thread for download and support. Hope you guys enjoy! Let me know what you think. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T10:47:53Z","Content":"Hello anarde, and welcome to the forums!
