My name is David, long time lurker and \u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E personal grammar nazi! Nah, I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122m just joking. English isn\\\u0027t even my first language! I\\\u0027m actually Swedish, so please pardon any annoying mistakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve been playing KSP for a while after discovering it through the one and only Robbaz, and I really love it. It\\\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E my type of game, and it has that beautiful combination of science and silliness that an astronomy geek like myself wants. Like Orbiter, but fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike many on this forum, I have very high expectations for KSP\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s future. So many things to do, so many sights to see, and so many places to visit, no matter what horrible conditions our adorable little Kerbals may have to endure in the process! I must say I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122m very impressed by your team\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s accomplishments so far, and I\\\u0027m sure that you will both surpass and meet all of my expectations! In that order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike most others, I look forward to the day when 0.16 is released in all its glory, which will be the day when my intrepid Kerbals finally get to step out onto the barren surface of the Mun, make their long and hard journeys worthwhile, and show that fine regolith who\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s the king! It will be glorious, but nowhere near as glorious as the day when you provide us with more planets to visit and explore. After all, more planets mean more regolith to dominate, decorate, and annihilate!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBody by body, both Kerbal and celestial, I shall conquer the Kerbol system. Megamile by megamile I shall make Phileas Fogg look like a wimp, and bite by bite I shall eat the Kraken for breakfast, and its buggy offspring for lunch! It \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E be glorious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil this glorious future transforms into a new present, however, I will just sit back, lurk the forum some more, and maybe produce some fanart. I haven\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t drawn in a while, now that I think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least I have now completed this beginner\\\u0027s rite of passage and made my presence known, so that will be it for now. See ya in the shadows, posters and fellow lurkers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... And \u003Cem\u003Ehere\\\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E a picture of one of my fearless, unmanned probes, standing on the surface of the Mun.
