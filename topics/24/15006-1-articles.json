To the extent which I never bothered to send anything to orbit... 8) I should probably get on that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyways, now with the .16 update, I cannot land my plane. Like at all, I get my vertical speed to less than -5, and touch down, but inevitable after like 2 seconds the plane disintegrates completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the plane in question...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DiWCn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DiWCn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few more \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/qglLl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/qglLl\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I strutted the heck out of this thing after the first failed landing, but that didn\\\u0027t seem to help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be appreciated...

Try putting on your rear elevators on more horizontally so they don\\\u0027t hit the ground. Or maybe you were going too slow on the landing and your plane stalled out and hit the ground too hard. Just remember when landing keep your nose up slightly, keep your speed steady and don\\\u0027t slow down too fast. Just take your time line everything up and you should be okay. Oh and when you do land don\\\u0027t brake as soon as ya land. Let your plane slow down on its own for a while then tap the brake til you stop.
