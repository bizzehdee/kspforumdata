I have the following problem: If something goes wrong and I want to restart a tutorial, and hit the Esc key, followed by End Scenario, then when I restart the same scenario it will often end up in the middle of the scenario in an unplayable state (i.e. I see space, but no vehicle). Only by quitting and restarting the game can I get the tutorial to reset properly. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong when resetting the training scenarios?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T05:59:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, IDK.
