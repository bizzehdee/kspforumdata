Last week I revisited it again and decided to buy it. I\u0027ve been basically playing it every free moment I have since. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI immediately threw myself in the career mode and quickly realized that this game is a lot more complex than it looks at first glance. Countless times I had to resort to google to find solutions to my problems, often getting referred to posts on this forum. And more than once solving a problem only created several new ones, something that seems to be common among KSP players. Like having an astronaut stranded on the mun, sending a rescuecraft to help said stranded astronaut, only to have the rescuecraft become stranded too and needing a second rescuecraft to rescue the first rescuecraft... Let me say it one more time.. rescuecraft!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, finding myself chuckling more than once at familiar stories on the forums I finally decided to join the community.
