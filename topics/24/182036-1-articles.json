It has three available configurations available ranging from lower graphics settings to high graphics settings. And the good thing is all you have to do is change which config file you have installed (See the mod instructions for full detail). Install it and the dependencies, and I can tell you from experience, I run the lower settings - it gives me clouds and it doesn\u0027t bog down the machine. And the results are pretty spectacular.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, and again, welcome to the forum. If you have questions, feel free to ask.
