I\u0027ve been a gamer and a \u0022geek\u0022 for a very long time and I usually judge a game initially by it\u0027s ability to \u0022deaden the sense of time\u0022 in the game during the first few days. I started playing the career mode last night at 8:00PM and realized after a while I hadn\u0027t heard my wife making noises in the living room which she usually does at night...I stepped away from the computer to find out if she was ok. It was 12:45AM. I had no idea of how late it was. This is a sign of a very good game! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, I feel I\u0027m doomed now.
