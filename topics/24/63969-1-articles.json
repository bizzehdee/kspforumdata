I agree with ZLM, sounds as if you have \u0022skipped ahead\u0022 and not got the science for, eg, landing pad, then suborbital, then leo, then high orbit, then....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the difficulties with the science is that you can only get one result for eg the mystery goo per unit, so you can end up with only a small amount of science from an impressive mission sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you like doing \u0022big missions\u0022, how about a \u0022science ship\u0022 with 8 goo containers, multiple Science JRs, etc etc and do one big mission to minmus or something? There\u0027s lots of different biomes so lots to research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy trick was to do EVAs and crew reports as often as possible per mission, as they can be done many times per mission and you get full science for transmittting the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us know your next mission plan!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
