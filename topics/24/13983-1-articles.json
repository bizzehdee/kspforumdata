I\\\u0027ll start off with the basic AA stuff, my name is David Fortsch (Not hard to find me, so why hide my last name?) and I\\\u0027m here because I\\\u0027m interested in Rockets and Space Exploration, but don\\\u0027t have any interest outside of hitting a few buttons and watching things happen. By that I mean I\\\u0027ll tinker with a rocket and hope it flies, it usually turns out with a big explosion. I have many interests and when I find a hobby I usually go big. I\\\u0027m a young gun, I\\\u0027m currently 17 years old and have been on and around Computers since I was roughly 12 years old. I\\\u0027ve been around the block having managed a Forum for a then popular youtuber \\\u0027Duncan\\\u0027 aka mobilephone2003. I was an Administrator for him for a bit before I had to leave due to personal reasons. Since then I\\\u0027ve ran a couple other forums here and there and I am currently employed as the Customer Service Manager for a small company that makes custom footwear for Sim Racing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m big into the computers, having like I said been around them since I was 12 or so. I am not so much Technical with them, I prefer to just dabble with fixing them from Viruses and other internal stuff, I don\\\u0027t enjoy messing with the components them selves. I\\\u0027ve been in and out of the Game Development world, having been the Project Manager for an independent game called \\\u0027Spin-Tyres\\\u0027. An offroad trucking game created for an Intel Competition and won an award in it. I\\\u0027ve also been a World and Platform Designer for a company that is creating a Virtual World. I joined the company when I was 15 and just recently Officially stepped down. I have moderated for a few companies, currently moderating for a Gaming Company in the UK called \\\u0027Eutechnyx\\\u0027, I help moderate their forums primarily for their title NTG. In the mean time I BETA Tested their newest PC game that has just reached Open BETA. I\\\u0027ve lent my hand here and there for small modifications on a game called Rigs of Rods and I am looking into helping out anyway that I can here on KSP once I get the full version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing about me is I enjoy to help people, so if you have any questions that you think I may be able to answer my PM box is always open for you guys and I\\\u0027m eager to dib my foot into this game. Looking forward to watching this expand!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny questions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T18:32:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-11T00:40:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\\\u0027ll fit right in, welcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
