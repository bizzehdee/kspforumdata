I\\\u0027ve always loved space and aviation and games and sims that are about these subjects. Love Orbiter but not very good at it. I really love the easy UI and setup of KSP. Plus I\\\u0027ve always wanted a nice looking, space game with capsules and modules and such. I tried the demo last year but recently purchased the preorder and just got the latest version that now includes separate 3D animated Kerbal models and its outstanding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m still a very poor engineer and mostly succeede at creating flying debris but its loads of fun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust saying hello and I have a question.
