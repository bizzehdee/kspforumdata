I ought to give a shoutout to Northerlion (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/Northernlion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/user/Northernlion\u003C/a\u003E) for introducing me to it while I\\\u0027m at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just picked up the game this past weekend. This is such a great concept for a game it\\\u0027s shocking that it hasn\\\u0027t been done before (or if it has I\\\u0027m certainly not aware of it!). And yet I know of multitudes of games like Train Simulators. The fact that this group could take such a simple yet excellent idea and add so many features is fantastic! Seeing the features planed for later versions of the game is exciting too. There\\\u0027s certainly a lot of potential to build upon what is available now! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I\\\u0027m pleasantly surprised by is how active the members of the community are. Although I haven\\\u0027t had to use it yet things like the graphics mod to make the game run smoother are great to see! It\\\u0027s really great to see people helping each other out. Also I really appreciate the various tutorials, hints and tips people have posted on the forum and on the wiki.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I just have the demo, but I\\\u0027d like to support the game and buy the full version. However, I am having an issue that causes a crash. I\\\u0027d make a thread in the support forum but it seems like everything there is focused on v15 (aka the full version). Is it okay to ask for assistance with an issue in the demo?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise I really appreciate the concept of the game and although there\\\u0027s obviously a lot more to be added I am trying to fully explore the possibilities presented in the demo. So far I\\\u0027ve:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Established an orbit around Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Punched the face of Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Launched far into the black abyss, dooming my astronauts to an eternity of nothingness\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there more that can be done in the demo I\\\u0027m not seeing? I know the features in the full version allow for a plethora of greater possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks again to everyone that has contributed to this game and this community. So far everything\\\u0027s been a whole lot of fun and I hope it will be even moreso in the future! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-27T18:58:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can ask about problems with the Demo.
