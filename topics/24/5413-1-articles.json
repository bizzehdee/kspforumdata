I know what half of you are already thinking. A kid? On a forum? The community is dead. I assure you not. While most of my brethren in age are immature or (to be frank) idiotic, I can almost guarantee you that this is not the case. I can be mature, enjoy humor, and even support or help the community! Giving back is always great, yes? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to business, the game itself. I have only a hour or two under my belt, but I already love it. And the fact that it is in Alpha, and under heavy development? Truly amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of my current achievements in the game are going out of the atmosphere and creating a ship that lands and takes off again. What I am working on now is reaching the moon, or mun, as it be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan on donating, and officially buying the game, as soon as a credit or debt pay system is reached. I am a kid, after all, and Paypal is clearly above my intellectual levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to something that is probably going to make you mad. Scanning this lovely community, I have discovered a hatred for a certain Youtube channel. The Yogscast. I am actually subscribed to these Brits. Now what really sucks? You guys are correct about them. Well, not the group itself, but about its community. Besides a couple of uncommon mature supporters, most of the Yogscast community is.. childish. I won\\\u0027t go further into detail because it is difficult bashing on my own community. The video makers themselves are pretty humorous though, and I feel ashamed you all are judging them horribly because of the mass of idiots who subscribe to them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with this, I bid my welcome. Also, I am going to try this Marquee text option.. I never saw it before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[move]Hello[/move]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JupiterII","CreatedById":8029,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-13T01:04:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the community!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-13T01:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ping111","CreatedById":8679,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-13T01:06:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, twin brother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also a \\\u0027deserving\\\u0027 child on the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pointless","CreatedById":13502,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-13T01:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for the wonderful welcomes.
