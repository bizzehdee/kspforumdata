My Earth base is Portsmouth UK. I thought of doing things a bit more realistically, couple of test launches, then put a few satellites in orbit, couple of unmanned orbit and rentry flights before trying a manned orbit, then go about heading outwards, start on a space station and so on. Final question is, should I record every launch and put it in a blog/diary or just stick it on YouTube, and will people actually care and watch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T19:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T18:31:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the community Agricola \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy preference is for a travelogue with pics, but most people do like to watch youtube vids so I think you should go with that idea, and yeah people will watch \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus you aren\u0027t far from me, fellow UK south coast denizen \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun recording, and fly safe!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
