On my youtube channel CallisTrOn Entertainment you find some (more or less) entertaining videos. I\u0027m working on improving the quality of the videos, so maybe it is worth to check them out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI joined the forum now, because I will start a big challenge event named KSP Raceleague. You will find the thread of it in the challenge forum (soon). I hope some of you will take part :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I got 2 problems with the forum. I can\u0027t put an avatar in my profile, and I don\u0027t know where I can edit my signature. Would be awesome if someone could help me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T16:04:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum (at last! how could you keep playing KSP for that long without joining before? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour \u0022problems\u0022 with the forum are the same every new user finds: until you have at least 3 posts approved, there are some restrictions in what you can do, among them editing avatar and signature.
