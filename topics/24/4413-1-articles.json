The last few updates have really made me addicted and I cannot wait for what the game will bring in the future.

My Skyrim character is getting jealous. ;P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to use all sorts of mods, but recently found much pleasure in going 100% stock. Landing on the Mun and coming back is so much more nerve-racking, but also much more satisfying I find. I keep track of my misadventures on a blog.
