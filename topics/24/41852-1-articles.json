I just bought KSP a week ago and have been enjoying it immensely. I learned about the game watching a couple of LP\u0027s and thought it looked like fun. I\u0027ve also been reading the tutorials on the wiki, which have really helped. Currently I\u0027m trying to get two ships to dock successfully, but I still have quite a ways to go. So far I\u0027ve just barely managed to get the ships close together and in the same orbit a couple of times. Hopefully I will master it soon so I can start building a cool space station and other cool space things! Anyway, if anyone has any good tips please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee You Space Cowboys,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDancinDarunia\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T16:39:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
