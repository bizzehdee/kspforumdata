I find this refreshing as compared to other gaming forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am Angvar, a 46 year old ancient gaming veteran who picked up this super amazing game about a month ago. The best way to express how much I am enjoying it is to point out that I have already racked up 400 plus hours playing this game on steam alone and probably 50 plus on my KSP store version while I settled a gaggle of issues with the latest update. Good thing this is the slow part of the season at my work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have always played the begeezus out of every game I have become involved with. I love to experiment with and explore every nook and cranny I can find in a game. Now I have found a game that is nothing but experimenting and exploring. Utterly Outstanding!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to role play while I play games. I imagine a scenario that my characters in game fit into which adds greatly to the experience for me. This time around I am ][van Kermanovich, Glorious leader of the peoples Great Soviet Kerbal Space Program. I am American of Ukrainian/Russian decent and yes I like to drink vodka and play patriotic Red Army choir tunes while I am in playing this game. I need to see if I can replace the music in the game so I can have the anthem play on launch and Hunt for Red October play when I hit orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played with the sandbox for exactly one launch and then went right to career mode. I wanted to learn the parts and their capabilities as I went along. I managed to get a lander onto the Mun (In not so many pieces) with just what the game had to offer and my own experimentation. At that point I started to watch the tutorials and read posts here. Very useful! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I have managed to scientificate up to the 550 point level of which I think I have two nodes. I have made a manned landing and return to Minimus and the Mun. And I have blanketed much of Minimus with probe landers. At some point I decided to get serious about my program and came up with a strategy. Scientificate from the home world out. I built a plane, a probe rocket and a rover to explore the biomes of Kerbin. Pretty sure I have 99% of Kerbin biomes all sussed out. Then I started my rover/colonization program, which has kept me very busy. Today I finally settled on a final prototype after driving two other versions across vast distances of the Mun. Now I am ready to initiate my steppes people style roving science colonization program. Basically hauling my housing, fuel and scientific apparatus around behind my rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that is probably enough. As you can tell I can run my mouth (fingers). You all have a great time and I look forward to interacting with you all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-06T06:53:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2014 06:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Angvar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMessy Post\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T06:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Angvar, and welcome to the forum. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E46 year old ancient gaming veteran \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet off my lawn, you punk kid!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angvar","CreatedById":107332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T06:28:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHello Angvar, and welcome to the forum. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet off my lawn, you punk kid!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELol, ok maybe not as ancient as some maybe but compared to the crowd I am used to running with in other games I am usually the old fart. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do remember my father showing me how to make punch cards to play blackjack on his computer at work and also playing around with his blackjack program on a computer you would program with cables like an old style switch board. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that counts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-06T06:49:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2014 06:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Angvar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERemembered some ancient history.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaelath","CreatedById":106084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T06:39:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi!
