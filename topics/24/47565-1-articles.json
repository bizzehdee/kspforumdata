I\u0027m N3BULAV0ID (pretty 1337 huh?) and I\u0027m newishish to KSP, been playing for about a month. I\u0027ve successfully completed M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus landings, now I\u0027m working on setting up an orbital fuel depot. I figured it would be nice to have a forums account so that I could ask questions about anything I\u0027m having trouble with... which brings me to the first of what will likely be very, very many:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to get 5 rockomax 64 fuel cans to orbit in one launch for my fuel depot, but I\u0027m having some trouble. Any ideas/videos that I could watch?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T20:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat sort of trouble are you having?

Of course they had to be refueled once I got them there. Which wasn\u0027t too difficult, I\u0027ve learned bigger isn\u0027t always better. I\u0027m setting up two different refueling stations, one orbiting Minmus which is basically a space station and another which is going to orbit Duna once I get it there. The one which will orbit Duna is going to be a no frills refueling station, just the basics to get the job done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N3BULAV0ID","CreatedById":84268,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T21:33:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETyvm.
