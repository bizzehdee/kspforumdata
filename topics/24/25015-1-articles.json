For 4 years, I was fixed on EVE, then on STO for about half a year, then both fell to the way side. For a little while I was into SC2013, but that lasted about 2 weeks. When EA put out the call that we get a free game, I played ME3 for about 2 weeks and beat it. Half way through a second run for things I\u0027ve missed. After that, decided to load up Spore and set a goal at beating all of the Grox, with cheats. Have a small dent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith EVE, you either harass other players, or, you avoid other harassing players. For STO, you get something like 60 unique missions between two races, and then grind anything else. KSP is truly a replacement for SimCity 2013. No grinding. The $30 or so I paid... Yeah... Extremely worth it. I downloaded the free version, installed, but didn\u0027t get a chance to play. Started watching Youtube, heard the comments about the video lag, but knew about the stage of the software, so, I\u0027m cool with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this is really REALLY pre-pre-pre alpha to the alpha, and there are a LOT of optimizations that have to come out before a true Alpha is sent out. My major beef IS with the lack of optimizations for video, the lack of support for multi-core. Hitting up GPUs for Physics would be great, however, that is extra dev time. I need to load up my GPU monitors to see what kind of hurt they take on when playing KSP, but I hear the fans spin up on my twin GTX570 cards. Wonder if I SLI them if that\u0027d help? hmmm....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, here\u0027s to a long and successful endeavor with this program.

I\u0027ve created a tug for emergency purposes, and I\u0027ve also created a rescue boat that can go up, attach to the station, and return safely.
