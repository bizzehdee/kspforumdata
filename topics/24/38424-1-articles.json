I am relatively new to KSP and I would just like to have the honor of saying hello to all the other people on the forums! I thought I was pretty decent at first at this game (Didn\u0027t we all?) until I saw some youtube videos of scott manly and some other great kerbalnauts and realized how I definitely need to learn more about this amazing game. If you have any suggestions and tips for a beginner (I have been playing for a month) it would be much appreciated!
