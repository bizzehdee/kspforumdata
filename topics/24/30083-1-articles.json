was wondering how small SSTO planes usually get? i got one down to 15 parts! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E have you seen a smaller SSTO space plane takeoff from the runway with three wheels?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand also wanted to say thanks to the Dev\u0027s who have made this game what it is... i love a good space sim \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei was hoping to set a challenge here on the forum about getting into orbit with a SSTO carrying a payload then going to Mun to drop off the payload in Munnar orbit and coming back to KSC runway using the least amount of parts/weight possible,carrying the smallest amount of fuel/air intakes possible and flying with kerbal power not a probe body... but im not sure how to set the limits on part count and maximum weight as well as other rules that im sure would be good to implement and am looking for ideas/help\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ething is im not to experienced with SSTO\u0027s design other than my own so i need input on a few things concerning SSTO Design also im wondering if anyone has seen small SSTO\u0027s pop up like these before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei have put together a 20 part SSTO that can get to Mun and back with enough left to land and im wondering if anyone has seen a SSTO plane put together with less part\u0027s i know i can put a 15 part SSTO into orbit but without ASAS and only one intake so its a bit rough getting up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E i also have a 25 part SSTI(interplanetary) that works well and can also take off and land twice(getting into orbit) at the KSC without refuel \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E and it does have a docking port for refueling and or small payloads \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei do not use any mods or the Dev debugging menu i only have my skill at design to blame for these works of art \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E oh and i was also wondering if intakes have gotten nerfed at all in the 0.20 update?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for reading and i hope some help will come from this long post \u003Cimg

SSTI or at least it didn\u0027t come up when i searched for it \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei wonder can i really be onto a simple design that works better then all these big complex ones im seeing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei always make a point of trying for few parts due to my very old computer... but hay it worked out i guess lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei am also in the process of filming/editing my first youtube video where i pay tribute to 0.20 by flying to Mun to plant a flag with only a 20 part plane(one stage nothing left behind) and make it back to the runway in time for supper \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen that\u0027s done ill release my first SSTO for download and then make another video showing the 15 part craft performing in my SSTO how low can you go challenge \u003Cimg

be a good SSTO judge or what you could do to help me organize/plane this challenge right \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplease let me know through a PM[not in this thread] if you are interested and thanks

I would be lying if i said I wasn\u0027t intrigued. I just tried to make an SSTO with bare minimum parts. I even removed the landing gear and tried to use a parachute to land the thing during testing, but at least one engine always broke off.
