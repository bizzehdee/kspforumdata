I grabbed Simple Rockets on my Android phone a while back as a Free App of the Day on Amazon, and always saw the \u0022Try Kerbal Space Program\u0022 option in the menu. I finally grabbed it, and I am amazed at how awesome this game is (even in it\u0027s pre launch state!). So far I\u0027ve had successful (albeit HIGHLY inefficient) trips to Mun and Minnus, as well as somehow accidentally stranding a Kerbal in orbit around the sun. I recently have tried my hand at space station building for fun, and FINALLY had my first successful docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am thinking of branching out and trying some mods or maybe some sort of noob-friendly challenges to try. Do you folks have any suggestions for either? Also, a friend of mine is grabbing the game soon to play (I think it runs on Mac, right) and wanted to try a multiplayer mod. I\u0027ve looked at Kerbal Multiplayer, and it looks pretty cool, but I haven\u0027t been able to access the threads for any of the other threads linked by the wiki. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is nice to join in this community, and it looks really fun! Thanks Squad for an awesome experience, and I hope to see you all out there on the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T07:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Sucitraf.
