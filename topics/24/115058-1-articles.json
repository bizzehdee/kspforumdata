I tried landing on the Mun first, but either by wrong techniques or inferior design I was forced to make it a no-contact trip. I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to land safely, however I tried, so I hobbled back to Kerbin, to use my new science to upgrade my design and try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI switched pods from a cluster of lander cans to the full three-seater, and with some science tech I sat it upon a thick and short fuel tank, and radially mounted four others with terrier engines under them. Each are mounted with radial decouplers for an easier trip home, and another terrier is seated under the main tank in the center. This is just the lander of course, the other stages aren\u0027t much issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for some reason this setup is causing me some irreconcilable issues, and I\u0027ve no idea why. The center of thrust and mass are all fine, and after the first firing all seems well. But as they keep firing, two of the radial engines are burning WAY faster than the others, and eventually flameout and become unusable, lest the whole thing starts spinning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t figure out why this is. None of them are sharing fuel lines, unless the decouplers do that and I hadn\u0027t realized it. But even if, why would two drain faster than the others?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s weird too; one of the tanks clearly fires, but doesn\u0027t indicate ANY fuel loss when I right click it in flight, while the engine has burned out beneath it, and the staging indicator shows it\u0027s empty... what the smeg is going on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T22:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPictures of the vessel in question often help diagnose problems.

I fixed it by remaking it... but I abandoned the design anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t do it. I just can\u0027t pull this off, and I don\u0027t have a clue why.

Completing basic goals takes me DAYS of trial and failure. I\u0027m not kidding when I say some of this has made me burst into tears out of sheer frustration. Rescuing a Kerbal from low orbit took me so long that I couldn\u0027t believe it once I\u0027d actually pulled it off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I\u0027m trying to land on the Mun and return... and it\u0027s... IMPOSSIBLE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean it. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s supposed to be this hard, and supposedly I\u0027m playing on the easiest setting. I ALWAYS run dry of fuel, and crash into the Mun at anywhere from 100 to 350 meters per second. I\u0027ve even tried incorporating the RCS thrusters against the speed. I\u0027m not coming in at a steep angle, in fact I\u0027m basically just letting the orbit decay until it reaches the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut by the time I\u0027ve dumped a full minute of the liquid fuel in the transfer orbit, and secured a mun-centric orbit... I\u0027ve got nothing left. I have enough to suicide into a crater of my making, or maybe run away with my tail between my legs and waste 30-100 thousand credits of funding on a failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m starting to master the basic Kerbin orbit, and can be left with a 3rd of the fuel in my second stage to begin the transfer. But that transfer orbit, if you\u0027re carrying ANYTHING and not employing the optimal periapsis approximate transfer, will leave your final stage with almost nothing, even using the efficiency of the terrier engine. And if that doesn\u0027t happen, I\u0027ll run dry of monopropellant and electricity, to be left in a dead float.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve built ridiculous rockets with asparagus staging, tried loading up the lander with TONS of fuel, and make the containers ejectable when they run dry to dump mass where possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s why it feels so impossible: even if you BRING more fuel, it only tends to weigh you down and make you pay for the expense by having the trip require more fuel because you brought more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even gave up and installed MechJeb, just to see if it was even POSSIBLE... and I\u0027m not convinced it even is anymore, because THAT just crashed too!!!

I hate what this game does to me. I\u0027m literally crying right now, because what I\u0027m attempting has taken so long, needed so many attempts, and shouldn\u0027t be this hard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already been to Duna and Ike. It took two refueling missions, but I got the crew and science back. Landed a huge base on the Mun. Figured I\u0027d do some more with Duna before attempting Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I took on both base-landing missions to Duna and Ike, and the rescue of a Kerbal from Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting there was easy. My base design was too long and wobbly to be practical on a planet with an atmosphere, but I landed it all the same, only losing the then useless nuclear engine on its end, and coming down too hard on the front wheels which snapped. Otherwise, operational and in one consistent piece. I retired the design because of the numerous flaws I encountered, and went with something more practical for Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe REAL challenge was the return mission, sending an unmanned ship with a lander to ferry them all back. It took three full mission attempts, and reloads to be settle on a lander design that could make it back to orbit, and even rendezvous with the main ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo since I landed the base in a sensible location along the equator, picking up the four Kerbals there was doable.

I don\u0027t care. This game is hard enough as it is, and I dropped forty bucks on this thing. But the landing guidance has done me so well, that with Duna I\u0027ve been thrown for a loop. On the Mun base missions, I had to be careful about using the guidance, because using the base as a target would almost always guarantee my lander would drop right onto it and break off solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here... I don\u0027t know what to do. I\u0027m so tired, so DONE, and the idea of relaunching the return mission again makes me physically ill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing guidance, every time, brakes WAY too late, and ends up blasting far from the landing site on the pole, nearly 20 kilometers generally. WAY beyond the accepted 2 kilometers the game allows so another ship/kerbal can be controlled and rescued by an unmanned lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I\u0027ve tried landing manually... and it\u0027s no good. Oh, I can land it. I have parachutes, and in conjunction I can put her down within 3/4 of a kilometer... the issue is getting back. The Landing Guidance of Mechjeb is efficient enough to land me, and put me back in orbit with the engines and fuel I have. I did LOTS of tests on Kerbin to find a lander that could get the highest of the others, and tested different levels of fuel with the winning design. It\u0027s as good as it gets, though next time I might consider a seat-only lander to remove the weight of a whole pod. Really I used a four-seater crew cabin, which sounded great with its half-weight on the space shuttle pod, but now remembering you don\u0027t friction-burn leaving Duna, the external seats sound like a good bet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut basically, manual landing means I lose too much fuel to achieve orbit again, and Mechjeb can\u0027t get me close enough as I see it... does the landing guidance need some sort of best case scenario?

If you\u0027re tired of crashing landers into a variety of orbital bodies, leave them alone for a while and find something else to blow up. Spaceplanes are interestingly tricky with 1.0, for example, and have a much shorter turnover than interplanetary probes between launch and disintegration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cutlercollin99","CreatedById":135764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T03:04:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you would, please post some pictures by screen shooting the game. f2 is the key or fn F2 for mac.
