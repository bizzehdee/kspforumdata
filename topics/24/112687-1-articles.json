It\u0027s quite captivating (especially for a sandbox game, as these usually can\u0027t hold me that long).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently playing a normal career mode and after several restarts (and various explosions) i think i have a fine grasp on the basics (currently finetuning my fuel-usage to get into orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever i have some questions, which i couldn\u0027t answer via the wiki or by browsing the forum, so i hope it\u0027s ok to ask here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. During the trainings-mission when activating SAS i get these vector-nodes besides my navball to tell my pilot to automaticly target this node. So far i have gathered that in career mode, how much of theses vectors turn up depends on the level of the pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, do i also get these icons when using a probe-body (with SAS) on an unmanned vessel? Currently i have only unlocked the first probe body with SAS (the one after the sputnik) but no icons appear. Am i\u0027m out of luck (as i find these quite usefull when executing maneuvers) or do higher tech probe-bodys have these little helpful icons?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Transmitting science data after conducting an experiment gets usually less science then keeping the data and returning the vessel. Until now i have witholded transmitting any data in fear that it would lower my total science i could get out of an experiment/situation-combination. But after reading a bit up i\u0027m not so sure anymore. So can i safely transmit all material studys i conduct in high orbit (for example) and still reach the maximum science cap for that experiment? (Though it would take me more experiements then if i return it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. How to control a plane?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve unlocked only the first tech to build planes and thought i might try building a small one - after putting a lot more wings on it (so much that i didn\u0027t have enough parts left to put on some parachutes..) i finally managed to get one into the air, for about 20sec before i crashed it into the water. I know it\u0027s probably difficult to answer this without a concrete example, but most of the time i\u0027m not sure if i crash because the design has some errors, or if the design could fly, and i just can\u0027t control it. Any general tips to found out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Delta-v and return home\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve read several nice tutorials here about delta-v and it\u0027s importance and since i installed kerbal engineer my rockets are becoming a lot better. Since after i got a good design to launch a satelite into orbit (with properly planned fuel usage - currently i have to burn to much of my last stage) i want to send a probe to the mun i\u0027m thinking about how much delta-v i need. Figuring out how much i need for the trip to mun is not a big deal, but it seems the delta-v maps never contain the required delta-v for the hometrip. Or do i just need the same amount i needed for the first trip? (Lets say orbit -\u0026gt; orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk i think thats enough questions for now, since this is in the welcome-forum after all.
