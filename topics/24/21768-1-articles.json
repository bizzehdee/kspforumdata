His discription was vague and unintresting but i gave it a look anyways. Boy was I glad I did. I purchased the full game before I even tried the demo when I seen an active forum and modding community I knew it was safe to have high hopes for this game. Last night after I downloaded I played around with making a space plane. Tonight I made a simple two stage solid rocket and I am currently 75,000m above kerbel enjoying the view from space. I\u0027m pretty sure I can\u0027t reenter the atmosphere without burning up, but I got half a tank of liqiud left on my module and im gonna go for it. I knew I should have fit that pilot assist thingy as im now spinning wildly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Anyways, I thought I\u0027d come on and say hello to all you since I\u0027m positive I\u0027ll be around for a while.

I\u0027ve seen ships that are able to be put in orbit fine when flown manually, but mechjeb will crash every time.
