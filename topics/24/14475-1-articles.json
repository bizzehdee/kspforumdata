Just wanted to say hello and make myself known on the forums, a place I feel I will be spending a lot of time on in the future. I\\\u0027ve played the demo for KSP a couple of times in the past and always loved the game, and finally decided to take the plunge and purchase it. As a budding shipbuilder, I know I\\\u0027ll probably be here often with lots of questions to ask, so I\\\u0027m hoping patience is something many of you are good at. Judging from the forums, the community here is pretty friendly, so I\\\u0027m looking forward to getting to mingle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-17T06:00:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
