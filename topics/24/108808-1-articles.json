I never posted an introduction thread, so I figure it\u0027s better late than never. I meant to post this as post #1000... but I got carried away elsewhere and realized my post count was already up there.\n\nI\u0027ve been playing KSP for a couple years, but it wasn\u0027t until about 12 months ago that I started installing mods. Then finally signed up on the forum (for more improved lurking) back in August. My first mod was released in late November... and it\u0027s been crazy times ever since.\n\nHere\u0027s to the next 1000 posts, and a few mod ideas that I have floating in my head that may come to fruition in the coming months. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T19:51:50Z","Content":"Well, long delayed hello to you as well!
