I must say it\u0027s a lot easier landing on landing gear than wingtips. I don\u0027t have pictures at the moment of my landers, but my current setup for my most reliable lander is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELander: 1.5 tanks, adv SAS, mk1 pod (on the sides it carries two 1.5 fuel tanks that can be modified as beacons and dropped on the moon\u0027s surface)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch stage: 3x big solid boosters, 3x 1.5 droppable fuel tanks, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eall attached to 9xfuel tanks and 3 main thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis setup I\u0027ve been able to land on both Minumus, then on Mun, then return with not only fuel to spare, but also with the entire lander intact on Kerbin\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also been able to modify it and stick satellites to the front and lift them into orbit with some success. So far I\u0027m stock though, so workin only with vanilla parts before I really mess with mods.

It\u0027s big enough to fly something large through it if you REALLY tried. So now my empty rocket is stuck there as a rescue pod for crashed missions I guess.
