I was up until recently however hilariously bad in all aspects of fictional rocketry, managing to blow up myself up on the launch pad more often than I\u0027d put a capsule into orbit. I guess practice has helped me however, as I\u0027ve become much better these days - so much so that I\u0027ve managed to build a craft that could orbit Kerbin, Mun and Minmus and complete the circuit without losing anyone to catastrophic existence failure along the way. Now, if I could just figure out how to keep Jeb from dying every time he gets near the Munar surface; that remains one hell of a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, good day to you all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheGadfly","CreatedById":54328,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T06:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi all,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just bought and downloaded the game a couple days ago. It\u0027s really interesting, and I love how open-ended it can be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have yet to shoot a successful orbit, but I have made successful liftoffs and splashdowns using the parachute. I\u0027ve found that controlling rockets and planes is much easier using joystick with the sensitivity sliders at the minimum, and from the cockpit view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to wonder though - how does the spaceship and capsule (with and without SAS) orient itself? I don\u0027t see thruster jets unless I add a thrust pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have to ask what happened when I accidentally shot my Kerbal into deep space - it seemed to be going on a trajectory perpendicular to the other planetary orbits, but then suddenly took on a circular orbit around Kerbol. Did I miss something about the ship\u0027s trajectory?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it\u0027s a wonderful piece of software, and I can\u0027t believe how few guys are part of the development team.
