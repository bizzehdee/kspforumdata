I\u0027ve exploded a few times on re-entry, and quite a few more times with low-altitude flights where my ship tips over and spins wildly out of control, or the parachute doesn\u0027t have time to deploy.\u00A0 I\u0027ve build aircraft that get off the runway but not off the ground before tearing off wings and other parts. Name a newbie mistake, and I\u0027ve probably made it...several times. (experience keeps a dear school and I\u0027m slow learner.) \u00A0 Since I really don\u0027t like crashing and burning, and my piloting skills are atrocious, I haven\u0027t made a whole lot of progress before I go back to the beginning and try again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI upgraded to 1.8.1. Currently I\u0027m doing a plain unmodded careeer game on a fairly hard difficulty setting: no more reverting flights. On career mode with limited funds,\u00A0 this tends to enforce a safe, baby steps to avoid losing expensive parts, vehicles, and pilots while I gain experience and correct design flaws...but I have to keep introducing innovations in order to fulfill increasingly difficult contracts. It\u0027s a tricky balancing act. and I\u0027m often not sure what innovation to add next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I have jet propelled wheeled ground vehicle loaded with instruments for tooling around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and collecting science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) I have a aviation flight test program that I;m using to conduct limited power runway tests in order to find and correct instabilities what would be fatal once I get off the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) i am conducting tests on various combinations of engine, fuel, and staging, so that I can perform targeted suborbital flights at increasing range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the new tools available, so far, KSP has become fun again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-12T04:31:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, that\u0027s all pretty normal. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Welcome to the forum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
