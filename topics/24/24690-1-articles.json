I persevered through my teething troubles building my first rocket, and promptly went for a launch, I hit space, but was sub-orbital. Frantically I looked about for the KSP formus... Off-line, DAMN!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway long story short. After some more trials I managed to get to low earth/kerbal/I-forget_the-planet-name\u0022 orbit... Needless to say I handed over my $23 that same night I downloaded the demo, what a blast! I LOVE KSP!
