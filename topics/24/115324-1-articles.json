I have followed KSP progress on Steam for some time. I missed it in the Summer Sale, but started watching Scott Manly videos about it, and couldn\u0027t wait any longer, so here I am, a full price player. \u00C3\u00B0\u00C5\u00B8\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been playing a career game, because the progression is what most appeals to me. I have attained my first Kerbin orbit, but I feel like it was rather inefficient, and I\u0027d like some advice. My 4 stage rocket has 1.5 twr and 1.35 twr on the first and second stage. I started my gravity turn East at 100 mps, and then fought it over to 45 degrees at around 10-12k. From there, I waited till my apo was 72k, and killed my engine. About 30 seconds from apo, I turned prograde and burned at full to gain orbital velocity. I was able to pull the peri up to about 60k, but at the same time my apo went up to 130k. I needed to make 2 more corrective burns to circularize. Where can I improve? I am using the terrier for my last stage, and have tons of delta V, I also have a 3rd of a tank left upon deorbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, strictly from a roleplaying perspective, I\u0027d like to salvage as much of my jettisoned debris as I can. I don\u0027t want to put stayputniks on them though, and I don\u0027t have the confidence yet to leave my main craft in a deteriorating orbit to maneuver the discards. Are there any mods or workarounds to help me with this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for a great game and a great community, Squad. You guys rock!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T19:53:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny orbit where your Kerbals (or machine) survives... is a GOOD orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esaid By Jeb Kerman, just now, in my head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reolos","CreatedById":147659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T20:00:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do agree!

It adds a small amount of complexity to your build phase as you will need to add parachutes to anything that will come off your rocket the you wish to save. You will need enough chutes to safely land the debris. Your part count, and cost will of course go up accordingly.

You may need more control authority so that it\u0027s less work to make a gradual arc toward orbit, with your craft. That comes first from gimballing engines like the LV-T45, from tail fins with control surfaces (yaw/pitch adjustment in flight), if you have those unlocked. And last from reaction wheels, if you have those unlocked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also like trying for in-physics recovery, the 22km physics range in KSP v1.0 allows for more experiments, but, I find its impractical most of the time. You can lower the parachute deployment altitude and do experiments.

My payload is the one man pod, 2 goos, science Jr, a heat shield, and 3 chutes. Not a big load. I like to keep my twr low, because I don\u0027t like fighting with the atmo.

You can adjust their thrust output in the VAB (right-click to set.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I have SAS modules on a craft, I tend to leave them on. Later on, when you are docking craft at odd angles to each other, SAS on the connected craft can cause wobble and unplanned disassembly, that\u0027s when I turn it off and use F sporadically, just to get things to settle down. (If you want to dock a third thing, or go EVA.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a 30 part craft, the gimbal control range may be too much, leading to a twitchy over-control problem. You may not even need fins. You can set the percentage of gimbal range in the VAB by right-click, if that is a problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to your specific question about what I did - I pretty much explained it. When I have this \u0022problem\u0022 it\u0027s usually because I\u0027m going too fast in a straight-up direction, and wish I had slowed down or had more control, so I could have gone sideways a bit earlier in the process. If you didn\u0027t have a gimbal engine before, that will make a big difference. An optimal ascent is a curve toward Apo orbit, that can begin (very slowly) a few hundred meters above the launchpad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117876-Why-Does-My-FLIPing-Rocket-Always-Flip-Over%21-%28Easy-Picture-Explanation%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis fairly short post,\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119185\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis other longer post\u003C/a\u003E, for some more detailed rocket basics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
