I started with a high speed vehicle which dropped a cluster of instruments, but without mods the pod just disappears. So I moved on to perfecting my piloting so I can land anywhere. I\u0027m working on a simple 2 engine jet with big wings and lots of fuel that can glide at low speeds and land in some pretty rough terrain...will be more capable as my flying improves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I want to develop a rover/delivery system for the survey missions on the Mun/Minmus...thinking about picking the brains of a few obviously talented builders on this forum to maybe learn a thing or two about a thing or two...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning a vanilla install.

Even at that speed it also tends to take a loooong time to get between different places. Although pretty cool for short-range work you\u0027re usually better-off using a \u0027hopper\u0027 design that flies to the next destination on a sub-orbital trajectory, or even re-establishes orbit.
