Besides Kerbal Engineer Redux, I also installed Protractor and Transfer Window Planner. Between the three, I should be able to plan a mission and build a launch vehicle to spec. I also downloaded AntennaRange to add some realism, although it means losing contact with the sat with the whip antenna I diverted into solar orbit to fill a \u0022Fly by the Sun\u0022 contract (oops!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
