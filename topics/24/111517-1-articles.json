I can get into orbit around Kerbin, but I can\u0027t seem to get anywhere else. I started in career and left it on easy, but I am still stuck. Its been a long time since I have played any KSP. I have been streaming on Twitch and have had one person join that helped and that\u0027s how I got to where orbiting Kerbin became easy. So any tips here would be awesome, and if you guys want to join me while I am streaming I will put my Twitch channel below.
