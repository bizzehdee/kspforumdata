Smaller ships take less to move around and are more stable. You can start off with a one man pod, ASAS, small fuel tank, and one small engine. See where that gets you. Then add more slowly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVanamonde has posted some great resources, but if you still need more I made a simple tutorial for the complete build step by step, and the launch step by step to get a ship into orbit.
