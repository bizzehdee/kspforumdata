As you all know, our Space Program has grown by leaps and bounds in the last few days. We credit these recent advances to our determined highway cleanup crew. Without their help we could have never achieved the advances we have. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe would also like to give a heartfelt thank you to all the resilient kitizens who live near the KSP. Without their steadfast determination to rebuild their houses so quickly, we would have had to shut down our program due to that troublesome \u0027crimes against kermanity\u0027 law.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to the matter at hand. We would like to announce the successful orbit of our first satellite. Its in a pretty stable orbit of 98,000m to 96,500m on a heading of 237 degrees. Although we consider this a great achievement, several problems did arise during the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of these problems was the loss of thruster fuel on the way to orbit. Jebadiah was confident that this would not be a problem in the future. He was also confident that this was only a minor problem for our satellite launch. Turns out he was right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem arose when started to jettison our satellite. We haven\\\u0027t figured out how this happened yet, but somehow during the satellite jettison our crews de-orbit stage was jettisoned at the same time. Bob and Bill tell me this is a \u0027huge freakin problem\u0027 and something about \u0027we\\\u0027re all going to die\u0027 Jeb is confident that this \u0027only prolongs our time in space\u0027. Jeb seems very excited about this new development, as we all are, here at KSP. Not only did we launch one satellite, we launched 2, with the same spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe would like to put an end to these rumors that our brave crew is \u0027never coming back\u0027. We are confident that our crew will return one day. All of our scientists here at Redneck Rockets Inc. promise us that the crew will return. They said they would \u0027get back to us\u0027 on when we can expect this joyous homecoming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are very proud of our new space program and hope you will continue to choose Redneck Rockets for all your space needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-25T01:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
