Like I said, I\u0027ve been playing for almost a week. I did watch one tutorial, I suppose, and from it learned a few tips I would never have figured out on my own. I watched Scott Manley\u0027s tutorial about orbiting the Mun. I felt like I wasn\u0027t really cheating because I had already done it once. But, I could not repeat it in 7-8 tries and got frustrated and then watched his video. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, after all that, it was a little stop and go at first. But, now I\u0027m doing well. I just did two missions and orbited Minimus twice, successful on first try. So, I felt pretty good about that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m happy to be here. I\u0027m learning a lot about space travel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"madmat","CreatedById":16054,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T04:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EG\u0027day joe and welcome to the forum. Scott Manleys vids are an excellent way to learn all things KSP. Enjoy the game and feel free to ask if you have any major dramas. Small things like unexpected explosions and rapid deconstructions should not be regarded as unusual.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T05:30:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!
