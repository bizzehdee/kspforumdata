My first launch went well, and I reached orbit without anything blowing itself up or crashing into the surface; Jeb was a happy camper that day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I got cocky. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided I would go straight for the Mun and, thanks to some luck and a high school physics education a few years removed, I managed to get there! That\u0027s right, on my second ever mission the Alice I made its way all the way to the Mun, then promptly crashed into the surface. Which is a bit of a good thing, \u0027cause poor Jeb didn\u0027t even have enough fuel to land let alone get back in one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Alice I\u0027s sucfailcess, I moved on to build the Alice II, the first spacecraft ever to time-accelerate itself directly into a collision with the Mun. But at least I had enough fuel! So I decided to call that a trial-run and tried again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, I figured out how to take screenshots just in time to catch the \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E Alice II\u0027s landing on the Mun! With enough fuel to get back this time...or so I thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img836/7975/screenshot1cs.png/\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1cs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee?

Sort of. It hit me mid-flight that I was forgetting something important, something thrust-to-weight-like...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, a few empty fuel tanks and a completely under-shot delta-v goal later, Bill Kerman not only had the distinction of being the first Kerbal on the Mun, he also managed to be the first Kerbal to orbit the Sun in the same flight! He\u0027s still there, y\u0027know, in a 12 million km circular orbit. I wondered if I should attempt a rescue, but then realized I still had failed to get to the Mun \u003Cem\u003Eand back\u003C/em\u003E. To the VAB!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img16/1278/screenshot4in.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot4in.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Alice III, a much simpler design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time I did manage to make it there and back, although I had some issues with plane corrections and almost didn\u0027t have enough fuel for the voyage home. Also, like the dingus I am, I relapsed into thinking printscreen was the screenshot key, so no shots of my historic achievement in luckology. I wonder if Bill saw the flight...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pursuedtank","CreatedById":50078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T08:53:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice one!
