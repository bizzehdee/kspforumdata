In that you start out with a rocket that has two tanks overlapping or clipping into a third (centre) one. Is it possible to do the same in the vanilla game, and if so, how?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-13T04:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/177712-icyhot/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022177712\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/177712-icyhot/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ICYHOT\u003C/a\u003E, and welcome aboard!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, I have never played that scenario, so I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re referring to, However, based on \u0022clipping\u0022 and \u0022overlapping,\u0022 I\u0027d say you should look at the offset tool. It allows you to move parts a limited amount in the X,Y, and Z axes, which will probably give the result you\u0027re looking for. Back in the old days, we had to use combinations of cubic struts to do the same thing, or use the \u0022cheats\u0022 menu to attach two parts to the same location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-13T04:50:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, looking at the image it seems like the tanks were radially attached and then offset into the main tank.
