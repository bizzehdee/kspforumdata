In many of the videos they say that you should take off in a west facing direction (270 degrees) instead of the typical east when visiting inner planets. I have not seen one where they explain why that is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know exiting Kerbin\u0027s local system in the retrograde direction (from Kerbin\u0027s velocity vector) will help visit inner planets because it slows down your orbit with relation to the Sun, but I don\u0027t think that leaving Kerbin in a west facing orbit will affect that at all.
