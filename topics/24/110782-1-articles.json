I have been hooked ever since! I have already started working on my first addon (about a month into it) which I hope to be able to share with all y\u0027all if I get it to the point that it would be cool enough to share. I am an astrophysicist by training, so the mod I am working on is geared towards that. This forum has helped me quite a bit so far, so I thought it would be a good time to sign up, got a few questions that I haven\u0027t been able to find answers to quite yet.\n\nHappy modding!"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T14:35:08Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!
