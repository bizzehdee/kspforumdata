Though I stopped playing KSP I couldn\u0027t help but think \u0022Dayum I wonder what KSP\u0027s like now\u0022 Since I left before the 1.1 update, but I had deleted my KSP copy, or so I thought. I was browsing my hard drive for any form of entertainment when I stumbled upon a hidden copy of KSP on it with mods on it and I was like \u0022Ey it\u0027s dat game dat I used to play, Lets play it again\u0022. And it really felt good to be playing KSP again and so I decided to go back on the forums and get addicted to it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone recognizes me HI!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-20T12:48:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello Greenhornet553 and welcome back to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
