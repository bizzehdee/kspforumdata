You can also change it up by adding mods from the ever growing modding community to change gameplay and add more parts. It is an awesome game and Squad keeps updating and adding new content.

Ok so here is what happened for me. I bought the game and played for about 20 hours (total) I absolutely loved it. I enjoyed making crafts flying to planets, etc. etc. However I didn\u0027t know what to do after that. I got together with a group of friends and we started having \u0022Space races\u0022 who could get to a planet first. It was a ton of fun. Pretty much I would say just have fun with it. Explore planets, do the career mode. Get a good feel for the game. Then go and get mods, mods add quite a bit more to the game like Krag\u0027s planet factory which adds other planets. find and test new crafts. Build a huge ship and then blow it up with your own home made missiles \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E it\u0027s a ton of fun. If you really get bored try out the KMP or DMP mods (Kerbal Multiplayer , Dark multiplayer) then you\u0027ll be playing with friends and other people. I moved from a simple 20 hours to having a grand total of 274 hours (and counting) and I\u0027m still not bored yet. It\u0027s hard to run out of things to do. It\u0027s worth every penny if you\u0027re going to buy it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork_werewolf","CreatedById":90749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T07:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of value for money nothing beats KSP on my steam list. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing by a long shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have 289 games on there.
