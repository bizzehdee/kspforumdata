But nothing was really lost. I\u0027m an Aussie and mostly play KSP when i\u0027m putting off assigments for uni and various other reasons. One of my favorite sports in KSP is not to try and get to places already done that, although i absolutely fail at docking I will get there soon. At this time my favorite sport within KSP is Kerbal Punting. I will elaborate on that soon in the challenge thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers to you all and its good to be back!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
