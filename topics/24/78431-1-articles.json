I\u0060m new to forum but playing KSP since 0.22. I\u0060m actually realy bad at this game. but i love it. I fell in love with KSP, when i saw someone circularizing his orbit in a let\u0060s play video. Maybe it\u0060s not a big deal, but the fact that the increasing tangential velocity raises the orbit in the opposite side was very astounding to me. I haven\u0060t thoght about that before. At that moment i\u0060ve realized how awesome this game is. Before this moment i\u0060ve always thought that KSP is about financial management of a space program. Of course later i\u0060ve discovered some other awesome things about this game...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060m joining this forum, to learn more about ksp and maybe to help someone, if i can. So few other things about me. I\u0060m playing this game on a low speed laptop, so i have many problems. But i don\u0060t mind. I would love to play KSP stock, but there is many things that must be implemented in stock game. So i\u0060m using mods such as alarm clock, KER, FAR, DRE, Procedural parts, fairings, and navigation utilities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish you all best of luck in missions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T22:07:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello nuralisoy. You said you are bad at the game? So is everybody else. The trick is to keep playing so that you crash closer and closer to your destination, until you make it there. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Anyway, welcome to the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
