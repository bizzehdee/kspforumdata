Um... my name is Guber, and I\u0027m a Kerbalnaut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell...it all started innocently enough. I saw a friend post some pictures of KSP, and thought it might be fun to try. What could it hurt, it seemed harmless enough? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I got the demo. It was fun, a few laughs with friends, that\u0027s all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got into stable orbits and felt like the king of the world. I started doing more and more....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI told myself it was no big deal... it\u0027s just a little experimenting. I can stop anytime I want, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I couldn\u0027t stop. Next thing I knew I\u0027d bought the full version. I was sitting up half the night talking to little green men and adjusting fuel loads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMrs. Guber would call to find out where I was and who I was with...she said she doesnt\u0027 know who Jeb is.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there were Mun landings, satellites...good grief! Where does it stop? I realized I\u0027d stepped off the deep end. I didn\u0027t know where to turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I talked to someone. He was building space stations, but seemed like he could handle it. He told me about this place. He told me that the first step is to admit that you\u0027ve got a problem. So I came here, hoping for help... you see, I REALLY NEED to build that lander so I can get back....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, thanks... that\u0027s my story.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-05T05:31:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2013 05:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Guber K.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fyzzi","CreatedById":31686,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T07:13:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E very unique introduction \u003Cem\u003E*applauds*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy this, I bid you a welcome, sir...
