I have been a fan of space travel ever since I watched my first episode of Star Trek on TV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace flight simulators have always held a certain amount of interest for me. I sort of started my career ages ago with MS Space Flight Simulator. Then I was trying out Orbiter on and off in various versions, but always found it kinda challenging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen KSP came along.
