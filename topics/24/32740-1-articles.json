I\u0027ve hit a few \u0022burnout\u0022 cycles before so I try to cut back on it a little now, but I still came back to it even after the first \u0022burnout,\u0022 which in my opinion is the mark of a truly great game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you run into any snags while you\u0027re learning how the game works, my own recommendation for your first stop would be the Drawing Board (link in my sig), which has a number of useful tutorials and other tools. Feel free to ask questions in the How To section as well, as many of the people who frequently post there are quite knowledgeable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Initar","CreatedById":69353,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T22:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELearn the parts, experiment, and have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T22:34:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
