Landed on MUN,MINMUS,EVE,and DUNA without any autopilot or mods. Watch alot of Scott Manley and pretty much just learned off of that. Ive watched alot of other ppl\u0027s vids but it seems education level is more suited to Scott and even he sometimes speaks jibberish. I dont do any calculations \u0022or know how to nor even want to learn how to.\u0022 I have trouble downloading some mods like Chatter box and texture replacer. Chatter box works but i dont have any audio carrying over into the game. No beeps no com loops no breathing, but my HUD for the chatter box is on my screen and i can scroll through all the windows and options. If there is a mute button or something please someone save my life! Love KWRockets and Impossible Inovations (Only fun in sandbox. I would consider it cheating In career mode but thats just me.) It is very helpful if your in a rush and just like reading what the corny captions say everytime. I really would like help getting my texture mod working. Everyone on Youtube has AWESOME cloud mods that i WANT!. I could do without all the lights on the planet. I need all the RAM i can get and i mainly try to avoid the night side at all times 1X. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the first game on the computer I have played religiously since I was 14....... At 15 Call of Duty came out and......yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGREEN HATS! DO NOT DOWNLOAD MECHJEB UNTIL U HAVE ACTUALLY DONE SOMETHING ON YOUR OWN! dont be a loser...learn how to play the game right. You wont find a better satisfaction than actually getting somewhere with YOUR MANUVERS and YOUR PLANNING and YOUR LANDING!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell am i just new or do i totally suck? Ive played almost 200hr.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T18:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello AcHayes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Welcome to the forum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while I also play stock-only and prefer to do things myself, please don\u0027t be quite so mean to the Mechjeb users, okay?

I was only saying that Beginners in the game shouldn\u0027t try and use that right off the bat. it takes away the whole point of the game at first. BUT when you actually play the game right you have a better appreciation for the fact you can do it without autopilot. it does take some skill to reach planets cold vanilla. with the NASA pack now it became a little bit easier and a little bit harder all at the same time. all i was saying is that if you start off first using Mechjeb it takes away apart of the game in the beginning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thrill of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven for newbies it would take some skill even navigating the mechjeb menu. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a great mod dont get me wrong i use it often(especially interstellar) i just felt it more gratifying doing the latter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AcHayes","CreatedById":111137,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-17T04:33:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMade it to Duna and Ike last night as well! with one ship HA! and went pack to K and my straps on the parachute broke about 50 meters above the pad! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis game tho..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-17T05:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can expect a lot of that sort of thing in your KSP future. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
