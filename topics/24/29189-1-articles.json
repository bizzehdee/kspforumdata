I used to mod The Sims 2 back in the day a bit (wasn\u0027t very good at it but it was fun) Ive been reading the mod guides on here and playing around with the .cfg files. Ive got blender and I have had a play with it (never used it before). I just want to say, Im not a gamer, I seldom play them, but Kerbal is the best game Ive played like ever \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IcarusBen","CreatedById":173604,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T02:32:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet me be the first to welcome you to the KSP forums!
