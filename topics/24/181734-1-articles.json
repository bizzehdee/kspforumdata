Only recently did I decide to study Astrophysics, and devote my entire life to this passion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI suppose then that KSP is (or perhaps isn\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) a good gateway into the vastness of the cosmos which I intend to explore to the fullest extent. Something about exploring that which is unknown is rather mystical, and pulling it off in the end extremely satisfying.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut I think it would be inappropriate to say I know much about anything related. Certainly more than the average person, but definitely not as much as I likely should. Or want to.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s where KSP comes in once again. Only now have I begun to swim around in the community a little more, and I think it would lend me well to know some of you better. Nowhere else do I know where to find a more relatable and like-minded group of individuals. And I believe such a move would further not only my levels of social interaction (which as of the moment remain at an all time low.) but also fuel my knowledge and understanding of space and all things related, for it is important in any field for one to learn not only from lectures and textbooks, but also from socialization and debate with colleagues.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThus, I do hope that we share many good times to come in the future. I would hold no objections whatsoever to knowing you on a personal level, though if there were some more readily accessible hub, such as a Discord server, that would be highly appreciated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll the best to you fine folks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-27T04:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to our forum. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-27T04:54:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/194955-moostic/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022194955\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/194955-moostic/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Moostic\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 I\u0027m glad you have found your path in life and I hope you go on to make great discoveries (and also post about them in the science and spaceflight subforum \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RubyPetersen","CreatedById":195176,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-01T11:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am so happy that I am here in the best place where there are good people around which are like an inspiration to others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
