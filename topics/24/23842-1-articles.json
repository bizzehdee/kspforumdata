Wrote down the details so I\u0027d remember to pick up a copy, and then lost my note and couldn\u0027t remember what it was called until a couple of days ago when some of my colleagues mentioned it being on steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver a decade ago I finished a Masters degree in Astrophyics, and on finding out there were basically no jobs (besides teaching) for astrophysicists in the UK, I gave up all my dreams and idea\u0027s about space and settled down in to a long, (mostly) boring career in IT. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday morning I managed (purely by accident) to get a small satellite into a tight orbit. Sure, I forgot to put any RCS fuel onboard and the thing is spinning so fast it should, realistically, fly apart. But its up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday afternoon I managed to achieve a solid solar orbit with a one man space station. It\u0027s a slightly different orbit to the one originally planned (can\u0027t get the hang of orbital insertion burns) but I\u0027m sure that the view of the sun is far more impressive than the one originally planned around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyhoo\u0027s, thanks for giving me the chance to do the kind of stuff I really wanted to do in my life, rather than the stuff I had to do to make a living. The game\u0027s fantastic, and I\u0027m looking forward to getting good enough to be able to start exploring the solar system, instead of just peppering it with debris from various failed experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-25T10:22:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2013 10:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DrNoesis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T15:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"musicpenguin","CreatedById":57938,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T15:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome newcomer!
