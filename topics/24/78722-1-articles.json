After getting what should be all the equations you will ever need to do anything on here, then perhaps make primers for how exactly to compute and apply said collection of knowledge. I have seen some pages on the wiki with some of the math, but not all of it and not really and I got the feeling (though I may just be dumb XD) that it was written with the assumption that the reader already possessed some underlying knowledge on the subject. And hey, we get people un-afraid of math and start solving what amounts to engineering problems in a fun game maybe we\u0027ll get more engineers and scientists \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.
