I\u0027d never actually heard of it before, and it looked \u0022mildly\u0022 interesting (wish I could come up with a suggestion for how to get across just how fun it really is). I saw the video where they are trying to put the squid thing in the jar and it keeps escaping, which to date, I\u0027m not sure what this had to do with the game other than it involving the Kerboids. Perhaps something that will later be introduced?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously almost didn\u0027t buy it. This isn\u0027t really a slam on Squad\u0027s advertising methods, because really, I\u0027m no marketing major myself, but from what I saw up front, it looked like little more than a \u0022build a simple ship and make it fly\u0022 game. (Most of this is because the vast majority of the top videos on YouTube with a search of \u0022Kerbal Gameplay\u0022 are just people blowing up ships repeatedly as if it\u0027s difficult to ever get one to fly - as if this is the only goal of the game.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all of this said, I did finally think it was interesting enough and bought a copy. I immediately went into the \u0022Career Mode\u0022 (I realize they plan on changing it significantly in the future). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was Saturday. It\u0027s now Wednesday. I have already logged more than 60 hours in this thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the past 17 years, Final Fantasy VII has had a firm place as \u0022my favorite game ever made\u0022 due to the sense of accomplishment I had when I\u0027d finally gotten to Sephiroth. No game since then has had that feeling for me, or given me an ongoing desire to accomplish it. Until now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first time I managed a fly-by and orbit of the Mun when returning the guy home (keep in mind, I\u0027m in Career Mode here. I\u0027d even recommend that the \u0022Sandbox Mode\u0022 should only show those items that you\u0027ve already unlocked in Career mode, but I\u0027m masochistic like that) - the first time I got him home I had a bit of that feeling. This automatically lead me to a new goal... Actually landing the thing on the Mun. It took me awhile (and a lot of lost lives) to get the hang of using the navball to land the craft, and to quit trying to look at the craft itself when landing, so by the time I managed to land that first one, again, that sense of accomplishment! I even exclaimed to my wife, \u0022I DID IT! I LANDED ON THE MUN!\u0022 To which she replied, \u0022Have you taken the dogs out today?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then I realized I had to also get THIS guy home... But alas, my lander had run out of electricity, and I hadn\u0027t unlocked solar panels or batteries yet... The poor shmuck spun out of control on his way home and is presumably orbiting the sun for eternity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started tooling around with stuff. Attaching it to the ship and right-clicking it, and that\u0027s when it occurred to me that Science was to be the main goal! Not just \u0022let\u0027s do some cool stuff.\u0022 So then I realized that I actually needed the guy to start doing EVA\u0027s and writing reports, and documenting everything he did in order to get the \u0022Science\u0022 up. Back to the beginning! First, let\u0027s see if he can do anything without even taking off? Yep! Science points... Then in orbit? More! Back to the flyby! Then a Mun orbit! And now... NOW I have enough points to get those friggin batteries and solar panels!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first time Jeremiah came back from the Mun, I hailed him as a hero. Then had to take the garbage out, but he was a hero none-the-less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I saw that there was a \u0022docking\u0022 station. \u0022They didn\u0027t...\u0022 said I. Sure enough, some videos confirmed... I can make... Space... Stations... My brain exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently working on getting my science on so I can get enough pieces and parts to build some remote landers to see what the other planets are like. I haven\u0027t left Kerbal\u0027s orbit yet, except on accident. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, big, big, big-time fan here. It wouldn\u0027t take much to give this game the tiniest of pushes (finishing the career mode, adding a few features such as showing which \u0022accomplishments\u0022 still have points to be collected, etc.) to push this game over the edge to take the new seat as my all-time favorite game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd my Steam library has over 200 games in it. I also have three large boxes of physical games in the garage. (I\u0027m also a wanna-be garage game developer, and have been at it for years.) So I think that title should carry some weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to be fair, even if Squad (not saying they should, obviously) were to slap a label of \u0022done\u0022 on the game as it is, and call it a day, even at the state it\u0027s in now, it\u0027s an incredible game. And I haven\u0027t even started playing with the mods yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Javin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leveller","CreatedById":70427,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T21:31:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThats just awesome man.

Removes that ridiculous \u0022wobble\u0022 from the joints. These things are made of steel and shouldn\u0027t look like they\u0027re made of rubber. It also REDUCES the strength of the joints to compensate for the wobble removal. In other words, stacked objects are far more stable, but also more \u0022brittle\u0022. It reduces the pointless torque significantly while also making torque more dangerous. Thus, if something is going to start spinning, or take a blow from the side, it\u0027ll smash apart more realistically, but I don\u0027t need a bajillion struts to get a standard rocket off the ground.

The maps should be for planning trips and maneuvers.
