I\u0027ve been lurking on the forums for a while, and finally decided to jump in and introduce myself. I think this community is one of the best online communities I\u0027ve seen. Everyone is so supportive and enthusiastic about this awesome game.

It\u0027s a very supportive community. Haven\u0027t posted much myself because all my questions so far have been answered already by someone answering someone else\u0027s questions. Don\u0027t have experience enough either to be helpful yet. Guess the community is the way it is because we are mostly nerds and geeks haha, and have no desire to act cool or make fun of anyone. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave not been playing KSP too long myself. Started late 0.25 after a friend mentioned the game. Have restarted career mode many times so far due to new mods installed and a number of trial and errors not being to my satisfaction. Haven\u0027t been further than Minmus yet and haven\u0027t finished any planned orbital or planetary stations yet. There is always some new mod or something else coming up that I just have to try. Oh well, it\u0027s a lot of fun anyway and I think I will spend many hours trying to get Jebediah where he hasn\u0027t been before.
