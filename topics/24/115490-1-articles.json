I\u0027m just starting and haven\u0027t even attempted my first orbit of Kerbin yet. While trying to rack up some science credits I accepted the Mk16 Chute Test Contract. That should be an easy 4 credits I thought. Ha!\n\nAll I need do is release the Mk16 between 18,000m and 24,000m while going 300m/s to 1200m/s. After designing a rocket that would get me to just over 2.4km so that I hit the lower threshold of 300m/s velocity in the prescribed altitude window, I repeatedly lost the chute to \u0022aero forces and/or heat\u0022. Mind you the test was successful; I would\u0027ve gotten my 4 science credits, but I\u0027d have lost my astronaut and I was almost resigned to do just that. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nSo the lesson I learned is to make a beeline to the KSP Forums and/or Wiki when one finds oneself stumped. In short order I learned that the minimum pressure and altitude for release of the Mk16 is tweakable from the VAB. Ten minutes later I had Jebediah safely back on Kerbin with 4 science credits in the bank!! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThis is a great \u0022sandbox\u0022 game that is both challenging and fun. What a great community!
