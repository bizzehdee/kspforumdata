I\u0027ve tried a couple of times at making a space station but I\u0027m quite bad at rendezvous and docking, I could maybe just keep on trying to improve my docking skills or go to another planet but I\u0027m not interested in the latter at the moment. I\u0027d appreciate some cool ideas or tips on what to do and where to go from this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-14T22:44:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could orbit the sun and get some science. If you do want to go to other planets, all you need to land on Eve is a heat shield and a parachute. (Getting back is a whole other story.) If you can land on and return from Mun, Duna isn\u0027t much harder.

Ike because it\u0027s familiar, yet different than Mun or Minmus, and not too far away. Gilly for something new- it\u0027s like everything is in slow motion there. Also, jumping is a viable way to launch for orbit on Gilly, lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-16T16:57:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd Ike has nice views of Duna.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-17T15:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsteroid base building is a challenge and is what I am doing now in a stock game. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RevanX_LSR","CreatedById":216972,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-20T06:01:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou could try an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E if you have the tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
