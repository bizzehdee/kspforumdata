I\\\u0027ve been in the search of something exactly like KSP for a few years now, I\\\u0027ve tried orbiter and it wasn\\\u0027t my style. I wanted to build my own space ships and more casual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy adventures in KSP have been a bit funny, and some times more serious. I\\\u0027ve nearly landed on the mun within my first week (using others ships). I have mastered basic things like orbiting how high I want, getting to the Mun quickly, and orbital linkup. However, I cannot land within 100 miles of where I want yet, but I\\\u0027ve been picking up the skills needed recently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of things to do is KSP might seem small with only Kerbal, the Mun, and Kerbol. Yet that has not stoped my from challenging myself with the things in the challenges section, or launching a 3 stage rocket with all the SRB\\\u0027s I can find, and a few RCS trying to get into orbit. The developers have done a great job on this game, and I have officially donated my first $10 and will try to donate $5 every payday until I feel like I\\\u0027ve paid them back for the days of fun. KSP is has limitless potential, and I like where it is going, keep up the good work and keep talking with the community to add new features and KSP will soar into the unknown.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cthulufaic","CreatedById":6660,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-25T04:00:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGutenTag and welcome to the forums!
