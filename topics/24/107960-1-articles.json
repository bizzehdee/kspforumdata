The current version is the real, not-beta-any-more-honest, 1.0.2 (unless there\u0027s been another bug-fix patch since I last looked). It\u0027s a lot more realistic and free to update.\n\nLike you, I tried the demo (mostly to see if it would even run on this old machine) and was so awestruck at that I had no hesitation in reaching for my wallet. It was a good investment and only destroyed the rest the of my life for a little over a year \\*grin\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T04:14:47Z","Content":"Hi and welcome. This game runs really good on video cards a couple years old, so long as your CPU has some juice to it for the physics calculations."},{"CreatedByName":"Nerik","CreatedById":143287,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:22:19Z","Content":"Thanks everyone,\n\nI think the CPU \u0026 graphics cards are ok, I\u0027m just a bit short of RAM."}]}
