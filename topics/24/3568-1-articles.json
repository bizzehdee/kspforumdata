So I found this game back in August when I mis-clicked a YouTube link. Best. Mistake. EVAR! Watched a couple of videos on it and was hooked. So a little about me. I am a senior in high school. I am going to the local community college when I get out of school and taking the first responder courses and getting a job at the local fire station. Eventually I would like to work for NASA, assuming they still exist in the next 20 years. Anyway KSP is pretty amazing and I definitely want to be an active part of it\\\u0027s community.
