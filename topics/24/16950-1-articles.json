After attempting to join a different time and never getting an activation email, I tried again and now I\u0027m here! Yay! Now, for what you\u0027re probably here for, the (kind of?) funny story! So, I finally built a rocket actually capable of achieving orbit. Once I got into a very lopsided orbit, I decided to attempt to land on the Mun. So I did a prograde burn? and got in a trajectory for the Mun. I sped up time and entered the Mun\u0027s gravitation field. That\u0027s when I realized I had used up my remaining fuel getting into the field. I sped up time again and escaped the Mun\u0027s gravitation field, expecting to be back in an orbit around Kerbin. I then found out that the Mun\u0027s gravity had slingshot me into an orbit around the Sun. Fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T08:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, from Sci-Fi and all that, i expected slingshots to be a navigational masterpiece of space-flight. Turns out, as long as you dont care where you end up, they are rather easy to achieve. On my first full-version flight, i was so lucky, that a mun-approach would have slingshoted me directly into Minmus\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 grav-field, had i opted on it. As Minmus orbit is slightly off-plane, that was quite a lucky shot. I still find it hard to reach, even when i am actually trying. ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T15:25:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
