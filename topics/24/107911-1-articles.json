General orbital mechanics, planetary transfers and similar space stuff are unaffected, except for recommendations about which parts/engines to use.\n\nYou may find my earlier (0.90) guides still useful, although don\u0027t expect the ships themselves to fly as advertised.\n\nInstalltion, configuration, settings and the game interface itself - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111114-A-Complete-Beginner-s-Guide-Induction-To-Construction](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111114-A-Complete-Beginner-s-Guide-Induction-To-Construction)\n\nVehicle (mainly rocket) design from rover to spacestations - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79658-Exploring-The-System-A-design-tutorial-campaign-0-90-Final](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79658-Exploring-The-System-A-design-tutorial-campaign-0-90-Final)"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:02:54Z","Content":"Guides are being written / filmed as we speak - best place to check is in the Tutorials section, at this point - just make sure you are searching for Kerbal Space Program 1.0, as many of the guides currently present were written for previous versions. As you probably guessed the release version is different enough, even from beta, that the many of the old guides are out of date.\n\nAlso, welcome! Check my sig for a guide and link to my channel, where I\u0027m making a consolidated set of guides for all the major concepts."},{"CreatedByName":"Ival70","CreatedById":75336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T01:27:57Z","Content":"And of course, don\u0027t forget to check out Scott Manley.
