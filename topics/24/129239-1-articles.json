When I left I was playing .90 and the hype and negativity surrounding 1.0 was painful and I felt it best to just give it a rest and come back with a fresh outlook, and here I am! Unfortunately my Linux box had a major melt down, and I\u0027m playing on win7 for now but I have to say it\u0027s not too bad. except... I can\u0027t play! The new aero system in 1.0.5 is very very different to the souposhere! Even the FAR and deadly reentry mods I used to use were\u00A0more forgiving.\u00A0So I\u0027m pretty much a Noob\u00A0again. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood to be back though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-04T15:57:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2016 03:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KerBlam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEnglish are dificult\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T14:59:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello KerBlam, and welcome back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe all had to learn how to launch and ascend all over again with the new aero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlam","CreatedById":134309,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T15:59:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
