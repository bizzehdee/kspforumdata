I\u0027m from The Netherlands, but I currently reside in Michigan, where I\u0027m doing an internship before finishing my studies. \n\nI have been playing KSP for about a year now, and I\u0027ve visited this forum on-and-off until I decided it was time to get a bit more active! I\u0027ve been flying around to some of the more obvious targets (Eve, Duna, Jool) in Science Mode, but a while ago it seemed like a good idea to start a Career Mode game to spice things up. I\u0027m now totally caught up in the process of building a viable SSTO for a visit to Laythe, which so far has had mixed results.\n\nThat\u0027s about it, I\u0027ll see you around on the forum I guess!"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T15:31:46Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums Woksaus!

I spend quite a bit of time building SSTO planes too (though maybe not so much recently). Hope to see some of your designs at some point.\n\nWelcome to the forums! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T18:20:48Z","Content":"You\u0027re from the Netherlands? \n\nAny chance you could tell me about TU Delft?\n\nAlso, welcome aboard!"},{"CreatedByName":"Woksaus","CreatedById":148764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T01:20:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You\u0027re from the Netherlands? \n\u003E Any chance you could tell me about TU Delft?\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, welcome aboard!\n\nYeah, I am. I\u0027m from Utrecht University though. Why, what would you like to know?\nThanks for the warm welcome! As soon as I\u0027ll have some viable design, I\u0027ll make sure to post it. I\u0027ve been messing around with other people\u0027s designs, but I\u0027d rather come up with my own interplanetary-worthy creation."}]}
