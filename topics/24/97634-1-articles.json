Only you can answer that, as this game\u0027s learning curve can be a little intimidating at first. When I started I did the same thing and played vanilla \u0022science\u0022 mode, which at the time was the only option other than sandbox. I landed on the Mun and Minmus multiple times, and set up a refueling station in orbit above Kerbin. Once I could dock comfortably I expanded the visual graphics of the game and slowly messed with a few other mods. I still prefer playing vanilla with just some basic visual enhancers and maybe 1-2 others to expand information mostly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you enjoy KSP, and fly safe!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T15:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t meddled with mods very much. I did use a few for a while that just added functionality, such as Engineer and RealChutes and Kethane for a while, but I always ended up returning to stock. I think that the best time to try fiddling with mods is when you are able enough to land on both moons of Kerbin AND can perform at least a few dockings. That is the majority of the skill sets in KSP, and mods tend to change the procedures, so it\u0027s good to have the stock frame of reference first, in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iFlyAllTheTime","CreatedById":111190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T17:43:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recently gifted a copy to a friend and a cousin who have never heard of this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted them to learn the underlying game before making things too easy or difficult for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey have seen my heavily modded copy and often enquire why they don\u0027t have a certain feature or a part, to which I carefully reply and convince them to stay away from a lot of mods at least for the first few hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I did suggest 2 addons to them both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb and docking port alignment indicator.
