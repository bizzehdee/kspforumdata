What a ton of fun this game is. After many, many, MANY spectacular explosions and near death experiences for my poor Kerbals, I have successfully put a satellite and the first part of my space station in orbit. Next will be either a Mun orbit attempt for another satellite or a docking maneuver to expand my space station, both of which I have yet to succeed at. Nonetheless I will persevere and continue to throw Kerbals into the far reaches of space or hurtling to the ground until I succeed!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UNSC","CreatedById":31653,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T23:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello and welcome.
