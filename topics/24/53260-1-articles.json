I\u0027m not sure how that compares to most regular craft, but it\u0027s the highest part count I\u0027ve done in a single craft and you might have framerate issues at launch. Also, once the purple light goes green and you can launch, the craft sort of \u0022bounces\u0022 around a bit. As such, it is prone to blowing up before launch. I\u0027d just recommend relaunching and hoping it doesn\u0027t blow up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s meant to be a space station and refuelling platform. It is computer controlled with 2 hitch-hiker storage units for kerbal passengers. It carries 2 orange tanks worth of fuel, as well as some RCS fuel. Both times I\u0027ve launched it I\u0027ve had to refuel it once it got into orbit, as I\u0027ve had to use that fuel getting it up there. It has 2 free docking ports, 2 extendable solar panels and various other bits and pieces\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s difficult to fly but it can get into orbit.

Mechjeb is an autopilot with tons of usefull information the stock game doesn\u0027t give you, such as deltaV. DeltaV can be translated directly to distance.
