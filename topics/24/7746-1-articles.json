I\\\u0027ve mainly just been messing about building bigger and bigger rockets but I thought i\\\u0027d try and make myself something fun tonight. I\\\u0027ve done a few orbits of Kerbin itself but I was going for a much bigger orbit to try and match that of the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got caught in the Mun\\\u0027s gravity (for the second time ever!) and it threw my orbit off. I then spent the rest of my fuel trying to get caught again and failed. Another launch of my ship and i\\\u0027m back in orbit around Kerbin heading for the Mun. I get caught again but i\\\u0027ve got the speed too high and I lose it. However the second time i\\\u0027m better prepared and I managed to get into orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dropped my PE and AP down and managed to aim myself into the Mun. However I ran out of fuel doing this final burn to hit the surface and I waited far too long before engaging my RCS thrusters to stop the ship from crashing. I panicked last minute and wasn\\\u0027t even able to parachute down to the surface (assuming you can). I\\\u0027ll never forget Merwise, Judrick and Hersy Kerman as my first astronauts to (accidently in all fairness) get to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWasn\\\u0027t the most optimised Mun insertion but i\\\u0027ve had such a blast doing it (and got some awesome screen shots) so I just wanna say a huge thank you to the developers and keep up the good work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFridgecake\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt0570","CreatedById":13414,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-07T01:43:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, welcome!

Got some serious tinkering to do with my rocket and need some practise orbiting and the like.
