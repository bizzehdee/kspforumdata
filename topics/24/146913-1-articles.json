Just recently bought the game \u00A0on x1and am enjoying it immensely! Although, does anyone know a good remedy for brain strain? Already had several failed missions due to angle of accent or fuel levels but this morning I managed to actually get into orbit while still having enough fuel for the decent! Lol, still have 1 Kerbalnaut stuck up there due to that miscalculation, I\u0027ve noticed a bit of salt on this forum from some console users which, so far, I\u0027ve seen no justification for, though I\u0027d admit this game isn\u0027t for everyone. Personally, I look forward to spending many fun filled hours elevating my Kerbal to greatness....or possibly martyrdom\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-01T11:12:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums.
