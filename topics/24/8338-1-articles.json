At that time, version 8 (I think) was the most recent one, and even getting into a basic orbit was an adventure. I actually tried really hard to get into one (using the KSP orbit calculator), but I failed miserably. So I was left with just shooting rockets straight up, which wasn\\\u0027t that satisfying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually I got bored and uninstalled KSP. However, a few days ago I stumbled upon this website again, and voil\u00C3\u00A0, KSP has an orbit map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHAT IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get into an almost circular orbit (time compression ftw!) after 1 1/2 hours with just stock parts.

Most of the launch phase is a somewhat carefully orchestrated series of maneuvers, but not so much as serious as a lunar landing. During the Lunar landing, that is probably the most fine controlled thing you can do. You have not just vertical velocity to kill, but lateral and the body is drifting away from you as you land, so you are constantly killing velocity. You also have mountains to worry about, so you have to pick a landing site off of your normal trajectory about 30% of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember being frustrated when I had trouble with orbits and Mun flights, but you will eventually get it.
