Longtime lurker of the forums here and /r/kerbalspaceprogram as well. KSP was an impulse buy back before there was a solid career, and I felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of parts. However back in September of this year I started playing again and within hours was absolutely hooked. I completed the tutorials, have watched countless hours of videos and tutorials by the incredible Scott Manley (and many of you as well), and now 2 months and 216 hours of gameplay later I have completed another landmark by finally joining the forums (albeit rather late).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little bit about my game history thus far. Haven\u0027t made it to any object outside of Kerbin\u0027s influence (although I have made it to both the Mun and Minmus numerous times), and working on completing a Kerbin Space Station, have successfully built a working SSTO, and will then work on a permanent Kerbin polar settlement, followed by settlements on the Mun and Minmus, and unmanned and manned missions to Duna and Ike. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you so much to everyone on the forums! I\u0027ve enjoyed learning about both your triumphs and tribulations, and am so happy to see such a welcoming and supportive internet community. Thank you to SQUAD for making an incredible game (and for listening and responding to the ever-growing Kommunity). I look forward to learning far more and taking the journey with you all (on the forums this time) to .90 and beyond! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the Best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ival70","CreatedById":75336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T19:25:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! I\u0027m curious about this space station, you should make a showcase for it, or at least add a picture. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
