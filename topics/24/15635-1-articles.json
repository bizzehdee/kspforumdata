I took a look at the website and thought \\\u0027What the hell, it looks like it\\\u0027s made for kids\\\u0027. I downloaded it anyway and took it for a spin. What an awesome game! Whoever knew orbital mechanics could be so much fun? At first I couldn\\\u0027t work out how you traveled from A to B, although building rockets was fun nonetheless, but after three days and a little bit of reading on Wikipedia about orbital mechanics I can now land on Mun and Minmus and return. The last Minmus trip used Mun\\\u0027s gravity for a slingshot. Now in the process on planning a Mun and Minmis landing and return on the one journey. One thing that strikes me is how graceful orbital mechanics is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope in the future we get docking and construction in space. I\\\u0027d love to be able to push fuel and parts into orbit and construct a station or pickup fuel for a mission. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-30T03:30:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard, i am sure you can find not so childish equations here that will blow your mind, the community just likes to have some fun, can you blame them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, good to have another player with us!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-30T03:56:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
