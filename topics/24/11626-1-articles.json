Well what I do is I get into an orbit around the Mun first, then lower it to about 5 or 10km.\n\nAfter that I burn sideways to stop the craft from moving and I hover gently to the ground, watch out for the ground though as the altimeter is set for the average height, not the actual height from the ground, if you turn on terrain scattering in the settings screen you will see Mun rocks, giving you a good visual clue to your height.\n\nTry to land as slowly as possible, many pilots use RCS to help them but it\\\u0027s possible with just the main engine, you can actually practice hovering and landing on Kerbin before you go, so you can get the hang of it.\n\nIf you are drifting sideways when you land you are more likely to break your rocket, so making sure you are coming straight down is a must, you can use ASAS to help you and press capslock for fine control, you\\\u0027ll still be able to tilt a tiny bit and you can use that tilt to stop your sideways movement.\n\nAs with most things, landing takes practice and all your attention, but after a while you\\\u0027ll find it becomes easy.\n\nYou say you want to do some modelling as well? I can\\\u0027t help much with that but you can find a lot of help [here, on the addon development board](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?board=39.0), you\\\u0027ll need the free edition of [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/unity/download/) if you want to use the new .MU files and the normal maps and emissive maps the new format supports, you\\\u0027ll still need a 3D modelling program though, and many mod makers use [Blender](http://www.blender.org/).\n\nI hope this helps you Sean137, good luck and have fun ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T16:05:21Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nHappy Launching!\n\nArrr!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager"},{"CreatedByName":"StellarUniverse","CreatedById":6629,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T07:42:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sup KSP Community\n\u003E \n\u003E I am a bit of a new person to this game.
