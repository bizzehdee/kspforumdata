Well what I do is I get into an orbit around the Mun first, then lower it to about 5 or 10km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that I burn sideways to stop the craft from moving and I hover gently to the ground, watch out for the ground though as the altimeter is set for the average height, not the actual height from the ground, if you turn on terrain scattering in the settings screen you will see Mun rocks, giving you a good visual clue to your height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to land as slowly as possible, many pilots use RCS to help them but it\\\u0027s possible with just the main engine, you can actually practice hovering and landing on Kerbin before you go, so you can get the hang of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are drifting sideways when you land you are more likely to break your rocket, so making sure you are coming straight down is a must, you can use ASAS to help you and press capslock for fine control, you\\\u0027ll still be able to tilt a tiny bit and you can use that tilt to stop your sideways movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with most things, landing takes practice and all your attention, but after a while you\\\u0027ll find it becomes easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou say you want to do some modelling as well?
