I have been following the forums and decided that I would like to ask for some expertise advice, and possibly get to know a few of you cool cats... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started Career Mode 3 days ago, and am having some-what trouble collecting science. I know that for most of you experienced players you guys find it easy. Would you care to point me in the right direction?

I burn most of it landing, even though I try to be as efficient as possible. My current goal at the moment is to land on Mun, perfectly, and return home. I happened to have a Kerbal trapped there, and he is getting mighty lonely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I thank you guys in advance, and hope that you can provide a solution, or point me in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you guys around\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKato\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T00:03:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there Kato and welcome to the forums! There\u0027s no right or wrong way to build a rocket, but getting to Mun will require you to think about the design. The less weight you carry for your final stages the less fuel it will take to get it into orbit, so keep those upper stages small. The key to success is finding the right balance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
