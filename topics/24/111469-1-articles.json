I got this game after seeing it being played on twitch and so far I am really liking it. It seems to be lacking in real life space related stuff though, which I really enjoy. I saw a twitch user ChrisPBacon82 playing with a lot of realistic styled spacecraft and worlds and I am looking for help into getting into something similar. I really enjoy real-life spacecraft, especially old stuff from the space race, both Russian and American, manned and unmanned. I am looking where to start from experienced KSP players here on the forums. Thanks guys and hoping to be playing with cool real-style stuff soon!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T11:28:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 11:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RoadBlock**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T11:49:55Z","Content":"Hello RoadBlock. Welcome to the forums!\n\nI don\u0027t know who ChrisPBacon82 is, but there are a lot of people in the community who build all sorts of things. That includes a crowd that is heavily into replicating real-life craft and missions in KSP. These forums are very extensive. Have a look around, and you should find the sort of thing you are looking for.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T14:16:40Z","Content":"Hi RoadBlock,\n\nCheck out some of the excellent Mods available that add more realism to KSP, such as requiring Life Support, and a realistically sized solar system, or an even more realistic aerodynamic simulation. I don\u0027t know what the names of these mods are off the top of my head (I don\u0027t use them personally) but I\u0027m sure any number of forum experts will be able to list them in this thread.\n\nWelcome!"}]}
