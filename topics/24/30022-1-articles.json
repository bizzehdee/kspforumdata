Came across the demo of the game on steam last week and instantly bought the game. Needless to say, the better portion of this past week (luckily had week off from work) was spent hurling Kerbals through space. I absolutely love this game and love to see how deep of a community is surrounding this game. From the hard core science guys to the casual flyers, strictly stock to the modders. It\u0027s a deep community which will offer a great variety of ways to play for future Kerbalites. Thank you to anyone who posts or have posted videos and tutorials on youtube. Without you I would not have gotten far in this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already started playing with mods such as, KW Rockets, Remotetech, ISA MapSat and Mechjeb amongst many others. This past week I\u0027ve managed to set up a sat relay network around Kerbin and Mun and have made 3 Mun landings. This week I hope to get started on my KISS (Kerbal International Space Station) and build a Minmus rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to interacting with this community and sharing my Kerbal experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarkotiks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T19:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad to see that you\u0027ve been enjoying yourself so far, and that you\u0027ve found the community to be agreeable. I won\u0027t say it\u0027s a perfect place, but it\u0027s one of the better ones I\u0027ve belonged to, and I\u0027ve been on Internet forums of some sort or another for many years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the subject of tutorials, I\u0027ve tried to gather quite a few quality ones in a single place as part of a project I call the Drawing Board (link in my sig), meant to be a reference library for users of all skill levels. Feel free to check it out, or to ask questions on the How To forums, if you ever get stuck somewhere or just want to hone your skills that much more. We also have a Mission Reports section where you can spin an entertaining yarn or two out of your most memorable missions if you\u0027re the storytelling kind. Above all, just take a look around, and don\u0027t be afraid to just jump into a conversation if the topic interests you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T06:13:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
