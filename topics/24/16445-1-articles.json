(Do Online Now Guys). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI downloaded it but left it sitting on my PC for weeks, I was growing bored of FPS games, fed up of being annihilated on Civ V and done with racing round funny shaped tracks in fast cars. I saw this sitting there and decided to give it a go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only reaction was WOW! What a great game! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am loving the demo and I am almost sure I should buy the real thing. So far I have built a few craft, got an orbit and once managed to slingshot myself past the moon and into deep space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am still struggling with all the new things (maths etc), even just using the demo I am almost overwhelmed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I want for the moment is to just prove to myself that this game is worth buying by learning how to get a rocket up there with enough fuel to learn how to handle orbits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am glad to be \u0022on board\u0022 with this \u0022program\u0022 (too many puns?), I am loving every minute but still have so much to learn! Hopefully once I finish reading the how to section I should be OK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh also, almost forgot, Nice to meet all of you guys too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ALILOOOONG","CreatedById":33396,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T16:20:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi welcome to the forums If you want an avatar like mine just ask me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E only yours would be bigger than mine\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nine_iron","CreatedById":37971,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T16:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EForgot to mention...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my spare time I play golf, hence the forum name.
