I am TheBlueJay. As my name suggests I like blue jays and (as it does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E suggest) pandas. I have recently downloaded KSP off of Steam and am enjoying it quite well! I\u0027ve only reached a stable orbit once and spend hours in the design stage, but I suppose that\u0027s normal within the first few..weeks? Not sure how long that lasts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. I have been lurking here for quite a while, viewing threads on interesting craft and downloading mods (which I have done a lot in the past while). Just now have I decided to create an account and say hi!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose I should introduce myself more. I enjoy learning the Czech language (Pozdravy is greetings in that language, as you can view in the title of this post) and not-so-much Spanish (but I still put Saludos in the title!). I find anything space related very interesting (since I was a child, in fact) and, thus so far, have enjoyed KSP. My favorite KSP related topics are VTOL craft and small, cute landers and rovers. (Is that last part weird? I can\u0027t tell!) I have, for a long time, wanted to become a NASA worker or something of the like, maybe an aircraft engineer. Recently, an aspiration for YouTubing began. I can\u0027t explain it, but you know, it\u0027s one of those spontaneous things. I would go off and give you the story of my life, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve already read enough!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I hope to have a good time here at the KSP forums and...yeah! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E:)\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(By the way, I think you can already tell, but I like parentheses.
