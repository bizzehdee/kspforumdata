I didn\u0027t realize I had to EVA to get to the spaceplane in the Station One scenario, undocked it, and had to EVA to try and get it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 which I botched pretty seriously\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I then realized there was another spaceplane nearby in orbit, and grabbed that one (yes, I noticed it was damaged). I tried to dock (remember, this is like the 4th thing I\u0027ve done in KSP)\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Think \u0022Gravity\u0022 and you\u0027ll have a picture of what the station ended up looking like \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. I then messed with the EVA scenario to try and grok that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, enough practice, I started a science campaign as I wanted to start small and try and learn in little steps with the lowest hardware. That went well, and I even managed a couple Mun landings within an evening. OK, a late night (wife wondered why I came to bed past 1am). I have not filled in the whole tech tree, but a heck of a lot of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayed that campaign a few nights, landing on a couple worlds outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI, then on the weekend I started a \u0022regular\u0022 career. I\u0027m now full up to some of the 300 science stuff in the tech tree, and I\u0027m not really gunning for science since I know I can do it fast with a few landings on the Mun or Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERocket construction:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun, but the lack of things I\u0027d expect to use being useful is not great. I want to put nosecones on. I don\u0027t want lander parts hanging out in the breeze. I\u0027ve seen a fair number of rockets, I\u0027ve been to a few launches (even got to see a Kerbal like use of range control at White Sands once\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 BOOM!). I have expectations of what they look like. I\u0027m fine with spacecraft being entirely different, but that\u0027s what construction in space is for. (i.e.: the atmosphere should matter) The lack of dv information in VAB design is a problem (yes, I know there is a mod, this is all about stock).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBasic flying:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe UI is pretty good. It\u0027s easy to understand, and uncluttered. Kudos. The interiors don\u0027t really have useful view information or I might actually use them to fly (in other games like flight sims, or serious play in Silent Hunter 4, I consider exterior views \u0022cheating\u0022 and don\u0027t do it, so more useful interiors might be of use, but the exteriors are pretty, so I can live with that (though not for flying aircraft)). For a noob, docking was the hardest thing to get decent at, but the learning curve was not steep, the first couple attempts were\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 not efficient. I\u0027m still not great, but I don\u0027t doubt I can dock, it\u0027s just a matter of having enough RCS. Orbital maneuvers are easily possible by trial and error using maneuver nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience/Tech Tree:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot a fan of the current arrangement. It\u0027s kind of bizarre. I understand the desire to \u0022get better stuff,\u0022 but it needs to make sense to have enough suspension of disbelief that you can get into it, and not consider it a grind. There are threads here about it, and I sought one out for my first post on this forum specifically. Campaigns are important. I think the devs should entertain novel ideas to make them interesting, and also just really look at the idea of \u0022science\u0022 vs \u0022flight engineering data\u0022 for incrementing technology. I\u0027d like some major tech nodes, and more incremental stuff in between (same parts being upgraded to slightly better models, slap a new texture on them (even if it\u0027s just a part number label on the texture map). The amount you get need to be smaller for some things (sample returns), and larger for others (probe data transmitted). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeh. Some are fine, others are just annoying. After dutifully trying to test an engine at 1600-8300m and 160-something m/s several times (all 4 things required had checks) but failing (think I needed to stage the rocket right then or something) I simply abandoned all the test contracts that could not be done trivially. I don\u0027t mind being asked to build novel test-beds, but some are just too dumb to want to bother with. I realize 0.25 might address some of these last two sets of comments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStuff I wish there were good reasons to do:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Build even small space stations. I built one in each of my 2 career games \u0022because.\u0022 There is no reason to make them, I just thought it would be cool. More requirements for missions (life support, etc) might make assembly in orbit critical (which would be a good thing for gameplay, IMHO). I think there would need to be a new docking port that makes 2 bodies rigid, perhaps (a full-diameter ring, perhaps it can even be a decoupler that can be mated in space?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Apollo-style landers. This is basically asking for cargo stages. An empty tube with a decoupler on the bottom, inside, for the cargo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Longer term science. Place probes in orbit to study a world, sensors left on the surface to transmit science. Medical studies of astronauts on orbit. Probes that skim atmospheres, etc, etc. These provide reasons to build new craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Make Munar or other world bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther thoughts:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am aware the devs don\u0027t like \u0022random,\u0022 but there is a good place for some random elements in a game that encourages replay. The player might get a contract to test a new engine. Say the Skipper-X. The X in this case is for \u0022experimental.\u0022 The reward might be adding that engine to the parts list for him. The testing might be a series of tests in real flights (over Kerbin, near the Mun, etc), but this X engine might have a random chance of failure in a few ways. Doesn\u0027t work, has a small explosion that results in fuel leaks, gibing doesn\u0027t work as planned (locks at an angle), etc. Chance of failure need not even be super high, and taking the test contract is still a choice. So far some of the most fun I\u0027ve had has been rescuing a few ships in odd orbits I managed to strand earlier in the week (and one last night when I accidentally staged part of my lander unintentionally). Failures are fun. Even random ones. Heck, random rocks clobbering something would not bother me (it can be a toggle in difficulty settings \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReentry. There needs to be a penalty. The only guy I have killed so far was from my recent rescue. I used a grabber to get a vessel that I built before docking rings, and elected to send it home for reentry. I then braked a little, and figured I\u0027d reenter one, then the other. The first hit the atmosphere, and I found I could not switch to the 2d one until the first was all the way recovered, and apparently the chute doesn\u0027t open without me hitting space bar and it crashed. Aside from the fact it should not have happened, I could work around and make sure they are spaced farther apart for reentry next time. Still, guys were stuck in orbit for game years in my 1st campaign (did loads of time compression messing with distant probes and left poor Jeb in munar orbit for many years while I sent a couple ships to the other side of the solar system). I\u0027d have tried a rescue earlier if I needed to\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 because he was gonna die, for example.
