Are you remembering to turn the throttle up? If you turn an engine on but the throttle is set to zero, nothing with will happen. Also, is there a way for fuel to get from the tanks to the engines? They have to have a connection of one sort or another. Posting a screenshot of your rocket would help. If you have version .17 (the current one), have you tried flying the example ships? Do they work for you?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radion","CreatedById":3273,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T21:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe do hope you enjoy your stay, and if you have any questions or concerns, please don\u0027t hesitate to ask the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eservants\u003C/span\u003E Moderator Staff, myself included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the spacebar is the correct button to launch and to change stages during flight. Be sure that, as Vanamonde said, your fuel can reach the engines, the throttle is up, and that your engines are in the active stage. If they aren\u0027t, they won\u0027t ignite.
