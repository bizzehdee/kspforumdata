I downloaded 0.13.3, played it, had tonnes of fun, showed it to my brother, and he downloaded 0.18.3, the same day.\n\nI have landed on one body around every planet. I have only landed on Laythe, of Jool\u0027s moons. And as far as I can remember, I\u0027ve never actually had a successful landing on Dres (apart from a single extended landing leg... dunno quite how that survived the lithobraking). But I have put debris on a lump of rock at every planet. So i\u0027ve got that going for me, which is nice.\n\nI... may have broken KSP at the moment. I can\u0027t figure out how to fix, or re-cause the problem, but I\u0027ve stopped seeing the science reports. That\u0027s fun. I\u0027m probably going to reinstall fresh.\n\nI cannot remember not liking space. But at my heart, I\u0027m a writer. I hope to be an author, someday. Without a secondary job. But that\u0027s a dream. As yet I can only have fun with words for myself to enjoy.\n\nOnwards to the Mun, and beyond!"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T13:19:40Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums at last.
