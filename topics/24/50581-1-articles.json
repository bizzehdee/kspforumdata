Blood shot eyes with bags under them, some weird facial growth, must be hair, looks like hair but its crusted with several weeks worth of food and drool. My once white T shirt now stained with god knows what, probably beer..... better be beer. I\u0027m wearing a shoe... on the wrong foot, and I have no idea where my pants are. There\u0027s an odd odor in the house, and everything is in disarray. Pink slip sitting on the kitchen table, I must have worked somewhere... that\u0027s right, aerospace. I was an aerospace tech. Operative word being WAS. It has become readily apparent that I have a condition, most commonly referred to as Kerbosis.
