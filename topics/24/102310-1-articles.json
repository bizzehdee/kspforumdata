As far as help and tips go, the [Gameplay Questions and Tutorials section](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/15-Gameplay-Questions-and-Tutorials) has a wealth of valuable information for both the new player and the seasoned pro. If you want to know how to do some common task you will probably find a tutorial for it in the Tutorials subsection. If you have a specific question about how to accomplish a task, post a thread in the Gameplay Questions section that I linked to.\n\nThere are also numerous useful resources in [the Wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page).\n\nThat should help get you started.\n\nSee you around and happy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T12:32:19Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!
