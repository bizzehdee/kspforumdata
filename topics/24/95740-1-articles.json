I had heard about KSP several times in the past, and each time I had forgotten about it before I could get around to downloading the demo. Well, that all changed about a week and a half ago when I finally remembered what had so often been forgotten. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow. This is too much fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am now the proud owner of the full version of KSP, and have been playing in career mode. I\u0027ve not yet made it beyond an orbit around Kerbin -- still doing bits of science, testing parts, etc. -- but it has been a blast so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there was the rescue mission that I mis-clicked and accepted. Poor Enson Kerman decided to take a joyride in a rocket, and is now floating in orbit with no way home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm... okay, Mission Control has been upgraded to level 2, but we don\u0027t have enough funds to upgrade the tracking station. Guess no maneuver nodes for this rescue. Just enough science to get the 909 engine and the BACC booster... can we make this work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParachute, two command pods, a T400 tank, and a 909 engine for the rescue module. Decoupler, two T400s, and a T30 engine for the mid stage. Decoupler and a BACC booster for the initial lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff! Man, this thing flies like a cow, really hard to turn at 10km, but we did manage to get into a nice circular orbit with plenty of fuel to spare in the rescue module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took a little while, but we finally approximated poor Enson\u0027s slightly eccentric, slightly inclined orbit, crept up on him, and T\u002B2 days later, Enson was able to EVA to the spare command pod we brought along and hitch a ride home... all without being able to place maneuver nodes. Jeb, our pilot extraordinaire, was doing a lot of math on his fingers that day. Splashed down in the ocean just east of KSC with about 2 units of electricity and almost zero fuel left. We were descending fast, even with the chute open at 500m, so Jeb burned up almost all the fuel in the last 100m or so, going for a soft landing to recover the engine and fuel tank. A slight bounce on splashdown, but everyone\u0027s home safe and sound. Way to go, Jeb!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo many future plans, and so little time to actually spend playing, but it\u0027s going to be one heck of a ride!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T00:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PnDB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PnDB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo many future plans, and so little time to actually spend playing, but it\u0027s going to be one heck of a ride!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe story of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHello, there.
