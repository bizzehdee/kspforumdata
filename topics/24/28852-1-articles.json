I have been having great fun from the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a background as a private pilot (I learned to pilot a plane at 15yo even before I got my drivers liscences) and I have a bachelor in Physics Eng. (with a useless master but I disgress). Just wanted to point this out because I feel like this game was made for me, with all the true liberty to let your imagination run wild (I have been playing way to much Dwarf fortress anyways) and just a touch of reality so there can be PHYSICS and SCIENCE! in there plus the added flight simulator part (well almost... the aerodynamics dont seem right at times) its just SO great I cant seem to express it properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf my english is poor I apologise, my native language is french and I am from Qu\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9bec. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust so this is not a complete empty post, here a is picture of my first SSTO plane just reaching orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BqQ5jMH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BqQ5jMH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one of Jeb enjoying the new seat from 0.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/owI9Jv7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022owI9Jv7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJonhyBee\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-24T19:06:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2013 07:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by JonhyBee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERemoved potilical comment... sorry about that.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Promii","CreatedById":36781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T18:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello from British Columbia and welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a better aerodynamics model, try the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/ferram-aerospace-research/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFerram Aerospace Research\u003C/a\u003E mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-24T19:25:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2013 07:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Promii\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERemoved response to political comment\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JonhyBee","CreatedById":67114,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T19:03:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks! does this mod make it a lot harder or just different?

Nose cones actually work with the mod, but in overall it can be a lot harder. Rockets from a single central structure, however, will go through the air like an arrow.
