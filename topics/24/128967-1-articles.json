I\u0027ve recently started a new Career over at KSC and thanks to the helpful guides and a great deal of practice, I\u0027ve just managed to rescue a stranded astronaut and safely return him to Kerbin! I\u0027m sure in time, orbital intercepts and rescues will become second nature, but for now it\u0027s the highlight of my KSP career!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee you around \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenhornet553","CreatedById":154907,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T13:34:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello and welcome to the Forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never been able to maintain a career mode save since I find it hard to do contracts, but I\u0027m trying to do so now. Might I suggest trying to read mission reports to learn more stuff?
