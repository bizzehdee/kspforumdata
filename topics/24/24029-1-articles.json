I was using Orbiter sim for a long time, and I still find it superior to KSP in some ways (the orbital physics is lot more accurate in it, and the feel of flying in the Solar system is great), but the easy and entertaining approach of KSP is something I really appreciate. The overall presentation is very nice, the controls are reasonably complex, yet easy to grasp. What I probably like most is the map screen, which I find very intuitive, with its orbit displays and maneuver planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe choice of smaller solar system and a planet with the same gravity as Earth, but a lot smaller, with shorter orbits is I think excellent, as it greatly reduces the time requirements for missions, while keeping the principles realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding the ships, crashing them again and again and learning from mistakes, then finally reaching my next milestone (be it reaching orbit, or reaching the Mun) is really rewarding and entertaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I love the open nature of the game and the community around it. The addons already present are stunning and varied, and given the game is still early in the development, I think it is a real simulation jewel shaping up here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"musicpenguin","CreatedById":57938,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T14:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome newcomer!
