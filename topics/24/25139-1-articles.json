Just to say hi and mention how I got here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was perusing the SimCity Reddit last month because of the issues surrounding the SimCity 2013 launch (long term SC fan) when one comment caught my eye that mentioned for some reason that a game called Kerbal Space Program has a very active Reddit. Kerbal Space Program! I had never heard of it before but the name instantly peaked my interest, being a long time space enthusiast and professional astronomer. I quickly found kurtjmac\u0027s hilarious Youtube series, downloaded the demo the same evening and a few days later I bought the full version. I was happy to support this independent effort that is even produced in the same country where I (temporarily) live. I was also pleased to see that I could install a native Linux version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this to say that word of mouth and the active KSP community has enabled me to find you guys and converted me into one happy customer!
