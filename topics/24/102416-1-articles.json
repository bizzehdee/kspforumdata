It\u0027s a great tool for just this sort of thing, and should make installing addons quite easy. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager-v1-6-5-6-Mar-2015\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the link to the thread\u003C/a\u003E. Download the CKAN client and run it, point it at your KSP folder, and then find B9 Aerospace in the list of mods and click to install it. Should be pretty simple. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s nice about CKAN is it won\u0027t overwrite any game files, so you don\u0027t have to worry about making a backup. Even so, KSP addons don\u0027t generally require making backups anyway, since even mods that replace stock elements do so via new files.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"amigo240480","CreatedById":139835,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T02:58:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk i will give this a try shortly and respond in due course thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T03:11:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee Chapter 2 of \u0027Induction To Construction\u0027 :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
