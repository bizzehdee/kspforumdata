I\u0027ve been following the reddit for quite some time, and obviously watching countless KSP videos on the YouTube for tutorials on the best ways for orbiting different planets, etc. I\u0027ve managed to get some pretty interesting builds, and get to almost every planet except for the elusive Eeloo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I cannot do is dock. I\u0027ve watched so many videos on how to dock but for the life of me, I will can get an intersect within 2 to 3 km, but once there, I\u0027ll come in at approximately 150 m/s (Target) attempt to burn retrograde to kill velocity but I constantly overshoot by 20 km even with RCS. I guess the main thing I\u0027m confused with is which nodes I need to burn towards during docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hate using Alt\u002BF12 and would love to build a refueling or science station around Kerbin or the Mun, but many hours have been wasted attempting this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 0.90 coming out, the limitations on the weight of ships makes things even more difficult! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, I\u0027m looking forward to becoming a regular follower in the forums. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T08:00:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to start braking before you get that close. Once you\u0027re within 10kms or so, you can shed much of your speed and still not lose the intercept, or at least you can get it back with additional steering as you close. By the time you\u0027re 2kms away, you should be going 30m/s or less, and no more than 5m/s once you\u0027re close enough to see details on the target ship. Docking itself needs to bring the ports together at 0.1m/s or less, or the ships will just bounce off of each other. Meanwhile, don\u0027t feel bad. Docking is one of the hardest aspects of this game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
