I purchased it on Steam when 0.25 was released, and I can\u0027t stop playing it! I don\u0027t know what is more challenging/fun, building craft or flying them? During the download and install, I was looking at the Steam KSP forum. One of the newbie articles mentioned \u0022... get ready for a steep learning curve\u0022. So before I even tried to play, I found Scott Manley\u0027s \u0022Career Mode Tutorial\u0022 on You Tube. I watched the first episode, then played the game some. Then watched the second episode, and played some more... Well, after 12 episodes (4 hours worth), I am hooked! Thank you Squad for this most fascinating and remarkable piece of entertaining, educational, and compulsive computer code that I have found. Now I\u0027m starting to add modifications to the base game for enhanced immersion and further enjoyment that is beyond expectations! So much to do, learn, and experience... It\u0027s almost sinful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1302.photobucket.com/albums/ag127/Antman68/GreetingsfromMinmus_zps68b0a893.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GreetingsfromMinmus_zps68b0a893.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and now I have to call the Betty Ford Clinic from an overdose of Project Gateway and Project Odyssey, courtesy of Bob Fitch!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T04:31:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!

I do not use ATM in the heavy mod folder anymore since I converted the graphics to DDS. I can squeeze more more mods in, and it loads much faster. Needless to say, I guess I\u0027m hooked! This is better than Lego, Lincoln Logs, and Erector Set combined.
