I\u0027ve been playing KSP right after 1.0 release and stacked about 280 hours of playtime. I was lurking around the community for a long time but decided to join in and have a good time away from throwing rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m living in South Korea as a college student majoring in graphics design.

One thing I\u0027m proud of is that I managed to successfully complete the base on Duna. Never been to Jool and Eeloo, so It\u0027d be great to learn from you guys in the near future!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T11:57:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello Greythorn032 and welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a former lurker, you already know how valuable this place can be.\u00A0 Sounds like you\u0027re well on your way.\u00A0 Glad to have you aboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greythorn032","CreatedById":163268,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T17:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222552716\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138623\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462103851\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022131400\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starhawk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1 May 2016 at 8:57 PM, Starhawk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello Greythorn032 and welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a former lurker, you already know how valuable this place can be.\u00A0 Sounds like you\u0027re well on your way.\u00A0 Glad to have you aboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
