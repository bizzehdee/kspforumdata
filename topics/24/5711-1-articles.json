I found the game through Yogscast \u0027Sips\u0027 and have loved it since. I have attached the very first (real) ship i made(built in two stages, the Chute-Pod-Decoupler-Fuel-LiquidEng first and flown to get used to the controls, then the rest). Following will be a list of Milestones in roughly the correct order, brace for a wall of text!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff! - Make a craft and start launch. - Achieved: Within ten minutes. The SucLun Mk I had its base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKilometer and rising. - Take a craft to the 1km mark. - Achieved: Same launch, fuel ran out shortly afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerboom! \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Mission End: Catastrophic failure \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Achieved: Same err... launch? Activated parachute at 700 meter just to find out I had another stage (decoupler is not parachute). I finally got it up at 400m. Didn\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t fully open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETouchdown! \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Successfully land after achieving flight(10000m\u002B) \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Achieved: Within an hour. With the completed SucLun Mk 1 I never reached orbit, I did, however earn 100km and a safe landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this thing work? \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Activate SAS when you have a SAS or ASAS module on the craft. \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Achieved: The next day while experimenting with loads of SFB\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s, I figured I\\\u0027d need a minimum of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see my house form here! \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Successfully get into an orbit with both Apogee and perigee higher than 100km. \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Achieved: Day two, using the better SucLun MK2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKouston, we have a problem! \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Have no functional boosters in a 100km/100km (Peri/ Apo) or higher orbit. \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Achieved: Same launch, time to add more fuel to the SucLun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big cheese \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Achieve orbit around the Mun for 1 in game hour or more. - Achieved: Day three had been experimenting with different launch procedures for a few hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat, no cheese? \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Successfully land on the Mun \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Achieved: Same launch as above, when i tried to return home the trajectory kinda went the wrong way. (I aimed for Kerbin, promise!). Only the pod with chute survived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERound-trip \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Achieve Mun orbit and land safely on Kerbin \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Achieved: Same craft as above with better knowledge on how trajectories and orbits work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou sure this is the right way? \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Your craft has entered and orbit around the sun. \u00E2\u20AC\u201CAchieved: Missed the Mun by a few hundred kilometers... Same craft as above, but upgraded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImported goods \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Install an add-on(non-stock part(s) \u00E2\u20AC\u201C Achieved: Still day three. I made my first modification. The Liquid-Low-Consumption engine (LLC Engine) is lighter than the stock LFEs and has higher trust to fuel ratio. On the other hand it is prone to overheating and you need a good lot of \u00E2\u20AC\u02DCem to launch anything bigger than the standard pod with fuel and engine combo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats what I have done so far. I watched about 2 hours of KSP videos before I downloaded, so i knew somewhat how (and if) things works. I have made some addons, which are, as of this post:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe OneWay Corp. Package -My own add-on pack with (fairly) balanced stats. Includes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELLC Engine - Liquid Low Consumption engine - Pros: More trust per fuel -Cons: Generally weaker, mostly only useful in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA heavily modified version of the LV-T30 Liquid Fuel Engine with decreased fuel consumption and slighty less weight, but at the cost of a heavy loss in power and weaker construction. Also prone to overheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarchute - Supposed to be a weaker version of the normal parachute. -Pros: Can open and slow in space(Broken) Cons: generally worse than usual parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA starchute uses solar and cosmic wind to (hopefully) slow down you ship out in space, even from ludicrous speeds. Compared to a normal parachute it has less slowdown, but atleast it works out-of-atmosphere. Please note that this is a prototype and will not refunded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrototype splosion booster - The radioactive warning icon on the side should give you a warning. Very kerbal SFB - Pros: Insane trust Cons: Insane trust, REALLY prone to overheating, its a SFB; you can\\\u0027t turn it off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA solid fuel booster with heavily reinforced construction to support the 30 second long beating from setting of small nuclear blasts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeavy Command Pod - Heavier, more solid Cpod - Pros: Can take some serious beating 2-3times normal -Cons: Heavy 3-4 times normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u0027Really pimped up commando pod\u0027. One may wonder if adding a bunch of solid metal plates and duct-taping them to plate makes it better or worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you survived that, you should know my entire KSP history. I find OneWay Corp. a quite kerbal name, so I decided to use it.
