Part two is a modified space station core with the multi docking port replaced with a large RCS tank and an array of RCS thrusters at each end of it. My next task will be to design my own station, but for now I wanted to concentrate on designing the rocket to get them into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d originally set the tanks to asparagus stage but it turned out to be unnecessary and it\u0027s an exceptionally stable rocket.
