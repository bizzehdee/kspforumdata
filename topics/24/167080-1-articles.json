It was so hilarious, that I wanted to try to put a vessel in orbit as well . Ignoring the fact that the game wasn\u0027t in sale, I bought it on Steam and tried it. Around 100 playing hours later,\u00A0here I am.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had though times, before I finally decided to watch some actually\u00A0explaining videos and to play the tutorial, but I\u0027m starting to get it. So far, I did a Mun and Minmus encounter, and saved around 8 lost kerbonauts. The next step would be landing on the Mun, then probably Minmus. Kerbol system seems vast enough and managing a Space agency is an interesting thing to do. I abandoned the idea of playing without reloading saves, as my first two attempts at career mode were crushing bankrupcies. Another great defeat was my attempts to bring a place at 18,900 meters using only the two most basic jet engines. I decided to finally give up before this mission made me completely fed up of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also put away my general policy of not using mods to keep the game as the developpers made it. It makes sense to me in a game in which you are against some sort of AI, but in KSP, you are \u0022against\u0022 the universe. Having tools like the alarm clock or the engineers (for delta v) doesn\u0027t seem to me as cheating, since you could easily (indeed, you should) have this in a real space agency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love this game and wonder where it was in my life before. I even play a bit too much of it, with so much more to discover. I come from a world of Grand strategy games (Paradox Interactive, EUIV, Stellaris, CK2), and I\u0027m impressed by what a small team of indie developpers managed to create. The community here seems very active and I learned that an expansion is in work. I plan to buy it and I hope this game continues for a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might post sometimes, but I have absolutely no prior knowledge in rocket science and am rather poor at maths. I am generally interested in history, philosophy and law, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-31T17:04:54Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2017 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Arizal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-01T03:44:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have little knowledge of real rocket science and I\u0027m too lazy to use the math I do know, but with practice, I was still able to figure out how to get places. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u00221\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to our forum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-01T04:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the space place!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile there are some folk here who are frighteningly good at maths and have the lots of rocket science knowledge, I think you\u0027ll find that a lot of us came to this game (or way of life) without much of either and sometime into the addiction suddenly realised they\u0027d accidentally gained a lot of both.\u00A0 KSP has definitely sharpened my maths and taught me so much about the concepts behind space travel, the only drawback to that is\u00A0you might find yourself shouting at sci-fi movies for not performing realistic maneuvers or for showing rockets launching straight up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI definitely endorse the use of mods. They add a lot to the game, some like the ones you mention really help (Kerbal Alarm clock is a must for running simultaneous missions and sure you could manually calc your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E but that\u0027s not what I call fun).
