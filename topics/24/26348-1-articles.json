I have had this game for a week now and completed the all the training that came with the game. I have just started to add Mods to the game and I am a little confused about where all these files go. I understand the Parts and Ship files, but where do these files label \u0022Plugin, Plugin Data, Source go? These folders where in the game after installation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"speedio","CreatedById":17052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T02:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Plugins and Plugindata folders that come with some mods to into the root folder of ksp.
