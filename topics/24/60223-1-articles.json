Electricity is generated by most engines (not all), and is collected by solar panels, and high in the tech tree, the RTG generator produces a low but constant flow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t worked out a rule of thumb for chutes required, because it depends on the size of the ship, but also how slowly you want to end up going after the chutes open. A large ship, for example, will be more fragile and will need a lower touchdown speed to avoid damage. Nothing should ever hit the ground at more than 10m/s, though. The overlapping of the chutes is merely an aspect of the part animation, and does not affect their performance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem you had is probably due to the speed at which the chutes opened. The faster the ship is moving, the harder the shock that\u0027s applied when they open, and you were likely going faster on your re-entry flight than you had been in testing, even though the chutes opened at the same altitude in both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of us try to avoid unnecessary casualties, but don\u0027t feel overly guilty about it, as Jeb frequently reappears after fatal accidents. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork13","CreatedById":100102,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T04:18:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello fellow Kerbnoughts and Kerbministrators!
