I currently use mechjeb info panels for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Bug fix: (yes, it is a bug) where SOI crossing during time warp messes up the calculations. I know that people use the Alarm mod as a WA but it would be nice if this was fixed in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope to see these improvements.
