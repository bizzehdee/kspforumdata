I learned, I laughed, I installed many mods. However, only now did I suddenly decide to create a forum account. The tale, for those interested while awaiting the completion of a Jool-transfer, is thus:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile setting up my third KSP install (the first is my normal one, the second is multiplayer, and the\u00A0third is my realism-intensive one) I experienced a bug with SVT and Sigma Dimensions having a sibling-squabble, which resulted in the complete and total blackout of Kerbin\u0027s surface. As charmingly space-like as this was, I desired being able to actually see how far my plane was from the ground. (Disclaimer: no accidents actually occurred, as Valentina was the pilot. (Further disclaimer: Jeb is now released from his padded room and back on flight duty, fully appreciative of the dangers of using sounding rockets to open wine bottles. No similar accidents shall occur in future. JEB. I\u0027M WARNING YOU.)) Going to the SVT forum thread, I was about to create an account and enunciate my lamentations in the hopes that the esteemed developer would have a clever solution, but then I noticed another forum-denizen had not only experienced the same tarry Kerbin, but had invented a work-around. Testing it, it worked, and I had no need to make my own post. However, I was filled with a presumably Kraken-sent sense of gratitude for this unknown random individual, and promptly decided to create an account to thank this person, as well as others who have been massively helpful.
