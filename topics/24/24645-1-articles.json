This should be a extender for docking small crafts to the station. I have launched the ship using mechjeb but have the problem that after staging the main tanks the ship doesn\u0027t react to steering except rcs. But the autopilot then burns all rcs for the maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen other ships without that problem so what is it at my ship?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone please look and give me advices? Maybe some tipps for a better ship, too?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/eeex6cs6jkpeqpk/Cobra%20Bucht%20MK2.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/eeex6cs6jkpeqpk/Cobra%20Bucht%20MK2.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
