I\u0027d probably still be stuck trying to establish a circular orbit without you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in the middle of establishing a Mun and Minimus base as a way to iron out any issues before I send off to Duna. I\u0027ve already sent over a ScanSat. Recently, I started playing around with Karbonite and also decided to do a probe landing on the Mun with 0 maneuver node use (just to see if I could). The game really starts to get a lot easier after you understand the navball. I always hated it before, but realize now that was only because I didn\u0027t understand it properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen building a couple parts for the orbital part of my Minimus base, I discovered this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q8LhZSf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Q8LhZSf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had no idea you could change the output light on the Illuminator Mk 1 \u0026amp; 2, and I haven\u0027t seen it mentioned on the forums. Figured I would pass it on, just in case it wasn\u0027t common knowledge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a journal system built into this forum? Some forums have an area where you can build your own thread. I\u0027d be kind of like the \u0022What did you do today in KSP\u0022 thread, but a personal one. Just a place to keep track of my KSP progress (and I dont want to clutter a public area with my shenanigry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAser\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s.
