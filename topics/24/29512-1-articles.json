This is definitely the most challenging game I\u0027ve played. I\u0027ve begun trying to setup some infrastructure on Mun, well Bill K. crash landed and Jeb was sent to rescue him however his vehicle doesn\u0027t have the fuel to break orbit. So I decided to sent them housing till I can get things sorted out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
