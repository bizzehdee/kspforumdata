Around a 45 degree climb is probably most fuel efficient, but jet engines use so little fuel that it doesn\u0027t matter much. If the plane has enough power, I usually climb at 75 degrees or so just to get it done quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When you get to 20,000m, level off and build some speed. You want to pile on as much horizontal velocity as possible while you make a slow ascent to 30,000m. Keep your angle of attack (the angle between where your nose is pointing and the direction in which the plane is actually moving, shown by the prograde marker when in surface mode) and climb rate low; by the time you hit 30,000m, they should both be around 10 or so. A low angle of attack reduces drag and helps your intakes work better. The low angle makes you climb slower, but that\u0027s okay; you need that time to get up to speed. As you go faster, the angle of attack required to maintain a given climb rate reduces, but as you go higher, the thinner air means that the angle of attack required to maintain a given climb rate increases. If you do it right, these two factors will roughly balance each other out and you should gain the necessary speed and altitude in a single smooth climb. However, a plane with some aerodynamic or piloting flaws may need to bounce up and down between 20,000 and 30,000m a couple of times while building speed before the final push.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Somewhere between 20,000m and 35,000m (exactly when depends on both plane and piloting), you\u0027ll start to run short of air. Don\u0027t switch to rockets immediately. If you\u0027ve got multiple engines going, shut some down to concentrate the available oxygen into the ones you keep running. If you\u0027ve already shut down as many as you can, throttle back a bit. You can dramatically increase your jet-only altitude by doing this, and once you get up to serious height the thin atmosphere means that you only need a tiny amount of thrust to accelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Keep this going for as long as your plane and your patience can tolerate. A well-built and -flown plane should be able to get over Mach 4.5 and 30,000m in a single attempt on jets alone. Once you\u0027ve wrung as much speed and altitude out of the jets as possible (you want at least Mach 4 and 30,000m), force the nose up to 45 degrees and light the rockets. If you have both jets and rockets, don\u0027t shut down the jets immediately; the thrust of the rockets will drive a ram-air effect that kicks the jets back into life for a while. Keep the rockets burning until your apoapsis exceeds 70,000m, then shut off and coast until it\u0027s time to circularise. Point prograde and close your intakes while coasting to minimise drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good plane and pilot should be able to get the apoapsis to 70,000m with less than a minute of rocket power. Done properly, it requires very little fuel. But if you try to brute-force it from lower speeds and altitudes, the atmospheric drag is going to drain your oxidiser tanks before you get anywhere near orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re having trouble with design rather than piloting, give \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89092-Kerbodyne-Scattershot-a-simple-and-easy-to-fly-beginner-s-SSTO-spaceplane\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89092-Kerbodyne-Scattershot-a-simple-and-easy-to-fly-beginner-s-SSTO-spaceplane\u003C/a\u003E a try.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jaddbo","CreatedById":117784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T02:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have seen some air-hogging designs, and I do feel like it is cheating with that.

While a large single stage can also reach low orbit, it is more efficient if you two stage them with the payload. Turbojet engines can also be used although you don\u0027t have to use them as a aircraft. Examples below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will do Mun orbit and return if flown carefully. At staging, you should be doing close to 2,400 m/sec at 38,000 meters, the flameout point of the turbojet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CjSDej9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CjSDej9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlameout;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r7U7URC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r7U7URC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe turbojet booster is recoverable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L32yzpB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022L32yzpB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll rocket SSTO for a satellite;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fzsw9pX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Fzsw9pX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xzPmcjz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xzPmcjz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore practicable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qJqIeKY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qJqIeKY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/54oZtAu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002254oZtAu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mp83ZO9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mp83ZO9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T17:44:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...Wings are never useless unless you don\u0027t plan on bringing the craft back...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWings are excess mass in vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcess mass is bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTO your Moho ship by all means, then decouple all that useless excess mass before your transfer.
