I\u0027m Box and I have been playing for a month or two now but I still would consider myself to be new to all of this but I love this game. I like how KSP has a steep learning curve, for me that is much more interesting than just running around shooting a things and stuffs. Have read in some threads that this game can be addicting and infectious, for which I have found to be true. I have found that I have woken up wondering how to build that space station. Not sure if that is a good thing... But I think it is. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Funny thing is that my kid likes this game as well. She\u0027ll come into my office and look at me and say \u0022Papa rocket ship?\u0022 (she\u0027s two) and loves to stage the rockets. She doesn\u0027t always get the timing right but laughs at the explosions so it\u0027s cool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny who Hi everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T03:24:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t always get the timing right, either. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
