To counter drift, use the WSAD keys to tilt the craft towards the retro marker as you slow down to under 10m/s descending. When you can get your craft and the retro marker lined up with vertical, you will have the horizontal drift under control. This takes practice to perfect. You will eventually reach the point where you can land using far less fuel then in your first attempts. Ideal landing speed, under 5m/sec with nearly zero drift. The retro is drifting in the photo below but at the descent rate well under 2 meters almost at touchdown, it can be ignored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kvNuDvT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kvNuDvT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this Mun example, descent speed was so slow that the drift could also be ignored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QcmRBwb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QcmRBwb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1k9i7KN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221k9i7KN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractice your first landings on the seas of Minmus.

Several mods provide a lot of information that is not available or only poorly-presented in the stock game. The three best-known information mods are KER (Kerbal Engineer Redux), MJ (MechJeb) and VOID (name too long to type). Amongst other things these will give you detailed figures for vertical and horizontal velocity separately, which is particularly useful for landing. They will also give you altitude above ground, rather than above (arbitrary) \u0027sea level\u0027 which is all the stock altimeter displays. You may prefer TinyGuages or another mod which provides \u0027instruments\u0027 rather than a its own display-window/area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I don\u0027t know of any mods which replace the Mystery Goo and other science objects but there are several which add others. The PB-NUK doesn\u0027t seem too hard to place except on very small probes but I will offer the construction tip most of us adopt sooner or later - Cubic Octagonal Struts. They attach almost anywhere and provide a new attachment node for anything you are having trouble fitting. In the end, if it was easy it wouldn\u0027t be fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Struts again. Fit anything, anywhere. The Hubmax is not used as often as you\u0027d think and the micronode is a pretty rare part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Struts, and especially girders. To be honest, there are mods like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99660-0-25-Adjustable-Landing-Gear-v1-0-1-Nov-9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99660-0-25-Adjustable-Landing-Gear-v1-0-1-Nov-9\u003C/a\u003E but landing better is usually the solution, not just creating indestructible gear. Girders have a very high impact-tolerance and can be added if you wish but are also generally more useful for stability than impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aivoh","CreatedById":129331,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T23:22:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENext Question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI run Windows 7 64 Bit and bought \\ play KSP via steam so how do I know if it is running in 32 or 64 bit mode?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly if it is running in 64 bit, how do I force it to 32 bit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T23:42:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use Steam so I can\u0027t give you a definitive answer but as far as I know the default is 32-bit and you won\u0027t have to do anything. x64 is known as unstable at the moment and (AFAIK) you have to force that if you want to run the risk, rather than the other way around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
