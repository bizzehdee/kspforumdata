KSP on the other hand, allowed me to learn how to bring a rocket to orbit, why i need the rocket to performe a gravity turn and how to get to other planets (reaching Mun for the first time in the v.12 demo was breathtaking, to bad I accidentaly deleted all my pictures -.-). On top off that, I can do that with self build rockets. This game is just awesome.
