So today I finally decided to join the KSP Community!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I actually made my account a week or so back but only today did I remember to make this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was looking up about space things last year because a lesson in school got me interested, and I found the KSP site. At first I was a bit confused, but when I downloaded the demo and played it for the first time I found it to be pretty fun actually. About 2 weeks after that I brought KSP, and I have been hooked ever since, but only recently did I think about joining the community. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would consider myself good at KSP, only last week did I get to the Mun on my second mission in my stock career save! (Not actually sure if that\u0027s good or not, but it works for me)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think that\u0027s all I\u0027m going to say for now, don\u0027t really want to write paragraphs because I really am not in the mood right now. Also if there is anything else you guys want to know feel free to contact me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T19:37:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum, MadMooMan. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boosterspice","CreatedById":58629,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T09:55:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreetings!
