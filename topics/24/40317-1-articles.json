I\u0027m Jose Aparicio and i have uploaded lots of stock cool craft in the spaceport. I even invented a new stock way of propulsion which is collision propelant you can check out my craft on the spaceport simply by searching josea74. My goal is to make as many cool stock craft to provide to the KSP community so they can share the same fun i have with my own craft. I consider myself a stock ksp aircraft designer lol. Hope you guys enjoy my craft and stuff \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalspaceport.com \u0026lt;- go here and search josea74 for many of my creations all 100% Stock. I have over 10 creations on the spaceport so it will take time to paste all the links onto this one post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"willwolvescry","CreatedById":71661,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T19:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome! Hate to break it to you but 10 doesn\u0027t leave that big of an impression on the spaceport. There\u0027s over 190 different stock designs. What might be a good idea though is (I know I\u0027ve been promoting this alot) is to make mod aircraft as well as stock spacecraft. It will expand your focus group and may also make you a better designer. Another way maybe to create designs that will help beginners out like models or bases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"josea74","CreatedById":76852,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T20:51:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI said Over 10 lol but I try to make the best I can so i dont just make a whole bunch of useless ones. Currently i\u0027m working on a HUGE stock carrier it should be able to go fast in water and be aircraft landable and takeoffable. The time it will take me to complete this carrier is a long time. It will have 2 RUNWAYS and I want it to be one of my best creations yet. Also im pretty good with designs if you go and search josea74 on the spaceport you can see all my uploaded craft in 2 pages. On the spaceport I\u0027m the biggest stock exporter from what i know. Also i have seen mods and i can make badass designs with them but however i choose to be mod free to allow those who dont use mods to also download and enjoy my craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T21:58:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
