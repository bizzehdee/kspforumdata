The Kerbal Rocket Group (a name I got from the old Quatermass movies, who is in charge of the British Rocket Group) has not been too successful to date. I\u0027m playing the unmodified game until I get use to it. My biggest achievement to date has been landing (twice!) on Minmus, once on a slope about 60 degrees. I go kaboom when I try the Mun. I\u0027ve also tried Career mode, which is fun, I\u0027m thinking I should switch back to sandbox. I studied physics, math, and astronomy in college and absolutely love the game, grew up in the late \u002760s watching Apollo and Walter Cronkite, and love space (Obviously) Realistic, but not toooo realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be asking a lot of questions. I watch the tutorials people have put on YouTube, but they make it look sooo easy. I hit the space bar at the wrong time, but I\u0027ve learned that F5 is your friend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T21:28:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuartermass and the Pit scared the snot out of me.

(Well, not on slopes so much.) The trick I\u0027ve found is to use CapsLock to give you more \u0022fine\u0022 control over the thrusters, and ONLY LOOK AT THE NAVBALL. Took me forever to quit trying to look at the craft and control it through brute force. The navball gives you everything you need to land (short of the ACTUAL distance to the land - something I wish they\u0027d add). Use your retrograde indicator to stop ALL lateral movement, and then once perfectly centered, control your speed to land at under 6 m/s and you\u0027ll be golden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!

Would you reccomend I get use to the virgin basic game before add-ons and mods? And yes, I discovered the capslock key the other day, lol. And yes Quartermass and the Pit scared the bejeppers out of me too, I was about 8 or 9. I usually don\u0027t/didn\u0027t have nightmares, but I wonder what the heck my parents were thinking when they took me to it (and I\u0027m aging myself horribly)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Riftmann","CreatedById":101626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T03:06:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found a brilliant logo someone designed on Deviant Art for the British Rocket Group in the Quatermass Movies that I am using for my Kerbal Rocket Group(I\u0027ll go back and give him credit if I ever post the flag.) I also have a sandbox going with Dododyne Propulsion (if anyone gets the reference I\u0027ll be impressed.) It\u0027s flag is white with a clipart Dodo on it and it is hilarious if I do say so myself (I\u0027m thinking of changing all their first names to John and just change their last names)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts of the game are frustrating me. I\u0027m trying to learn how to dock, but it is going slow. Docking, I haven\u0027t even tried rendevousing yet. I sent up a small robotic space station, with a small robotic ship already docked to it. I used one of those 6 docking port dohicky mcboobs. I\u0027m terrible. I managed to actually docked at one although i had to sit there for a while before it became one ship again. I tried undocking, and docking to another one, but it won\u0027t seem to stick. I\u0027m perfectly aligegned and I can\u0027t get off of it with RCS (and there is only RCS). I don\u0027t know why it won\u0027t click. I read somewhere to turn off SAS on both ships, but that didn\u0027t help, and someone said you have to place the docking ports correctly or they won\u0027t work. If it\u0027s a construction problem, I\u0027m screwed. i understand docking, the problem is learning the keys, I keep hitting the wrong ones. My 10 year old nephew was watching me, it\u0027s a great way to demonstrate Newtonian physics, it was fun explaining things to him I studied orbital mechanics in college and have a undergrad degree i math, I was planning to get a graduate degree in astronomy, but things happened. So I understand the principles and the math, its panicking and hitting the wrong keys, that is frustrating me, and i get nervous...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
