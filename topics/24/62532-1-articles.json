Once you reach orbit, you\u0027re halfway to anywhere. So they say, it\u0027s not strictly accurate but for some cases you\u0027re actually more than halfway. Anyway, even if you still can\u0027t do it, there\u0027s a whole host of KSP-based Youtubers (such as the renowned \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxzC4EngIsMrPmbm6Nxvb-A\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScott Manley\u003C/a\u003E) and the forums here for help.
