I\u0027ve been playing the game for about a year or so now, getting there, more of a sandbox user at the moment than a career mode person, but that\u0027s just a lack of time more than anything else.\u00A0 I\u0027d been avoiding joining a forum as I didn\u0027t want to feed the addiction that this game has become, but there comes a time when perhaps you just have to embrace it! :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a bit of a spaceplane addiction, and a love of orbital tugs. Just getting into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E at the moment.

A claw at one end, a docking port at the other and they\u0027re really handy for anything that\u0027s construction/docking related. This saves most of my payloads from needing any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E on at all (for the big stuff I might scatter some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters around but no need for monoprop tanks).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve another couple of tug designs that are basically a nerva with fuel tanks and a claw/docking port that is tend to use for refuelling/transfer obit injection (I leave the final correction to the engine on the craft that has just enough fuel for the insertion/circularisation/landing burn). This is really handy because you only worry about the payload, and the launch. I even had a couple of missions where I messed up the launch, was in a sub-orbital trajectory, but had a tug close enough to get in, refuel and save the day. That was fun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally I have a few puller tug designs that I use for my fleets. My Jul mission I\u0027m currently building up is a puller tug with 28 Nervas (at the moment, if I get time I can upgrade it with at least another 24). It\u0027s a modular system where I can just dock an extra thrust module on (each module having 4 nukes). The plan is I\u0027ll be able to move the thrust units between missions. e.g. borrow a couple of units from my\u00A0Jul mission to go and do an asteroid interception, then return them before the launch window opens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scaffolding that these big tugs use are\u00A0all a pain to launch, but once they\u0027re up with a little bit of spaceplane refueling (or refueling them from any spare left in the tanks from the payload\u0027s launch) they really do save me a lot of payload. I end up never really needing an upper stage.\u00A0It\u0027s also an architecture where if I just fancy flying a launch but don\u0027t have a design ready I can just launch another tug into a different obit, or do a spaceplane refuel or whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, back to work!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-10T22:30:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also like working with tugs.
