When I was a kid I always wanted to be an astronaut. While this game is definitely far from that, it has kickstarted my interest in learning about orbital mechanics! This game is so addictive. I love the combination of creativity, learning to work the game, and learning basic rocket design and orbital mechanics. So far I\u0027ve played career and sandbox. I\u0027ve landed probes on Mun and Minmus and have landed and returned Jeb from the Mun. I\u0027ve also been following along the wiki campaign which I find pretty interesting. My next step is to land Jeb on Minmus with the same Mun lander and then maybe make my first space station. The possibilities are endless - I love this game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UPAEfQ7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UPAEfQ7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tHQkT3W.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tHQkT3W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T06:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello rd-md.
