You can get it from either one. If you want the convenience of steam and automatic updates, go for that. If you want it to be cheaper (for a few more hours) or not to rely on steam servers go for the website. Unfortunately the website does get a bit slow and difficult to download from when an update is released.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deflekta","CreatedById":96562,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T17:09:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhen i buy it on steam does the game work even when the steam servers are down ? also if i get it on the website can i transfer it to steam ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T17:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDON\u0027T GET IT ON STEAM!!!! - My biased opinion using steam before, If you buy it on steam you will never get it to work without steam. Once its bought there, you cannot remove it from steam. I would definitely buy it off the website and if wanted add it to games.
