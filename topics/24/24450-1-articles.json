I usually just lurk around. I\u0027ve been trying to post a bug I\u0027ve found in the support section but it doesn\u0027t seem to be letting me, nor is it letting me update my avatar. I\u0027m a huge fan of the game and seem to be picking it up fast!

I\u0027m still at less than 5 posts, this will be my 3rd. After 5 posts, I will say that you should be able to add an avatar. I don\u0027t know what to tell you about posting a bug in the support section. Maybe that will work for you after your 5th post. To prove new members are not bots, you must post at least 5 times before more options are available to you. Read that somewhere on here, think in the forum rules.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BurntToasts","CreatedById":61157,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T18:04:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, this actually went through? I\u0027m surprised. I skimmed through the rules and I didn\u0027t see anything about that. I may have missed it? It wasn\u0027t letting me post anything really. I was a little concerned.
