Take it one step at a time: focus on getting a pod into a stable orbit around Kerbin first (about 100km will do) and bringing him back. Then try to get one to burn out farther, catching a Mun intercept, then coming back. Then, try to get an orbit around the Mun and come back.

And when they do, it\u0027s usually because of a problem in an earlier stage. For example: your lander stage doesn\u0027t have enough fuel to return, because your injection stage burned out before reaching an intercept, because your orbital stage didn\u0027t manage to circularize completely, because your launch stage was too weak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer: solve it from the bottom up. But guess what\u0027s the key to a better bottom stage? A lighter top stage.
