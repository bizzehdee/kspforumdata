It only took a couple of minutes of watching the video of KSP to persuade me to buy the program which I consider to be excellent value for only $23.00 ( converted for me to \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A315.45 ). I anticipate many hours from now on trying to make the Kerbal race into Space travelling experts. I am also astonished at the plethora of addons available so far , especially considering that the core program is in a progressive stage of development.Many thanks for a fun and informative program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDavidR\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T10:56:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T19:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
