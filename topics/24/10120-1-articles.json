They just don\\\u0027t work, even when they are EXACTLY the same as other rockets from videos which do work. I think this is a bug and hence I may not play again, but yeah.\n\nAside from that, greetings! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-03T15:12:55Z","Content":"Can you post a screenshot of one of your rockets in the VAB and on the launchpad?"},{"CreatedByName":"Celarious","CreatedById":23982,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-03T15:17:57Z","Content":"VAB:\n\n![JYSqt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JYSqt.jpg)\n\nLaunch Pad:\n\n![05EKJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/05EKJ.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-03T15:22:32Z","Content":"OK, first of all, your rocket is too heavy for those three engines at the bottom to carry (all the weight of the rocket is pushing down on them on the launchpad), which is why two of them broke (grayed out on the second screenshot). \n\nTry lowering the center part of the rocket so that the three middle engines are lined up with the three outer engines. \n\nAlternatively, try something a little smaller for your first flights. \n\nYou can find a lot of great rockets in the stock repository here:\n\n[http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=6409.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=6409.0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Celarious","CreatedById":23982,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-03T15:24:00Z","Content":"Ah, thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-03T15:25:18Z","Content":"Second, those three engines do not have enough thrust to lift a rocket of that size.
