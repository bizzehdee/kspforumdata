I started playing the demo back in February but that didn\u0027t last for too long. After about 5 hours or so in the demo I had to buy the game. Since then I\u0027ve gone from thinking I needed fuel lines from Mono propellent tanks to the RCS thrusters to being able to go to any planet and moon I choose. I stream the game occasionally on my \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/newbiusmaximus\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etwitch\u003C/a\u003E and have a lot of fun doing so. It\u0027s fun showing people the amazing things you can do. This game has been a lot of fun and each update has made it that much more enjoyable. 0.90.0 Hype!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Newbius Maximus\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Broax","CreatedById":109333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T00:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI admit that I also made that mistake starting out! :-p\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
