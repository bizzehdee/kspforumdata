I found it about a week ago.\n\nFor several weeks now, I\\\u0027ve been thinking: \u0027Hey, wouldn\\\u0027t it be great if there was a space travel sandbox game? Which lets you build your own rockets and all?\u0027 However, I never really looked into it, not expecting such a thing to really exist. \n\nThen I found a video of KSP on Google\u002B and...well, long story short, I think those were the best spent 15$ ever ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI\\\u0027m using a few mods and consider myself a more or less \u0027realistic player\u0027, launching probes to the moon first, testing my gear in low orbit etc.\n\nWhat else about me...\n\n- English is not my native tongue, so I hope you can forgive me the occasional spelling and grammar mistake.\n\n- I\\\u0027m a huge fan of \u0027MLP:FiM\u0027. Just throwing this out there because I\\\u0027ve seen a few pony-avatars and -signatures around here ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n- If you want to know *anything* else about me, go ahead and ask me. I won\\\u0027t promise to answer every question, but you can always ask ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo yea...thanks for having me here.\n\nSyrus out~"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T18:02:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E - English is not my native tongue, so I hope you can forgive me the occasional spelling and grammar mistake.\n\nYour spelling is top notch, english isn\\\u0027t my native either, but i think it owes more to the laziness of those who actually do have it as the first, welcome aboard!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - I\\\u0027m a huge fan of \u0027MLP:FiM\u0027.
