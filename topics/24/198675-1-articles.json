Shared Horizons is a bit newer than No Place Like home, so Horizons has some additional features. As for how they work with mods, that\u0027s different every time. Every update can break\u00A0some mods and it takes time for their makers to unsnarl things, but how quickly that can be done is anybody\u0027s guess.
