You can call me DreadedEntity. Unless of course we\u0027re friends (have we met before?). I\u0027ve been playing KSP for about a week now and am delighted to say that I\u0027ve found this game to be the epitome of \u0022what could go wrong????\u0022. I have made my first orbiting satellite with a 2-stage launching system (gravity and air friction sucks!). I had decided to specialize in atmospheric aircraft when I first bought the game, but my first design failed and my second design had a center of lift issue that I could not correct and I got no help from the forums, either. So I\u0027m a little discouraged but my ambition hasn\u0027t dampened! My next project is to build a massive orbiting refueling station or a Capital Ship like a carrier, complete with it\u0027s own refueling station and hangar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play with a \u0022group\u0022 of friends and we have our own teamspeak server for VoIP and I love to meet new people as I am co-leader. If you\u0027re interested in playing in an environment where many people are playing the same game and can share ideas and your conquests send me a PM and I can give you our address.
