One of the (many) gripes I had with Spore is that, for something based on the idea of evolution, it seemed to skip over huge chunks of technological development. It went from \u0022you\u0027ve conquered the planet\u0022 to \u0022here\u0027s your interstellar craft, make it how you like\u0022. A few Kerbals scattered over a rather large amouint of geography later, I realised that KSP is more \u0022you can build it, so long as it works - if it doesn\u0027t, you\u0027ll find out rather quickly\u0022. And to be honest, the level of forethought and planning needed in building even a ship capable of orbit is something I find impressive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter getting the game, I\u0027ve had a few successes, if by successes you can count one Kerbal floating around the sun on his own orbit (possibly while playing Space Oddity in the background), one stranded on the moon after I postioned the lander legs too high up to protect the engine and three possibly off to colonise a new star system, or at least one can only hope. I\u0027m starting to get the basics of orbital mechanics, and I can\u0027t wait to see how this develops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, Good evening Kerbin, it\u0027s great to be here!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS, can anyone recommend any mods?
