I also admit I am possibly the worst pilot in the games history. My hand eye coordination is pretty bad hence the poor skills. I normal rely on mechjeb for getting into a good orbit but ive been slowly improving without it. My ideas are very varied and wild to say the least \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At the moment I have about 5 crazy orbits about the sun, 1 Kerbal that was on a vector of his own due to me not being able to return him to his ship, after a while I took pity and decided euthanasia was the best option for the poor soul. I also have about 20 odd ships between kerbin and minmus. Most of which are out of fuel and do not have docking ports on \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E. I have tried looking at and using a lot of the tutorials on the net and some fantastic work by scott manley. I still however cannot work out how to dock with other ships or even get into orbit of other worlds. On my limited success I have created some amazing looking craft and one perfectly flyable plane and rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope to chat with many of you soon and read and look at ur amazing creations. Many thanks to the devs for a fantastic game that looks, feels and runs better than many a big budget game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy flying all\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hacktech","CreatedById":57094,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T10:34:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeya Britguy32 and welcome to the forums! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I can also recommend Scott Manleys tutorials.
