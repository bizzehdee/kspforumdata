I\u0027m new to KSP and the forums. I\u0027ve got a handle of the basics of KSP, and would like to share what I\u0027ve done thus far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a space lab with every attachment but the nose cone, with three docks. It\u0027s in a stable Eastward orbit above the equator of Kerbin. I\u0027ve launched a successful round trip lander mission to the Mun, and taken a surface sample, planted a flag, and wrote out a motivational plaque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ll be fine, but I need to make more efficient ships and maneuvers in space. Once I\u0027ve got the hang of that I\u0027ll play the campaign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad to be a part of this community. KSP is the most amazing game I\u0027ve ever played. Minecraft is the only game that even shakes a stick at it, and Minecraft\u0027s stick isn\u0027t half as large as Kerbal\u0027s! You\u0027ll be seeing more of me around here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T07:46:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello JHadden123, and welcome to the forum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, one of the intended functions of the campaign is to introduce parts and missions in a gradual way.

My solution for getting stuff into orbit right now is strapping more stages and solid fuel rockets to my ships so that I don\u0027t use up any fuel for my payload\u0027s use once it reaches space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of it though. Through R\u0026amp;D, your original rockets will become worthless space junk over time just like real life, as your space program evolves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think it will help me learn the basics more thoroughly I\u0027ll give it a shot; but part of what I like about sandbox mode is the freedom to build anything any way you like without a second thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I need to watch more ThorLP or Scott Manley!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T16:54:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh, it\u0027s just a suggestion.

Rendezvous and docking can be hard for new players, but it\u0027s a lot of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T23:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was actually building one before work yesterday. I made the payload too big and I doubt navigating would have worked in orbit since it was so fat and the center of thrust was so misaligned. In any case I staryed a new game and I\u0027m working on unlucking parts now. It seems like KSP\u0027s campaign pretty well forces you to make a whole lot of pointless trips with a lander to different biomes if you want to accumulate some easy science points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
