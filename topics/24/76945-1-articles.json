Then just minutely nose up until you have clearance from the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative to that would be to slightly angle the wings to increase the AoA (angle of attack), large planes IRL do this to allow for an almost linear takeoff on the runway but take some effort to get to the required take-off speed \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally hopes this makes your future with planes a lot brighter \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ll go find the aerodynamics (with pictures) thread and link it here for you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat thread can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry had to hand-type it (Im posting via an Xbox \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-08T04:27:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2014 04:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by I.T Marcus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELink To an Amazing Post\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CmdrLaForge","CreatedById":114648,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T04:52:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you.

I think it looks so smooth because it only has the main wing.

However, this is a pretty inelegant solution and wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work with your smooth single-wing design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: High ground clearance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving high ground clearance gives the plane more room to pivot when taking off and landing. However, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m again not sure if you could do this without hurting the aesthetics of your airplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Extra landing gear at the tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis idea would probably work best for you.

I think you could probably do this with any high-impact part such as an I-Beam if you didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to use landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure how these ideas will interact with FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
