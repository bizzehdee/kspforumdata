I picked up the game on Steam in March, and it\u0027s one of the few digital purchases I\u0027ve ever made at full price. I had a blast building rockets and planes (and mostly watching them blow up), but never seemed to get the hang of extra-Kerbinary travel. Though I managed to begin assembly of a rather large space station before realizing there was a much more structurally sound way of doing so. Then 0.22 came out and a few days ago I read that the campaign option was available! This only made the game more appealing to me, as it seems the very restrictive amount of parts you are given at the beginning helped me to refine my rocket building greatly. They are still over-engineered, but they\u0027ve gotten me successful manned missions to Mun, Minmus, and a probe stranded on Eve due to an accidental staging. Anyway, I hope to become a member of this community, and wish to improve and expand my and others\u0027 building skills and knowledge of orbital mechanics \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T08:38:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(and some characters) \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T08:44:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022scootersoup\u0022 data-cite=\u0022scootersoup\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eit seems the very restrictive amount of parts you are given at the beginning helped me to refine my rocket building greatly.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, it\u0027s a good discipline to learn to build with a reduced toolset.
