Back in the 60\u0027s \u0026amp; 70\u0027s (70\u0027s mostly) I built rocket kits, sometimes designing my own rockets. The last rocket I designed/built was 8\u0027 tall including lander. I had too much effort built into this just to send it a few hundred feet up, nor to loose it to winds aloft with the chutes. So this is what I built...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt it\u0027s heart, was a very rudimentary alt transmitter, and a model plane receiver for 1 top of ark servo action and 1 lower altitude action. At it\u0027s peak altitude, 3 black powder charges would be ignited to; 1) The lightest charge, push rocket body chutes out 4 ducted 3/4\u0022 thick fins of the main stage. 2) This, the largest charge, was in a re-enforced section below the slip-fitted lander, with the propellant in a honeycomb setup so it wouldn\u0027t \u0022pool\u0022 into a pile or away from the igniter, push out the lander. 3) Placed in a tube atop the lander would push away from the lander while expelling a small drogue chute tethered to the lander to keep it upright while keeping it from gaining too much speed, but not too slow to insure that it kept relatively close to the launch area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne C engine was mounted at the center of the lander so at several hundred feet from the ground it was ignited to provide a quick speed reduction \u0026amp; to blow out the main chutes. To keep battery weight down I took apart a mechanical flashbulb of the era to ignite the engine. The lander had gear that pivoted out when ejected from the main body of the rocket and a sprung, inward bending knee hinge to absorb what the chutes left for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was nearly 40 years ago and my last venture into rocket designing, till now.
