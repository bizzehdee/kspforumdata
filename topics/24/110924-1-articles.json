Recently I re-discovered Kerbal Space Program, thanks to Scott Manley ([https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg](https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg)) and Paul, also known as Squirrel! ([https://www.youtube.com/user/DaSquirrelsNuts](https://www.youtube.com/user/DaSquirrelsNuts)) I watch them regularly, and recently they have been doing a lot of KSP! I love space sims, and in the past, I discovered KSP, when it was in Alpha I think. I thought it looked silly, and ignored it. I have never been so wrong in all my space sim life. Now, thanks to Scott and Paul, I re-discovered it and tried the demo. I was shocked. This is the space sim I had been always looking for, and I had found it. I bought the full version, and I am not disappointed. I am very grateful to the devs, and Wernher Von Kerman and Gene Kerman as well for teaching me about the game, and even Jeb for being BadS. I am glad to be part of this community, and I look forwards to many good times! ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n-CaptainApollo"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T19:20:47Z","Content":"Welcome to the Forums!
