Recently I re-discovered Kerbal Space Program, thanks to Scott Manley (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg\u003C/a\u003E) and Paul, also known as Squirrel!

I love space sims, and in the past, I discovered KSP, when it was in Alpha I think. I thought it looked silly, and ignored it. I have never been so wrong in all my space sim life. Now, thanks to Scott and Paul, I re-discovered it and tried the demo. I was shocked. This is the space sim I had been always looking for, and I had found it. I bought the full version, and I am not disappointed. I am very grateful to the devs, and Wernher Von Kerman and Gene Kerman as well for teaching me about the game, and even Jeb for being BadS. I am glad to be part of this community, and I look forwards to many good times! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-CaptainApollo\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T19:20:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Forums!
