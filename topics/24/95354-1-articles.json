The game is amazing! I have run into a little problem though. I have played in sandbox mode messing around a little and spent a day on the demo so i learned how to get up to space and orbit around kerban, But now i wanted to start the career and get serious which i have. In career mode i have done quit a few exploring different areas on kerban and testing numerous parts while flying and landing. But now i want to do the orbit kerban contract. but i cant make a maneuver when i get up high enough on kerban. At first the \u0022Ap\u0022 line was white and i couldn\u0027t do anything up there but point my jet and go. Then someone said you need to upgrade your tracking center then you will be able to make maneuvers, So i upgraded my tracking center and launch pad, And now my Ap line his blue now since i upgraded my tacking center like in the demo or in sandbox mode but i still cant click and make a maneuver. when i click the Ap line the only option it gives me is set target or switch. So what am i doing wrong? do i need to upgrade more or something.? or am i a complete idiot lol!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T15:12:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t normally play career; but by the sound of it you may need to upgrade it again. Off the top of my head, I think you need the level 3 tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T15:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENormally you just left or right click on your trajectory and the menu to make a maneuver shows up, but I\u0027m sure you know that already.

In response to your problem, here\u0027s a fact: You do not need maneuver nodes to get to orbit. The easiest (but not most efficient) way to get into orbit is to just burn straight up until your apoapis is above 70km. Then, when you\u0027re there, turn and burn 90 degrees to the right (assuming you didn\u0027t mess around with the roll controls) until your periapis is above 70km. Orbit Achieved! And you should know that I used that countless successful times before I learned my gravity turn, \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E you should also know that this needs no maneuver nodes.
