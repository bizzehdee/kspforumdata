I\u0027m not going to say my real name (weird, right?), but I live in the US, I love KSP and, well, video games in general. Well, I\u0027m not quite new to the game, I\u0027ve been playing since 0.19, but I\u0027m new to the forums. I\u0027ll be taking mission ideas (As I have absolutely none atm), but I just wanted to introduce myself real quick.\u0027\n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T03:11:43Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums!\n\nThings are a bit unusual around here with the release of 1.0 imminent.\n\nGood to have you aboard.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Zucal","CreatedById":139764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T04:02:43Z","Content":"Welcome!

I\u0027ve been playing since .7 myself, so I\u0027ve seen a lot...\n\nMy favorite missions are building space stations in orbit around every planetary body and keeping them supplied... \n\nFunny, I haven\u0027t completed even half the planets yet... Modding seems to get in the way of gaming time lately"}]}
