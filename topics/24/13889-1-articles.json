I got the demo about a month before the latest version released, and played it so often I bought the game just before version .15 came out. I have logged silly numbers of hours on this addictive game and come frequently to these forums, but not written until now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure its about time to introduce myself formally, since it seems I will be sticking around. Most addicting single player experience since the first Oblivion, but with more re playability!! I dare say it is nearly as addicting as EVE was, back in the day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I will be around lurking/commenting occasionally. Perhaps eventually I will get FRAPS and start recording some of my crazy Kosmos and stock-item creations (I love the Kosmos set!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-FPC\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bartkov","CreatedById":31705,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-09T10:22:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to Kerbal Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be awesome to see your vids, please do share them!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-09T14:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElectroxSoldier","CreatedById":18194,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-12T16:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuack. :3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-12T18:03:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis guy jumped on my TeamSpeak server, and it took me until later that night to remember that years before, we played Homeworld and EVE.
