Been playing a couple weeks now, in \u0022Career\u0022 mode. My most ambitious (successful) missions to date have been a Minmus landing and sample return and a first foray into \u0022deep space\u0022 with a crewed mission leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI and returning. (I also have left a trail of flaming wreckage across the Mun in a failed effort at landing a probe. But it was the result of a not-quite-perfect LANDING, not a failed de-orbit: the probe skittered sideways, tipped over, and made several low-velocity bounces before blowing up in a series of explosions, and I think I know how to correct the issue... so as the PR departments of NASA and SpaceX say, \u0022We failed to achieve all of our objectives, but the overall mission was highly successful and we learned a great deal from it\u0022.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway. Background. I\u0027m an aerospace engineer by profession, and my resume includes stints working on both the Space Shuttle and ISS programs. So I\u0027m pretty well \u0027up\u0027 on the theory and practice of orbit mechanics (even if some of it is stuff I haven\u0027t used professionally since I learned it in college, I do remember it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, I\u0027m pretty good at vehicle design for a given mission. And I was totally unfazed at launching \u0022Deep Space One\u0022 with no advance mission planning because I knew full well that I could manage \u0027on the fly\u0027 a Mun gravity-assist that just *barely* managed a Kerbin-escape, small burn back into Kerbin\u0027s SOI, midcourse correction to another Mun-flyby to kill some of the excess velocity while targeting directly into an aerocapture back at Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am driven STARKERS, however, by the gawdawful challenges of attaching radial-mount boosters to decouplers: using a 2D interface to solve a 3D placement problem, AARGH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have precious few questions and difficulties with the orbit mechanics (though I eagerly await the addition of advance mission planning when Mission Control comes online), but I have a host of them revolving around the game itself: its user interface quirks and the peculiarities of ship construction mostly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, I\u0027d like to land on Minmus someplace other than the various Flats. But the higher-elevation areas are, well, *higher elevation*. And the altimeter in the base interface is altitude relative to the datum, not relative to the local terrain. So how do I figure out where the surface REALLY is, in time to kill my remaining descent velocity and \u0022land\u0022 rather than \u0022crash\u0022? I WANT an instrument that gives me altitude AGL, and the parachutes use that data when deploying on Kerbin...but I don\u0027t know how to get access to the data. (That\u0027s going to be a bigger deal when I start concentrating on Mun; a long, slow, low-speed powered descent that kills velocity at a high altitude and then cautiously creeps down to an uncertain surface? Doesn\u0027t really cost that much fuel on Minmus; it\u0027s a less attractive option for Mun and its higher gravity, however.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother quandary: I have just researched my way to the base rover parts, and am all eager to master Mun landings so I can send a rover there. Which leads me to wonder... the game does not appear to have anything in the line of cargo bays or vehicle ramps... so how do I GET a rover to the Mun, off the spacecraft that transported it, and onto the surface (reliably right-side-up!) where it\u0027s useful?? If I put it at the top of the stack, above a lander, I don\u0027t see how to get it down to the surface; I suppose I could put it UNDER the lander, with a decoupler ABOVE it and landing rockets mounted radially...but that seems needlessly contrived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is doubtless a case of \u0022thinking inside the box\u0022; I know how it was done for Apollo, and the various Mars missions, but those don\u0027t seem to be options here. Is there some obvious, straightforward way (which I am just not seeing) of mounting a rover on a lander, transporting it to a destination, and deploying it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s WAY too many words for a \u0022Hello\u0022 post, so I\u0027ll shut up now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T19:53:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello and welcome.
