I\u0027m also a fan of everything that touches space stuff. I\u0027m fascinated everytime I see the moon or the stars. KSP is pretty much the perfect game for me!\n\nI\u0027m relatively new to KSP. I\u0027ve tried it out in the very beginning back when there was no map, no maneuver nodes, no nothing.\n\nThe game was really good but lacked content. I stopped playing it and last weekend I decided to give it another go after reading about all the new stuff that\u0027s been added. I figured on saturday morning that I\u0027d play it for an hour or so. I ended up doing nothing but playing KSP the entire weekend XD. This game is just way too good!\n\nWith that said, I had an idea. I am streaming on twitch once in a blue moon. I\u0027m still trying to find a good game to stream. big maintream games gets a lot of viewers, but when you are a new streamer and dont have a good viewer base, your stream is at the very bottom, as they are ordered by viewer count.\n\nthe idea I had is to start a new \u0022Adventures of a Kerbonaut\u0022 topic on these forums and start a new campain which I\u0027ll exclusively play on stream, and keep a record of what we did in the topic here, kindof like a Diary. I don\u0027t know if thats the kind of thing people would enjoy watching, but it would be fun for me to do, even if nobody comes to see the streams. **PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT ALL TIMES I PUT IN THAT TOPIC WILL BE AT MY LOCAL TIME ZONE: GMT-5.**\n\nIn the strum, we shall learn togheter and make progress toward reaching the far ends of the galaxy! More experienced players can come and share tips and advices, while beginners can certainly learn a thing or two about the game. Some could just enjoy the entertainment of seeing me fail (or maybe have some success, who knows!).\n\nI should start this adventure tonight around 5 or 6 pm (GMT -5). The topic will be created either after the stream or before the stream in an appropriate section here on the forums.\n\nMy stream\u0027s url is the following: [www.twitch.tv/Thunder_86](http://www.twitch.tv/Thunder_86)\n\nThe diary\u0027s address: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128685-Adventures-of-a-Kerbonaut](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128685-Adventures-of-a-Kerbonaut)\n\nI hope to see a few people tonight and I hope you\u0027ll enjoy watching the \u0022Adventures of a kerbonaut!\u0022 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T16:25:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 04:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thunder\\_86**\n  \nadded the address of the diary thread!"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T15:26:12Z","Content":"I\u0027ll definitely have to show up!

I\u0027m still a n00b at streaming as well, only streamed twice, and I would ideally need a better microphone, as right now it my laptop\u0027s integrated microphone that picks up my voice. Since I play on a second screen, my head is not even turned in the direction of the microphone. But I guess it works for now, nobody complained about the sound in all of my... 2 streams... yet XD.\n\nI\u0027m on a very tight budget for now, so the microphone is not a priority, but it sure would be great to improve that later.\n\nI may or may not be streaming with the webcam on, I don\u0027t think its really necessary, I\u0027m far from being that good looking anyways XD. But if everybody still wants to see my face, I\u0027ll add a face cam no problem lol.\n\nHopefully I see you on stream tonight, I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m gonna be streaming for long, but like I said I\u0027ll keep this savegame for streams only. Its gonna be on carrer mode on Normal difficulty settings! I\u0027m still on my 3-post caution period, so my posts are not displayed until a mod sees them. So far mods look pretty quick, my previous message took less than an hour to be reviewed, but I may go and start the topic right away, to be sure its up for tonight! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nHope to see you there tonight!"},{"CreatedByName":"furysamurai72","CreatedById":102666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T19:33:35Z","Content":"I know this isn\u0027t a budgeting forum, but anytime anyone mentions being on a tight budget I have to suggest YNAB.

Hope to see you around!\n\nFor that YNAB thingy I\u0027ll see, I won\u0027t go in the details here, lets just say my ex put me in a VERY rough situation... I might actually sell my house and move to a more affordable place as my house is far away from work(50km to go and 50 to come back... 100km a day! or 60miles for those who work with imperial systems), it costs me a crapton in gas, and the roommate that I got is an idiot and in my location its hard to replace him... So yeah. what will solve all my problems is just to move to an appartment closer to my work! Not counting the fact I live in Canada (winters are COLD), and its freaking expensive to heat up that 11\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BD house. in a small appartment, no stupid roommate, very low commute costs to go to work, and very low electricity bills, everything will be fine ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).
