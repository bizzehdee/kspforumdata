But I have a feeling that Eve may be harder, because of some videos and posts. But I haven\u0027t tried yet, so I may send a probe to the planet first and see how it goes from there! Also I found out that there are hidden easter eggs on a lot of planets! So I will see if I can find all of them!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSACheese","CreatedById":150877,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T19:48:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!
