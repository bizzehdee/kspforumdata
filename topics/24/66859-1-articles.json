I have 160 hours to date. So, I just wanted to say hi. I\u0027ve also been reading lots of forum posts, but I\u0027ve finally gotten around to signing up. Usually I don\u0027t go to the \u0022Newcomers\u0022 section, I just observe and comment until I understand it all, but I decided a long wall of text would be a good introduction. I\u0027ve never made it outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI without cheats or debug, but I\u0027d like to try. I get annoyed with my friend, who introduced me to KSP, because even though he has been playing longer than me, he has yet to get into orbit. On top of that, he\u0027s murdered Jeb at least 30 times. I had a career mode space race with my other friend. I was the first with a probe in space. So anyways, that\u0027s me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr hi im new1\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T23:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T00:28:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!
