I\u0027ve had KSP for a while but am not much of a forum person, so I\u0027ve mostly only lurked anonymously for the sake of catching announcements, keeping up with the devs\u0027 design philosophy (Which I am fairly pleased with) and taking the occasional look at the Exchange. Registering is not without uses, though, and I might take up modding if the time to learn to code ceases to elude me, so here I go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play KSP in bursts, getting back to it from time to time and mysteriously improving by leaps each time. The updates and improvement, particularly maneuver nodes, have helped me along, of course. Not long ago I was barely able to make a vessel capable of performing multiple Mun landings for extra science and exploration, now fuel is the only issue I\u0027ve been dealing with in that department. Erring on the side of too much fuel helped, within reason. And though I am terrible enough at docking to not even bother for now, I\u0027m finally getting things to other planets.

It looks like my issue was being unable to fine tune a rendezvous to a degree I was satisfied with, then picking the wrong time to cancel the craft\u0027s speed relative to target.
