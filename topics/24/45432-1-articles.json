Won\u0027t bore, will just post some suggestions, and while i realise this game can be heavily modded these are aimed at making the core game more user friendly and better:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Make the parts screen easier to manage. For one, split parts into smaller groups, in propulsion have engines/fuelpods, maybe even types of fuel. It becomes an immense hassle to find parts. Also, while i love the lore of them, there should be some standards in regards to the size they have and their name. Something like R3/R2/R1 put somewhere in the name to mention how radially big each part is, for a small example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Part info when you have it selected. I loaded up some models from the default folder and besides comparing their look to the ones in the parts list i could not see which part is what. I just wanted to take it down and understand how it\u0027s built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Visible connection points. A screenshot illustrates it best, from Galactic Civilisations 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20071126124230/galciv/images/1/13/ShipDsgn.PNG\u0022 alt=\u0022ShipDsgn.PNG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the red dots are connection points on the parts and the default \u0027facing\u0027. For spherical items, they have a lot of them, but what this helps to do is you know where to point your mouse to clip parts to a specific point and not have to wobble your mouse around until the game recognizes that you want to ACTUALLY put it there. Sometimes to simply put another fuel tank below another one, in line, i kept getting tons of weird other placements until i finally got what i wanted. I understand the game is trying to translate where you\u0027re pointing in a 3D space by throwing a vector and the first intersection is what gets used, but the GC2 example above is a very simple way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) More stats in the vehicle builder. What\u0027s the current ship\u0027s total mass? How much thrust does \u0027this\u0027 stage give out? I don\u0027t know enough-enough about the game to say which are important and in what capacity, but i really just felt i was slapping parts together without knowing how or why. I have three engines, should i add another one? Do i need an extra fuel tank? How long does will this engine burn with this fuel tank at max burn? Sure i can calculate, or run it to see, but having some stats makes it atleast tangible and gives you some numbers to have in the back of your mind and reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Faux wind-tunnel? Can i see where the biggest drag is on my ship and try to fix it before launching it? Goes with the above improvements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Overlay trajectories in the \u0027normal\u0027 3D view. This can\u0027t be so hard. While i understanding using the map to actually make trajectories since it\u0027s a fine thing, what\u0027s the issue with not being able to see said trajectory and whatever changes in in in the 3D viewer. While i\u0027m sure in the end it\u0027s just novelty, it would make it easier for people to understand what\u0027s going on when they can actually see their ship physical facing and the relation burn has on their trajectory in real time. If nothing else, atleast show ship \u0027facing\u0027 in the map. This might also be more fun since you end up with something else to look at rather than a blue line and the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s about it so far. I\u0027m still struggling on preserving fuel and getting a ship into stable 75/75 orbit with /enough/ fuel to make re-entry. Often i barely end up with enough fuel to make periapsis. Anyhow, this is perfect to play at work. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T15:55:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis belongs in the suggestions forum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts menu is fairly well organized in more or less the same way you suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor your 4th concern, there\u0027s a magical thing called math. as well as another magical thing called a calculator, which can be paired with pen and paper for maximun mass-finding and Delta-V finding efficiency\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewelcome aboard. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cosmitz","CreatedById":82036,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T18:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, thanks for the greeting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a stickler for the fourth issue, in the end, it is a game. Sure i can math, in the same vein i can not even start the game and giggle maniacally while i calculate thrust ratios on a notebook. Or not really. Just got the Engineer Redux mod and it\u0027s simple in what it does, just tosses stats at me like TWR/thrust/Delta-v, stats that you NEED to know when you\u0027re building rockets and for simplicity\u0027s sake, have them in front of you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know what i sound like, i have favorite games of my own that i played to death and still get surprised what little usability feature that i didn\u0027t have and makes a world of difference gets mentioned by a pair of fresh eyes trying the game for the first time. Sure, i learned and someone else can learn aswell, but if it can be made better and easier to comprehend, it should.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T20:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need assistance with any aspect of the game at all, whether it be piloting, engineering, or interface, I\u0027d highly recommend taking a look at the Drawing Board (link in my sig) or asking questions in the \u0022Gameplay Questions\u0022 section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding point 5 in particular: Right now, due to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Atmosphere#Drag\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E the way the game renders atmospheric drag\u003C/a\u003E, all parts more or less contribute equally to the craft\u0027s air resistance, regardless of their aerodynamic properties or even whether or not they\u0027re exposed to atmosphere at all.
