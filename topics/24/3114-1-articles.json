Like so many others, my day was going along fine until a random Reddit search put me on the path to orbital destruction. Now I spend my nights with bleary eyes and slide rule, trying to figure out a way back to the launch pad from whence I came. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ok, the slide rule is a lie. I have one and know how to use it, but rarely bother because I have yet to achieve my first orbit. After trying a few times with the stock parts, I loaded up all the mods I could find, but felt it was too easy and took away from the spirit of the original space race: achieving success with limited means. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E anyway, I love this game and hope to contribute in some way, but I suck at math, so we\\\u0027ll see. I can write and transcribe... anything I can do in the way of documentation? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E RS\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-21T04:27:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4davis","CreatedById":6398,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-22T17:09:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewelcome\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
