Then took a break, downloaded 0.12, and was amazed at how much did those three features make the game even more interesting! The full version should be pretty impressive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, after making a few successful Mun landings and returning the astronauts home, I guess it was time to register and say hi \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Now I\\\u0027ve given myself several tasks to keep myself busy. One is placing 4 satellites in Munar orbit in one mission. Then putting a small research base on the Mun. I also wanted to try some funky stuff with orbital transfers, wanted to see if I could lock a ship to switch between Mun and Kerbin orbits indefinitely without any input to maintain this after it was established.. probably not before we can start doing flight plan analysis on the ground prior to launch, etc. But still, a Mun/Kerbin orbital yoyo would be fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, hope they fix the donations system quickly, because I think this game deserves support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-25T18:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
