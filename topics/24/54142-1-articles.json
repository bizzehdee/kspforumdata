For example, I\u0027ve launched five or six successful Mun missions - fly-by\u0027s, \u0027stayputnik/probe hybrid\u0027 landings, and am now ready (skill wise) to conduct a manned landing, but I haven\u0027t scored enough science points to unlock some fairly essential gear to do so (primarily docking gear). I am doing experiments whenever possible, but it doesn\u0027t seem that the returns are sufficient to match the requirements needed for higher tier gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre other players finding this? Or am I missing something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a suggestion, it seems that the \u0027science points earned\u0027 could be increased by 50%, and \u0027science points required\u0027 could be decreased by 33%, both across the board, to raise the rate of tech and equipment advancement. Plus there are only so many times you can do similar things without boredom or repetiveness creeping in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T03:10:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a certain pool of points to be collected by performing each kind of experiment in each of several regions. Repeating an experiment does not gain as many points as the first time you do it, but you can just keep performing that experiment until you\u0027ve collected all the points available for that test/location. So have you tried re-doing missions/experiments? Have you looked for different places in which to perform experiments? (There are some lists you could find of all the locations, but I don\u0027t want to spoil it.) Also, once you research solar panels and a probe core, you can start flinging one-way missions around with abandon, and those can be worth a lot of points. And by the way, this is the first iteration of the science system, and it is already scheduled to be substantially re-worked in the next version of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hidden Gunman","CreatedById":94236,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T21:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Vanamonde, I\u0027ve been doing that, it\u0027s a bit like \u0027science point farming\u0027, although I understand that there may well be tweaks to the system. Definitely needs a little bit of re-organisation and rebalancing, but nothing too drastic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keithz15","CreatedById":93963,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T22:00:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried fly-bys or landings on minmus??
