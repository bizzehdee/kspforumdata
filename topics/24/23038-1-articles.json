I got into this game from reading a review of Space Agency for the ipad. Someone said it was ok, but it was no Kerbal Space Program. Well, after a google search, and 30 minutes trying out the demo, I had to get the full version. I\u0027ve only been at it for a week or so but it keeps me coming back for more. I\u0027ve been looking for something like this ever since Buzz Aldrins Race into Space. This is a different animal but the realism, challenge, and not so bad learning curve have been a great combination. Add in a few mods, and I\u0027m hooked. Not since maybe Civilization have I been sucked in by a game! And it\u0027s not done yet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, great to be here and it\u0027s great to see PC gaming back so to speak.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T09:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you will play it a lot and have fun with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T09:22:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums DarthJazno, I too agree that KSP has that special quality.
