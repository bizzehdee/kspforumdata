Started playing around with KSP about an hour ago and I must say, even after playing through the in game tutorials my mind is absolutely blown at this moment...I\u0027m not even sure I\u0027ll be able to use any of that to my benefit tomorrow! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I can already definitely appreciate the massive amount of customization and endless gameplay this sim can provide. That itself makes me giddy and provides me with the courage to keep on trying!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how the heck did you guys who jumped into KSP at launch even begin to learn and understand this game? Because at the rate I\u0027m going I dont think I\u0027d honestly be picking up much...but I suppose this is insanely premature of me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe massive amount of youtube tutorials and written guides will probably be a tremedous help and huge crutch for me, but I suppose my one, main question at this point is how in the hell did you veterans of the game get started understanding it? Its not the technicality that gets me, just the sheer amount of work that goes into even orbiting (which is a good thing, if I made it sound otherwise!). Its a bit daunting to me at this point. I\u0027ll probably replay the tutorials tomorrow, but even the construction one seemed like a giangantic undertaking of \u0022where the hell do I start!?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips, pointings, or general direction would be MUCH appreciated! I can\u0027t wait to understand SOME of this game and be able to sucessfully do my first flight! The last tutorial I completed, the orbit one, was the most mind bending, and once I got the last section of it where he says \u0022see you on ground!\u0022, I began turning towards the ap or pe or whichever (my apologies I haven\u0027t gotten even the terminology down yet!) and boosting as I did for the others, but just ran out of rocket fuel =/. Alas I never made it back to earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone who wants to take me under their wing and show me some pointers tomorrow I would love to come along for the ride! I\u0027m thinking some sort of xchat type voice comm would be absolutely clutch for some great 1 on 1 tutoring in this game, if anyone feels charitable enough with their knowledge and time to do that =D. Of course, I\u0027ll check out some of the beginner youtube vids tomorrow as well, I\u0027m sure that will help explain some of the mysteries I feel are so out of reach right now. And I know I\u0027m being extremely impatient (only played for an hour or so!), but this game already has me so excited I just want it ALL RIGHT NOW!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, and sorry for the novel of a post I wrote! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Indo\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T12:39:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe videos help, but I definitely had a lot of trial and error while trying to get to orbit. That is part of the fun, though. If it was easy, then getting that first ship up there wouldn\u0027t give you that rush of \u0027YES, I DID IT!\u0027 Which is a big part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do believe there is some sort of voice-chat group around, saw a post on it somewhere but I don\u0027t have it on-hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, and remember that failing is half the fun of KSP. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I also threw this video together yesterday that covers the basics of career mode building and orbiting.... and a bit of disaster recovery.
