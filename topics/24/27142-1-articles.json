I almost made it out of the atmosphere last night before looking up some tips online. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few quick questions. Is there a benefit to launching an unmanned satellite into orbit over a manned capsule other than the obvious one of not suffering a casualty in case of an epic fail? Do the science instruments actually gather information that is communicated back to base level once it is in orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Finnerty","CreatedById":61457,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T21:00:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe scientific instuments do work, but no communication. Just right click on them and they show info on temp, strength of gravity, barometric pressure(only reading from this in orbit is \u0022IN VACUUM\u0022 but works in atmosphere and on the surface) and can\u0027t think what the fourth one does. The antennas unfurl, but no real comms yet with them. Haven\u0027t read recent upcoming additions to the game, so I can\u0027t say whether they will be used in future updates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been launching just satellites for now myself, just for kicks putting one in orbit everywhere I go, just to say, \u0022I was here\u0022. And it gives me an idea of how much fuel it takes to get to each planet,moon. The temp and gravity instruments I have on each satellite. They both show readings in orbit. But, that\u0027s just how I\u0027m starting out playing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T00:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any other questions about how things work, be sure to stop by the \u0022How-To\u0022 section and ask there.
