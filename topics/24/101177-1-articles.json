That was always part of the design-philosophy behind KSP, and something SQUAD should be and rightfully is proud of...\n\nKSP plays best with mods- when you get tired of spaceships, give [submarines](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24845-Boat-Parts-0-90-R4-65) or [airships](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53961-0-25-and-partial-0-90-HooliganLabs-Mods) a try for a little while, for instance (there are actually some rather excellent mods that allow both of those- linked in the text!) Or, when you want to try a more challenging experience, give [Real Solar System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55145-0-90-Real-Solar-System-v8-5-Dec-23) and a more realistically-sized planet a try along with the [RealFuels](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64118-0-90-Real-Fuels-v8-4-25-Feb-15) mod: it\u0027s so different it\u0027s almost like a different game. If you want to try near-term \u0022hard\u0022 science-fiction gameplay, then the [KSP-Interstellar Extended](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111159-WIP-0-90-KSP-Interstellar-Extended-0-7-23-Radial-Magnetic-Noozles!) mod (which I help develop) is always a great place to start- there\u0027s nothing like building a [Propulsive Fluid Accumulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propulsive_fluid_accumulator) in Low Kerbin (or Earth) orbit or taking an [Alcubierre Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive) to another star system (with another mod that adds a second star system!) And, of course, if you\u0027re more into \u0022soft\u0022 science-fiction, there are mods that even add in the Starship Enterprise and [working lasers!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/9923-0-90-Lazor-System-v35-%28Dec-17%29)\n\nRegards,\n\nNorthstar\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T10:00:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 10:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989**"},{"CreatedByName":"RandomActPG","CreatedById":139429,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T16:42:50Z","Content":"There\u0027s always something to do in KSP.
