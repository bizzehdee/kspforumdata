I discovered KSP from a youtuber by the name of Chicken keeper. I have just gotten the game and have played it for a few days. I have launched some satellites, a space station(I think), and lots of ships(even a long range prope that I tried to get into orbit of some far away planet.). However I have had 2 problems with the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I have made many ships, trying to get to The Mun. At least a dozen designs have been made and launched. I have made a good design (for a Newbie of course \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) that can get me into orbit and to the Mun. My problem is I have to use my lander to get the rest of the way to the Mun, and when I do I don\u0027t have enough fuel for the landing. I have 4 small tanks of fuel with fuel lines to a main tank that they are connected to, they are supposed to draw fuel from this tank when they run out of fuel in their main tanks, but they don\u0027t. Why is that and how do I fix it(The fuel lines are connected top to bottom)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A smaller problem, I made a space station, but the game says it\u0027s a ship. When I loaded up the stock station core I saw that there was a part there that I did not put on(it\u0027s the one right above the hitchhiker). When I looked for it in the part menu, I could not find the part. What is this part and in what tab is it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone could tell me how to solve these problems I would be most grateful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--S\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9 onr sverdar sitja hvass!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T02:01:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Fuel lines only flow one way, so is it possible yours are backwards? Look closely at them and you\u0027ll see that they have little gray triangles on the sides that point in the direction the fuel will flow. 2. The part above the Hitchhiker is a Lander Can control capsule, but you can change the classification of your own construction to \u0022station\u0022 by right-clicking on its control part and choosing \u0022change name\u0022 from the menu that appears.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T12:24:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFuel lines have to be connected directly from tank to tank or they don\u0027t work as I found out with one probe design with drop tanks. One of my three stage designs, not an asparagus setup, got its second stage to escape velocity. Soon as I can solve the slow roll problem, it will be a good launch vehicle for Mum and other nearby exploration with a Kerbal astronaut.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joil","CreatedById":70626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T13:09:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.
