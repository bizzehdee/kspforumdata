Been playing since 0.14. After 5 minutes of the demo, I paid for the game. That says a lot because I\\\u0027m not a big time gamer but this game blew me away. BRING ON THE CHEEZY: I\\\u0027ve always loved the space program and loosing our (US) manned mission program broke my heart. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs most kids, I wanted to be an astronaut. Must have seen \u0027Space Camp\u0027 and \u0027Explorers\u0027 a hundred times. This game not only gives me an outlet for that, it lets me explore space on my own terms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot give enough praise to the SQUAD team and the mods. I can honestly say, this is the best game (simulator) I have ever played. I feel honored to be a part of it and watch how it develops. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChad \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-11T16:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
