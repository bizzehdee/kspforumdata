I\u0027m a big time techie and general science geek. I built and flew model rockets as a teenager. In 10th grade I discovered computer programming (BASIC) and wrote a couple amateur programs to help me with my model rockets. I served in the Air Force as a 9S100. I was basically a science/tech MacGyver.

I now work for myself and do Linux systems administration and website design/administration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing KSP for about a month now and creeping these forums for pretty much just as long. Made an account to post in the Interstellar plugin thread. As an aside, really excited to Scott Manley start his KSPI video series. I\u0027ve been playing with KSPI for almost as long as I have stock and it\u0027s such a fun plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see...oh, mods. I play with Kethane, MechJeb, Protractor, KSPX, KSPI, Procedural Fairings, and swapped out Quantum Struts for Ferram\u0027s Kerbal Joint Reinforcement. KJR plays very smoothly with the big, heavy parts from KSPI and makes for a bit less stressful launching. I have a kinda meh PC so I try to keep my mod count low. I\u0027m considering that part welding mod I\u0027ve seen floating around to keep my computer from crying when flying ships over 200 parts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSuperintendnt","CreatedById":47102,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T19:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, granted it seems you have already swam in the deep-end given that this wasn\u0027t your first post!

Indeed, I jumped into the deep end with the game since I went into it with at least a rudimentary understanding of the physics involved. Turned out it was a bit more involved that I thought if I wanted to go beyond Kerbin orbit, so I ended up going back to the tutorials after 3 or 4 days of messing around in LKO. xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 9S100 is an Air Force military job. It\u0027s very much more of a science-y type job than what you might think is a typical military job, say a rifleman or a mechanic. A 9S is more like a nuke tech for a Navy sub in that you have to have a high level of technical and scientific skills. I used these \u0022nerdy/civilian\u0022 skills as a member of the military to support military missions. Nothing civilian about what I was doing. When I joined up, my recruiter basically read off the description in the link I provided. I asked her, \u0022soooo, what does that mean?\u0022 She literally told me that she had no idea, but because of all the big science sounding words and the fact that you need a top secret clearance, it had to be a really cool job. At basic training, none of my instructors knew what I would be doing. I got to my technical training base and it\u0027s hilarious looking back because everyone was all \u0022oooo he\u0027s a 9S!\u0022 but yet no one outside of my school knew what I was doing either. I got to school a few weeks early so it wasn\u0027t until after basic and after being at my technical training base for a few weeks that I had my first day of class and finally found out what the heck I would be doing for the next 4 years. lol It was WELL worth the wait once I found out, but that was one of the longest, suspenseful waits of my life. xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought I would be clever, but the light blue of the \u0022here\u0022 link doesn\u0027t show up very well on a white background next to black text. lol \u003Ca href=\u0022http://usmilitary.about.com/od/airforceenlistedjobs/a/afjob9s100.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://usmilitary.about.com/od/airforceenlistedjobs/a/afjob9s100.htm\u003C/a\u003E This is the link in my above post that gives the info on what I did.
