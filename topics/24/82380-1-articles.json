To be frank, I know absolutely nothing about rocket science. (I did read \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003EThe Right Stuff\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003E, for what it counts.) I do not profess to know anything about rocket science, nor do I intend to. I am confident that any work I do here will be done at great cost and through the vast expenditure of human (Kerbal?) life. I took a semester of Physics freshman year, and that\u0027s it. (If you\u0027re wondering what grade I got, don\u0027t. It was a D\u002B.) I am going to achieve my goals (whatever they may be), come Hell or high water, or some combination of those two. I will not cheat. (At this point, I broke down into sporadic giggling at the notion of not cheating. Now that I\u0027ve gotten control of myself, I promise that I will not cheat without saying that I did so, or at the bare minimum, implying it. In short, you\u0027ll know if I do.) So, I plan to begin my glorious foray (I think I spelled that wrong) into outer space on Saturday. I was going to link that one thing Ronald Reagan read after the Space Shuttle exploded, since there\u0027s going to be a lot of that going on. (Explosions, that is. I cannot promise that there will not be any Space Shuttles, but I will do my damnedest to ensure that there will be no Ronald Reagan.) On that note, I will conclude this first entry. God help us all.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003E- Bissotwo, Head Research Person for Kerbal Space Center\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
