I have no doubt that y\u0027all can probably do the math in your heads by now, as much as you do it on the job, but it\u0027s still worth a glance if you need a reference for the interface and controls. The people in the How To forums will also be glad to answer any questions you have about the game as well. Feel free to look around the rest of the forums as well, and hop into any conversation that piques your interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T17:57:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome i watched the Vega launch live!
