The easiest way to learn the basics of orbiting is 1) Using addons pack and 2) .cfg edit your parts. You can add, by example, a zero to fuel. Since 0.14 you can also use plugins like machjeb. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the basics to orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo straight up to ~10KM. Than you can turn a bit to get horizontal velocity. I (we?) prefer 90HDG, or the AD keys. I (we?) prefer in the heading of the D key. When your altitude is high enough (I prefer 100-200 km), time warp till you\\\u0027re on the highest apsis. Now, prograde (that yellow circle in the nav ball) till you have a nice orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-12T19:47:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wntvcom","CreatedById":16993,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-12T23:04:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022manofwar447\u0022 data-cite=\u0022manofwar447\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei got it a couple days ago and im wondering how u need to set up your stages so you can get to space cause the farthest ive made it is 160,000 meters but cant get orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The other posters give good advice, but personally I enjoy the test, do something different, test again method.
