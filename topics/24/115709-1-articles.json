Or rather.. been lurking for a while but never really bothered to register until now.\n\nSo who am I?\n\n28 yr cad-constructor who have a sickly interest in space and construction.\n\nI mostly build spaceplanes theese days (although I really should get started on my Duna colonization program). The dream is to get 100T payload to LKO via SSTO plane (PB so far in 1.0x is ~50T). I have a twitch account where I stream occasionally. Sometime in the future I hope to get a schedule going.\n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T20:28:45Z","Content":"After 3 years playing this game, I can get just under 7 tons to orbit with an SSTO.
