Been playing since Alpha. Never got to another planet (outside of Kerban SOI) until beta. Then I made a station, so forth and so on until I visited every planet, including Eeloo. Mechanical engineering student, however I do research in Additive Manufacturing so I guess I am an engineer, albeit one in training. Anyways, I\u0027m going to try my hand at a return mission from Eve finally (new aero model = feasible takeoff and reorbit from sea level possible?) and probably do the Jool 5. Anyways, hope to make friendships with you guys, rivalries with others. Time to get this thing started!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:41:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!
