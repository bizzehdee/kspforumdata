My name is David Evans, but I go by the alias of Bashkire (Kire as in ear). That being said, however, I don\u0027t mind terribly what you call me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, a little personal history:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m 19 years of age and joining the Royal Navy as (hopefully) an Air Crew Officer Pilot, so this is the perfect place for me! I\u0027m an ex Sea Cadet and was in the corps for a little over 2 years and reached the rank of Able Cadet. I attended several courses, including a prestigious week long leadership course at the Britannia Royal Naval College and my passion for the sea and my future career in the Mob has burned ever since. I enjoy a good bottle of port and it\u0027s become quite the accompaniment for my KSP missions... although as I type this I am down to my last shot and a half.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a little Kerbal Space Program personal history:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI picked up the gem that is KSP shortly after version 0.16 came out and was captivated right from the off. I immediately built my first rocket with the biggest fuel pods, biggest engines and, in short, all the biggest parts I could find. The rocket blew up as soon as I started the flight. But I was not deterred! I continued designed and, many Kerbal widows demanding my death later, I created my first ship to get into orbit. But it wasn\u0027t enough, and before too long I\u0027d reached the Mun! I then turned my attention to building aircraft and (again) many deaths later I had a craft able to fly in atmosphere and land. As a bonus, it even looks like an F35B Lightning II so it naturally got the name Speedy Bird I despite not being very speedy and as unbirdlike as an elephant with wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I have turned my gaze to the heavens one again and I am setting my sights on the Mun once more to search its surface for these mythical \u0022Mun Arches\u0022 and \u0022Munoliths\u0022 so they can be documented for my people to better understand the great Kraken that created this system!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to see if I can keep a blog of sorts to document my space program for all the world to be envious of! Or laugh at. One of the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any questions feel free to ask me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027ll leave you with a picture so you can put a face to the name:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SGeWb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SGeWb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-28T12:04:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
