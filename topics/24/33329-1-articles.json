I have been pretty much chronicling all my launches and achievements into a kind of Blog format with it sometimes appearing as a mission report or a new\u0027s broadcast xD. I do have a question though besides an entire website (well I could do a website) what would be a good medium to do updates on my current achievements and missions? Normal blog? I thought about a post in the forums with updates on my games current situation as I rather enjoy writing out what recent launches have been like and plan for future ones. Not entirely sure where in the forum though, the writers section I guess? Not really a story per say or fan fiction just me playing through a self campaign I planned out, very similar to the one in the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-NCSA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENeblian Company Space Agency\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T16:17:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
