I do not claim to be very scientific ( I got a C in GCSE Physics) but I love the fact that I can play KSP and not really have to be a rocket scientist. Anyway I look forward to contributing to the forum.

I don\u0027t have a strong academic background in rocket science myself (math wasn\u0027t even my best subject in school), but it\u0027s amazing what you can learn in a short amount of time when you have the motivation to do so.
