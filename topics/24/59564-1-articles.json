And what better place to make a first post than in a section of the forum for first posts. Anyways, I got KSP during the STEAM Autumn sale because one of my favorite youtubers played it and it looked like fun. After logging 24 hours of game play, I managed my first Mun landing (unmanned). Soon thereafter, I reached Minmus and, finally, Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow more about me. I live in London, KY. I am going to college for an electronics degree. I also write amateur music sometimes, and short stories. And sometimes I.... You know what? Just choose a hobby. I probably tried it before. I probably didn\u0027t do well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe DLM in the topic title stands for my username, Delta Lambda Mu, my three favorite Greek letters. You see, I took AP Physics B in high school. I failed the course but passed the exam with a 3 (out of 5). And because it was AP (Advanced Placement (it was college level)), I got credit for it that transferred to my college.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo before I somehow get talking about wanting to build an elevator, I am going to stop here. Ask me any questions you want and I most likely will answer them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T00:32:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever before met anyone who had favorite Greek letters.
