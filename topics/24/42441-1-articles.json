The name\u0027s Nick and I\u0027m a budding chemical engineer stepping into the wonderful world of launching various hapless objects into space. I\u0027ve only spent six or so hours in KSP so far, but I\u0027ve come to realise that it\u0027s basically the Dwarf Fortress of flight sims... which is totally awesome. When I bought KSP I severely underestimated the level of technical knowledge, but hey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve managed to get a handle on safe landings (Barring one where my parachute decided to self-cut, resulting in a spectacularly messy splashdown somewhere south of the Kerbil Space Center) and am currently experimenting with launching objects into orbit. Tried spaceplanes a few times; turns out I should never be a pilot, because my flying skills are somewhere between \u0027no\u0027 and \u0027Geneva wants words with me\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo hello!
