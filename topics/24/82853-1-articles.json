I picked up KSP during the Steam Summer Sale and have been really loving it ever since. I spent a lot of time on rockets in the science sandbox mode, and unlocked the tree with repeated missions to Minmus and the Mun, thanks in part to a lander design by Scott Manley, seen in the YouTube video where he unlocks the entire tech tree in the newest game mode in two missions. I\u0027ve captured a small number of asteroids into Kerbin orbit. I have simple space stations in orbit of Kerbin and both its moons, and once I got them there, I got a little bored with rockets, so in the last few weeks, I\u0027ve been working on SSTOs. I have a couple of SSTO designs that I\u0027m pretty proud of, and I\u0027ll be posting them to the craft exchange. Later, I might add some of my rockets. I look forward to constructive criticism from the folks that have been doing this longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn these forums, I\u0027ve seen some of the fantastic things that can be done with mods and MechJeb in particular, but at least for the time being, I\u0027ve decided to stay bone stock. I\u0027ve also seen plenty of ways to \u0027abuse\u0027 mechanics, ie asparagus staging, airhogging, and in general, spamming certain components like struts and canards. In my humble opinion, if the game allows it, I have no problem with anyone taking advantage of it. At this early stage in game development, there\u0027s something to be said for the idea that it\u0027s compensating for things the devs haven\u0027t fixed, balanced, or implemented yet. Also, doing so seems to be rather well-suited to the simplistic mindset of Kerbals as portrayed by Squad. Bigger and more can only be better, after all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I want to try to strike a balance with my designs, so particularly in my rockets, I try to limit where I use these things. Still, I\u0027m amazed at the things people have gotten to fly, taking these to extremes, and I\u0027m not immune! My SSTOs would never get anywhere without at least some airhogging, strut spam and canardapalooza. However, I try hard to build craft that are controllable and not too ridiculous, and so far, I\u0027m pretty pleased with the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAs of now, I have just one question for my fellow forum members:\u003C/strong\u003E I read the board rules and noted the section on walls of text. If you haven\u0027t already noticed, I can be verbose. Does this board have functionality where you can hide text behind a link that will expand it, like a spoiler tag?

One of my reasons to stay stock is, becoming dependent on mods is becoming dependent on another dev. If a mod maker goes dormant and a new revision breaks the mod, well, I don\u0027t want to have my arse hanging in the wind without my favorite functionality. I want to be excited about new releases from Squad, not dreading them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ere: MechJeb, I\u0027m thinking precision flying will eventually become interesting, and probably necessary for me. I doubt dead reckoning will get me much further or much bigger than I\u0027ve already gotten, so some measure of precision is going to be required for long-range missions.. but I have had a lot of fun so far. Not that my opinion matters to anyone, but I do think precision flight computers would make sense to include in later branches of the tech tree, given how difficult dead reckoning is, and how much math it takes to DIY.
