I\u0027m Kaz, or as I decided when I started playing, Kerbal Avionic Zciences. Been playing KSP on and off for a year or so now, and decided to come to the forums here to join the community sort of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is I\u0027m not that great at the game, mostly because I can\u0027t quite wrap my head around the process of deducing Delta-V and some of that other actual rocket science stuff. I poked around on the Wiki but I couldn\u0027t really grasp what information was there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if anybody has a simpler guide to get me started on that kind of math I\u0027d appreciate it!

It even shows this information for the different bodies in the Kerbol system, if you plan on your ship going to those bodies. It is a really great tool and I love using it as I don\u0027t need to keep guess and checking if my ship has enough fuel for my needs! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T22:31:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKER, MJ and VOID are excellent information mods if you just want something to display those figures for you. Otherwise you\u0027ll have to work them out by hand, slide-rule, calculator or spreadsheet every time you make any change to your vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two numbers which you want to know: TWR (Thrust to Weight Ratio) and deltaV (potential velocity vector change).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR is dead easy - all you need to know is the total thrust of your engine(s) in any stage (which KSP gives you in the VAB/SPH part descriptions) and the total mass of the rocket, including any payload (including \u0027higher\u0027 stages) it has to carry. TWR is simply Thrust/Mass; if it comes out under 1 your engines aren\u0027t powerful enough to THRUST up against the WEIGHT of gravity pulling you back down - you can\u0027t liftoff and won\u0027t be going to space today. Ideally you launch with a TWR of 1.2 - 1.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdeltaV is a bit trickier in that about the only word in \u0022potential velocity vector change\u0022 that makes much sense is \u0027velocity\u0027. That\u0027s a \u0027vector\u0027 though, in as much as if you\u0027re \u0022going at 80mph\u0022 you must be going in some particular direction. You can burn fuel, using-up deltaV, to change that so you\u0027re going faster, slower and/or in a different direction - all depending on which way your engines are thrusting at the time. To calculate deltaV for a stage you need to know three things - engine Isp (which KSP tells you in the VAB/SPH part descriptions), the total mass of the rocket (including payload, etc) with all its fuel, wet_mass, and the total mass without fuel, dry_mass. The formula is: (Isp * 9.82) * LN(wet_mass / dry_mass) \u0026lt;- easy, isn\u0027t it ^^. It is actually ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp = how efficient the engines are; the higher the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(9.82 is the gravity factor used in KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewet_mass / dry_mass = what proportion of the rocket\u0027s mass is available to power the engines; the higher the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELN() = the natural logarithm function. Don\u0027t worry too much about it - you\u0027ll need logarithm tables or a calculator/spreadsheet to work it out anyway. What it means is that there are diminishing returns from adding more and more fuel, because that fuel itself has mass, which needs deltaV to push, so you use more and more of the fuel just to push the rest of the fuel. In Excel/LibreOffice Calc the function is written as \u0022LN()\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoooo ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...
