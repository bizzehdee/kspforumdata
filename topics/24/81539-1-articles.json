I mean real fun, like before this new update. Because I am not! I can\u0027t play for more than 5 to 10 minutes. There\u0027s always some bug or crash error. And let\u0027s face it, this is not the fastest loading game around, at least with mods. How many of you are enjoying the game with at least the majority of their favourite mods? It seems I am spending more time uninstaling and then installing the game with some mods only to find it is still the same crap... and going back to removing the game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am tired. ... and honestly I dont know what am I doing wrong!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-12T19:27:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2014 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RedHell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kialar","CreatedById":60893,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T19:20:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had not one crash since I bought this game.

Two tips I have to offer for keeping the fun in KSP are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003Cstrong\u003EPick your mods carefully\u003C/strong\u003E. I can often spend hours browsing the addon releases page and often end up downloading loads of mods that look cool, but when you get to playing you may find you rarley use the parts at all. In some cases you may even have so many mods the game doesn\u0027t work at all! The key is to figuring out what you enjoy most about KSP, for me it is science, so I would try to only download mods that can enhance the gathering of science side of things like \u0022Dmagic\u0027s Orbital Science\u0022 mod which gives you new machines and tools to collect samples and data with. For other players it may be just building, so download some mods with lots of cool parts like the B9 pack. There are even mods that help bring more realism into the game, requiring you to have oxygen and food supplies for your kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u003Cstrong\u003ESet yourself goals to complete\u003C/strong\u003E This may not just apply to modded KSP but the game as a whole. Logging on and messing about in the VAB or SPH may be fun for some, but I find that after 5 to 10 minutes, and with no clear goals it quickly becomes boring. In my experience the place the hours of fun comes from is setting yourself constant goals along the way such as: get into orbit, okay, now land on the mun, then Duna... and so on. This sense of progression is what the new career mode tries to instill in you, and is what the main part of the game is all about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn response to the crashes you have been having, KSP can only allocate a limited amount of RAM to your mods, (I don\u0027t know the exact amount) so try following step 1 and removing some less useful mods a couple at a time to see if you can get it running. This will also drastically reduce load times. If you still have technical problems, try posting in the \u0022General Add-on Affairs\u0022 section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that any of this helps, just reply if you have any questions and I\u0027ll be happy to help any way I can. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
