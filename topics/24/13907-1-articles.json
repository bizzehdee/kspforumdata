So how does this one stack up to any others you may have experienced?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Every community such as this seems to have its own history, with controversies and recurring mistakes; are there any particular topics that one would consider taboo on this forum? Any blundering mistakes I should ensure I do not make?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - What is the generally accepted social policy regarding people who are new to these forums? I do not doubt that the people of this forum are kind, however are there any unspoken limitations on what someone new to these forums should or shouldn\\\u0027t do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should be enough vague interrogation for now, so I suppose I shall do as all newcomers on this particular board seem to do at some point in their introductions; I will extrapolate on how I got here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game first came to my attention after seeing a YouTuber I follow (Kurtjmac) play this game during a livestream, and this piqued my interests. I have always been obsessed with aerospace, especially the engineering aspect, so this game almost seemed to have been custom-built just for me. I didn\\\u0027t even bother with the demo, and bought the game straight away; I have been playing to the point of obsession for the past week or so, since I did so. Having previously been a part of the Minecraft community (glad to have left that ship before it sank), and more specifically the modding community, I decided to check and see if there were any mods or pluggins for KSP, and lo and behold, I have not been left wanting. I did refrain from installing said mods however, until I had at the very least made a successful Mun landing (which I found to be a delightful challenge), after which I have been trying out quite a few of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, I am very glad to have found this game, and even more so to have found it at this relatively early stage it its development, as the game seems to present near limitless opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR - This game seems cool and so does this forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Candre","CreatedById":15181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-09T13:31:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you haven\\\u0027t read them, here are the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9016.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EForum Rules.\u003C/a\u003E Conduct is what you\\\u0027d expect in any other forum.
