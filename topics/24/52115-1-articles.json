Either my rocket spins madly and I\u0027m forced to eject everything and safely land the main control pad in order to not kill the crew, I terribly miss the orbit and it ends diagonally/I fall back to Kerbin, or I run out of fuel. I\u0027m pretty sure my rocket can be able to get to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, I just can\u0027t seem to be able to control it properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if I end up writing typos, english is not my first language.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T19:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have fins/RCS thrusters on your rocket?

Lower gravity makes it easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are in low orbit around the Mun (or Minmus), burn prograde (the circle with the lines through them) until your orbital speed drops down to 0 (or very low).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you are falling down to the surface, switch to surface mode (click on the speed meter on the navball) and make sure your prograde marker is right ontop of the navball.

Below 10m/s is a good speed to touch down with Lander legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you land in the Sun.

Remember to kill the horizontal velocity by burning toward your retrograde marker to start with. Once that\u0027s down you will start to fall and then it\u0027s little burns to keep to a decent descent speed, keep it below 100 m/s as you should be able to stop from 100 m/s quite quickly when you need to. Keep burning towards your retrograde marker and it should start to move towards the top of your navball, ie you\u0027re falling straight down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, RCS is pretty much pointless unless you\u0027re docking with something, there are uses, but nothing that you\u0027ll need to worry about for A mun landing.
