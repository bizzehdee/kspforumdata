I\u0027ve been senselessly murdering Kerbals for a few months now, I\u0027ve actually been improving these numbers in recent weeks thanks to some kick ass Mods and CKAN (Greatest thing ever)... and this is where I am stuck.

Here is a link of a few of the machines available.[http://store.steampowered.com/sale/steam_machines](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/steam_machines)\n\u003E Thanks for any and all help or advice.\n\nWell, I don\u0027t know a thing about the steam machines, but this might help:\n\nI\u0027ve got a computer that can run KSP lag free when:\n\n- no mods are installed\n\n- all textures and renders are set to the lowest quality\n\nThis laptop has:\n\n4GB RAM memory\n\nIntel Pentium core\n\nSo that\u0027s the minimum hardware you\u0027re going to need.\n\nMoving on to a better computer: the laptop I\u0027m typing this on. It can run KSP on medium quality with a tiny bit of lag when things like Environmental Visual Enhancements and Kopernicus(planet adding mod) are installed. This laptop has:\n\nIntel HD graphics 4400\n\nIntel i3 core\n\n6GB RAM memory\n\nSo for medium-low quality lagfree gaming with a few mods (part-adding mods or mods like Chatterer or Texture Replacer are no problem), you\u0027re going to need a computer with that kind of hardware.\n\nFor full-quality gaming with lots of mods, you\u0027re looking at an Intel i5 recommended, i7 for best results. The RAM should be above 7. Then the graphics, a good Intel HD graphics or Nvidia card will do.\n\nAs for the Steam Machines, I don\u0027t think you should take one of those if you want to install mods. You see, mods have to be installed in the KSP directory, and the steam machines are **not** computers.\n\nA steam machine is basically a PS4 that instead of the PS4 software runs Steam. It therefor has no Windows or Apple software, so you can\u0027t access the KSP direcory and modify it.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nThe steam machines are around $600. Well, a good computer with an i7 core is around $700-$900, so it isn\u0027t that expensive when compared to a decent steam machine.\n\nHope this helps\n\nThe White Guardian"},{"CreatedByName":"scifi6546","CreatedById":130550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T19:06:59Z","Content":"I would build a computer, you could get a computer that could run ksp as well as other games that you probably discover you like.

A 4460k i5 is more than enough for 60FPS at most times and 2GB of vRAM is good as well. Active Texture Management reduces RAM usage and OpenGL/DirectX 11 help even more with using less RAM. Anyways, welcome to the forums! With practice, your Kerbals will not die.

In fact, the most expensive gaming pc I\u0027ve seen was around $16500! But hey, that one had:\n\n8x Intel i7 core (the most powerful edition of the i7 is the strongest processor ever built on Earth!)\n\n4x Nvidia GeForce Titan X (Until the new Titan Z showed up, the Titan X was the most powerful GPU)\n\n64 GB RAM\n\nYou understand, that\u0027s a lot of money wasted, since it\u0027s practically using a minigun on a fly. Good computers do not have to be expensive, you\u0027ll be fine with an intel i5 quad core, 8GB RAM and a decent GPU, which\u0027ll cost around $650-$950."},{"CreatedByName":"Dilli","CreatedById":142986,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T15:18:57Z","Content":"IIRC Steam OS is just a modified linux (Debian) OS and it seems you can just enable the access to the desktop to and file system.

Most hardware companies don\u0027t release drivers for Linux as often making them outdated and potentially leading to lower performance. Steam OS itself is actually very lightweight and can offset some of the driver disadvantages. You\u0027ll find that Steam OS will perform similarly to Windows on high-end games such as GTA 5 and others."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T22:15:37Z","Content":"I\u0027m not sure how technically inclined you are, but if you want to maximize KSP then you\u0027ll be better off building a PC since you\u0027ll be able to focus your spending on the components that make the biggest difference.\n\nKSP is CPU bound so you don\u0027t need to spend big bucks on a high end GPU, but you\u0027ll still want something better than integrated, especially if you want to use visual mods. Since you\u0027re looking at Steam machines I\u0027m assuming that you would be fine with Linux (which is better for KSP anyways since it\u0027s been 64-bit for a long time) and you\u0027ll want as much memory as you can reasonably get your hands on (about 16GB). I would also recommend a SSD to drastically reduce game load times with a lot of mods.\n\nA Steam Machine could work just fine, but it\u0027s hard to recommend a specific model since a lot of them aren\u0027t listing any technical specifications. What you\u0027ll want to look for is an Intel CPU (make sure the model number doesn\u0027t end in T, Y, U, or M, these are low voltage/mobile parts that won\u0027t have as high of performance), an Nvidia GPU (better linux driver support) GTX 950 or higher, minimum 8GB of RAM (more is better, especially for KSP on 64-bit linux), and a SSD (realistic minimum if you also want other games/software is 256GB)."}]}
