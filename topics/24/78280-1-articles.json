About the best advice you can get will be found on a YouTube channel by a man named Scott Manley (the resident Rock Star of KSP). Don\u0027t be dismayed at first glace; his channel has a ton of content and some if it is pretty advanced stuff. The reason I recommend you view his videos is he also has many \u0022beginner\u0027s guides\u0022 and \u0022getting started\u0022 videos. While playing KSP is loads of fun, it can be difficult for the new player as the \u0022tutorial\u0022 portion of the game is still under development and isn\u0027t \u0022fleshed out\u0022 yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few quick tips to help you on your way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Bigger isn\u0027t always better! More rockets, while fun, means more fuel and more weight to lift; you will rapidly approach a point of diminishing returns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Find a way to drop the parts of your ship you don\u0027t need during flight. A quick search on Onion Staging and Asparagus Staging will serve you well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Only attach parts to your rocket that you NEED; again, while redundancy is fun, it does mean more weight to lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Maneuver nodes, don\u0027t forget that a single long burn to orbit is not always the most efficient (and easy) way to get there. Often burning the right amount, at the right time, for the correct length of time will make an otherwise failing craft soar into the heavens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps and best of luck.
