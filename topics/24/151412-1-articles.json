It has such a big gravity well that it is hard not to get an encounter! You want Kerbin to roughly be at 3:00 and Jool at 12:00. Pretty straight forward. I\u0027d say you look at a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E map so you know what to bring. You can use a Tylo or Laythe gravity assist to get into Jool orbit and save tons of fuel. Literally. It should take around 2500 m/s to get to Jool orbit if you do it efficiently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDocking is pretty easy unless your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters aren\u0027t aligned properly. That has happened to me recently and trust me:\u00A0ITS frustrating. (See what I did there? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u00A0) Basically, you want to get an encounter under 10km with your target. It is better if you get it under 1km but if you can\u0027t that is ok. I see rendezvous as\u00A0getting close to the target. Basically you\u0027re going to be going at roughly the same speed and be miles away from your target. You need to alter your velocity so you are moving faster and towards your target. However you are going to fly right by it if you do it this way so as soon as you\u0027re as close as possible to the target, burn retrograde relative to your target velocity, (click on the velocity counter on the navball to change it to target velocity if you didn\u0027t know) and burn retrograde until you are going at roughly the same velocity, then burn towards your target again and then burn retrograde and rinse and repeat. As soon as you are less than 200m away from target, activate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and use the H and N (Forward and backwards) and IJK and L keys (side to side, up and down) to move yourself into position. Then select docking port on your craft that you want to dock with and click \u0022control from here\u0022. Then select a docking port on your target and hit set as target. Then dock. Simple as that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone could probably explain it more clearly too. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, hello and welcome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFire\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T20:14:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t say that Jool is easy. It does make for a large target, but it\u0027s also way the heck out there, and you arrive at a pretty high relative speed. Slowing down to stay there once you arrive will involve burning a lot of fuel, or aerobraking. And I myself am still learning how to aerobrake in the game\u0027s revised aerodynamics and heating conditions. There\u0027s an additional complication in that the planet\u0027s many moons are likely to be in the way. That can hurt, if an encounter throws you the wrong way, or it can help if you use an encounter to help decelerate. All in all, I would advise you to try a mission to Dres or Eeloo first. Without atmospheres or moons, they wouldn\u0027t assist you in braking, but neither would you need to worry about complicating moon encounters and aero heating.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-09T03:37:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a nice chart showing how the planets should be aligned to travel to and from them:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dXT6r7s.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dXT6r7s.png\u0022 width=\u0022500\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here\u0027s a nice chart showing how much delta-V you should pack to get wherever you\u0027re going:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022V4FHldK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V4FHldK.png\u0022 width=\u0022690\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe delta-V equation adapted for KSP\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/OX mix:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelta-V = 9.81 * Isp * ln( [ship mass] / ( [ship mass] - ( .005 * ( [# units Liquidfuel] \u002B [# units Oxidizer] ) ) )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a little complicated-looking, but it works anytime in flight and can be found with only what\u0027s given in the stock game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Space Dino","CreatedById":163476,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-21T05:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve not even been to Duna, I\u0027m currently still stuck in the Kerbin system due to dinosaurs not having the intelligence to fly spaceships and whatnot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IncongruousGoat","CreatedById":157062,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-21T16:39:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Jool, plan a really big delta-v budget.
