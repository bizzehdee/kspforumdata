Burn straight up to about 45,000 meters or slightly higher before pitching over if you want to achieve orbit. This lets you get out of the denser part of the atmosphere so you\\\u0027ll get further on less fuel.\n\nAlways keep an eye on your Nav Ball on the bottom center of the screen, it has many helpful icons. If you\\\u0027re not familiar with rocket terminology, learning the meanings of prograde and retrograde may help."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T21:43:05Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nHappy Launching!\n\nArrr!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager"},{"CreatedByName":"ajshell1","CreatedById":24132,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T10:54:45Z","Content":"I have just landed on the Mun! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T23:30:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have just landed on the Mun! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nGood work ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif), welcome to the elite."},{"CreatedByName":"Key of door","CreatedById":4130,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T05:01:03Z","Content":"You landed on the Mun, now get back.\n\nAnd if you have done that already, and really want to get known, go to the mun, orbit Kerbin, land on Kerbin, go back to the Mun, orbit Kerbin at 11,400,000 meters AP and then land on Kerbin.\n\nThis will make you famous for sure."},{"CreatedByName":"spike8760","CreatedById":9330,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-08T00:20:08Z","Content":"Welcome! after you get back, check out the mods our community has made! simply amazing Happy Launches! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
