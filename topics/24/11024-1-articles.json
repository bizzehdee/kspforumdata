After an hour of playing I immediately bought it. I\\\u0027ve been playing 4-5 hours a day. I used mechjeb at first to kind of learn how to get into orbit and lunar transfer and whatnot. Learning to do it manually has been pretty rewarding. Now I can now launch into orbit and transfer to either of the moons fairly regularly with manual control.\n\nThat\\\u0027s about it. Just wanted to say hey. Seems like a great community.\n\nAnd thanks to Squad for this amazing program."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T15:55:14Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nHappy Launching!\n\nArrr!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T15:56:38Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums!
