I\u0027ve been waiting for the mods to update before getting 0.24 but I expect some aren\u0027t going to. When I update, what will happen to ships containing modded parts that haven\u0027t been updated, and should I send rescue missions to remove the kerbals from those ships before I update?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fueniker S.","CreatedById":89507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T19:33:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell that depends, if the modded Parts are compatible (however seeing as you have ~40 mods, that\u0027s probably not the case), then you have nothing to worry about when it comes to your ships. If some of those parts are incompatible, then you will not be able to even load your modded crafts, unless you manually add the missing parts by taking them from older Part Packs and updating their code (If you open the .craft file, you can actually find out what part you might be missing). When it comes to plugins, they usually will not affect your ships, unless of course the mod contains parts as well. So yes, you should rescue your Kerbonauts from crafts containing modded parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Collider1","CreatedById":114806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T19:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, not being able to load them doesn\u0027t sound too bad as I can update first, see what works and then alter my mods (I was worried they might all just get deleted). Do you know what would happen if an unsupported modded ship was in visual range of an active ship? As my space station has a stock-only escape shuttle and it would be useful if I could just undock it, update KSP and then redock it if the station loads and de-orbit it if it doesn\u0027t. Also it would affect whether I have to evacuate my mun base of just step the kerbals outside.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fueniker S.","CreatedById":89507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T12:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry for this late reply. As to your question, personally I\u0027ve never really experienced that scenario, and so I\u0027ve no idea what happens. However, i wish you the best of luck in updating your KSP and saving as much of Kerbalkind as possible. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Collider1","CreatedById":114806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T12:32:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think if I prepare two quicksaves, one with the kerbals next to their ships and one with them all out of visual range, I should be able to ensure their survival without causing myself too much trouble by having to relaunch them if I can get the ships to work.
