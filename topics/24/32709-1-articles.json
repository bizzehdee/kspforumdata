I finally made a circular (or near-circular) orbit, and input to help my first orbit-capable craft would be fantastic, if you\u0027re willing to give suggestions. I have KW Rocketry and a mod I forget the name of (I installed it when I was v tired stupidly, lol) that adds Gemini and Odin parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I really hope those mods aren\u0027t one and the same, because I remember installing two.

Anyway welcome. Nice looking ship you got there. Might be a bit tad overkill on the srbs, fuel tanks, engines given your payload, but I always says if it flies, it\u0027s a keeper. (I don\u0027t talk about my landings.) You might want to check-out some of Scot Manley\u0027s KSP youtube videos. He does a great job of helping us all fly better. Plus the guy is a hoot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the 2nd mod you downloaded with the Gemini and Odin command modules is probably the NovaPunch mod (just called NP by most people.) If you are playing the most current version of KSP (.20.2) then NP isn\u0027t gonna work very well for you as it hasn\u0027t been updated since .19.1. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut don\u0027t lose heart, the incredible modder Tiberion who has been safeguarding and unselfishly updating NP is working even now to bring it completely to .20.2. Also the Gemini and Mercury spacecrafts with their respective launch vehicles are now in a separate mod by the equally talented frizzank. Both Tiberion and frizzank are great people too. If you ask nicely they will be glad to help you with their mods. BUT always read a complete thread or do a forum search before you ask. Just a polite thing to do first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo cinch your flight harness a little tighter and strap on that old leather flyin\u0027 helmet cause you\u0027re gonna to the Mun soon.
