I assume its purely Newtonian but can you really do things with real world math. I got protractor from the space port roughed out a few numbers on Mathematica and missed Jool by a country mile. I\u0027m assuming the problem is my rusty physics but I\u0027d like to be sure before I try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EG\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T15:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe physics are fairly accurate and maths can be used to perform various tasks.
