After about 10 minutes with the demo version I put down the $15 to get the full version. Really like it even with just stock parts. I managed to get one flight in orbit, lose one in space, and just got another in orbit around the Mun. Probably could land on the Mun at this point (or attempt to at least), but not sure I am ready for that risk yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T00:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
