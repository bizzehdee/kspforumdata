I\u0027ve owned KSP for almost two years now, but I have to admit... I\u0027m still a pretty big newbie. When I first got the game, there was no career mode and I was simply overwhelmed by the assortment of parts compounded with a poor understanding of orbital mechanics. I quickly grew tired of the game and moved on. I got excited about it again when I learned of the 0.90 release via RPS. Then I discovered Scott Manley\u0027s youtube channel. Boy does that guy know his stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m still absolute rubbish at building and flying rockets, but I love building aircraft. I\u0027ve gotten quite good at it, in fact. I installed NEAR because I was unsatisfied with stock aerodynamics, but was a little intimidated by FAR. I figured this was the place to come to if I wanted to learn more about rocketry and what I\u0027m doing wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems there\u0027s an amazing community here and I can\u0027t wait to learn more!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T00:19:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t take the last two years off, and there\u0027s still stuff I\u0027m learning.
