After having found this game about 3 weeks ago (and not playing anything else since then ;D ) I decided to stop lurking and introduce myself along with my latest mission. First, a big thanks to the folks at Squad for making such an awesome game. So far I think it has that beautiful mix of fun and over-the-top style with just enough pseudo-realism to produce plenty of challenges and rewards. I\\\u0027d also like to thank the modders and community who have made some outstanding things to play with. Project Lonestar may have been stock, but I really enjoy the mod packs that have been available thus far. I just consider Kerbin-made parts to be a little more challenging. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I give you Project Lonestar!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vplsu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Vplsu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR version: I made a three craft rendezvous in Kerbin orbit, Burned two to the mun, landed 1, crashed the other ~400m away, and returned. I also landed within a few hundred klicks of the KSA and landed the third craft 21km from the first. The following is somewhat fictional, but based on a true story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bit of history is in order. After the latest patch (0.14 stable) I decided to start clean and make a serious Mun shot and return platform. The previous attempts usually ended up with fuel problems, but with the addition of the half-tanks and LV-909 LFE I felt the efficiency was there now. Truth be told, I believe the Kerbal scientists finally convinced the engineers and Col. Jeb that it wasn\\\u0027t half as much power, but actually just a little bit more! Thus began the Muna III project. Sadly, the Muna design never produced a \u0026gt;=50% (good by Kerbal standards) success rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMUNA MISSION STATS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuna III A-D: 5 pad explosions, 4 decoupler/booster collisions on accent, 2 missed Munar burns, and 1 failed Munar landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf note, and not listed, is Col. Jeb\\\u0027s mission Muna IIID-4. He was able to land, make accent, and, with fuel empty, somehow use RCS thrusters to set a return orbit. Unfortunately reentry happened in mountainous terrain and the command capsule landed hard. Major Bob is in traction with a broken spine and LtCol. Bill is still in a coma in the burn ward. Col. Jeb was relatively unharmed, but was administratively grounded when mission logs showed that his \u0027triple loop-de-loop\u0027 maneuver during Munar decent burned off the scheduled fuel for the return trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point the KSA decided to can the Muna project. With lessons (somewhat) learned the mission planners had a split over the next proposed project. The majority group decided that the Muna lacked enough power, and since the engineers discovered a way to radially mount 8 fueltanks/boosters on a center spine, it was given the go ahead. This turned into project HADES with the aim of a direct Munar trajectory and direct return. The minority (actually just 1 scientist, Mort D. Kermen) advocated a kerbin orbit rendezvous with a resupply and command craft, before using a trans-munar orbital insertion. KSA leadership, unsurprisingly, selected project HADES and shuffled Mort into a secluded lab to work on his crazy project. Mort decided to call his project LONESTAR being that he was alone in his idea, but knew it would rise to greatness someday. Luck was with him in fact, as project HADES met with disaster:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHADES MISSION STATS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHADES IA-B: 3 pad explosions, 4 overheats in Kebin accent, and 1 Munar \u0027landing\u0027 ( announced at the press release so project HADES personnel could save face. Munar module \u0027landed\u0027 at 500m/s.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFaced with 2 failed mun projects, the KSA then turned to their last hope. Mort and his Project LONESTAR. Initial testing of the craft went better than expected. After orbital tests and a munar orbit without landing, the project was given the full go ahead for mission LONESTAR IB-2 \u0026amp; 3. During development, project ICARUS was devised as a way to restock the main ships in orbit with extra supplies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELONESTAR IB-2 Alpha Crew:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELtCol.

Both LONESTAR craft launch into orbit at ~200km orbits and perform rendezvous (honestly I only achieved stationkeeping (\u0026lt;20m distance) with Beta Team and ICARUS. Alpha team only got within 150m because the LONESTAR IB flies like a grain silo filled with concrete until the second stage is jettisoned)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) ICARUS craft launches and performs rendezvous for restock (I\\\u0027m gonna say food here since fuel isn\\\u0027t an option yet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Alpha and Beta teams perform TMI burn in sequence\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Alpha and Beta teams perform TMI retro in sequence\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) Alpha and Beta teams establish stable Munar orbits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.) Alpha descends and lands at predetermined landing site. begin science EVA and collects mun rock samples\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.) Beta makes orbital corrections (\u002B1 orbit) and attempts to lands as close as possible to Alpha\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.) During landing LT-2 strut #4 on Beta lander shears away and causes lander to topple. Major Gusrim claims shoddy engineering, while Mission Director Krantz asserts that he shouldn\\\u0027t have overshot his landing site. Command module is intact and all members in good health.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.) Beta team performs Munar EVA to Alpha lander 500m away while Alpha team unloads collected mun rocks and prepares for accent. Mission planers prepared for this, and the extra stocks from ICARUS were enough for an immediate return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.) With both teams loaded, Alpha lander makes their accent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.) LM and service module are jettisoned, and LONESTAR crew makes their TKI burn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12.)

I\\\u0027m hoping with the new persistence feature we\\\u0027ll get more cool missions like this. Took me most of a day to pull this off and write all this. All in all, I think even Col.
