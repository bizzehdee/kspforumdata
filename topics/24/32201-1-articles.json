My real name is very old and celtic and tends to tie peoples\u0027 tongues in knots, so I\u0027ll leave it out of here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing KSP since a few days after the 0.17 release, but now I find myself with enough free time to get into this community. The mount and blade community are lovely and all, but they\u0027re not great for an intelligent chat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a 16 year old Irish student. I like Sci-Fi, things that explode, and sifting through dubious amounts of codes to make mods. I also like Youtube videos, and I\u0027m looking at setting up a collaboration channel, the thread for which is underway. I\u0027m also an Actor, so that\u0027s where the dramatic entrance came in. Abstract drama is the best drama.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah.
