Anyway just thought i would share a few pics of what i did for the Kerbin Cup. Will get some screens of the ships that got the soccer nets to Mun and all the players. Not a difficult task but was a fun little rip. Thinking about building a stadium but i am Canadian if i did that it would be an ice hockey rink.
