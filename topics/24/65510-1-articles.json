Secondly, How long have you been playing? Putting up a refueling station is no easy task, and it requires a little knowhow on how to dock, because you are going to be doing lots of it. But really, the sky is the limit. Build what you think looks good in the VAB, break it into manageable sections, launch your first piece into orbit. Rinse and Repeat, launching each piece to rendezvous with your first section.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T03:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eid recommend MechJeb as one such tool.

Download it, place the mechjeb unit on the uppermost stage \u0026lt;that your NOT going to dump during ascent or at least, not until your about to back down to kerbin\u0026gt; and have it do its thing. Use Ascent Guidance to get into orbit \u0026lt;or do so manually, your call\u0026gt; with the ship\u0026lt;s\u0026gt; you plan to learn to dock with, then, once it circularizes you in orbit, use the rendezvous planner/autopilot to have it set up a rendezvous with your targeted vessel \u0026lt;ascent guidance can launch you into a rendezvous position as well, either into the same exact orbit, or above/below depending on how you set up the target altitude, or it can just launch you into the target vessels plane\u0026gt;. ONCE it has you at say 100m of the target, then, have it commence docking via the docking autopilot, sit back and watch and learn the entire way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E OH, btw, make sure you are trying to dock 2 ports of the SAME SIZE, clamp-o-tron to clamp-o-tron, sr to sr jr to jr.

Once you have docking down, the next step is making sure that you have a rocket capable of launching a full orange fuel tank up to your desired orbit. If you can launch something that heavy, nothing else will be a problem as long as you have the patience. Start working on some powerful rockets and put up that tank, then build a little station around it. In my opinion, make the tank easy to replace or refuel when the fuel runs out.
