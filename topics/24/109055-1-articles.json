(Do I need to reinstall the game?)\n\nBackground:\n\nThe reason I ask is that I use a Dvorak keyboard layout, not a Sholes (\u0027QWERTY\u0027) one. As a result, I\u0027ve been spending a lot of time in \u0027Settings\u0027, reconfiguring the key bindings. And I\u0027ve been encountering Some Strange Things[1]. I\u0027m currently planning to plug in a Sholes layout keyboard just for use with KSP -- but for that to make sense, I\u0027d have to undo all of the (many) key bindings changes I\u0027ve made...\n\nThanks for any help you\u0027re able to provide.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n[1] for instance:\n\n\u002B settings claims that the \u0027take snapshot\u0027 key is \u0027F1\u0027 -- but it\u0027s not; it\u0027s F12 (?)\n\n\u002B the \u0027space\u0027 key is set (by default) in [settings \u003E Input \u003E Flight \u003E Other] for both \u0027Launch/ Stages\u0027 and \u0027Switch Translation/Rotation\u0027. Given that the \u0027space\u0027 key tends to break the ship into bits at various points in a mission, when I first saw the overload on this key I thought \u0027that\u0027s scary\u0027[2]. And although the UI seems to imply that it should be possible to select which modes the space key works in, the pretty \u0027Use in Mode\u0027 lights, while they go out when I click on them and click \u0027Accept\u0027, they don\u0027t actually stay unlit: when I go and look at them again, they\u0027re still shining brightly.\n\n[2] ... and I was right to be afraid: after completing the \u0027Orbiting 101\u0027 training mission -- after the point Gene Kerman leaves me to my own devices -- switching to \u0027Docking\u0027 mode and pressing space twice both toggles the \u0027control mode\u0027 **and** separates the capsule from the engine. In space, nodoby can hear the kerbals scream...\n\nPS\n\nVersion info:\n\nKSP v1.0.2.842 via Steam\n\nWindoze 8.1\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T15:48:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 03:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pendant**\n  \nAdded some version info"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T16:08:58Z","Content":"If you\u0027re wanting to reset all control bindings to default, open up your KSP\\_Win folder (if you have steam then you can ask someone how to get to that) and at the bottom there will be a settings.cfg. delete that and restart the game.

Most notably, the \u0027Use in Mode\u0027 on/off \u0027lights\u0027 for the \u0027space\u0027 key aren\u0027t all now on (prior to this reset, they were all on -- hence the disastrous mission I referred to above -- and I\u0027m almost positive I\u0027ve never successfully changed any of those \u0027lights\u0027 at any point). So perhaps the Steam update system left some garbage behind from my earlier version. I note that the readme.txt (in the same directory folder) says \u0027Completely revised Input Mapping system\u0027 as of v1.0.0.\n\nMaybe this would be of interest to other Steam and/or Dvorak users.\n\nThanks again!\n\nPS screenshot is still on F12 though... weird\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T16:49:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pendant**\n  \ntypo on filepath"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T16:49:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E PS screenshot is still on F12 though... wierd\n\nSteam screenshots (for every game) use F12 by default, KSP also comes with it\u0027s own screenshot system (which puts it in it\u0027s own directory), for non-steam users mostly, which uses F1."},{"CreatedByName":"pendant","CreatedById":143841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T16:53:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Steam screenshots (for every game) use F12 by default, KSP also comes with it\u0027s own screenshot system (which puts it in it\u0027s own directory), for non-steam users mostly, which uses F1.\n\nThanks.
