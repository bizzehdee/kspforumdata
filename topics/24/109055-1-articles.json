As a result, I\u0027ve been spending a lot of time in \u0027Settings\u0027, reconfiguring the key bindings. And I\u0027ve been encountering Some Strange Things[1]. I\u0027m currently planning to plug in a Sholes layout keyboard just for use with KSP -- but for that to make sense, I\u0027d have to undo all of the (many) key bindings changes I\u0027ve made...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help you\u0027re able to provide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E___\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] for instance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B settings claims that the \u0027take snapshot\u0027 key is \u0027F1\u0027 -- but it\u0027s not; it\u0027s F12 (?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B the \u0027space\u0027 key is set (by default) in [settings \u0026gt; Input \u0026gt; Flight \u0026gt; Other] for both \u0027Launch/ Stages\u0027 and \u0027Switch Translation/Rotation\u0027. Given that the \u0027space\u0027 key tends to break the ship into bits at various points in a mission, when I first saw the overload on this key I thought \u0027that\u0027s scary\u0027[2].
