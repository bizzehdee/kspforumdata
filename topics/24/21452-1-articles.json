New to these forums. Just got KSP 0.17 after playing the demo. I need help. I\u0027m a little confused. There is a lot of stuff. Also, it\u0027s really hard to make a good spaceship! I usually just put a few fuel tanks and a few liquid thrusters on them and that\u0027s it. Could you help me make a way better one? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T05:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat sort of trouble are you having? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA basic rocket needs a capsule, a fuel tank, and an engine, and that\u0027s all, though it won\u0027t go very far, and the pilot won\u0027t survive the trip. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo keep the pilot alive, put a decoupler under the capsule and a parachute on top of the capsule.
