No puns there! The creators have really made a unique and absolutely fun game based on science and NASA! I am learning stuff! I play allot of Table Top and Board Games which take up most of my spare time but I get as much Kerbal time as possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have a sandbox game going on for testing vehicles that I want to use in Science and Career modes. I know that seems like a cheat but I have had to restart Science and Career modes a few times due to running out of funds and science and it is a good way to practice launching vehicles. Perhaps I am doing something wrong but I have not really made allot of progress in those modes to make restarting a game an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The main question I have here on the intro threads is what is the bast way to search for an answer to specific missions or challenges in career mode? Should I just search for the mission itself in the search fields? I assume that most of the questions for missions have already been answered and instead of asking it again in the forums I thought I could just search for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T21:03:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe forum search is not very good so it\u0027s best to read the thread titles in Gameplay Questions And Tutorials for specific questions.

You start with \u0022launch a new spacecraft\u0022 - do you have a problem with that? \u0022Reach an altitude of 5,000 meters\u0022 - not a problem, right? \u0022Get into orbit\u0022 - may well want to read about the difference between getting into space and getting into orbit. Part-test contracts \u0027in flight\u0027 cause quite a bit of confusion, you\u0027ll find several threads about them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr are you looking for someone else\u0027s vehicles? My tutorial (link in signature) goes through 30-odd vehicle and 50-something mission designs in a logical order. For sandbox, not career, since the tech-tree in that doesn\u0027t make any sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blastercrazy","CreatedById":127772,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T21:43:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am looking for is essentially a walk through for each of the contracts.

However one of the contracts that has me stumped at the beginning is testing the booster on the ground. Is it as simple as building a basic rocket and setting it off? Seeing as how it starts on the ground would that trigger completion of that contract? Or do I have to wait until I unlock the launch stability and support gantry? Probably not the correct description but it is the red crane looking device that locks the rocket on place. I figure that would allow me to just place the gantry on the vehicle with the booster or engine attached and set them off but not release the gantry.
