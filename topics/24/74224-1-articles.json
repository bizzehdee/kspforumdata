I bought it when when the previous version was out ( I think?). I played vanilla career mode and managed to accomplish a lot before my save got erased/lost when I switched my OS to a SSD. I was pretty far up the tech tree and landed on the Mun twice before that happened. I stopped playing for awhile after that happened because I didn\u0027t want to go through all the work again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I just play sandbox mode using mods and set goals for myself. I have been currently working on a Space shuttle-like craft for the past 2 weeks using mainly trial and error. It looks kind of crude and now I am just trying to make the whole thing more efficient. However, I finally got it into orbit last night, docked with a fuel tank (which turned out to be a waste of time btw), and it is now orbiting the Mun, without using an autopilot program (nothing against users that prefer to use it). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also got a few friends into it as well so I can\u0027t wait until multiplayer comes out!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T22:02:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello owmanthathurt, and welcome to the forum. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrial and error is just how one learns this game.
