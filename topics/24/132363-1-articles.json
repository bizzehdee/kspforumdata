The start of my career, having no experience with KSP, was tough. Many failed launches, a poor Kerbonaut lost(R.I.P. Jeb), and many a fail orbit. Just yesterday I recieved a little bit of science I could scrape off of one last Mun orbit, to get the upgrades I felt necessary for a Mun Landing. The ship went through 2 variations, that ended in utter failure, until I came to this design. It was perfect, and glorious to behold, a modern marvel for Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Jlxz8Jh\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/Jlxz8Jh\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Jlxz8Jh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/Jlxz8Jh\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch went smoothly, I got into orbit with fuel to spare. I was able to get a trajectory on the Mun, and I propelled myself onward. Once arriving to the Mun I realized that my solar panels had been away from the sun during the warp, I was using a OCT to pilot as I had a scientist onboard, and my SAS was out of power. Crap. I had to turn the ship using my precious RCS reserves to face the sun, catch just as much sunlight as I could, and engage my SAS. It was a success and I was placed in my orbit around the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I planned my descent I started to realize that my ship was pulling in one direction. I couldn\u0027t figure out why. The descent to the Mun was tricky. Constantly fighting against my tilting ship and limited SAS use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iA0lvMB\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/iA0lvMB\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/iA0lvMB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/iA0lvMB\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI finally got it landed to realise that one of the fuel lines feeding into my central tank was not working. The outside tank was full of precious fuel that I needed for my return trip. I quickly scoured the web looking for answers when I found that I could upgrade my facilities to allow fuel transfer. I was saved!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI transferred the fuel into the central tank, planted my flag, and grabbed a soil sample (came with the facility upgrade too =D). I then decoupled my landing gear and shot myself towards Kerbin, running out of fuel in literally the last second of my burn =S\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut after a long stressful flight I made it back to Kerbin, I didn\u0027t burn up on reentry, and splashed down safely.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Bn5qLgi\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/Bn5qLgi\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Bn5qLgi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/Bn5qLgi\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EaD20dy\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/EaD20dy\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/EaD20dy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/EaD20dy\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis nice mission snagged me a cool 300 Science, the most science I have ever seen =D, and cost me close to 40k.
