Engineering...so contemplating approaching from a KSP Aerospace Test and Development.\u00A0 While really interested in the full monty Career mode, I think it doesn\u0027t allow me to follow an iterative, progressive growth like was experienced in the real Space Race of the 50\u0027s, 60\u0027s, 70\u0027s...developing expertise and knowledge...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut here is the issue...new to Linux (Mint) and just getting my mind wrapped around that, and then decide to take up the challenge of installing KSP...and encountering difficulties...any assistance, guidance, words of wisdom, ancient Kerbal proverbs would be appreciated\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-20T19:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello

it.\u00A0\u00A0 It\u0027s probably easiest if you just extract it straight to your Home folder.\u00A0 The folder should be KSP_linux.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside that folder should look
