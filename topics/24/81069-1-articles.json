Others find joy in throwing ships at mind-numbing speeds and velocities towards other planets, or even simply around Kerbin. Some others still simply enjoy the creative and artistic side of launching crafts and sightseeing the Kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI make the tiniest working probes possible and launch as many as possible towards stuff on a single rocket. Nothing makes me happier than docking half-tonne RCS-free satellites above the Minmus, or delivering little Xenon shipments to a noodle-thin refuelling station in low Kerban orbit. If anything does make me happier, it\u0027s making things more challenging and intricate.

(They make a hexagon configuration.) It still has a little life after Kerbol sets and rarely eats any charge at all during space flight, even at full throttle.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T00:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy minimalistic do you mean low parts or compact ships\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso welcome to the forums\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommander jebidiah\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TDOB","CreatedById":118268,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T00:36:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Commander Jebidiah\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Commander Jebidiah\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBy minimalistic do you mean low parts or compact ships\u003Cp\u003EAlso welcome to the forums\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommander jebidiah\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EBoth, technically.
