I enjoy this game very much and have a strong interest in the cosmos. More importantly, I am terrible at this game. I hope to learn some while on these forums because I must be missing something while watching youtube tutorials. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my past time I enjoy taking photos, making music and creating graphics on photoshop. Maybe I can bring a few of my skills and help someone with a mod in the future. I would really like to help create some custom music for the game (but it seems that this is nearly impossible from what I looked up). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to meeting more of you around the forums. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a good day and new year!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T06:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Aningaaq. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/15-Gameplay-Questions-and-Tutorials\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis \u003C/a\u003Eis a good place to look for tips, or post questions of your own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
