If all you want to do is rotate the apsis then that can be accomplished by simply doing burns in the \u002B/- direction of motion, this will raise/lower your apsis as well though. You can compensate for that though by doing burns that compensate upwards or downwards, depending on whether you are decreasing or increasing your velocity (respectively). Vertical (\u002B/-) can also be used, but this tends to \u0027rotate\u0027 your orbit about your present position, and can quickly drive your apoapsis into a Kerbin escape trajectory and drive your periapsis into the surface. Orbital planes are way easier though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
