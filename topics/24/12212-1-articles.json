I\\\u0027m not a very good writer so I probably can\\\u0027t write a very good introduction other than: I play games, eat, go on the shitter and sleep and go to school. Thankfully not in that order but you should get the concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for my questions about the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Boosters\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I make them detatch as soon as their fuel is dry? Actually, how can I make them detatch like a normal stage? I\\\u0027ve seen Robbaz do it a couple times. I have no idea what the mod for these special boosters are but it should be the same for all, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2.

All my ships end up being wobbly wobbly wobble woom sham biggedobyy before exploding and mushing together with the capsule killing all my Kerbanauts making the mission a complete failure?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.b How do I make a big ship? What are good tactics, what should I think of when making a successful one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.c Sometimes when my ship moves extremely fast and I try to detach a stage the latter stage hits the earlier stage and often this results in a \u0027kerblamm\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.derp How do I make a moon lander on top of a larger rocket that somehow is capsuled inside a nosecone or something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat ought to be it.
