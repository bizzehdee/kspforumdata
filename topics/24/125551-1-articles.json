What is being restored as if the failed launch did not happen? I can see the contract/achievments seemed to be saved. It seems (I have not noted the exact numbers) that my science benefit for each re-run lessens. But the poor pilot is woken from the dead. What is the game-play list of restored/kept?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 2: The reputation/fund is totally unclear (too brief/small in the demo). When are funds deducted, when earned? What does reputation do? Just a brief summary will do fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T21:42:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, I\u0027ll try to answer the second question first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunds are deducted when you launch a rocket. Parts cost money to make, so naturally rockets cost money to launch. That is the only time money is deducted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can earn funds a few ways. First, by completing a contract. Just like in real life, you get money for following a contract. Second, by accepting a contract with an \u0022advance.\u0022 When you are low on funds, this can help you build a new ship to make more money. Third, by recovering a ship and its resources. The closer you are to the runway or launchpad, the more funds you get from recovering your ship. You get 100% of your cost back if you recover a ship from the runway or launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReputation is a measure of how well known your space program is. It\u0027s a general way to keep track of public opinion. You can use some strategies to trade reputation for funds or science, and vice versa. It\u0027s a bad idea to go and kill your kerbals, because then your reputation goes down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know the exact list of what gets reset. However, the ship goes back to the pad (or runway), the clock goes back to the mission start, any contracts you complete are undone, and everything (I think) goes to the way it was at the start of the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes that answer your questions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
