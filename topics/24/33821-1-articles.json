I\u0027d say return trip from the Mun, but I was following a tutorial video, so that hardly counts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunniest moment, imagining this scene at Kerbin Space Command:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir, I have good news and bad news... the good news is, the nuclear engine test was a success!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Great! ... what\u0027s the bad news?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well... we kind of forgot any batteries and didn\u0027t extend the solar panels... so the RGU died at full burn while orbit-correcting. The test frame is currently on its way past the Mun and looks to be escaping Kerbin entirely before it runs out of fuel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO, random stuff out of the way, I\u0027ve got a couple questions. Firstly, I\u0027ve been running stock everything to learn how the game works, but I\u0027m curious about mods. Are there any that are considered pretty universal for use? I know almost everyone seems to use MekJeb, but what about others? I\u0027d really like to avoid anything that\u0027s at all overpowered, but variety is nice. I\u0027ve seen \u0022Kethane\u0022 get mentioned a lot?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I\u0027m having issues with heavy-lifting. A six-way asparagus-staged system (3 pairs of large tanks \u002B mainsails) is the best I\u0027ve managed, but it\u0027s horribly unstable, both while staging (boom), and with spinning badly during burn. Besides-which, the entire concept of asparagus-staging, while clever and efficent, sort of strikes me as a kludge, and a sort of exploit to the lack of proper drag calculations. Any good recommendations for lifter designs, or where to get started?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(not-a-spambot-#1)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T21:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Initar","CreatedById":69353,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T12:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHellow fellow kerbonaut!

But the list is endless, you can find pretty much any thing you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout asparagus staging, it\u0027s kind of legit, although very hard to do IRL (there\u0027s a thread about this somewhere). Don\u0027t mind the spinning too much, it\u0027s harmless and actually pretty usefull when you jetison your boosters.
