Downloaded the demo, and fiddled around. Within the hour I was happily orbiting in a small ship, with no fuel or means to get back, but hey, I achieved space travel. Wasn\u0027t long before I was attempting the mun landing, and this was before I learned what a prograde/retrograde marker were, so lets say landing while traveling 100m/s horizontally doesn\u0027t work. And after a few youtube tutorials, docking and landing came with ease. Small mun outposts and LKO refueling stations now setup, though I still haven\u0027t attempted interplanetary travel. Seems like a major milestone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking for ideas on how to spice it up, or is it all just launching, orbiting, and landing now?
