I\u0027ve also tried a Stock Wiki to create my own sections but its not a complete wiki.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have searched and searched and I\u0027m stunned not to find someone has designed all the launches/sections in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe i missed it in my search. can anyone point me in the right direction?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe i can fix the bugs in international contruction ISS in kerbal orbit project. My engines show a strange thrust graphic out the side and wont launch. also the game seems to think my craft is a space plane as thats the only option to return to the space plane center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW.

I just now realized that all sections are seperate part options. So i can launch everything. Anyone else having trouble. i re-downloaded the newest KSP and it seems to work perfectly now with the ISS download i mention above. This post can actually be deleted.
