I have played KSP for about a month now, but only recently did i join the community. So far, \\\u0027tis great fun. I am currently working on a ship to get to the mun (which thanks to C7 i have almost accomplished). Does anyone here have tips on fuel efficiency and/or slimming down rockets? Thanks, and Kodspeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JupiterII","CreatedById":8029,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-25T18:06:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! You can use less fuel to get into orbit by only firing at your apoapsis. It has a larger effect on your periapsis, so you use less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-25T18:08:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathlord123","CreatedById":10998,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-26T02:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JupiterII\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JupiterII\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!

My rocket seems to have an apoapsis that goes out to munar distances, yet it goes out farther than i can go. I waste all my fuel trying to get into an orbit, and i then end up very far from apoapsis, with my periapsis still inside kerbin, and i would have to wait a good while to get to apoapsis, at which point i am totally out of fuel, and can\\\u0027t make a burn. How on kerbin i got into that kind of orbit, i have no clue. Heck, this is probably just a total freak accident. I\\\u0027ll be testing this again soon. Also, run-on sentence is run-on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JupiterII","CreatedById":8029,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-26T03:14:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deathlord123\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deathlord123\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, but i have a slight issue.
