The bottleneck is when lots of parts have to have the physics calculated which is a game issue at present. Your system will be best at graphic intensive FPS games specifically designed for gaming computers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, the two advantages of custom built systems is 1. getting items that fit your specs, and 2. no crapware to deal with that gums up the operating system wasting CPU time and memory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T13:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn another note you could leave the graphics card out since the A10 is an APU which has a GPU built on to the processor.
