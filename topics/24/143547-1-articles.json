On the next try, to see if I could do it again, I got my periapsis down to 6 km. Never for a moment allowing for an atmosphere. The result was ultimate G lithobraking. Oh well. I had some fuel left to try to slow down, but before I could use that, I already crashed. So here is my question. Is \u0022sea level\u0022 on Duna (and the Mun and Minmus) the lowest point on the surface? I\u0027ve lost a number of ships to mountains. I vaguely remember sea level on Mars IRL to be the average height of the entire planet (could be wrong!) and I assumed that to be the case in the game as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T13:23:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongratulations on getting to Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Wiki\u003C/a\u003E Duna\u0027s lowest elevation is at 124 m above sea level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen attempting to land I always try for the lowest area possible to maximize the effectiveness of \u0027chutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dutchy45","CreatedById":158638,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T15:54:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks Starhawk,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt kind of does n\u0027t make sense, 124 m above.

Then when you\u0027re aerobraking make sure to check and see if your trajectory hits the ground. You should use rockets to slow down before deploying your chutes, and you\u0027ll most likely need them again at landing because unless you have as many chutes as there are parts on your ship you\u0027ll probably be going too fast! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0Protip: Never trust KSP\u0027s altimeter while landing anywhere or while aerobraking at Duna. You won\u0027t know exactly how high you are above the ground unless you\u0027re just over Minmus\u0027 flats, or Kerbin or Laythe\u0027s oceans. You should take a screenshot when you\u0027ve landed successfully! (F12 via Steam, I think it\u0027s F2 in stock, might be F1 though.)
