And perhaps was moddable as well. And of course now I find out that such a game exists and is completely awesome!!! :-) Honestly, I\u0027m not sure why I merely added this to my Steam queue when I first heard about it, instead of buying it immediately. Over the past 3\u002B weeks, I\u0027ve been either playing KSP, watching KSP videos, or lurking on the forums here, with every spare moment I could grab (including some moments well past my bed time) -- and loving every moment of it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got the basics down: I can launch and rendezvous and dock and reenter. I\u0027ve done a few Munar flybys, mostly with Ion probes, but haven\u0027t tried landing anything there yet (or sending anything outside of Kerbin\u0027s SoI). If my attempts at powered vertical landings on Kerbin are any guide, I\u0027ve still got a ways to go before I master that particular skill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince pictures are nice, here\u0027s my first attempt at creating a space station, \u003Cem\u003EKalamazoo\u003C/em\u003E. Built and launched in two pieces (not counting the fuel tanker docked on the far left). Pretty modest, I know, and there\u0027s no Sr. Docking Ports, but I\u0027m still proud of it. With the recently-attached manned section, it can house 8 Kerbals, but currently only has 7. There\u0027s an empty spot for Jeb when he gets back from the first manned Munar flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i201.photobucket.com/albums/aa215/cph9fa/2013-07-04_00002.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-07-04_00002.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I may not continue that game, since I\u0027ve just started a fresh game where I\u0027m using RemoteTech, ISA Mapsat, and (eventually) Kethane (along with several other mods). I\u0027ve established my comsat network, and mapped Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I\u0027m also a C# developer, I\u0027m looking forward to trying my hand at creating some mods as well. And I hear that 0.21 is coming out soon, too!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T17:25:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!

Because of it\u0027s proximity, it\u0027s pretty easy to go from LKO to a Munar encounter. Then along the way you can adjust for a pretty low PE, and with the lack of atmosphere, you can have a very low orbit, so the distance that your lander actually has to descend can be minimized. Because of the low gravity, landing can be a bit difficult, but at the same time, if you\u0027ve got too much vertical speed to land, it\u0027s easy enough to gain altitude and try again. These are just my findings. The fine folks on this forum are very helpful if you have any questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rockhem","CreatedById":57141,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T19:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is funny, this is also the exact game i always thought about years ago, i saw a youtube comment that said \u0022Kerbal Space Pro- (instinct takes over, stops the video and looks for a KSP vid) then i found kurtjmac\u0027s video, watched about 60 seconds of it and then downloaded the demo (i never made it to the mun in demo though.....)
