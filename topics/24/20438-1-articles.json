Well.... \u0022Space Badger\u0022 here, but that\u0027s because one of the faux Badgers got here before me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E (They\u0027re all over the place you know!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thrilled to have finally taken the plunge and dipped my toes into the addictive waters of \u0022KSP\u0022, having tried the demo ages ago and determined it was definitely worth keeping my eye on. I\u0027ve only been playing v1.7 since yesterday, but it\u0027s obvious already that \u0022KSP\u0022 is going to be one of those perennial games which just stays on my hard drive forever, while others come and go as the mood grabs me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInspired by the videos of Jef Major, I decided to take at least a few steps toward mastering flight within the atmosphere of Kerbal, before trying to get all \u0022Houston we have a problem\u0022 and have already spent hours designing by the seat of my pants (because I have little clue about this kind of thing) trying to create something which might reach Kerbal\u0027s northern pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI optimistically christened my project \u0022Pole Dancer\u0022, but quickly discovered that my real talent seemed to be in sending innocent Kerbals to horrible deaths and I had no idea how to even create something which would take off, let alone fly a distance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pole Dancer 1\u0022 blew up on the runway when I started the engine! \u0022Pole Dancer\u0027s\u0022 2 \u0026amp; 3 started moving... but then span, tumbled and exploded! Oh Kerbals... I am so very sorry! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pole Dancer 4\u0022 was something of a breakthrough. True it never took off, but it \u0022did\u0022 hold a straight course right down the runway... before exploding at the end of it. But that Kerbal gave his life to expand our knowledge hugely and that is probably what I\u0027ll be telling his wife and kids. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pole Dancer 5\u0022 was the first to actually achieve lift off and here at Badger Towers we cheered wildly, right up until it plunged into the sea!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pole Dancer 6\u0022 avoided getting its feet wet, by displaying an exiting ability to actually make a turn..... kind of. For a moment I thought I might be able to bring it back to the runway... but no. Another smoking hole in the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings us to date and the fantastic breakthrough of \u0022Pole Dancer 7\u0022! (I\u0027m not to clever with the internet stuff, but if I\u0027ve done this right you should see a picture of \u0022PD7\u0022 below.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i609.photobucket.com/albums/tt178/GreyBadger/Poledancer7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Poledancer7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022PD7\u0022 has exceeded my wildest expectations! The take off procedure requires some..... finesse to accomplish , but once in the air she is turnable, climb and descendable... why she\u0027s flyable for goodness sake! Not exactly what you\u0027d call stable, pretty tricky to keep in a straight line and I\u0027m not sure she\u0027s landable, but that\u0027s because I ran out of time on my test flight last night and couldn\u0027t work out how to save a flight ion progress, so I have yet top worry about bringing her down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan she reach the pole? Maybe....maybe not. One big problem I have at the moment is not being able to work out from the map view, which direction I am flying in and I don\u0027t seem able to find a way to set a waypoint. But as Lex Luthor once said, \u0022North Miss Tessmacher!\u0022 I suppose if I try to keep flying as close to 00 degrees as possible, I can\u0027t go far wrong....... can I? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you in space fellas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBadger Out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PhNon","CreatedById":51754,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T14:47:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! I too am a recent recruit into the Kerbal Space Adventuring family, and I feel your pain in trying to get a jet off the runway. It seems your persistence has paid off though so congratulations! I resigned myself to editing a premade jet for my first fly around \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E It helped me get used to shaping the jets and also helped me get a handle on how they fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I might offer some advice, a larger control platform at the posterior section of the wings would help you gain more lift as well as increasing flight stability! Don\u0027t be afraid to use the \u0022SAS\u0022 options too; Heavens know I can barely fly without them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for your question, there\u0027s no way to plot waypoints with stock parts or interfaces, but there may be something regarding that in the addons section of the forums.
