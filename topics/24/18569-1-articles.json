I\u0027ve been playing the demo for a few months and I must say I\u0027ve been having a blast! (at the expense of a -few- kerbonauts).

So here I am, at this very moment downloading the full version after buying it! Now I can truly enjoy the wonders of kerbal space with no restrictions. I\u0027m a teacher of English Second Language (hence my english proficiency) thus I know nothing of rocket science.
