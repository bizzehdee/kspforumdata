I tried my hand on Orbiter a few years ago but it was a bit too complicated for me. I didn\u0027t have enough time to learn it all. Then I saw an ad for KSP on Steam, did some research and paid up! (Didn\u0027t get the steam version, bought it directly from this site).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve played with this for a few days now and thought I\u0027d head over to the forum to say hi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still getting to know the various tools, what all the parts do etc. So far I can easily get into orbit. I\u0027ve also placed a satellite around Kerbin and the Mun. Both are very poorly placed though. Might need to scrap them and do it again, or just leave as a memory of early space travel and it\u0027s failures \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I just finished placing a rove on the Mun. I chose not to read up on any manuals or use the existing designs. I wanted to learn from scratch. It wasn\u0027t pretty, but after a few tries I got there! The hardest part was to get enough fuel to get the thing into Orbit around kerbin and still have enough to get to the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the story of my first Mun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/35mnl35.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002235mnl35.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally the Rover with all \u0022stuff\u0022 powered on. I have no idea what all of them do...I just piled on all the parts in the Science Category \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. It probably isn\u0027t even a great design, but at least it\u0027s MY design, not copied from anyone and the thing works!! I\u0027ve got 4 mini radial engines on there and a full tank of fuel. Hmm...looking at the picture I\u0027ve only got 2!!!! The other 2 was probably ripped off during the lander separation!. Crap. My plan was that if I ever get a station orbiting the Mun perhaps I would be able to lift off, refuel and move the Rover to a different planet. Just a thought.....might not have worked...and it certainly won\u0027t work with only 2 rockets! Oh well, trial and error \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/2vshwuo.png\u0022 alt=\u00222vshwuo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext on the program is a a few geostationary satellites and then the biggie...an ISS style space station for refuelling, science and other cool stuff.
