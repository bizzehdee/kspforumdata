It was only once they had achieved Mun orbit that Kerbol Space Command realized there was not a spare seat for Erble LOL. As with the first landing, horizontal speed over the ground seems difficult for the Kerbonaughts to manually control. Maneuvering thrusters achieved a landing trajectory 4.2km from Erble\u0027s marooned ship and the rescue craft came down towards the Mun at 19m/s or maybe that was horizontal speed (that\u0027s the difficult part). The rescue ship cartwheeled across the ground coming to a landing on its side. All 3 kerbonaughts survived, but are now also marooned with Erble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH=CONFIG]31478[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]31479[/ATTACH][ATTACH=CONFIG]31480[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RIGAMORTIS -AGW-","CreatedById":38925,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T08:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, after much frustration with horizontal motion, I landed a rather heavy ship on the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH=CONFIG]31708[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T10:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust to point out; you\u0027ll only ever need on ASAS. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe normal SAS can be stacked for effect, though, if you\u0027re having stability troubles.
