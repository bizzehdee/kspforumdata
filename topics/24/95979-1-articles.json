I have been inspired by mods like B9 Aerospace that enhance the overall look and feel of vehicles in the game, and would like to learn how to make my own parts. I have a design background and plenty of practice with modeling and texturing under my belt, so my plan is to work on gaining a better understanding of how parts work in-game. I\u0027ve been pointed towards some great resources here for getting started. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then maybe I\u0027ll finally go to Duna.

Sounds awesome! Now, I\u0027ve only made planet packs (add-ons that add more celestial bodies to KSP), but personally I believe that is a great place for someone to start.

I use Mechjeb myself for helping automate launch windows and controlling attitude on more complex rockets. Both of these can be found on Curse (a place that is great for many games that use Steam and even a few that don\u0027t). I am starting out with just Mechjeb for awhile so I can get a feel for the vanilla game but I hope to mess around with ever more complex ones as I progress through the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
