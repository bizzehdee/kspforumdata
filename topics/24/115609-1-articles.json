First off, are you running on a Mac? If so, the function keys are bound to OS stuff like volume, display brightness, etc. if that\u0027s the case, you\u0027ll want to press Fn and then F1. There\u0027s also a setting under Keyboard in System Preferences that swaps the function keys, in other words meaning that to access the special functions you press Fn, and the keys work like normal function keys. If you run Windows or Linux, or if this isn\u0027t the problem, another solution is to rebind the screenshot key (do this in Settings \u0026gt; Controls \u0026gt; Game) to something like a numpad key or one of the keys on the edge of the keyboard like ~ or \\. (Everything else is taken by the controls. This game is complicated.) If all else fails, try reinstalling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T19:14:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t resort to a reinstall.
