It was the pinnacle of a series of events, that saw the first soft landing on, and recover from, the moon Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It was an unsheduled event during development testflights of the \u0027Crazyrocket\u0027 program. Though both MegarocketZ2 and Munrocket_C5 are still highly viable and capable lifting vehicles, potentially able to put a lander in a moon orbit, Dr Vermil Kerman, head of the space program, decided to apply the learnings to an entirely new rocket project, aiming at putting an as heavy as possible load into very low orbit around Mun or Minmus. Progressive testflights and modifications followed. The testflights almost always ended up in orbit around Mun or Minmus, since that was the design target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it came around that CrazyrocketD, piloted by Kenbus Kerman, a highly respected astronaut, ended up in a circular 7000m orbit around Minmus with a spectacularly healthy fuel budget. Not only did the last stage have both a FL-T400 and a FL-T100 tank for 25% extra fuel, but also the penultimate stage was still operational and had decent amount of fuel left. Probably enough for the return trip without using the last stage. The last stage was however only marginally equipped as a lander, featuring only three primitive landing struts, precauriously tall due to the extra fuel tank, and void of ladder, any extra control, science or electricity setup. So positive was the fuel situation, that a landing was contemplated, the fuel-paranoic Dr Vermil Kerman for once at ease. The electricity situation, however, was something different. Battery charge was low. No extra battery technology or solar panels invented yet. It became clear that to succeed and return, utmost maneuvering economy must be achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDr Vermil finally suggested the return flight should be made without an attempt to land, science points be used to develop solar panels and larger batteries for a future attempt. At that moment, Jebediah Kerman is rumoured to have snatched the microphone and yelled: - Go for it Kenbus!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever may be, fact is that Kenbus successfully landed CrazyrocketD on Minmus Greater Flats, planted the flag and cavorted around before boarding again and successfully launching the return flight. On re-entry, the Minmus lander still retained 75% of its fuel. Something Dr Vermil predicts will give credence to plans for a future Mun landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
