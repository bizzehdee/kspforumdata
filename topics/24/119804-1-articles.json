Starting to get pretty good at some stuff. I have modified some components for my needs, and am trying to figure out the parts needed to make a 12 sided ring space station. Attempted to modify the length only of some parts, but still don\u0027t have a solution for my center hub of a station, to get the right spoke lengths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I am currently playing with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i181.photobucket.com/albums/x262/Wild_Cobra/Kerbal/Station%20004%20experiment_zps17capglm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Station%20004%20experiment_zps17capglm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you notice, I have one passenger module oriented differently than the rest. I figured I will rotate all of them, and rotate the station for artificial gravity. Don\u0027t know if it will handle the speed needed for 1 G, but any gravity is better than none, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying different ideas with the solar panel orientations. Probably make them all in the final station like the ones on the odd-ball passenger module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice I left fuel tanks and engines! I figure I\u0027ll refuel the tanks, and take her for a spin around the kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T13:24:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Wild Cobra, and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s station is very impressive.
