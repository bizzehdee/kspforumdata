I had no idea the game would be as in depth as it is. It is so deceiving to look at on steam. I am so happy I did. I haven\u0027t been addicted to a computer game in quite awhile and I can\u0027t stop trying new stuff lol. Without looking at any tutorials and just deciding to jump in and see what I could learn I decided go big or go home... lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to make a space shuttle type ship with a huge rocket with boosters to get into space. I never made it into space until my third version of the ship and rocket. That was after many failed attempts. I finally got into space but couldn\u0027t get into orbit, it just went out to space and its trajectory brought it back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was here I realized I needed a tutorial on how to make a stable orbit so I gave in and watched one on how to do so and I\u0027m glad I did, I don\u0027t think I would have figured that one out lol. Finally with my fifth version of the ship and rocket I was able to get into space, create a stable orbit, orbit the planet and re-enter and land. totally addicting and the options are crazy limitless. It took the fifth version because carrying the ship itself was heavy, I had to counter the weight on the opposite side, and no matter what I did I just could not get the right balance of weight and fuel require to get me there. After SO many attempts I finally got it down, regulating the speed on the way up, using two stages of rocket and two stages of ship propulsion. It was pretty cool releasing that last stage with just my little starship orbiting the earth. After the orbit I made a new trajectory that would put me in a decaying orbit and bring me back down to the surface, made my burn using the last of the tiny fuel I had and came down. Amazing feeling of accomplishment when I got done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECannot wait to do more with this game. Figuring out how to build a space station in orbit, building ships out there, flying to other places, etc. Not even sure what is possible vs what isn\u0027t in game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer mode isn\u0027t working yet is that correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdated with a picture of my Mark V:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimage.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/44kepaxuf/USK_Ellindar_Mark_V.png\u0022 alt=\u0022USK_Ellindar_Mark_V.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimage.org/app.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efree screenshot tool\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-14T22:13:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2013 10:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ellindar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chrisd857","CreatedById":57291,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T21:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout career mode: yes, you are correct.

That will change as science missions and communications are implemented as the game is developed.
