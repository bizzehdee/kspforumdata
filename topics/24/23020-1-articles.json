Then it slipped my mind completely, until recently, real life and all that. Then, by chance I witnessed it again, this time through the interesting tones of Scott Manley, his detailed and humorous explanations of the deeper potential of the game tweaked my interest. The demo was downloaded and many attempts were made to orbit, some spectacular failures, and eventually success. The first wobbly, egg shaped 300km Ap and 80km Pe was hailed in my mind as an enormous achievement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, on to the Mun. Having reached that goal, I immediately purchased the game, through the dreaded steam. I have not looked back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods became a reality of my game, parts packs mainly, just for some extra choices. Then toying with mechjeb and hydrojeb (the delightful irony of both being the amount of times I have to manually save the mission with them active. I love that honestly, seeing things start to go pear shaped, then jumping in with joystick and thrusters, quickly determining maneuvre nodes and timing..so much timing....). From these things I have learned orbital rendevous, manual docking and landing. I now have a working, and crewed Space station (after a bit of delicate EVA with Bill and Bob) in a nice 300km orbit of Kerbin, and have managed several Mun landings (with the crew actually making it home). I did strand Jeb on Duna for a little while...but that was really just a test flight to see what kind of ship I would need to design to get there and land and get home...a bit under-engineered that first effort. Good landing though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, anyway...Loving the game Wanted to say hi, and thanks to the Devs and the modding community here...Nice work people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it\u0027s back to the R\u0026amp;D division...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T17:07:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T18:02:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s quite the introduction sir, welcome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
