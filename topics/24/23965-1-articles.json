I\u0027m brand-spanking new around here and absolutely loving KSP. A week or so ago, an old online friend was broadcasting via twitch.tv. So while waiting for a Battlefield 3 battle to end on 21CW, I tuned in to his broadcast and saw that he was building a rocket of some sort. I messaged him asking what the heck he was doing and he informed me about KSP. After downloading the demo, I was forever hooked! I bought the full version that night and couldn\u0027t be happier!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to the dev team and all the people that support them and the game. I can\u0027t wait to virtually live out my childhood dreams and discover new ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I\u0027ve nailed orbits and landing on the Mun. Next I\u0027m trying Minmus and getting the first few pieces of an orbital refueling station up and running. Being a surveyor/miner in MANY other gamers, I\u0027m really looking forward to getting a story written up for my private sector mining company and seeing what mods are out there to support the story.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T15:07:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T20:30:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the community Dantes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck on your Minmus flight, and have fun writing your story, we\u0027d love to read it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
