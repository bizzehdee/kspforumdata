I thought I\\\u0027d join the forums now, and post a picture of my achievement. At least they survived the explosive landing.

You can use IKJL for forward back left right, and HN for up and down. You can use those to cancel out all of your horizontal velocity when trying to land, and slow down your vertical speed with your actual boosters. You shouldn\\\u0027t need to waist RCS fuel on boosting up and down with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Lander legs. Now with vanilla mod, there are no \u0027lander legs\u0027 That is why I suggest using Nova\\\u0027s mod (which also replaces all of the base parts). Now if you wish to stay with vanilla, which is understandable, you can make makeshift lander using 8 radial decouplers towards the bottom of your lander (using symmetry), and attaching large fins onto that. That makes for some decent makeshift lander legs, and are semi helpful to prevent your rocket from falling off, leaving you stranded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"schaef87","CreatedById":11238,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-16T14:15:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\\\u0027t use RCS because I did not know that you could us IKJL to control them...I thought they were a supplement to the SAS, so I thank you for that information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will now add Nova\\\u0027s mod for my next attempt.
