I found this forum when I was doing research to build better rockets. I have only played maybe about 15 hours and right now I am setting a goal of the moon. getting up to near orbit was easy and orbit took maybe 2 or 3 hours after that of play time. After that I wanted to go to the mun. my biggest problem with getting there is learning little details. so I just learned after watching a video that it was possible to rotate items in the VAB. I also saw a few other things in building that I am not sure how people did it but that is why I am here. So I suppose my first lander is going to be over ambitious since I want to land a kerbal and a rover at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xorth Tanovar","CreatedById":71205,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T15:59:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreetings, and welcome to the forums....anyone with the name of one of my favorite bands ranks high in my book! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to agree, the details are everything....so many times I\u0027ve sent something up, only to realize I\u0027ve forgotten something useful/critical (Rockomax large docking clamps on backwards was my favorite).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T23:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
