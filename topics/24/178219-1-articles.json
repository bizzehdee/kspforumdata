I had a pretty heavily modded game. Even made my own little mod that used stock parts I never used, like that damned engine that\u0027s described as an engine for ants lol...I liked to think of it as Kerbal Sci-fi...Basically modded some of the engines to have higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and more power so that I could have more sci-fi inspired stuff without it being so cheaty, aka I still needed fuel but I didn\u0027t have to build something so outrageous as to ruin a certain aesthetic I was going for in my game. I also added science parts to command modules and habitat like modules so that after a certain point, I wouldn\u0027t have experiments hanging off of everything I built, and added electric generators to some parts as to not have batteries all over.\u00A0 Even modded the weight on some parts so that the added stuff would at least add to the challenge.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question is\u00A0where do I even get started again? I\u0027ve downloaded the latest version 1.4.5 and the DLC...do I install 1.4.5 and then install the DLC or is the DLC a complete update in and of itself?\u00A0 Is there a newer version coming down the pipe I should wait and install and play then? I had A LOT of credits/money in game (enough I NEVER had to worry about cost of anything) and about 21 kerbals at least 3 star or above...Can you still mod the save file to bring yourself up to speed of the last game you played without having to start from the beginning? I had started playing with roverdudes\u0027 mods quite a bit...love the idea of colonizing and building a self sufficient colony on another world...are those mods still around??\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance for any advice\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-10T19:34:40Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2018 07:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by bsooner77\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Esentence\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-10T21:57:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223448849\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178219\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221536607937\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022123485\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bsooner77\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, bsooner77 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe devs\u00A0would updated it, it would break all the mods\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t need to update.\u00A0 If you have it in steam, simply disable automatic updates.\u00A0 You can also run parallel installs of multiple versions, so you can simply migrate your saves over when you have the newest version tested with your necessary mods.\u00A0 I still mainly play 1.3.1, but I also have 1.4.3 and 1.4.5 installs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223448849\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178219\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221536607937\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022123485\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bsooner77\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, bsooner77 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question is\u00A0where do I even get started again?
