I\u0027m very curious though, who here is an actual aerospace engineer or student? The game truly tailors to us, and there\u0027s got to be plenty on the dev team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got the demo, and although I could be happy playing just the demo for years, I wanted Squad to have my money so they could keep up the great work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s why I\u0027m posting. The honeymoon phase has ended, and I\u0027m beginning to really master the basic mechanics. I\u0027ve watched some great youtubes with awesome ideas, but I don\u0027t want to learn too much from others because of the thrill of my own discoveries. Later, when I understand more, I\u0027ll want to see everyone else\u0027s ideas, but right now I want to do my own legwork.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I would like some hints to point me in the right direction. There are two general questions I have, and if anyone could point me to a great guide I\u0027d really appreciate it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. How to I calculate the most efficient escape rout into Kerbal orbit? So far I\u0027ve just been shooting for the zenith and then widening out the trajectory to orbit, but I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a better way to angle the craft on the ascent. How do I know when and how much though?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What is the optimal purpose of solid boosters? In my experimentation, it seems to me the most efficient to use them only in the first stage, but I just love using them! At all times!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am willing to do the research, I just want some insiders\u0027 opinions on the best research material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to joining the community and contributing in some way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev/r\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECowboy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T17:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the community Flawless_Cowboy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I can\u0027t answer the first as I use trial and (lots of) error, I can give you my thoughts on SRB\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are intended to help get heavier craft off the launchpad, and ideally they can be used to get a craft up to and over the first 100m/s where liquid engines are less efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the restrictions are arbitrary, you can also use them for the transfer burn to other planets and back, some people have managed to use them for landing (not usually in one piece though)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes KSP so much fun is that we are not restricted in the use of these parts, so players are free to experiment and to create new uses for parts that others might not think of trying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRB\u0027s have also been used successfully as aircraft propulsion, for escape systems, fireworks and weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is really only limited to what you can imagine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-30T19:41:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2013 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T17:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly enough, no one on the dev team is even remotely connected to the industry, just huge fans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AceGamer","CreatedById":61925,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T18:59:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hardly ever use SRB\u0027s.
