I seem to have lost my account and all my old posts on here in the April debacle. I haven\u0027t been back because my dad died Apr 25 and I had to take care of my mom for a couple of months. But I\u0027m back now. I don\u0027t know if my old reputation can be restored -- it wasn\u0027t much but it was better than nothing. So hello again and happy flying. I\u0027m currently working on better landers with stock parts. Just busted a wheel off on one as I landed on too much of a slope. Ah well, rescue time.....\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
