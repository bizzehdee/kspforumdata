Well, now I have and now I am interested in checking in on it a lot. Basically, saying Hello before I go into a forum browsing sort of spree while playing KSP. (Which might get a bit messy when I do important things in KSP...) I guess I\u0027m an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E/Airplane person. Given how I was playing before the Steam days of KSP, I probably got more time in than 750 hours that are on there.. probably over 1000. Anyways, thanks for reading about how long I\u0027ve been playing, and I hope to become more active in the community!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T17:51:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sorry, 0.17.1?
