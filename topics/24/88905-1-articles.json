I live in the land of snow, beavers, moose, syrup, maple leafs, and hockey. Also know as Canada. Everybody thinks that Canada is a generally cold climate, but down here in Southwestern Ontario where I live(Which is where I live if it wasn\u0027t obvious enough.), it\u0027s quite the opposite! The one mod that I could not live without is HyperEdit(Yep, I\u0027m a bad boy. Deal with it.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E). I love building realistic space probes, and I even started a HyperEdit Space Program with probes that I actually had goals for, but that was before I had AIES(AWESOME probe bodies and antennae. So, yeah. AIES FTW dawgs.). BTW, Canadians don\u0027t say \u0022Eh\u0022 all the time. Stop thinking that.
