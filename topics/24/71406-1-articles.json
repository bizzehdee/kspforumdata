First post, and it\u0027s a noob question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know how to explain my issue exactly. I have trouble aligning parts. I\u0027ll start off fine, connect a few things, but then something will be moved off the center, like a piece that has to be attached to the center. I can move the object around, up and down and to the sides, but not right back to where the other piece is. Sometimes it gets close and shows it can attach off to the side at some odd angle that won\u0027t be good. This is probably something easy or obvious, but I\u0027m just not seeing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhyunix","CreatedById":59383,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T17:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Capt\u0027 Starboard, welcome to KSP Forum- are you using symmetry? To change symmetry\u0027s, simply press and hold ctrl or shift and X to change the symmetry up or down respectively; not that? Go down to the bottom left corner of the VAB or SPH and press the one with a classic weight on it (the left one normally) to see what is making it like that. If its neither of those, show us some pictures, we\u0027ll gladly help\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T17:11:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027m not following what you\u0027re describing.
