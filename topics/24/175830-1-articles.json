I should really just give it up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo most of you already know me, which may or may not be a good thing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways guess I should introduce myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am Mark Kerbin. Well no, not really, that would be one heck of a coincidence wouldn\u0027t it?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am ~16 years old, male, and whatever else you guys care to believe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuge nerd.

Can get a little mean sometimes but I will chill out pretty quick, especially if someone mentions it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you haven\u0027t already noticed, most of my posts are very \u0022stream of consciousness\u0022 so read to the end if you want to know what I\u0027m actually saying.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am incredibly snarky and sarcastic, especially when tired, grumpy, or when I forgot to eat [insert meal here]. So if I seem like I\u0027m being a jerk, or just a bit... off,\u00A0its either sarcasm or the person the jerkiness was directed at happened to have me reading their post at the wrong time. If so, sorry. That or they were asking for it...
