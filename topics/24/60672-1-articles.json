I\u0027ve been playing since 0.17 and I\u0027ve already posted a bit on the forums, but now I am officially introducing myself. I am gutza1, 12 years old, and I don\u0027t accept many of the \u0022fanon\u0022 stuff such as kerbal photosynthesis and bouncy heads(it\u0027s only a bug, not canon). I, therefore use tons of mods. I am also a realism fan, and am temped to use a RSS rescaled Kerbol system for my future LP so I don\u0027t have to talk about nutronium cores or other applied phlebonium:D to explain the really small planets. I am also trying to use PlanetFactory to recreate GP2, GP3, and to create GP4 and a Pluto analogue named Bluto(rate this thread well if you get the reference:cool:).
