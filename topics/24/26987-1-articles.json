A lot of new people see all these parts in the VAB and just attatch EVERYTHING... Bad idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso remember that although there are a bunch of planets and moons around Kerbol (the sun), the planet Kerbin is worthy of in investigation too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying around Kerbin/using it to test landers etc is a good way to train yourself how to land and stuff, which will save you heartache of not training first and subsequently crash landing on the Mun.
