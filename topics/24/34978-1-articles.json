Use short burst rather then long ones for changing orientation and the same number of short thrust to stop those movements. If you need to turn the ship around, do so slowly. let that maneuver take a minute or two to save the fuel as well as to make stopping the movement a lot easier. H and N are forwards and backwards. The other are sideways movement for each plane such as left and right or up and down. Those are useful for docking maneuvers. Thrusting forwards is useful for fine tuning changes in your orbital path or trajectory to other locations. Otherwise, use the main engines for larger changes and save the RCS fuel for other maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-27T12:43:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2013 12:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synapse","CreatedById":72502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T14:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey thanks for your reply, I have a few more questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

It can carry a one Kerbal capsule. My Saturn probe, using a much larger fourth stage that can carry the three Kerbal capsule and requiring Mainsail engines to get off the ground, requires the lander stage to get into orbit and lunar insertion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is an issue of the tonnage of the second craft where you will need a lot more power and fuel to get to Mum. Adding an extra stage to get to orbit seems to be a point of diminishing return in the added weight of the engine VS the extra handling problems during orbital insertion. Use asparagus staging. Use the second stage engine for launch where its fuel tanks are kept full until the first stage asparagus have been used and jettisoned. The goal is to get all of that weight up to the Orbital turn and about 20,000 meters so the second stage can carry enough fuel for orbital and Mum insertion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, try the Apollo setup where a separate lander is taken to Mum and left in its orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
