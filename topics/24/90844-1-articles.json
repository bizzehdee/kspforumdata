I am on a mission to explore the reaches of my solar system and explore every planet and investigate floating objects. I plan to eventually establish an outpost on the outside of it. This outpost would be self sufficient and be able to hold a maximum of 40 crew members. I realize that this may not be entirely possible in the current version of KSP but possibly with the help of future updates and mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I think would be awesome is if in a future update, if it isn\u0027t possible already (I\u0027m not sure), is if you could escape the Sun\u0027s gravity and orbit and just float free or explore the stars and other solar systems. If that were possible I would build another out post or move my 40 man crew so that it it is perpendicular to the orbits of the planets and directly over the Sun just floating there, with windows facing the solar system. Another eventual goal is to establish colonies of Kerbals on other planets as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I am fairly new to rocket science but I am good at physics and math. Currently I am in college and trying to work so it is alt to take in trying to learn all the math and balance everything else. It\u0027s honestly like a whole other class that I have to teach myself. Right now I my strategy is pretty much building a ship and launching it, and reverting to the build or launch until success. I really want to learn the math because I think that it would be awesome and it will save me a lot of time when it comes to doing everything if I can plan it out and know every step and piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for anyone interested, I currently have a lander crashed on the Mun with 2 stranded Kerbals, a lander with just enough fuel to return home orbiting between 20,000 and 33,000km, and a pod en route to establish an orbit around the Sun at 26,000,000-30,000,000km between the orbits of Duna and Dres. I plan to either send a rescue crew to the Mun or establish a colony there to save my stranded Kerbals and bring home my ship orbiting Kerbin. My pod orbiting the Sun will serve as my scout as I venture off into space as well as be a testament to my deep space explorations. I don\u0027t plan on it coming home, it has a 201 units of Liquid fuel and 246 units of oxidizer left powering a LT-N rocket motor. I am currently only using fuel to adjust orbit, but when my fuel does eventually run out I plan to either leave it where it stops or shoot it into space to float on forever if its possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: This is all in sandbox mode for now, I plan to also start a career at some point but I want to get good at the game first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003EStar Command signing off.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-20T23:20:12Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2014 11:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Star Command\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T23:20:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Forums, Star Command. That\u0027s an ambitious goal you\u0027ve got there. Even without mods, it is possible to go on escape velocity from the sun and just float in space.

KSP does not model multi-body physics (again, unless you install an appropriate mod) so once in orbit around the sun something will stay there unless it enters the Sphere of Influence (SoI) of one of the planets by approach too closely. You won\u0027t be able to keep the windows facing the sun though as a vessel\u0027s rotation is not tracked unless you\u0027re actually controlling it. When you switch back to the space centre or another ship your station will just keep facing the same way so, half an orbit later, will be staring away from the sun instead of towards it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaths\u003C/strong\u003E: there are two equations that are really important to rocket design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThrust to Weight Ratio (TWR)\u003C/span\u003E: dead easy, it\u0027s the total maximum thrust of your active engines divided by the mass of your ship. The higher the number the faster you can accelerate (change velocity). Most importantly, if it\u0027s below 1 you won\u0027t be able to lift-off from the launchpad. Ideal launch TWR is generally considered to be 1.2 - 2, lower means you spend more energy fighting gravity (getting up), higher means you spend more fighting atmospheric drag (getting fast). Increase TWR by using more, or more powerful, engines or by reducing the mass of your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EdeltaV (dV)\u003C/span\u003E: bit harder, it\u0027s the amount by which your engines can change your velocity vector - the speed and direction in which you\u0027re travelling. With 1,000m/s dV from rest you can accelerate to 1,000m/s in any direction (assuming there isn\u0027t anything in the way!) or accelerate to 500m/s, flip the ship around and \u0027accelerate\u0027 in the opposite direction back to 0m/s, for instance. Your deltaV depends on the fuel-efficiency of your engine(s), the amount of fuel available and the mass of your ship. You need about 4,500m/s deltaV to launch into orbit from Kerbin. Increase deltaV by using more efficient engines, adding fuel or reducing the mass of your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdeltaV is calculated using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe rocket equation\u003C/a\u003E, dV = (Isp * G) * LN(wet_mass / dry_mass) (wet_mass being the total mass of the whole ship including fuel and dry_mass being after all the fuel is burnt). Breaking it down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E(wet_mass / dry_mass): means the greater proportion of the rocket which is available fuel the better\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELN(wet_mass / dry_mass): LN() is the natural logarithm function meaning there are diminishing returns to just adding fuel to improve the figure in 1. because it takes fuel to lift fuel\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E(Isp * G): G is gravity and either 9.81 or 9.82 in KSP, I can never remember (see below). Isp is engine efficiency\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E3. times 4.: more efficient engines with more fuel available (up to a limit) go further\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoooo - there are a few numbers you need to know before you can work out TWR and dV. Engine Isp and thrust can be seen in the part descriptions in the VAB/SPH. Each part\u0027s mass is also given there but to get the total you\u0027ll either have to add them all up or \u0027launch\u0027 to go to flight mode, press \u0027m\u0027 for the map view and click the \u0027i\u0027nformation button on the right of the screen - that\u0027s the only place KSP shows ship mass. To get the figure without fuel (so you can work out dV) you\u0027ll need to subtract the mass of the fuel within the tanks, but not the mass of the empty tank itself, or launch with empty tanks and check \u0027i\u0027nformation again. Every time you add or remove a part you\u0027ll have to re-calculate mass, TWR and deltaV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a right pain, in other words. Do yourself a favour and install either the Kerbal Engineer Redux (KER) or MechJeb (MJ) mod. These will both show you everything you need to know in the VAB/SPH as you build. First simple facts and figures to remember - you want a launch TWR of 1.5 and 4,500m/s deltaV. It\u0027s a lot easier with mods, Squad think we should have to work hard/crash a lot before getting into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E...units of fuel...\u003C/strong\u003E: You\u0027ll realise from the above that that doesn\u0027t tell you anything about TWR and deltaV (the important performance figures) unless you also know its mass.
