Some of you might remember me, some maybe not. Anyway, my name is CaptainApollo and I\u0027m a big fan of space exploration in general and also KSP, of course. I was posting a lot on this forum over the summer of 2015, but then school started and I got quite busy, and the forums updated and all and I didn\u0027t have much time for KSP either. But, now I\u0027m not as busy and I want to come back to the forum. It\u0027s interesting to see the new layout, what do you guys think of it? Either way, I am happy to be back to the KSP forums and start posting again!
