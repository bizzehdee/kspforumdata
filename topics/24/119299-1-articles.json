Tonight I became a member and am proud to share my greatest creation, the Duna \u0027VTOL\u0027 Lander! A stock craft (minus mechJEB). I am currently refueling the main landing craft on Minmus. The plan is to dock large heat screen in orbit around Minmus, then sling shot around kerbin and hit the Duna atmosphere hard scrubbing speed and landing safely. Any advice for landing a large VTOL on Duna would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YNQYwEt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YNQYwEt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thegamer211","CreatedById":149354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T11:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a nice miner you got there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd welcome to the forums, DealerLeaf! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T11:28:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Duna landings, parachutes can slow you down, but using engines and parachutes is much safer.
