My name is Caleb. I\u0027m 28 years old, I live in Texas. Being so relatively close to Mexico City I\u0027m always thinking about how easy it would be to visit KSPs birthplace. Maybe one day \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore KSP I had no idea how \u0022rocket science\u0022 worked. I had a pretty above-average understanding of ballistics, but never really had any interest in space travel. But KSP has really hooked me on how awesome it can be!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a pretty humble and patient person. Many people say I\u0027d make a great lawyer because I can (and often do) argue multiple sides of any situation effectively and convincingly if given the time to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of people here seem impatient and ungrateful for something that as far as I can tell, they probably shouldn\u0027t expect anyway. I know that many things can be implied and sometimes we put our trust in a source, and allow expectations to be created... but KSP is the Devs project. Not ours, despite however passionately we may feel about the subject of financial support of its development. I\u0027m grateful to be a part of the process in any way shape or form. Too few people seem to feel the same way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts always the angry people who talk the loudest. I do my best to life my life to the contrary, despite how bitter and world-weary many of my views can be. lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry and take it easy on the Devs guys. They\u0027re providing (whether we like how or not) easily one of the coolest things many of us have seen come out of indie gaming in quite a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d20/GateCrasherVI/Public/BWgroupset013_zps2a86d8c1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BWgroupset013_zps2a86d8c1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo thats me! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaleb.
