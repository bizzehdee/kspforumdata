Most I know that assemble their computers with the latest and most powerful hardware are Gamers who need the power to achieve the best game play so I figure\u00A0 I should have no problems running KSP .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been going through a few\u00A0KSP Toutorials along with watching others using KSP on YouTube and I am thinking of\u00A0 purchasing the program.\u00A0 I am wondering thought if I should get the main program and from what I can see the two add on all at once. It appears that the main program is $39.99 and each additional upgrades are $14.99 each. I have a STEAM account but think it might be best to download the program directly to my laptop,\u00A0 the reason being that whenever I do log into STEAM I\u0027m always getting updates and it sometimes takes a minute or two before I can start playing a game.\u00A0 This might be caused by my lack of logging in for months at a time\u00A0 but I still think having the program separate and as a stand alone will be more convenient.\u00A0 But if someone has information that going the STEAM route would be better please let me know.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI plan on reading through the WIKI pages on how to use the program and learning as much as I can from the videos before I make the decision to purchase.\u00A0 I suck at math and have difficulty with the metric system but I have always been interested in space and NASA. I have been following Space X and Blue Origin along with anything new related to rockets and the ISS.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think KSP will be interesting and fun. From what I have seen so far it looks like a fun way to learn.\u00A0 I can remember very clearly watching the Apollo 11 Moon Landing and have been interested in the space program ever since.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought I would introduce myself and say \u0022Hello to All\u0022 and I look forward to visiting this forum in the near future.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-24T14:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome aboard!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caerfinon","CreatedById":207619,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-24T14:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223931644\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200613\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221614175932\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210264\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mangulator\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, mangulator said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought I would introduce myself and say \u0022Hello to All\u0022 and I look forward to visiting this forum in the near future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking forward to reading about your progress.

Should I consider bumping up to 128 gb. of RAM , my laptop will except the upgrade.. I have plenty of space on my C drive and D drive because I off load my finished work to an external storage system in order to keep the on board drives free for large video files I need to work on.

I still have my Thrustmaster flight controllers I used when playing Falcon 4.0 and MS Flight Simulator I also have\u00A0a Cyborg Joystick,\u00A0 will these controllers work with KSP vs. using a keyboard. I have never been very good at using a keyboard in games, I even have a Play Station type controller.\u00A0 As I mentioned I rarely play any games on my computers anymore but will occasionally play a game of PGA Golf or a game of Chess.
