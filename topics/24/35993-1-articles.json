So I purchased off Steam a few days ago, have installed a half dozen mods (MechJeb, Engineer, Escape Pod, Orbital Fuel Station, etc). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some general questions and searching the web has helped me, along with Scott Manley\u0027s YouTube videos, but I\u0027m still running into a few things that I\u0027m just not sure about. So I thought I would ask (in no particular order) to see what I\u0027m missing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Struts - I assumed that when you use a strut in conjunction with a radial decoupled that the struts would disconnect as well (tested and it worked), but I also had one design where the struts didn\u0027t disconnect when the separation fired. I ended up abandoning that design, but are there any instances where struts don\u0027t come apart? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Fuel Lines - I\u0027ve had some issues getting fuel lines to connect, lots of \u0022fiddling\u0022 usually solves it. One thing I\u0027m not sure about is if they have any use beyond launch. IE: can u you use fuel lines on a space station to balance the fuel load between two tanks without having to manually transfer fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Unmanned pods - I take it there is no other way to \u0022un-man\u0022 a pod before launch other than to Eva and end then go back to the pad... Do you have to include a probe or remote unit in order to retain control or is the unmanned pod enough?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Space Station wiggle - I used the Orbital Fuel Station design (very nice btw) but at one point I didn\u0027t like the way the station was facing. I had two vehicles docked at the time and activated the RCS. Every thuster fired and the whole thing started to \u0022shake\u0022. I killed RCS but after a little while one of the vehicles shook side to side so badly it ripped the docking port off the station and took some parts with. I\u0027m assuming my screw up was that I should have undocked everything, then adjusted the station?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Docking ports as couplers? Can you \u0022dock\u0022 two things together and send them up on your launch vehicles? Do/Can you use struts to stabilize that connection?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Rovers - Haven\u0027t used them yet, I was thinking about trying the stock rover out, but how do you put it into your lander?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T02:12:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell a quick update... I found and loaded up the Dev release of MapSat and I successfully mapped Kerbin, yea, go me!

Your situation sounds like a bug, but it might help to see a picture of the ship. 2) Fuel lines will pump fuel on a station or ship or whatever, but only when an engine is firing. To get fuel to flow when engines are not firing, you have to use the right-click menu. 3) The whole crewing system is getting replaced in the next update, but for right now, EVA is the only way to empty a capsule. If a ship has no capsules that currently have any crew members in them, it will be inert, unless you\u0027ve also installed a probe core. 4) ASAS is currently disproportional to large ships and will cause shaking and the RCS spasms that you\u0027ve seen. But that is also slated to be reworked in the next update, and shouldn\u0027t be a problem much longer. 5) Docking rings can not be used to combine saved ships before launch (I think that\u0027s what you\u0027re asking). You can use them as connectors, but only if you build the whole thing as a single launch vehicle. After launch, you can combine or separate ships to your heart\u0027s content. There is a mod or two that will allow you to place struts on docked ships, but that option does not exist in the stock game. 6) I haven\u0027t tried the stock rovers, but you can hang rovers beneath or on the sides of a lander, and a trickier option is to mount it on top and drive it off. I made some examples \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35916-Small-Medium-and-Large-moon-rovers-from-Yeahletstrythatdyne\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35916-Small-Medium-and-Large-moon-rovers-from-Yeahletstrythatdyne\u003C/a\u003E of the most popular type of rover delivery system, which is called \u0022skycrane.\u0022 In it, a disposable mini-lander comes close to the surface or actually lands, and then drops the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CCKinnison","CreatedById":71439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T12:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Fuel lines specifically have firing engines draw from the FARTHEST tank they\u0027re connected to first, until they\u0027re dry.

So if you put a Hitchhiker module below a crew pod, that might also slave your issue, unless you want a totally un-kerballed mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; ASAS, as noted, is destructive in trying to do stationkeeping with RCS right now. However, RCS with a large, dispersed structure is a problem all it\u0027s own. More thursters is not necessarily better, placememt matters a LOT. For rotation, you want thrusters evenly spaced around the center of mass, as far from it as possible. note that with a BIG structure, it may simply not be able to take the maneuver - you might have to split the station into pieces with docking ports, rotate the core, and re-dock the bits, using tugs. For TRAMLATION with RCS, one set of thrusters arrayed DIRECTLY AROUND the Center of Mass is generally more effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5\u0026gt; Yes, you can launch docked ports. It\u0027s more parts, and \u0022more flexible\u0022 than sending up assembled structure not intended to come apart... and yes, you can strut across docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScramblesTD","CreatedById":72796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T17:56:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERover deployment is entirely up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of my designers either have the rover mounted at the bottom of the lander, and then dropped to the surface before touching down or if the lander is tall enough, dropped after landing and rolled out from underneath the main craft.

You first use a large burn to get you near the planet you want to go. This usually takes somewhere around 1500-2500 dV. Since you\u0027re a human being this burn probably won\u0027t be perfect. So you mess around with maneuver nodes until you do get an encounter. This secondary burn is usually only a few dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, you do need a lot of dV to get into orbit with other bodies. All that speed you added to escape kerbin, you need to counter all that to get back into orbit. If you\u0027re going to a planet with an atmosphere (Eve Jool or Duna) you can use an aerocapture maneuver to save fuel. You basically make sure that when flying past it you skim the upper atmosphere, this will bleed off most of you velocity allowing you to enter orbit for free (except a small burn at apoapsis to raise your periapsis into a stable orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T23:22:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClearly I have more reading to do.

If you fire along that axis while in orbit you make your orbit more/less eliptical. It\u0027s more efficient to just fire along your velocity vector (green) to achieve the exact same thing though. I mostly use it for my final approach for munlandings etc. I usually set up the orbit so my spacecraft will hit the mun. Once I\u0027m on a proper trajectory I\u0027ll stage and fire along the blue vector so my lander stage misses the mun.
