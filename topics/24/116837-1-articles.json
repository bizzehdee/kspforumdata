When KSP goes Unity 5, the problems should disappear. Until then, i recommend reducing the texture quality.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOh sorry, welcome to the forums, tech2000!

Unity 5? when? sweet! but yea, KSP usually uses about 2.78 GB of my RAM, not really much imo considering the quality of the game, both fps and visual. thanks for the compliments on the crafts. im a noob, i feel like my ships weigh too much, or my engines arent powerful enough. lol, oh rocket science. check out my Falcon 9\n\n![grnBnc3.png](http://i.imgur.com/grnBnc3.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T06:07:08Z","Content":"Honestly, it seems that your designs are pretty overpowered concerning engines (too much weight due to too many engines). The heat effects in your screenshot will happen to spaceplanes, as they need to get as much speed as possible from their airbreathing engines. A rocket has no such need. Check the web for \u0022gravity turn\u0022. Understanding the ascent physics helps a lot to get your constructions more efficient."},{"CreatedByName":"tech2000","CreatedById":148781,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T00:13:02Z","Content":"gotcha. thanks. so less rockets, more fuel?"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T12:37:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E gotcha. thanks. so less rockets, more fuel?\n\nnot even. Less rockets, more efficiency. If you\u0027ve been powering through the lower atmosphere, then you should have plenty of fuel as it is.\n\nThe reason that you don\u0027t want to go too fast, too low is because of your terminal velocity. You will start to spend more and more fuel on going at the same speed, instead of saving it for when there is less drag.\n\nTo recap- go as fast as you can, but not too fast.\n\nAlso- orbit is all about horizontal velocity, so learn what a gravity turn is."},{"CreatedByName":"Seaview123","CreatedById":130421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T17:28:02Z","Content":"Very cool looking craft you\u0027ve got there. You\u0027ll soon be just as addicted to this game as the rest of us around here are. Congratz on starting out and have fun.\n\nAs for your Quadrojet, here\u0027s some suggestions... put an SAS module next to your cockpit near the center of gravity. That will help with balancing it out. Also, try putting a docking port Jr on top of the fuselage over the CoG, too. Then on the runway, shift control to there (right click menu) and you\u0027ll have a top-down view of the nav ball to help keep your craft level. Hope this helps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T17:32:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 05:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Seaview123**"},{"CreatedByName":"tech2000","CreatedById":148781,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T23:15:46Z","Content":"thanks for the replies all! and yes, KSP is my new favorite game."}]}
