Decided to have one of my Kerbalnaughts go EVA before my apoapsis, forgot to do my burn and before he got back onboard we started doing re-entry. Recently I was able to put Kethane Detecting Satellites on Polar orbits on both Mun, and Minmus. Might start building a station and practice docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo minor questions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. is it possible to build orbiters or Probes separately from the boosters, and combine both \u0022craft\u0022 (save files) in the VAB?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
