I\u0027ve been playing KSP for about 3 months now, and lurking the forums most of that time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play dead stock, mostly puttering around the Kerbin system. I have a habitat/refueling station in Kerbin orbit (had lots of \u0022fun\u0022 figuring out orbital rendezvous and docking, and owe a great debt to these forums). I\u0027ve also landed a probe on Ike and then landed it on Duna. Currently working out an unmanned Eve/Gilly mission, so I\u0027m not updating just yet. I got halfway to Eve and realized I\u0027d forgotten to deploy the solar panels \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T02:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello. I also play stock-only. Don\u0027t be afraid to download the new version, though. You can copy the files of your ships and saves into the folders of the new version, and pick right up where you left off. (That\u0027s not the case for every update, but for most.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ripvanlemon","CreatedById":92617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T13:31:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi. Thanks for the reply. I\u0027m actually excited about the new version, but I had planned the mission and built my probe with .22 science (transmission spamming) in mind and already had it on the way to Eve. That\u0027s why I have held off updating. I love my Kerbals too much to send a manned mission there. I\u0027m going to try it again in .23, but I\u0027ll be sending a lab module... and probably run manned to Gilly for sweet jumps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T19:56:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome. I played mostly stock in v.0.22. I will again use a few mods when Kerbal Engineer and MechJeb are certified 0.23.
