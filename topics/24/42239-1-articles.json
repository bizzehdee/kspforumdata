I\u0027ve always dreamed of space opera-style travel (the kind with perpetually glowy engines, easy FTL and no worries about staging or delta-V) but after playing a little Kerbal, I have a new found respect for how cool basic astrodynamics are. In about a month I\u0027ve learned the meaning of Hohmann and bi-elliptical transfers, orbital inclination, pro/retrograde thrusting, and reinforced my existing understanding that doing almost anything is exponentially harder when dealing with space XD. That\u0027s without mentioning a whole host of other things that would completely clutter up my intro too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ribbon bar is not yet very impressive, but among other things I have managed a non-lethal M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn landing and almost got the unlucky pilot back to Kerbin. My lander was too fuel-inefficient to maneuver much after taking off, so he drifted into an unplanned Kerbol orbit and is now in deep space o.0 but maybe eventually I\u0027ll be able to rescue him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to chatting with KSP commanders who have grander achievements than mine. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T15:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
