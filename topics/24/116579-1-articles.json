I\u0027ve been a lurker for quite some time, but I\u0027ve been too shy to post until now. \n\nI picked up KSP just after the official release and I have never looked back. At first it was a nice explosion simulator, then I managed to get into suborbital flight. I remember when I stood up in my man cave and cheered out loud when I finally achieved orbit! I was such a baby back then ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Little did I know that that was nothing compared to when Jeb took his first steps on the Mun and safely returned home.\n\nWhen I bought this game I had a fear that it wasn\u0027t going to be enough for me. Just one solar system with a few planets - I\u0027m going to get bored of this in a heartbeat. Uhhhh....I\u0027m glad I was way wrong on that. In all this time I have been totally captivated and have only left the Kerbin SOI a few times. I have never planted a flag on Eve or Duna, but I have plopped probes down on each.\n\nWhat finally prompted me to post was ASET Mk1-2 IVA pod replacement. Wow! It\u0027s almost as if that just created a separate game out of this masterpiece. I just flew my first two flights entirely IVA. It\u0027s an amazing experience. The first flight was a suborbital test and then I put myself in a 100km orbit - just to see if I could manage to navigate while in IVA. \n\nEverytime I start to think I am getting this whole thing figured out, somebody pulls the rug out from under me and changes everything.\n\nI want to thank all of you posters out there for the great info on these boards. I also want to thank Scott Manley for his vids. Without the two, I never would have figured out how to get off the ground. I also want to thank all the modders out there for the great job you guys do and all the fun you provide guys like me."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T17:15:14Z","Content":"Welcome!
