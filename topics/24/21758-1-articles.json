I picked up pretty quickly after watching a few videos around the web. I haven\u0027t made it very far yet but that\u0027s all part of the fun for later on. I\u0027ve made it into orbit around the mun several times but just can\u0027t seem to land there. I realise you have to slow down to 4m/s or something after reading the wiki but no matter how much upward thrust I put the m/s number doesn\u0027t go down. Even when I\u0027m hovering about 2,000m above the ground going down about 20m/s a second however the number says 400m/s which is not true.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T03:15:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the numbers, are you talking about the digital display above the navball? Because that one is a combination of horizontal and vertical speed, so may still show a high number if you haven\u0027t shed all of your orbital speed yet.
