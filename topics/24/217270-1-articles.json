I can\u0027t figure out when to end it. I\u0027m overdoing it as I keep loering my periapsis until it\u0027s below ground.

Mun or Kerbin or Eeloo or any body. As orbital velocity drops your periapsis will go sub surface. Thats a good thing! Means you slowed down enough to stop missing the ground. On Mun your next burn or burns depending on fuel on board and/or bravery is to slow you enough to not go full lawn-dart. If on KSP1 i suggest getting mechjeb (its an autopilot), its a fantastic teacher that will do what no tutorial (written or video or w/e the game has) can or will do: show you how YOUR craft will fly during launch, rendezvous and docking and even landing.

Landing on a body with no atmosphere is one of the trickiest parts of the game. Save the game before you start the landing. Execute retrograde burn until your PE goes to 0 or below. Time warp until you\u0027re about 10kms above the ground. You should be going roughly 500m/s. The navball can show 3 different speeds. Orbit, surface and target. Select surface option at 10km.

Start burning at 10km. The goal is to reach lower your speed to ~10m/s when you\u0027re about 100 meters above the ground. Then continue burning and adjusting throttle to land gently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis requires practice, and often, multiple attempts. The height at where you want to start burning depends on the gravity, engine thrust and rocket\u0027s mass.
