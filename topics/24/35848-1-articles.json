I\u0027m kind of new around here. Still learning small pieces of the game which don\u0027t seem to be covered by the simple in game tutorials, figuring out keybinds that are useful really. I played around with the demo on steam and ended up getting a real copy recently and I\u0027m building even stupider ways to get things into space. My first successful attempt to get something outside of Kerbin\u0027s orbit was just a *tiny* bit too successful. Though I was somewhat surprised at the fact that I had managed to keep a kerbal in a tube basically with no chance of getting home because of some bad thinking with the decoupler which ended up just being the final nail on that coffin, and not enough parts(or mods for that matter) to be able to have a hope of getting him out of there and close enough to Kerbin to have a encounter of any kind. This was just done with a really big amount of SFB and some struts to keep it somewhat stable. Made it in pancake staging without even knowing what that was at the time too. It ended up being a five stack IIRC. No RCS or SAS, just a can, a kerbal, a paracute which had no use in the end, and a big set of SFB staging stuff. Not easy to control that ship. Kind of why I really had ruined his chance of getting home by firing the decoupler too soon. It was just enough to send me out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and into the Sun\u0027s. I know that isn\u0027t what it\u0027s actually called, but I forgot what it\u0027s actually called at to me it\u0027ll always just be the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow with a full copy and mods at my fingertips, I have a crazy plan. A Kethane converter vessel which uses the airflow of a reentry contrail in a attempt to freeze the heat sinks, basically. Or I guess make them basically cool down the converter enough to either increase the efficiency so that I\u0027m either using less Kethane or generating more fuel then expected. The plan is to make a MechJeb Autom8 file which when used will increase your angle as you\u0027re coming in that you\u0027ll have a very long amount of reentry and the contrails. Considering the use of Autom8 because even if it doesn\u0027t cause some kind of stack overflow error it\u0027s still a cool way to generate enough cooling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have but one last mod to add to my setup before I try to record some videos of my bad ideas and why they really shouldn\u0027t let hackjobs like me have a space program to run. Let alone run a business using the funds from my rare successes get me further into a really cushy chair which basically has a computer nearby which lets me send unmanned attack drones of various types to mess up anything I like the idea of messing up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and a big red button to launch several nukes from planetoids to nuke various things for no real reason other then liking the idea of blowing things up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T20:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
