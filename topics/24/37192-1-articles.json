A few seconds locked into that heading and you should see your prograde marker move with you.

My adivce is that the further behind the COM you put the COL, the more stable it is, yet it is harder to manoeuvre. The further in front it is, the more manoeuvrable it is, but it won\u0027t stay on course as easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI landed this with a keyboard, but I imagine using a joystick does give smother control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b6LUHfPl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022b6LUHfPl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seanoog","CreatedById":8599,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T18:23:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello an welcome deepsheep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a long time player of KSP, I can highly recommended a Joystick as a worthy accessory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso consider a Trackball mouse, to compliment the joystick.
