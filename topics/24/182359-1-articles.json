Welllll I\u0027m Reinhart and in the past I mainly played ww2 flight sims (primarily on the German side which you can probably guess from the name) but that got exhausting after awhile since I played MP full realism servers and made survival and combat effectiveness top priority so I took a break. Me and a friend discovered KSP years ago and would literally spend all hours of the night trying to even get a rocket into orbit. Flashback to now and I\u0027ve learned enough about the game to make complex ships and travel to other celestial bodies almost routinely and I this has to be pound for pound the greatest game of all time (in my eyes at least). Anyway this community has been VERY helpful and kind to me right from the jump so I\u0027m hoping I can be as helpful in anyway I can and kinda give back to the community with quality videos. Okay that\u0027s my intro, hope yall are having a good day \u0026lt;3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-22T00:00:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me be the first to formally welcome you to the KSP Forum, Reinhart Mk.1!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have nothing for which to be apologetic.\u00A0 Many people who have been helped previously are happy to help a newcomer learn the ropes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEspecially when that newcomer is truly interested in learning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am glad your experiences here have been so positive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-22T00:55:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/194521-reinhart-mk1/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022194521\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/194521-reinhart-mk1/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Reinhart Mk.1\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been following your Eve thread\u00A0and find\u00A0very informative -\u00A0it has generated a lot of great discussion, ideas and even a \u003Cs\u003Eduel\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0challenge.\u00A0 I\u0027ve also never made it back to orbit from the purple beast so I wish you the best of luck, Mate, I\u00A0hope you conquer it.\u00A0 I\u0027m starting to think about giving it a go again myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reinhart Mk.1","CreatedById":194521,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-22T00:55:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223544931\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182359\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221550796925\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160462\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022James Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, James Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m starting to think about giving it a go again myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou got it in you buddy, CHASE YOUR DREAMS \u0026lt;3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GRS","CreatedById":179502,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-26T07:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, welcome there, Mister...wish you can have fun in any ways you want...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
