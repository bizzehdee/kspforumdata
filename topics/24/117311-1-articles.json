I\u0027ve played around 800 hours of KSP, but given my playstyle and interests the furthest from Kerbin I\u0027ve ever been is Duna, twice. I tend to stick to designing jets and SSTOs with various mods like Ferram Aerospace Research, Advanced Jet Engine, Procedural Parts, B9 Wings, Intake Build Aid, Pilot Assistant, etc. I like to think I have a good enough grasp on plane and spaceplane design principals (in KSP-land) to assist some of the other members here, so I will be trying to give back to the community accordingly. However I\u0027ll definitely need some help in furthering my exploration of the Kerbin system! However my grand goal of the game, something I\u0027ve wanted to do since I\u0027ve learned it was even possible is to fly an SSTO from the KCC runway to a Laythe landing and back. Refueling is allowed, but I might limit myself to only launching/assembling fuel depots with SSTOs. Rockets are for losers right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T11:35:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Virtual Flyboy, and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess you already know how great this community is, so you know where to ask and find answers to questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you seen the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117415-SSTO-to-laythe-and-beyond\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESSTO to Laythe and Beyond\u003C/a\u003E thread in the challenges section?

While it is certainly possible to go there and back without any refueling, it doesn\u0027t seem to be practical for any crew onboard, which is something I consider in my selectively \u0022realistic\u0022 mindset. Often means SSTOs/any craft become bloated with extra, unoccupied cabin space if the trip is anywhere outside the Kerbin SOI. There are still plenty of things I wish to explore before that grand feat, so I hope to get squeeze some gravity assist practice in to make sure my burns out there are as minimal as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a very small album of some recent KSP adventures. Currently on a newish save right now, first thing I did was set up a com-sat network using my KD-A3 Pegasus, an SSTO with ability to deploy small payloads into LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/TVufd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Being an aviation nut doesn\u0027t help either. I can only hope people don\u0027t take a silly statement like that as anything more than what it is, a joking prod. I also stream on occasion, but I\u0027ll find the appropriate outlet to post that in whenever I\u0027m active, as it is rare enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, feels nice to find a forum that is all about the game you love, and the topics it involves. I\u0027ve been part of a Halo forum for 10 years, moderating 1/3 of that time. Surviving community was small and solid, but also stagnant, as many of us literally outgrew the game that brought us together, leading to mostly OT discussion, with me often talking aviation or space.
