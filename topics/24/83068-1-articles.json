And boy did I get hooked. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t gotten very far yet - a few orbital flights and one successful Mun landing \u0026amp; return (yay!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a question about science points. See if I have understood things right. I plan to start sending unmanned probes to the other planets to help gather some science points. I have understood that transmitted reports get less points than reports and samples that are brought back to Kerbin. So here\u0027s the question: I have noticed that you get full science score only once for any given place/situation/activity combination. If a probe makes a scientific observation at a given place, will I have consumed that science opportunity, or can I recoup the \u0027missing\u0027 points later in the game with a manned expedition? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: if an unmanned probe that\u0027s not returning to Kerbin would observe mystery goo in low Duna orbit, will that situation and location be consumed, or could I repeat the experiment later with a probe that\u0027s meant to return to Kerbin and get all the science points?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankful for help\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStockholm, Sweden\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T17:06:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a set amount of science to be gathered in each location (biome).
