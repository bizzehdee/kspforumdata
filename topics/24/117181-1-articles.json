So, I came to the place where people might care, might understand these unhealthy urges that make one forgo sleeping in favor of the utter impractical designs that took 20 some odd stages to get it up there. I came here, where I quickly learned there was a much easier way LOL!"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T16:24:25Z","Content":"Hello vestradeus, and welcome to the KSP forums!\n\nIt\u0027s good to have you aboard.

I don\u0027t know why.
