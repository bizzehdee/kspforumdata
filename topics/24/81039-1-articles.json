I\u0027ve only been playing KSP since 0.23, so fairly recently. The only non-cosmetic mod I use is Mechjeb - love the TWR and delta-v calculations, plus he\u0027s better than I am at performing maneuver nodes.

The delta-v calculator has its issues sometimes (recently had to delete all my config files from inside /Mechjeb2 and let the mod reset them as the calculator (and vessel info, and orbit info) went missing entirely:huh:) but for me it\u0027s worked quite well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t understand the flak MJ sometimes gets in the community though. The lovers love it but the haters seem to hate it with a passion. Sure, it\u0027s more impressive to pull off burns manually, and your first ascent to a 100km equatorial orbit is fun. Your 20th, 40th? I\u0027d rather put MJ on pilot duty and make myself a coffee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen do a flashy manual landing on the Mun just to prove I can. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
