I\u0027ve been a long time KSP players, pretty much since it\u0027s earliest Alpha. I\u0027ve been playing the game off and on ever since, pretty much giving every big patch another go. I\u0027m currently completely hooked on 0.90 Beta then Ever. I\u0027ve installed a couple of mods such as Interstellar, FAR, Karbonite, ScanSat etc to give me more things to do and I\u0027m pretty much spending days upon days of designing more missions and infrastructure around Kerbin. My Kerbanauts haven\u0027t really made it out of the Kerbin SOI in 0.90 yet but hey.. They\u0027ve been to every planet before then so I\u0027m sure they can wait a bit longer while I deploy countless more satellites and probes all over Kerbol. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been a long time lurker on the forums but only recently started making posts of my own. So far it\u0027s been great and I have to say you guys are a wonderfully friendly and helpfull community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat got me into KSP? Well... I\u0027ve always been a sucker for space themed games. When I first caught word of KSP I emediatly rushed over to the website to buy a copy. I\u0027ve also been following Scott Manley a fair bit on youtube and I\u0027m always amazed at how he (as well as other youtubers such as HOCgaming and all that) get such intricate networks of infrastructure or such huge and well designed ships into orbit. I\u0027ve been trying to get to that level of skill but even though I\u0027m a long term player, there\u0027s always more to learn and improve on in KSP wich is what makes this game so great. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m deffinitly not a math wizard so doing all those complicated Dv or ISP calculations is well beyond me. But there\u0027s mods to fix that and the game itself is beautifully simple and easy to learn, but oh so difficult to master. I\u0027m still looking to learn though and even though physics is far removed from my everyday occupation it does interrest me to a huge extent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoping to have a fun time on the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T03:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also don\u0027t do the math.
