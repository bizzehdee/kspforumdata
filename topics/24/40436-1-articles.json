It\u0027s astonishing and a ton of fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to build a sphere as a fairing at the moment though I\u0027m having problems since there are only square structural panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd building a sphere with only them is KIND of hard.. I managed to get one working but the panels were overlapping eachother and it just ended up in a ton of lagg and my PC melting (to be fair I may have made it a bit big..).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoooo I\u0027d like to ask all of you if there is a mod that adds more structural parts like a triangle into the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already found this mod: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/procedural-fairings/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProcedural fairings\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty nice but I really need parts like the already existing structural panels in the game. Preferably triangles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso is there an easy way to duplicate objects while being in the Assembly Building? I found out dragging a part from the ship somewhere where it\u0027s not attached and then using strg \u002B z to reset it keeps the part you dragged off but that doesn\u0027t seem to be the right way to do it....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to all of you and I wish you a great launch \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malloy","CreatedById":77040,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T11:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi mate, I\u0027m new too so can\u0027t help with the mod stuff but \u0022Alt-clicking\u0022 on a part or a group of parts in the vehicle assembly building will copy it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMalloy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whitefrost","CreatedById":77060,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T11:49:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks! that helped me a lot already!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorpi15","CreatedById":34189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T12:29:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome both of you to KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, you can look in the Spacecraft Exchange for ideas on how to make a realistic looking sphere with existing parts- In particular look at Mulbin\u0027s Vos-stock or the OKB-1 thread in rocket builders.

I tried out the B9 Aerospace pack and yes it has triangles though I have yet to find an equilateral one but I guess it could work with these.
