I have been having a blast (several times) with the demo and will be downloading the full game friday (yay). I have had an opportunity to put Jeb in orbit several times and I almost hit the Mun earlier tonight. I do have some questions though. I have been looking at the youtube videos and have been in awe of what I have seen. Some truly amazing things. What would you all suggest be my first add on or add ons? and is there somewhere I can get a detailed description of what I will have in the base game? do I get amazing reentry effects or do I have to down load an addon for that? space shuttle parts? down load or base? I see numerous satellites and things like lazors and docking computers. again addons or in the base game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no doubt I am buying the game in a couple of days, I just would like to know what to expect from what I buy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDingo\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSuperintendnt","CreatedById":47102,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T04:15:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!
