Are you able to reach a stable Kerbin orbit? My method is typically this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Reach a 90 degree orbit (I like 100km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Wait until the Mun is rising in front of you over the Kerbin horizon and direct burn. Watch on the map screen as your apoapsis (AP on the map) grows and as it approaches the point where it will cross the Mun\u0027s orbit, slow throttle until. When you see an encounter, cut throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. For a novice, stabilizing your Mun orbit can be tricky and there are many variables. If you\u0027re headed for and impact, you can simply burn retrograde and land. If you\u0027re going to slingshot, wait for periapsis (PE on the map) and burn retrograde until you have an apoapsis. Now you\u0027re orbiting the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry that and report back any complications. Also, as a personal favor, please use capitalization and punctuation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackwing","CreatedById":38746,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T20:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell i do what you say but nothing and for my mechjeb stragety i do 200 orbit altitude *not 200 meters of height* and then i got on a transfer to mun and then i completely miss also schools these days dont teach us grammer and punucation and capialzation so anyways i need some serious help\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T20:21:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi blackwing, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can find a lot of info on flying \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/15652-Orbital-Mechanics-101-A-Kerbal-Space-Program-Tutorial\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ein this thread here.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs MechJeb is trying to do, you have to get into orbit before you can get anywhere else, trying to fly straight at the Mun just wont work, in space it\u0027s all about orbits \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackwing","CreatedById":38746,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-04T17:06:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Envm i got it its actually quite fun jebidah slammed face first into the moon and still lived LIKE A BOSS from like 4000 meters above the surface that was during my bail outs\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
