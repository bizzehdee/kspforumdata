I\u0027ve used the free version to make some of my early videos but am gearing up to make more with the paid version. Just be aware that Fraps uses mega file sizes to record videos, so be sure to have plenty of disk space and never be afraid to tweak the settings to suit your needs."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T15:51:06Z","Content":"Fraps.
