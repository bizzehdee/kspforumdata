One day I just thought of \\\u0027Speakius-maximus\\\u0027 and boom there it was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy I am here: I am here because I played the demo a while back, as in a very long time ago. Last year I think.. Near summer or something stupid. Anyhow, I am back now because after listening to my IRL friend (HOCgaming) I have finally decided to buy the game and give it another spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything the community should be aware of: If there\\\u0027s anything you lot need to know, I will -TRY- to keep it here. No promises though. Er, to start with I have been a RPer for around 5 years now hence I use proper grammar (or atleast I think I do) at such a fetal age of 14. I am not great at Science, though in top sets it takes me a while to understand something as simple as why apples have worms in them, and why it\\\u0027s bad to find a worm in one when you take a bite. I guess I am also a joker, but not in a jokish way. I am said to make sly jokes which I completely disagree on, needless to say I am always like this. Whatever this is anyhow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy I bother writing this: Not too sure to be honest. Just bored and felt like doing something whilst I wait for my download to.. Eh.. Download.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I guess I shall leave it there for now, if you guys have any tips on how to do stuff, translate it from complicated binary into simple English a cave-man could understand please! Thank you for reading this, and only read this thank you if you read the whole thing. Otherwise, you will not receive a random cookie in your post by tomorrow morning. Before I ramble on, I shall say I will leave it there once more and go. Hoping to see some replies, bye.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-24T16:40:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-24T16:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Dad loves making words sound \\\u0027more latin\\\u0027 by putting -ox at the end or -maximus. :b\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"speakiusmaximus","CreatedById":30086,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-24T17:13:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Luigibro606\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Luigibro606\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Dad loves making words sound \\\u0027more latin\\\u0027 by putting -ox at the end or -maximus. :b\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHah, I doubt Speakox would sound right though.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-24T21:57:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHe likes Cats so I hear \\\u0027Catox\\\u0027 and \\\u0027Felinus Maximus\\\u0027 alot. :U\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deker12","CreatedById":16613,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-25T12:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOLOLOL ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khrissetti","CreatedById":29557,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-25T15:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Luigibro606\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Luigibro606\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe likes Cats so I hear \\\u0027Catox\\\u0027 and \\\u0027Felinus Maximus\\\u0027 alot. :U\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have multum felina maxima circa domum?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-25T17:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...no.
