I was pretty surprised to discover that things are quite a bit more fragile in the full version than they are in the demo.

So, any ships that you built in the demo can also be built in the 0.2101 game. What is different is that larger tanks, engines, and command units are available. You can launch probes instead of risk Kerbals. You can play with aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne major difference is the way SAS controllers operate. The ones built into command modules will be more then adequate for stabilizing your rockets in flight and if you have wobbling now when flying, it is because your rocket needs more bracing to stabilize it. Also, using SAS requires power so you will need solar panels or thermal generators when your engines are not firing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T13:32:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
