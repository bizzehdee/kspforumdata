Also, I can\u0027t find the option to pick an avatar, or set the signature? (I understand Sig option should be in left-hand bar under Settings, but it ain\u0027t. Are Avatars veteran privilege only or is my browser messing with me?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, see y\u0027all in the black!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Andro\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orbiter","CreatedById":53645,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T17:20:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello and welcome to the forums!! Yes, until you have five posts your posts will not appear until a moderator approves them. I believe that this also affects avatars and signatures. As far as I know, you must have five or more posts in order to change your avatar, signature, etc. Because of that, keep posting and have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andr0s","CreatedById":80489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T17:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Orbiter - it looks like I just got cleared, woo \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T20:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wish you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy launchings!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeautiful explosions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeird contraptions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInsane rockets and planes that shouldn\u0027t realistically fly!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T21:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
