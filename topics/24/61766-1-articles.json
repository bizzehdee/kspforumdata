Long time lurker and I decided to finally make an account and start posting, mostly because I thought others might get a kick out of this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/98buUSb.png\u0022 alt=\u002298buUSb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E Kinda reminds me of the concept animations of a cesium fountain clock. Would this be a sighting of one of the Kraken? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Whatever that was, it quickly ate half of Mun Base Ichi and thoroughly annihilated my carefully constructed platform crane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/n1oe7fs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022n1oe7fs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t tell, I\u0027m in the throes of Mun base fever, with a Kethane addiction and ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads to boot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo introductions-wise, I\u0027m a staunch opponent of MechJeb, I like things that move (e.g., KAS, IR), I\u0027m mentally planning the launch profiles and mission parameters for manned resource extraction bases on Duna and Eve and I\u0027ve got a two YEAR orbital probe mission to the Jool system currently in progress (so much for launch windows...). And I\u0027ve done orbital calcs for KSP on paper. More than once. Voluntarily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I\u0027ve already burned through the entire techtree in career mode - legitimately. Finished that before 0.23: only took a [few dozen] series\u0027 of moon missions, three Minmus missions, a Duna landing and an Eve landing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E oh, the sleepless nights...

As you can tell, I\u0027ve been developing heavily within the Kerbin sphere and not much anywhere else. My intent is to use the Mun as a primary launch platform for manned, interplanetary missions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ribbons.cgagnier.ca/redir.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ribbons.cgagnier.ca/image.php?ribbon=20101\u0022 alt=\u0022image.php?ribbon=20101\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIRL, I\u0027m (old.
