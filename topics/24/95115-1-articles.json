I had taken the contract as soon as it has appeared and after a few quick suborbital cash grabs I upgraded my tracking station and researched RCS.

After some orbital manouvering, I had an encounter with an intersection of 2000 meters. Jebediah started burning retrograde 2 minutes to the closest separation node. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EHe missed Adry becouse he forgot to burn on target | He missed Adfry becouse he burned anti-target\u003C/span\u003E He positioned himself 1800m away from him, which Adrfy had to traverse himself. He was going home, kerbals all around Kerbin were crying from happiness in front of their TVs and radios, papers were flying everywhere in mission control, C7 Aerospace has evaded lawsuit etc etc. Damm, Adfry agreed to do some EVA science for me. Amounts of win have skyrocketed in the sector. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe time for retrograde burn home has come. ORV is an extremely safe vehicle - it has 2 parachutes, RCS and basic SAS. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EIt is completely not built by desrowly greedy miser who didn\u0027t stage a decoupler for liquid fuel tanks.\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThe vehicle would land in the mountains west of the desert. The view was increadible. Crew was really enthusiastic. They have not only made something which hasn\u0027t been done ever before - they lived to tell about it. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThe rocket has tipped over on landing and they blew up\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E. How shocked and frightened they had to be when the landing turned out to be on a brink of catastrophic failure when the main fuel tank has exploded on contact with the surface. Thankfully the command pods \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Eand the monopropellant tank #worth!\u003C/span\u003E have survived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, this game is awesome.
