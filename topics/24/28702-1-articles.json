This place has really helped me out to find inspiration for new ships and how to get things done. I really like the community and thought that it is about time I actually joined in! I\u0027ve had the game for a bit of time now and have sunken in over 150 hours on it and I can say they are well worth it. Anyways, just wanted to introduce myself to you all before roaming around the forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m planning on posting some pictures of crafts I\u0027ve made so far soon, so look forwards to that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T05:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad you decided to stop by. I won\u0027t say it\u0027s always a perfect community, but it\u0027s definitely one of the better ones out there, thanks in part to our dedicated moderators. Hope to see some of those craft files soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile you\u0027re here, you might want to stop by the Drawing Board (link in my sig). Many of the tutorials are oriented towards newer players, but there\u0027s still quite a bit of useful info in some of those links even for old hands who just want to learn something new. The people in the How To forums can also answer just about any question you may have about rockets and spaceplanes. Feel free to look around and participate in any forum conversations that strike your fancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kolt","CreatedById":67456,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T17:16:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I have actually used the Drawing Board a couple of times in that past.
