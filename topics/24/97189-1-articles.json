The first couple hours spent were definitely used adjusting to the learning curve, with my first rocket smashing into the launch pad because I staged my chutes wrong, killing poor Jeb. But now after a good 90 hours I can say I\u0027m finally getting into the swing of things, I\u0027m going interplanetary with a planned Duna mission, I\u0027m getting pretty good and docking and rendezvous and I\u0027ve blown through so many quicksaves I\u0027ve lost count. I hope my time here sparks up some good discussion and maybe I can help players still struggling with the things that I now have come to be familiar with!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, glad to be aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T20:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI resisted going interplanetary with Kerbals for months.
