Maybe one thing that helps me here is I passed the private and instrument flight exams during high school ( A Vocational high school with ground school in the programs.). My dad was an airline pilot for years. I also apprenticed for a few years right out of high school in an avionics shop at a Cessna, King Air oriented airport, so, understanding telemetry (Somewhat), avionics, and flight in general, thrust ot weight ratios, CG, and so forth maybe helps in my build projects, thinking all that out front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m amazed at the level of sophistication in this game, despite the cheesy first impression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am automation engineer by trade, robots, PLCS, Vision systems, Sensors, CNC programming, that sort of thing.

Using a standard capsule (Parachute too), some ring fuel tanks with thrusters and stabilizer ring (Think \u0022Press \u0022R\u0022 and \u0022T\u0022 at launch\u0022!), followed by some Rt-800s clustered in triplicate and the 215 HP engines.). First manual flight, having no idea until later what 10K, 70K meters and so forth meant, I just went until the sky was dark and starry, lol...I managed to get my 3 Kerbals into 2 consecutive orbits, watching everything SLOWLY (Afraid to use the time keys), started heating the capsule nose something fierce on reentry, did a nice rotation staying on the mark, got the butt end heating up, slowed it way down and about 2K meters out from the splash down marker, popped the chute, slowed to 8 meters per sec or so and touched down...No Navy, No parades, but that\u0027s okay...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat game guys, keep the new stuff coming...I look forward to spending long hours finding my way throughout the universe, lol...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you all...Out there...maybe!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-27T17:42:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2013 05:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by I_do_robots\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crowdpleaser","CreatedById":79992,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T20:28:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello fellow Spacefarer \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite being new in the Forum, i have a few hours, days even under my Belt.
