That\u0027s really the only way to get anywhere in this game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a more serious note, try uncrewed probes that transmit data on one-way missions. A lot of players are unhappy with those because they only return a small fraction of the potential science gathered. But that doesn\u0027t take into account how cheap they are, and how much science, in absolute terms, they can acquire. I\u0027ve played 2 campaigns now, only sending Kerbals on the first few flights before probe cores are available.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joekidd1992","CreatedById":110769,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T02:15:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it would be bad if you get stuck to take a look at Scott Manley\u0027s tutorial.

What steps do you guys take in order to get to a place that has a different angled orbit? I can get to the mun without problems, but this is harder. Do you match the inclination before attempting the transfer? If so, what icon on the maneuver node do you drag to get into the right inclination?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all answers in advance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENewport\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
