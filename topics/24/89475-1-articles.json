This is my first time posting on the forums. I bought the game a few months ago, got the hang of the basics of construction and flight, and put a few unmanned satellites into orbit. I then got distracted by some other game releases, but I\u0027m back now. Anyways, with the new update, I wanted to try the new career mode, because I\u0027m not great at setting goals for myself, so contracts seemed like a good way to start out simple and slowly grow into the more advanced aspects of the game. Help keep me interested in learning new things instead of just getting stuck with \u0022What do I do next?\u0022 I also felt like managing the whole program would be overall more fun for me than just a space flight sim. Anyways, my attempts to start a new career mode left me stumped, with what to do first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked but couldn\u0027t find any beginner tutorials for the new career mode (all I found were ones for the old career now science mode), so I have some questions about getting started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Do I need to hire kerbals at first?

Should I leave them alone for now?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--How concerned do I need to be about running out of money or other resources early in the career?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--How careful do I need to be with my kerbals?

That way you can start with small, unmanned ships and expand your missions in a logical manner, at your own pace (eg; tutorial in my signature). In science/career mode you are tied to the insanity of the tech-tree and have to start with big, manned vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuildings: VAB=Build ships for launchpad (usually vertical) launch. SPH=Build ships for runway (usually horizontal) launch. Launchpad/runway=pick a ship to launch without going into the VAB/SPH first. Tracking Centre=See all your ships and other things currently \u0027in flight\u0027 and recover, terminate or fly them. Astronaut Complex=hire crew. R\u0026amp;D=tech-tree. Mission Control=contracts. Admin Building=\u0027strategies\u0027. As of 0.25 you can right-click them to see a description. The only one that might be difficult is the new admin building, but there should be some notes about those around (not that I\u0027ve seen them ...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience is usually the bottleneck for new players as, unless you\u0027re crashing all the time money is easy to get (especially \u0027test part X landed at Kerbin\u0027 contracts) and, as sal_vager said, reputation sort of looks after itself. About the only thing you can do to damage reputation is kill Kerbals so, yes try not to! Oh - and don\u0027t blow up your buildings or that\u0027ll cost a lot to repair.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
