Too many games out there these days simply try to get the player to do what the developers want them to do by laying down a trail of breadcrumbs and then \u0022rewarding\u0022 them at the end of it for doing exactly what they were told to. In KSP, however, you can set your own goals and challenges, and when you meet them, you \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E you\u0027ve accomplished something on your own terms. It really is an amazing feeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you ever need help grasping some of the finer points of design or piloting, be certain to check out the Drawing Board (link in my sig), where you can find a number of tutorials and other useful resources for players of all skill levels. Don\u0027t be afraid to ask questions in the How To section as well, as many of the people who frequent that part of the forums have a great deal of experience with the game. Above all, just find a conversation you like, and jump right on in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
