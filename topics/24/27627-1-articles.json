For all its faults, (and what community doesn\u0027t have those?) the forums are some of the friendliest and well-organized I\u0027ve had the pleasure of being a member of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re looking to get the most out of the game you can, I\u0027d highly recommend making use of the Drawing Board (link in my sig) and the \u0022How To\u0022 forums. Many of our more experienced players are quite willing to share their accumulated wisdom if you find yourself in a jam (or even just a lack of ideas on what to do next).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T02:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
