However, I don\u0027t remember what every piece is, and I can\u0027t seem to find some parts that I thought should be installed already. For instance, I can\u0027t find my control pod, or maybe it is stuck inside another part (like a battery) and I can\u0027t see it or get it out. I can see the major parts in the stage list on the bottom right but not every part. And when I click a part, I have no idea what it is - is there any way to tell what this ring I just pulled off my ship is? Rt-click info or something (that didn\u0027t work).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T10:37:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should be able to use a ship again provided you saved it.
