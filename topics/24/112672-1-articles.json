I have explored Kerbin, some of Mun and some of Minmus. Now I\u0027m trying to get a bit further. \n\nI\u0027ve been playing without any mods until yesterday when I installed MechJeb to improve fuel efficiency. Still, I prefer to burn manually since I seem to be constructing rockets with mid-burn stage separations and MJ isn\u0027t brilliant with handling those.\n\nLooking forward to rendezvous with you all around the forums! ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:31:24Z","Content":"Hello, Broda! Welcome to the forums! I\u0027m CaptainApollo, and I\u0027ve been here for about 2-3 weeks or so, I joined almost as soon as I got KSP, but it was worth it because this is an amazing community!\n\nGet ready for many fun times, and you should try some of the challenges that can be found on the respective board, I have only done one but it was a lot of fun, and it felt like a huge accomplishment. You are ahead of me, I have yet to send a Kerbal to another celestial body, but it will (I hope) happen soon!\n\nWelcome! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Broda","CreatedById":145939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T12:18:15Z","Content":"Thanks CaptainApollo!\n\nI\u0027ll be sure to take a stab at some of the challenges out there, looks like tons of fun.\n\nGetting Kerbals to moons is not much more difficult than getting into orbit - getting them back alive is the tricky bit ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T13:04:15Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!\n\nRendezvous is the hardest thing to do in orbit.
