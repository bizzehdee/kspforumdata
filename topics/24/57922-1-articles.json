I certainly haven\u0027t regretted my decision, believe you me! So far I\u0027ve spent about 45 hours (on-and-off) on it, going so far as sending three Kerbals in an orbit around the Mun and then arriving safely at Kerbin (as well as sending numerous xenon probes there). I can\u0027t say that I\u0027m an expert at this game (at all, really) but I\u0027ll keep trying my hardest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh dear, I almost forgot to actually introduce myself!

You may not be an expert, but an orbit-and-return of Mun isn\u0027t bad for 45 hours of experience.
