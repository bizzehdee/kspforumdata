Saw some of the Youtube videos (Munitar?) and thought it looked cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, got home, bought the sim (game?) and ran into my first issue: the controller. I\u0027m using a Logitech 710 wireless controller. It has four \u0022shoulder\u0022 buttons. Two of these are regular on/off switches. Two operate as one half of the \u0022Z\u0022 axis. In the Windows USB Game Controller, mashing one button moves Z to the left; the other to the right. I mapped this, in-game, to the yaw axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is that the ball will only move in one direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T21:54:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi xptical, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not used that controller before so don\u0027t know if it has any specific issues, but I would not be surprised if rawinput, which Unity games use, cannot handle something so complex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully someone else here has one of these and can help you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-10T23:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI unfortenatly, do not own one either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you not ahve a keyboard?

I made a two-stage rocket (solid first then liquid) but I don\u0027t know how to trigger stages off each other. Like, when solid fuel runs out, I want to trigger the decouplers and, maybe, fire the next stage automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got to about 11KM before I gave up on firing the liquid rocket. I clicked the engine and hit space (and throttle up/down) but it didn\u0027t seem to work. Maybe something about fuel pipes? Hmm...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a better description of the components would be awesome. I can flub my way through it, but it would be nice to know why I\u0027m selecting X vice Y.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-11T00:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, when you put decopular on, it appears on right side as \u0022decopular. when you press space, (no clicking) it will activate the decopular. same as liquid engine/solid, dont click, hit space to activate it. make sure you have fuel too for the liquid one!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xptical","CreatedById":55319,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-11T01:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m kinda doing my own thing.
