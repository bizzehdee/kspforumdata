They don\u0027t function all that well, but re-learning the controls and such will help. I would then suggest either sticking to Sandbox and making some rockets or going into Science mode and learning from the ground up. Career is challenging and has more aspects to manage than it\u0027s worth for a new player IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as Endersmens said, go check out tutorials online and on the forum, you\u0027ll be sure to run across some information that will help you.

Maybe the right initial playground for you should be there (once you gather science, no funds costrains and no contracts let you to gather more science fast as you like, going faster to be a sandbox mode with science points/tracking of achieved explorations)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
