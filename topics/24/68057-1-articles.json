Hope you find fun in this game and never escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo play this game without dying all the time, you need to join the Kerbal Space Cult and worship the Kraken so that it doesn\u0027t eat you! Occasionally you have to give it offerings of rocket-flesh and fuel-blood, but other than that the Kraken will leave your ships and sometimes even aid you in your quest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend start by building basic ships that get into orbit easily; bigger usually isn\u0027t better. You might think that more fuel is better, but it also adds weight and drag. Keep it simple, and keep Jeb alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"95tiger59","CreatedById":92346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T22:15:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewelcome! enjoy yourself make sure that before you sit down to play you bring some food a coffee maker and an empty plastic bottle\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaelath","CreatedById":106084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T06:21:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi!
