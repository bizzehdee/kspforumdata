Nothing that was on the tape drive really standout but when we hit the 5.25 floppy drive things took off. Might and Magic 2 got a thrashing and Adventure Construction Set kept my interest for ages. That all I can remember from then but whe nI got my hands on the AT series of IBM\u0027s there were so many more games to dip my toes into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy family has rather unique tastes in games, my daughters seem to stick to what they know, the first real game I introduced to , Minecraft. They do venture out to other games (usually when I drag them) but they drift back to that. While my wife still stays on the outer fringe of gaming and plays on Facebook and Pogo. Sadly, they dont have much interest in KSP. Probably a touch technical for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
