Now for the part of us currently writing this message, I am a 37 trained artist, who throughout his modest career has been tinkering (with variable success) with various tools, including Small Stone phaser pedals, analog vocoders and a chainsaw. I live in France, and enjoy trying to put 200-tons houses of cards in orbit while listening to space rock. Or catchy space disco tunes.\n\nCheers !"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T22:03:45Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums!
