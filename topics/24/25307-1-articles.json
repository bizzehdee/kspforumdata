I have tried building a few ships to get rid of it. The first was my Mantis class which I made grasper out of landing gear. It grasped really wel, but I couldn\u0027t control the vessel once clamped. I thought it was a balance issue so I went a little simpler and made my Spider class with a giant scoop (I call it the web even if it\u0027s a flat panel \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E ). I made a nice gentle contact, but this tiny bit of debris would not budge it\u0027s trajectory. It\u0027s like it was super massive and I merely made of paper. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDose KSP handle physics differently on uncontrolled objects? Is it \u0022cheating\u0022 ( I know there\u0027s no exact cheating in a sandbox game, but I\u0027m looking for player opinions) having gone through all that development to simply bracket to the debris and end flight?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EsvDefcon","CreatedById":62949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T21:43:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best thing to do is to keep the debris out of orbit in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do this, you should try to create stages which will burn when you are in such an orbit that your periapsis is inside of Kerbin.

I have gotten pretty good at having everything crash back on Kerbin.
