I finally bought the game a few days ago and I was wondering if there were tutorials or how to threads on docking and space plane construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have put the beginning of a station in orbit around Kerbin but I don\u0027t know how to dock other modules so that I can complete construction and get some kerbals on board. I have made some jets, but they all have a habit to pitch up or down and sometimes the reaction wheels can\u0027t do enough to help and if they do then when I have to turn the problem ensues as I generally have to turn off the SAS to maneuver. I have seen various threads touching somewhat on the topic of docking, but I was wondering if someone could refer me to the best ones on these topics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI currently have the beginnings of a space and a half-dozen satellites/probes in orbit (I say slash because a couple of them have enough fuel to possibly go somewhere and I haven\u0027t decide where to send them.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T00:57:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to youtube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFind Scott Manley.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe has excellent video tutorials on both of those and so much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Welcome to the game, enjoy yourself. A word of advice is don\u0027t aim too high to start. KSP is one of those \u0027Easy to learn, hard to master\u0027 type games. It\u0027s easy to learn the basics and orbit stuff but actually \u0027mastering\u0027 the game by doing things such as building a base on Eeloo or putting a space station around Moho is very, very hard. You should work your way up and enjoy the climb because there is just so much to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother word of advice: KSP only runs 32 bit (at least until the next update) and has a limit of 4GB ram and has no multi-threading. There is a limit to part count before unbearable lag sets in. It is different for everyone but the average I have seen is about 400-500. Keep that in mind especially for space stations. Also don\u0027t have a ton of mods. Mods add a lot to this game but you have to avoid having too many massive parts packs like KW Roecketry, Novapunch, Lack Luster Labs, etc etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome, enjoy, and have fun building insanely kerbal things like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img842/9184/954l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022954l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img690/980/wju.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wju.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd seeing pretty plasma shock heating effects like this (taken while aerobraking at Jool):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img59/8775/kngz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kngz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-22T01:03:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2013 01:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"B15hop","CreatedById":68462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T01:05:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlways remember two things when building.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep weight distribution as even as possible.
