I have landed on Eve and Duna (Only Rover on Duna), but I can\u0027t land on the Mun. Apart from that, I have been enjoying the game for the time I have had it.

Someome will probably come along in a moment and recommend a skybox mod for you, but that\u0027s not my area of expertise. One thing I might be able to help with, though, is Mun missions. I wrote an illustrated walkthrough which comes with a (sandbox) trainer ship you can download.
