I managed to make orbit and do a transfer and orbital insertion to the Mun but landing failed miserably. Probably because i am a terrible pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried out some aircraft stuff and probably didn\u0027t start with the easiest (flying back an Aeris 4A from orbit). It was horribly unstable even after pumping as much fuel forward as possible. I somehow landed it on the runway and only broke the middle engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like the aircrafts in this game so i would appreciate some suggestions on what aircrafts are easy to fly for a beginner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKukuc96\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T16:20:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Kukuc96, and welcome to the forum. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E And actually, it sounds like you\u0027re off to a good start.

I thought the same as Vanamonde on reading your post; getting to orbit is a pretty big achievement on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is not as good an aircraft as spacecraft simulator and the \u0027stock\u0027 vehicles supplied with KSP are deliberately \u0027wrong\u0027 in various ways to give you a challenge. If you care to look at chapters 2 and 4 of my tutorial there are two \u0027planes there that are easy to fly - including a download for the first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kukuc96","CreatedById":113464,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T19:44:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the responses the tutorial looks very detailed.
