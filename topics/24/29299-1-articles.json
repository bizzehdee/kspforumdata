My name is Gary and I\u0027m from South Carolina. I am not a native from this area, and I don\u0027t have an accent. We just moved from south Jersey. I\u0027m a software engineer so I hope I\u0027ll fit in. I\u0027m a PC\u0027er but I like Mac too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for my hobbies, I\u0027ve been in 3d modeling and game design for the last 25 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\u0027ve been messing with KSP for about 3 days now and I\u0027m totally hooked. I saw this game on Steam while looking for my Skyrim stuff, (Skyrim rocks to mod) but thought it looked lame, so I did some digging and read the forums here, then went back and downloaded the demo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter playing the demo until after midnight, I got up the next morning and bought it off Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteam doesn\u0027t do this game justice at all. You can\u0027t get a feel for what the game is really about until you watch a few you tube movies (Scott Manley) on how cool it really is, oh and I had to visit the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not just another shoot-em-up, or a kids game, it\u0027s a relaxing real life thinking game and I\u0027m loving it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve recommended it to a few friends that may get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few questions that I\u0027ll not post here because this is a hello world thread. So hello to all! I hope to learn and help others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you around!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Gary\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T14:13:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I currently reside in South Carolina, myself.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T19:40:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad to hear that your initial impression of the game didn\u0027t discourage you from trying it out. A lot of the visual aspects probably are designed to make the game more appealing to a younger crowd, but there\u0027s plenty of fun and challenge for players of all ages. KSP is deceptively easy to learn, but quite hard to master -- which is just the way I, for one, like it (although I don\u0027t claim to have mastered it by any measure myself!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need any help with a particular mission, or if you just want to learn more about how to make your rockets perform better than they are now, take a look at some of the tutorials and other resources that have been collected in the Drawing Board (link in my sig). The people in the How To section of the forums will also be more than happy to answer any questions you may have about vehicle design and space travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bellino","CreatedById":67962,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T22:24:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESouth Carolina FTW!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T14:30:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
