I am new to the KSP forums and have been playing KSP (a little obsessively) for a while now. I feel I\u0027ve mastered docking and landing on Kerban\u0027s moons and I am starting to get into interplanetary travel. I had a question regarding the interplanetary burns. I\u0027m supposed to burn prograde at the right ejection angle (which is no problem) but as the burn goes on, the actual prograde vector in the navball strays away from where I\u0027m pointing. The question is, should I be changing direction to follow it during the burn or not?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T02:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you think about it, staying on prograde while it changes will get you the most velocity increase for your burn, but staying pointing the same way will change the direction of the velocity slightly as well as increasing speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say compare the manoeuvre node orbit to your actual orbit - if they diverge significantly, point at the node marker, but if they\u0027re almost the same, point prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Welcome to the community!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MajorThomas","CreatedById":94499,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T06:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d suggest:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Time it such that you do half your burn before you reach the \u0022node\u0022 and the second half of your burn after the node. This gives me best results. For instance, for a 2 minute burn, start your burn one minute before the node, and keep going for 2 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Yes, chase the blue vector as it moves away at the end of the burn. But do it carefully...cut thrust and repoint yourself, rather than do it at full thrust. That little bit of vector wobble at the end is what I think of as the \u0022residual\u0022 and gives you a chance to correct the error introduced by being pointed off the vector slightly during the main burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shna_na","CreatedById":14950,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T13:30:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recommend using maneuver nodes to get the result you want and following that node (the blue one) and burning until the Delta V needed for the burn is at 0.0m/s.
