(you can run but you cannot hide! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )\n\nSince my last post about a year or more ago... I have moved house AND gotten married again.\n\nIn all that time, I have been playing KSP, I even have a mun base now of sorts. \n\nSo, I hope to interact with the community more often now since 1.0 came out (and the better 1.2) because, NOW.... no more frustration with broken saves due to updates.\n\nI even purchased a faster computer JUST for this game, a quad core, I could have gone faster, but its still better than a dual core I was playing KSP on.\n\nAny how... I am back. A special note to the authors, and Mod authors. ~~~ Seriously, I love you all! Your rock my Kerbal world! ~~~\n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T05:53:04Z","Content":"Welcome back, dont forget to give your love the required attention aside KSP, i tell you from experience ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nMost important thing in my life aside my love was allways a supersupersuperfast PC, then work, eat, sleep, and all the other things that come around.\n\nHave a good time!"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T05:56:59Z","Content":"Welcome back!\n\nWe\u0027ve been waiting!"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T07:04:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Welcome back, dont forget to give your love the required attention aside KSP, i tell you from experience ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\u003E Most important thing in my life aside my love was allways a supersupersuperfast PC, then work, eat, sleep, and all the other things that come around.\n\u003E \n\u003E Have a good time!\n\nOh, I do, that is why my KSP is often taking a back seat, Valentina has been on the Mun for ages because I haven\u0027t had the time, but as a side note, my new wife, Rianne, absolutely LOVES the adventures of KSP... soon, she will be starting her own game (so even less time for me to play, but hey, sharing the love of KSP is a good thing!)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Welcome back!\n\u003E We\u0027ve been waiting!\n\nIf only you knew...
