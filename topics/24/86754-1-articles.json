It\u0027s just a lot easier to make multiple copies in whichever folders you want - just unzip it several times. For the same reason you don\u0027t need to remove the demo if you still think you\u0027ll get some use for it. The demo\u0027s still on my machine so I can check how things work in it if someone asks a question that specifically needs the demo.

So long as the copies are for your \u003Cem\u003Eown personal use\u003C/em\u003E, I don\u0027t think Squad care. If you\u0027re installing it all around the office (where many people might be playing it), it might be nice if you bought multiple copies. Otherwise though, copy it to as many machines or locations as you feel necessary for your own enjoyment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you bought from the KSP store on the main website, you get the choice of a self-extracting installer .exe, or you can get a zip file (my personal preferred option) and just extract it to wherever you like. From Steam, you can still download the game and then copy it straight out of the Steamapps folder. For people who do things like modding the game (or playing with mods that don\u0027t work with 0.25 yet), having multiple installations isn\u0027t just nice, but damned near essential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the demo, well, as mentioned above, get rid of it. Unless you want the nostalgia value, it\u0027s a rather old version of the game, it\u0027s restricted in parts and the ability to modify, and includes nowhere near the number of features of the full game that you now have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd don\u0027t forget to have fun.
