(Which Frankly is fabulous)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve a fascination in spaceflight (both from a physics sense and historical sense), and have spent at least a year or so playing on Orbiter, which is kind of like KSP, but much more focused on realistic orbital physics (n-body systems etc), but (for obvious reasons isn\u0027t as fun). I eventually decided I\u0027d like to start designing my own rockets (you can do that on Orbiter, but I\u0027ve never been very good with coding etc)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fell in love with KSP as soon as I started playing it, and after fiddling around with several unsuccessful rocket designs, I finally got the hang of it (yes I understand the irony that I wanted to create my own rockets, and then ended up using someone else\u0027s to land on the Mun)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to exploring more of the program, and excited for more updates...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T20:21:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T20:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Frednutts, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think KSP\u0027s \u0022build it yourself, fly it yourself\u0022 nature is what makes it so much fun, the physics are there for proper orbital activities yet it\u0027s still accessible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
