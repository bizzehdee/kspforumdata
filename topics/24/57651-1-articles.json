I\u0027ve already become fairly proficient at achieving Kerbin orbit. My short term goals are to orbit around Mun, do some SCIENCE, and play with different types of orbits around Kerbin (Molniya orbits are very intriguing). Right now I\u0027m in test phases of my rocket to Mun. I think an extra solid booster stage should leave me with enough fuel to make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T01:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Glad to hear that you\u0027ve been enjoying the game, and that you\u0027re experimenting with different things.
