Just got kerbal space program and loving it already (already wasted some all-nighters finishing that one craft). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a student of Aerospace engineering at the Delft university of technology (final year of my bachelor, going for a master in systems \u0026amp; control), so KSP is really \u0022close to home\u0022. (Hey it\u0027s only 100km away \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ). I love being able to bring my practice of knowing hohmann tranfer orbits, tsjolkowsky rocket equation and gravity pulls into practice. Really fun to do it, especially when you can ignore the tiresome calculations that come with finding the correct time to burn to have a rendez-vous (just let the time skip or use some extra fuel so you don\u0027t need the ideal path).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve started with career mode and (I guess as expected) initially had quite some troubles with especially rendezvous / eva. Now I\u0027ve got a polar and equatorial \u0022station\u0022 orbitting the planet, and am about to create a real habitat on the mun. Just a bit annoyed that my last mission was a huge failure: I putted \u0022non snapped\u0022 clamp-o-trons on top of mk1 modules, which I just noticed lack a \u0022decouple\u0022 mode because the engine doesn\u0027t consider them well attached. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for some future, I really hope to see someday a \u0022random solar system generation mod\u0022, which generates a random system given a lot of planets/moons, so that every game is different (AKA minecraft). Also I\u0027d love to see in the future a \u0022vs\u0022 mode for multiplayer. Where you both have your own system and you actually have to race for the contracts (both players will get the same contracts, and the first one to complete gets the price the other just a small price like 1/5th science/gold \u0026amp; no reputation).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T23:47:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, it\u0027s always nice to see someone who can appreciate the \u0027serious\u0027 side of KSP while still having fun :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
