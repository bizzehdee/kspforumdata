Therefore decided to go for the MechJeb plugin. Better but not exactly what I have in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink the best way would be to be able to programm steering events and put it into the staging list\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6.something like \u00E2\u20AC\u0153roll 90\u00C2\u00B0 right\u00E2\u20AC or \u00E2\u20AC\u0153pitch \u00E2\u20AC\u201C10\u00C2\u00B0\u00E2\u20AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6Just to programm the trajectory, leaving the corrections to the pilot to make good for in flight what was made wrong on the ground. Should be more realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only a countdown would be fine but also GO or NOGO signals for the systems\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6those systems that has to be prepared for flight\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6hey\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6there is something missing between the VAB and the Ramp\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6whats with the flight preparation procedures on the ramp. If you cut lines wrong time and feed the tanks to early\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6those beasts wouldn\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t fly\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6or at least not as long as they should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spaceport itself is a little small. Usualy for every rocket system there is a separate launch pad. And a museum or hall of fame there would be fine\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6.with mission patches with the names of our heros, pictures and artifacts from historic missions. Lets put also some statistics in this building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy highest achieved speed so far is 9.573m/s with a weight on the ramp of 15,3t\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6.and escaping Kerbal gravity\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6.seems to be somehow unrealistic\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6or?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-11T21:19:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khrissetti","CreatedById":29557,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-12T11:23:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\\\u0027d like to add how envious I am that you live in possibly the most beautiful city in the world.
