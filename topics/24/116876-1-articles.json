Sort of a mix between a Klingon and a seven-foot ogre in powered armor. Of course, in those tales a daredevil hero with a blazing rocket always saves the galaxy, defying all laws of physics, logic, and his own ship\u0027s fuel tank capacity in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Modern Kerbal science has long ago debunked those Kerlywood fantasies. If protein life was to develop on a super-Kerbin the size of Jool, the \u0022giants\u0022 would be crushed under their own weight long before they\u0027d have a chance to invent any kind of powered armor. The laws of the universe simply do not allow for existence of such ridiculous creatures!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But if those aliens do exist, wouldn\u0027t it be terrifyingly fun for any self-respecting Kerbal to abduct some of them and study in lab conditions? Just think of the amount of SCIENCE that can be gained from examining such a monster... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JPxq5M3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JPxq5M3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Hi! \\o/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T14:53:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoah....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat a fantastic entrance!
