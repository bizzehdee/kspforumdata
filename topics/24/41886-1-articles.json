Tonight was my first Mun attempt in 0.21 after spending time building a 49-Kerbal space station and a RemoteTech satellite network. I first dropped an un-kerbaled hitchhiker pod and rover on Mun in preparation for a manned landing -- except I lost control of the rover while detaching from the pod, and it wound up stuck on its back like a turtle. OK, minor setback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI proceeded with the manned launch, docked with Kerbal International Space Station in its 300-km orbit to take on fuel, and set sail for the Mun. I lined up the orbit just right to land next to the hitchhiker pod, eased the lander into descent, and ran out of fuel at about 1,000 meters. Took me a few seconds to realize I\u0027d forgotten to run a fuel line from the center fuel tank to the outboard rockets. I frantically fumbled at my keyboard in an attempt to transfer fuel, but by the time I was about 100 meters above the ground I had fuel in one outboard tank. Apparently I need to work on keeping my cool in pressure situations. I panicked and hit the throttle, firing that single rocket and sending the lander head over heels, no doubt intensifying the sheer panic of Edan, Kenberry and Mitbert\u0027s last few moments. My first deaths since death became permanent. I\u0027m kinda sad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut hey, what can ya do? Tomorrow, I might remember to quicksave before the descent. Anyway, hi everybody.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T21:14:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome Amphibious Rodent\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T16:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
