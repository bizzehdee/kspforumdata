Just recently found this game and have only really started playing it the past couple of days. It\u0027s certainly a steep learning curve and coming on here the amount of info and the things you can do is a bit overwhelming when you see it all for the first time. Decided I would just start grinding away in career mode without too much playing in sandbox. Currently trying to get into orbit (I understand the theory and can get a nice circular orbit in sandbox), but I can\u0027t quite get there without running out of fuel. I can get a nice Ap, but when I get to the burn to raise the Pe I have to stop as I wouldn\u0027t have enough fuel to get back. I think I\u0027m being limited by the weight limit rather than parts. I\u0027ve upgraded the VAB and unlocked the first 5 bits of the tech tree. Do I need to upgrade the launch pad for the weight limit to increase? Just making my way through some contracts now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you guys some mods for me. Not looking for anything too \u0022cheaty\u0022, just some cool parts or info displays/panels etc to help with the game. Are there any other general recommendations for this game? What sort of things can I be doing while not in career mode? There is so much possibility it\u0027s hard to know what to do/try first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this was a bit of a ramble.
