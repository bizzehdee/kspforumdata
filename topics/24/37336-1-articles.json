Outside of maybe a dozen mods like Kethane, ISA_MAP, Damned/Infernal Robotics, Hooligan Airships, and Kerbal Attachment System, most mods are about improving the interface or providing parts that look different or are differently balanced rather than adding something that just can\u0027t be done in a stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PringleMan","CreatedById":1396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T20:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed. Some mods like LackLuster\u0027s pack or the Wayland Corp stuff or Bobcat Industries or KSPX are pretty much just part packs. Some of the parts may do really cool things, but it is still just a part that looks nice. Other mods like FAR or Deadly ReEntry change the way the game works. For example FAR changes the entire aerodynamics system of the game. There are also mods that add functionality to the editors and stuff.

It is easy to launch into orbit with no rolling or shaking. You may also be able to orbit Mun or Minmus but may need the thrusters to complete the orbital insertion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWant to go to Mun or Minmus with this design and land your probe there? Add a set of four TT-38K radical decouplers and attach a set of 4 RT-10 Solid Fuel boosters. Start the Gravity Turn after the boosters burn out, are dropped, and the first stage engine powered up. To land on Mun or Minmus, descend with the fuel in the second stage and ditch it when you have killed all orbital speed at about 3,000 meters. Use the probe thrusters to control landing as well as to kill all horizontal movement. Be sure Window\u0027s Sticky Keys are disabled. Land in daylight where shadows are present so you can tell when to slow down to 3 m/s or less and kill all horizontal speed to land. My second attempt was successful placing a probe on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis basic design has probes in orbit around Kerban. The booster design has a probe on Mun and one orbiting Minmus ready to land. An Onion Design using the basic rocket as stage 3 and 4 is currently orbiting Ike with fuel left in stage 3 after doing a Duna flyby. A similar design is orbiting Eve. On that design, an added thruster fuel tank is needed to aid in maneuvers since this rocket in orbit is too large to orientate on the ASAS alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-16T21:03:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2013 09:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZenViolence","CreatedById":74429,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T07:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESRV Ron,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust out of curiosity, at which altitude would you start your gravity turn with this design, and how aggressive are you with it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T11:02:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZenViolence\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZenViolence\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESRV Ron,\u003Cp\u003EJust out of curiosity, at which altitude would you start your gravity turn with this design, and how aggressive are you with it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI start about 5* when the boosters drop off.
