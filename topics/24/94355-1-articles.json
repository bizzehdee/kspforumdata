I\u0027ve been playing since around version 0.22 I left it for a while but now that the Beta was released I started playing again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my first save I didn\u0027t amount to much I explored the hell out of Kerbin, Mun and Minmus and left tons of flags there. I managed to send a rover to Duna, two probes around Duna and Ike, and a manned mission to Duna\u0027s surface with a successful return. I also sent a probe to Eve. This time I\u0027m aiming to play in career mode and put a flag on all solid objects on the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T11:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell you\u0027ve done more than me and I\u0027ve been playing since .20.2 and welcome to the forums\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T15:43:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBe advised that Career has become a lot harder on KSP 0.90 Beta. Proceed slowly, do lots of selected contracts to raise lots of funds. You will need them to upgrade KSP before you can build and launch larger rockets, EVA in space, collect soil samples, or use navigation aids for planning orbital maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
