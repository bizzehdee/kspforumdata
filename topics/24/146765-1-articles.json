I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll like it here. As for mods, I\u0027m a fan of playing stock untill I feel I need something, then I\u0027ll look for a mod that matches my needs. Others prefer to go all out and install every mod they like the sound of, so it\u0027s very much a personal thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-29T23:22:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/87737-ksp-v113-stock-bug-fix-modules-release-v113b1-10-jul-16/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the best quality of life mod. \u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SorryDave","CreatedById":119474,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-30T03:15:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad you decided to take the dive. \u00A0A good mod to start with is Kerbal Engineer Redux, it was my.first mod and the one I still find most useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
