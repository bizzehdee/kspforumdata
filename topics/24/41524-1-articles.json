I discovered this game 2 days ago, and tried the demo. Since it had me making rockets for 5 hours straight, and going into orbit to the sun (fortunate mistake \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E) yesterday I bought it. Still having fun, but I was surprised by the lack of extra content such as training scenarios, scenarios etc. I have managed to get stuff into orbit pretty easily, but haven\u0027t really figured a design to leave orbit for the Mun or towards another planet. Much less land a \u0022Rover\u0022 or something like that. I\u0027d greatly appreciate some advice from people who have been playing this game longer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a bunch!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrUberGr","CreatedById":78026,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T03:39:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd to be more specific...
