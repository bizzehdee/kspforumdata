I consider myself a bright person but this game makes me feel dumb. So addicted and so glad i found a game that gets my grey matter working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far i have learned a ton about rocket design orbital maneuvers and just the other day I was thinking, \u0022so thats what delta V means\u0022 to myself while reading the wiki.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am working on docking right now and just cant seem to close that last 1000m gap correctly. Kerbal orbit, circularizing it, switching to a Munar orbit and getting back I managed to get the hang of. So much to learn. Looking forward to a bright future for this game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RawChicken","CreatedById":57199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T12:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks good! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple videos in youtube on how to dock, that last gap is possibly the hardest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are trying with RCS right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you select the target and where it says \u0022orbital\u0022 velocity, click till you get \u0022Target\u0022..that is your relative velocity with the taget.

If you hit the ship and make it spin, try going back to that other ship and realigning it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you are starting to spin uncontrollably or want the ship to stop spinning, hit \u0022.\u0022 and time accelerate.
