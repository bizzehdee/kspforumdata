A simulator that appeals to a fascination with space and rocketry as well as making the subject accessible without dumbing it down struck just the right chord with me. I guess a solid way to introduce myself within the context of this game is to talk about what I\u0027ve done and what I hope to do with later missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I didn\u0027t know much about orbital mechanics and rockets going into the game, I like to think I\u0027ve learned a lot (Thanks, Scott Manley!) and plan to learn a lot more in order to reach ever more distant planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a list accomplishments under my belt including several successful Minmus and Mun landings, multiple successful lines of rockets, gathered data from a probe passing through Eve\u0027s SoI, learned how to perform a basic orbital rendezvous, and I am working on construction of a refueling station orbiting Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is so much I plan to do in the future. For now, I\u0027d love to land a rover on the Mun, successfully orbit and land on Duna, and complete my refueling station. That station would do so much to boost the lifespan of my trusty Triton line of rockets! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I hope to become a member of the community and talk with you about everything related to traveling among the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T01:42:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou already are a member of the community. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Welcome to the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shasol","CreatedById":98875,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T07:04:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Story Books\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Story Books\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I hope to become a member of the community and talk with you about everything related to traveling among the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving an account and posting makes you a member and friends will come along the way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy flying\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T00:52:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, the good old days, when one still hasn\u0027t hit the [AIRQUOTES]not seeing the light of day for a month and a half[/AIRQUOTES] stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022One does not simply play KSP and walk away\u0022\u003C/em\u003E...
