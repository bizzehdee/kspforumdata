Like to observe tumbling satellites, geostationary satellite flares during equinoxes, LEO satellite flares (and calculate them, to enjoy them not only from Iridiums ;D), Yaogan triangle formations and NOSS couples. Translated Heavens-Above to Russian and Ukrainian languages; interested in translating Kerbal Wiki also ;D\n\nBecome Kerbonaut about 2 months ago. Because if I like to observe sats, why not learn some orbital mechanics in practice? ;D\n\nGaming in Science mode, with modified tech tree (as for me, Squad\u0027s one was illogical). Flied all the Kerbin in plane, now constructing a satellite network (SCANSat plugin is the first I\u0027ve installed, lol) using modified Kerbal X (for heavy ones) and Mapsat launch kit (for light ones), with first space station, Skynet. Setted a lot of Separtrons in last stages for clear space ;D.\n\nThe most exciting mission I had is one to correct the orbit of my first SAR satellite, Lacrosse 1. When putting it in orbit, during separation of the last stage the satellite was pushed in 750x850 km orbit instead of 750x750, and so became inoperable during half of every orbit. I was very lucky to set a docking port on it, \u0022just in case!\u0022 ;D So that I managed to modify Kerbal X with RCS and dock myself with Lacrosse (I\u0027m enjoyed the docking procedure at all, It\u0027s always very interesting!). After correcting the orbit and undocking, I saw that I have only about 1/5 of fuel of Kerbal X upper stage, and about 600 of RCS. And there is began the sweat! After using all RCS and remained fuel, I achieved a perikerbin of 35 km. But I absolutely didn\u0027t know how I will slow down from 2,5 km/s to some hundreds km/s without blowing up... And there I was again lucky to install 3.75 m heat shield, \u0022just in case\u0022 again! And mission was successful...\n\nWell, there\u0027s no questions like \u0022How do I build my first rocket\u0022, because I have already let my rockets don\u0027t fly backwards, but side forward ;D By reading the Wiki basics, tutorials and so on.\n\nFor moderators: please delete my first post, in the neighboring theme... I tried to delete it, but can\u0027t find the magic button :/\n\nHappy landings, like mine ;D"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T13:11:54Z","Content":"Welcome aboard, 1valdis!\n\nI took care of the other post for you. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"1valdis","CreatedById":148940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T13:35:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I took care of the other post for you. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWell, now I know that there\u0027s kind moderators ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ZentroCatson","CreatedById":143939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T14:27:32Z","Content":"Welcome to the space program!

You can do both! Analyze the data in the lab and it\u0027s still in the original capsule to take home to Kerbin. That\u0027s the power of the science lab.\n\n2. No. It may be best to choose one type for your whole program so that everything can dock with everything else, depending on your needs.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"1valdis","CreatedById":148940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T16:58:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 2.

Opposite things. You don\u0027t need a telescope for satellites (just because they do moving, how do you will track them?), but you need a binoculars! With, surely, as much FOV and aperture, as possible.\n\nPS. I have both. And I watched through telescope on the sats only on the ISS. Everything else is too small to see some details. Also, binoculars quicker to set up (they just not need a set up, yep? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) ) and more comfortable to see through.\n\nBTW, there\u0027s many sats you can see with naked eye. Interesting sats. I get started with naked eye: ISS, Iridiums, rotating (thus flashing) sats, etc.\n\nClear skies."}]}
