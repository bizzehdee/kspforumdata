Introductory thread, and stuff. Hi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m Ashflare, because I was not very imaginative 9 years ago when I chose my screen name, and, alas, it kinda stuck. Professional slacker, nerd by nature, and excessive gamer. Which, all in all, makes this my perfect game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still something of a noob in this; I\u0027ve managed to land on the Mun a couple times, with only the occasional fiery explosion. I once managed an orbital rendezvous, but never managed to replicate it again. I\u0027ve also managed to, on one occasion, miss the Mun entirely and end up in a solar orbit. Happy days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore to the point, I\u0027ve been tentatively wading into the dark murky world of rovers today. My first tiny, unmanned testing probe worked fairly well, I explored the Mun\u0027s surface a little, and by happy chance, found the Neil Armstrong memorial, which increased my love for the game tenfold. Seriously, I had no idea there was anything actually on the Mun, I was just driving around for the sake of it, spotted something in the distance, and broke out into cries of childish glee when I got close enough to see what it was. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving some minor trouble designing a larger, manned rover, due to reasons, but I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll get that figured out.
