Do suborbital flights, learn how to perform an efficient gravity turn to get a larger rocket into stable orbit and return. Next, do a Mun, then Minmus flyby. Then orbit, land and return from there, do Minmus first. Finally, go interplanetary and return. Then, when you feel ready to tackle colonization, you can download the mods for inflatable habitats, Ketane mining, etc..., and start building the bases from multiple launches. But, do practice landing multiple missions as closely as possible on your target planet or moon before tackling the task of building bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike Jupiter, it is impossible to land on Jool.
