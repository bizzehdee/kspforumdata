I guess that was around late last year. Since that, I didn\\\u0027t played a lot. But I regularly checked some videos on youtube from an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eastrophysicist guy\u003C/a\u003E wanting to send a rocket to the sun... among other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis week-end I saw some new exciting videos from this \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eeve pilot\u003C/span\u003E guy trying and succeeding to land on a distant stellar object called Minmus. What!? There is... You can... land on another planet? Woah, I gotta do this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a few tutorials and wiki articles later, I got the new (for me) KSP v0.15 tonight! Yay!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of fun that last few hours! So I wanted to say hello...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Hello there! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the big story:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy objective tonight was to build a rocket and go to the mun. Without embedding my crew in the ground, if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI crashed into moon the first time... Missed it badly the second time (still did not got the mun rise trick right atm), managed to bring back my crew alive. Modded my ship. And after ten or so missions I\\\u0027m orbiting the mun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile slowing my ship down, sending my trajectory deep into the mun to approache a nice cleared area, I notice a strange blinking white pixel thing on the surface. Mhh, that must be a gap between polygons... that should stay there for a while and disappear as I get closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s3.arkolab.org.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/mun1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mun1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr is it? I had to left some unexploded debris behind when I crashed into the mun earlier... This thing is not rendering glitch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I decide to set my trajectory into this thing. I have to see that up close! A few surprisingly easy adjustments later...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s3.arkolab.org.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/mun3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mun3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait, this is not a debris!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s3.arkolab.org.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/mun5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mun5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoly cr*p, this is some sort of ancient artefact!

In fact I was not that far from succeding, but had too much lateral velocity, a few m/s, tilted, bang.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s3.arkolab.org.s3.amazonaws.com/misc/mun7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mun7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood news is that my crew survived the crash! I should set a rescue mission. Okay, this will be very hard if not impossible. And yes, the chute is destroyed. Even if I bring them back to Kerbin, how will they land safely? Will we have to dug them out of the ground? No, no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd no! I wont let my courageous kerbals drying-out out there in the cold! I shall rescue them, they\\\u0027ll have to wait a while though while I find a plan.
