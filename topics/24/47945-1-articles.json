I was 10 in July of \u002769 and I grew up in a small SE Ohio town. Our High School mascot was the Golden Rockets. I used my newspaper route money to buy materials from Centauri and Estes, and I tried to garner interest in forming a model rocketry club at the same High School.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the hobby had fallen away as I went to college and found wargaming was easier to sustain and maintain. Though even now I will stop and took at the Estes stuff in the hobby stores (Though Centauri had the best looking rocket kits).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a lot of years have gone by, and I\u0027m still a gamer, both tabletop and computer, and it took a visit to FARK to show me that KSP existed. I downloaded the demo and played around with it and finally purchased it yesterday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI headed straight off to the HAB and built my own version of the SR-71 and while finding out that the aerospike engines wouldn\u0027t work, I was able to get the plane to fly with an engine change. Which brings up my first question...How do you end a flight? I was able to land it, but I\u0027m far from the airfield. Next question...is there a pointer available (toggle able) to point back to the launch site?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking to build and fly aerospace craft like the Dyna-Soar project and the Lifting-Bodies like the HL-10 and X-24. I just started to explore the B3 Aerospace Pack, but even then I don\u0027t see the components I\u0027m looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m going to play around some more, build my own weird stuff, but I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll have more questions later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-10T20:01:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2013 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Darkeldar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T19:58:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the community Darkeldar \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPress Escape and return to the space center, you can end your flights from the tracking station screen, not sure about the pointer though, if you leave a craft at the space center you should be able to target it in the map screen, giving you a pink target marker on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of us just get used to switching to the map with M and dead reckoning though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a lot of addon parts, and if you don\u0027t find what you need then someone will probably make them if you ask.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck with your designs, and fly safe \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkeldar","CreatedById":83293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T00:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the welcome...I rebuilt the aerospace-plane with Sabre S engines and while it still takes most of the runway to take off, I have no problem getting it over 10K and over Mach 1.

I\u0027m having issues putting wing tips on a aerospace payload built in the VAB (one pointing up, the other down), that I believe I have to build the payload in the HAB, bring it to the VAB, translate it to a vertical orientation and then build the launch vehicle underneath it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan KSP do something like NB-52 and X-Plane flights?
