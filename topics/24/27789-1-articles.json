Or I\u0027m just misunderstanding something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Once placed, an EAS-4 Strut Connector can sometimes not be removed. From the top of a radially mounted Rockomax Jumbo 64 tank to the side of the center rocket a few meters up. Only way to remove it is to remove ALL the parts it\u0027s connected to and rebuild. Otherwise the Strut Connector comes right back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Often times impossible to place radially mounted things that looks to fit if I don\u0027t allow clipping in the debug settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* How do I nudge things up/down/sideways? Do I always have to place tall parts by mounting them in the middle?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this things that somebody else recognizes? If not, I must ask around a bit more what I have missed. I looked around on the Wiki but didn\u0027t find anything helpful there. Some threads on the forum mentions problem mounting radially, maybe that\u0027s what I\u0027m experiencing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, thank you for the best game I\u0027ve played in a long time :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"austin4050","CreatedById":66368,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T00:27:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also recognize this, but just ignore it, and live with it like all bugs in a game. As for the EAS-4 Strut, place it on the part you are going to connect it to not the Rockomax Jumbo 64. The impossible place glitch is common you can just place it somewhere else then change it to where you want it, easy fix. For the middle \u0022glitch\u0022 you described it could just be that you need to press \u0022C\u0022 to disable octagonal placing \u0022it moves the part you want to add depending on the center location of the other part\u0022. You can nudge things by holding the \u0022Shift\u0022 key and using Q,E,A,S,D for rotation movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helped!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T01:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can be hard to remove a strut, but it can be done if you can click on just the right spot of the origin nub. Also, if you haven\u0027t done anything else yet, you can undo the part placement with ctrl-z.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T01:06:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T02:57:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadial parts not wanting to place is a known bug, but there\u0027s a few workarounds for it that don\u0027t involve the debug console.
