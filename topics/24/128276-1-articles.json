It\u0027s been almost a year since I joined the KSP family and it has been wonderful. I want to say that as far as video game communities go, this one is pretty darn great. Beyond that, it\u0027s a great online community too! So, after months of lurking and only recently becoming more active, I have decided that it was high time I made my introduction in the welcome forum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s in a name?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell that\u0027s easy, it\u0027s a portmanteau of Race car and Ford Escort (RAY-skort) and the\u00A0number is a head nod to Iron Maiden. I\u0027m pretty much a huge metal fan, fyi.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/297781_145833685503942_1295401_n.jpg?oh=a4c61cb73d3984438291ea2cd1724e0a\u0026amp;oe=570E1FDD\u0022 alt=\u0022297781_145833685503942_1295401_n.jpg?oh=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://cdn.discogs.com/SZp3vsfZPCbI6viqvP98Hfs40RM=/fit-in/300x300/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb()/discogs-images/R-1466299-1257962172.jpeg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022R-1466299-1257962172.jpeg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, some random screen caps I\u0027ve made in KSP. Found out the hard way that rovers don\u0027t like being jumped like the Racescort does...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/hBLZp/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I recently bought a car that I\u0027m super excited about. I literally just got the loan application filled out and purchase agreement signed yesterday and I\u0027m on vacation for 2 weeks so I won\u0027t even see it until after the new year.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TsSIN6S.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TsSIN6S.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess there should be a little more\u00A0on me. My background is mechanical engineering, I currently work in the automotive industry but prior to that I was in aircraft. I\u0027ve pretty much always been a fan of cool engineering things: aircraft, spacecraft, cars, trucks, tractors, you name it. Something I\u0027d like to start doing more in my spare time is mechanisms. I\u0027m currently doing chassis design for work and car and truck suspension is extremely complicated but it utterly fascinates me. I had done some mechanism work in aircraft but there wasn\u0027t much new design that I worked on and was disappointed by that. It was very cool to learn about how control surfaces are actuated and the mechanisms that controlled the landing gear but all of that was either already done or adapted from an existing design *sadface*.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther weird things about me: I love etymology,\u00A0the study of the origin of words. Entomology is the study of insects, interesting but not necessarily my thing none the less and easy to confuse those two as XKCD points out:\u00A0\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wrong_superhero.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wrong_superhero.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a huge fan of puns so do with that information as you please.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy favorite aircraft is probably the Beech Model 17 Staggerwing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://test.fiddlersgreen.net/aircraft/Beech-Staggerwing/IMAGES/Staggerwing-red.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Staggerwing-red.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy favorite launch vehicle is probably Falcon 9 (call me a fanboy if you want, I\u0027m impressed by the fact that they made a launch vehicle at the cost they did):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/t31.0-8/12370936_10156839289665131_8473038539114381184_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212370936_10156839289665131_8473038539114\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy favorite scifi spaceship is the USG Ishimura. It was the first time that I really got a sense of scale of a starship. Plus, the Dead Space games are awesome:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/new-monster/images/c/c0/Usg_ishimura_full_profile.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150124000546\u0022 alt=\u0022latest?cb=20150124000546\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnything else?
