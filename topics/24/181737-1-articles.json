Hey, don\u0027t leave just yet!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI discovered KSP a month ago, and have been binge playing it. For the (unhealthy) amount of time and effort put into this game, I haven\u0027t done extraordinary things. Just managed to visit the Mun or Minmus a couple of times each, using a few dozen savefiles in the process. I still don\u0027t have a firm grasp of what makes a decent rocket. To be honest, I\u0027m more of a planes guy... so I decided to install\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003Ewhat looked like the\u003Cem\u003E nec plus ultra of aviation\u003C/em\u003E for KSP, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E that is (and a few other mods because I really fancied that su-30 or f-35 replica). But I\u0027m trying to keep the gaming experience light enough for my set-up, so I had to - sadly - resign myself to accept that I would not be able to run KSP with stunning visual enhancers. I actually use my business laptop and it\u0027s not too shabby, but obviously it wasn\u0027t destined to run video games so despite its theoretically encouraging specs, it still doesn\u0027t make the cut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway. I\u0027m playing career mode, and I\u0027m struggling to make it to the next level, which means making enough science to leave Kerbin\u0027s satellite system, and in the meantime understanding how to actually play the game to create rovers, probes and whatnot, then launch them into space. I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve made enough attempts at orbiting a probe around Kerbin to call it quits, but it is also quite certain that I know very little about rocket science, which is why I\u0027m here today among you kerbalnauts to learn from your wisdom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow hard can rocket science be anyway?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbally yours\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-27T13:49:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome aboad!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223529710\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181737\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221548582547\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022194580\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerburettor\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Kerburettor said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow hard can rocket science be anyway?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite!\u00A0 While it\u0027s certainly not real life, this is rocket science.\u00A0 I was right in your position when I started.\u00A0 My first couple weeks were essentially sending useless impactors to the Mun just to see if I could hit it.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t know anything about orbits that Star Trek didn\u0027t teach me.

Does that make any sense?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow things are getting interesting. I don\u0027t quite understand how my gravity turns are supposed to look like\u00A0depending on the rocket I\u0027m launching. How do I time it? More often than not, I have the unsettling feeling that I could have saved a few hundred\u00A0m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E by managing my trajectory a bit better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I understand, wheels are currently one of the bigger bugs in KSP, something about a Unity upgrade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure if MechJeb or Kerbal Engineer Redux have been updated to the latest version of KSP, but they provide some additional useful information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecific impulse has nothing to do with the Oberth Effect. Thrust-to-weight/thrust-to-mass\u00A0ratio, on the other hand, does. If you\u0027re staging mid-burn, your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E often drops, but that\u0027s because the next stage (usually) has less engine power, not because of specific impulse. In general, try to split delta-V evenly: get half the maneuver \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E done before the node, and the other half after the node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor gravity turns, there\u0027s the Gravity Turn mod, or outright trial-and-error.
