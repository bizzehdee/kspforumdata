I am relatively new to this game, finding it by chance when having a gaming boredom crisis- trying to find my next gaming fix!..... I am hooked on this game! I love the design element, the thrill of trying to get it into orbit, the buzz of getting out of the atmosphere and the music starting - as your first achievement.. Onwards and upwards to greater deeds with a spirit of endeavour akin to a real space program! I have since completed my first manual dock in orbit - how many other games would make you pump your fist in the air with triumph???? This to me is why this game is brilliant....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T14:15:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....Jeez, you\u0027ve already done your manual docking?
