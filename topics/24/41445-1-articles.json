I started playing just a week ago and already racked up a days worth of hours playing. Compare that to civ V which has just a bit more than that and I\u0027ve been playing civ v for the better part of the year! So to the Devs, mechjeb Dev, and kerbal engineer Dev, thank you for this new obsession. As a side, I couldn\u0027t for the life of me figure out how a rendezvous worked even with all the material on the net about it, mechjeb relieved that frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a question. I planned out some really big rockets to bring a platoon out to the far reaches of the solar system. One thing I\u0027m unsure of is how ship assembly in space works. I get docking ports, but I plan to send 7 jumbo tanks to my space station and then I\u0027d like to assemble them together so that 1 is in center and the other 6 wrap around that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this possible or should I redesign? I am tackling the challenge of sending it all up at once but that is obviously a problem in its own right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T14:55:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible if you have docking ports on the side. Or a frame with docking ports in the right places, then dock the tanks. It\u0027s gonna be tricky.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThreeWholePunch","CreatedById":77967,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T15:46:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I see what you are saying; I think my new space station assembly vehicle could work here. Add girders to one side and use a docking port, then have a docking port on the other side for my assembly vehicle to move it into place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.
