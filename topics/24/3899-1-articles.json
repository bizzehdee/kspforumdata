Basically you need to put your slingshot into munar orbit 45 degrees in front of the moons rotation and you will intersect perfectly. But let\\\u0027s back up for a second\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, when you are originally making your orbit, thrust towards the EAST. I say this because the earth is already rotating east, making it MUCH easier to set up an orbit in that direction. once you have gotten a stable orbit, just go around and wait for the mun to go over the horizon. Then thrust due east and watch your Apo rise 45 degrees from the moon. It\\\u0027s all the complicated math that really does this, but all you really need to know is wait for the moon to come around the horizon, and right THEN do your burn, and you should intersect the moon perfectly. One burst to get into the orbit with the Apo at 12 million meters and the Peri at 100-150 thousand meters should work just fine to get you there!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mirage","CreatedById":10848,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-17T13:10:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have been able to get my moonraker there just my linux-operating-exe issue lags the kerbals to death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think it is clear that a masive rocket is not needed as such.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stevenator1","CreatedById":10892,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-17T13:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mirage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mirage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eok thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have been able to get my moonraker there just my linux-operating-exe issue lags the kerbals to death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think it is clear that a masive rocket is not needed as such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo it is certainly not required to have a massive rocket \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E They are just fun to make.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rise and Shine","CreatedById":11038,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-18T17:31:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn my first tries of rockets with stock parts I got to 50 km only.
