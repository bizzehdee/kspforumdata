If your peripasis is below 69,100 (or so) meters, you are dipping into the upper atmosphere and being slowed by drag. Because of the nature of orbital motion, though, it would barely show at the periapsis, and the affect would be most noticeable at the other side of the orbit, the apoapsis. Another but less likely possibility is that the game does round off some of its calculations, which can cause very tiny variations in the exact numbers. Those can build up over time, but remain quite small. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, welcome to the forum, and feel free to ask any additional or follow up questions you might have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T10:41:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother possibility is that you nudged the space station core when you were docking another craft to it, which affects the speed of the core and thus the orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kismario200","CreatedById":104509,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T15:53:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KasperVld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KasperVld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother possibility is that you nudged the space station core when you were docking another craft to it, which affects the speed of the core and thus the orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not docked a craft to it, it was stock.
