I\u0027m a game developer in training. I know intermediate level HTML, and goddamn I love KSP. My time playing it has been filled with fails, fails, a win, and lots of editing parts because I suck at the game. I do enjoy the game still, it\u0027s one of my favourites. I\u0027d like to ask a quick question: Who here has attempted to make a game before? Anyways, thanks for reading this, and I look forward to playing alot more of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EALOT.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
