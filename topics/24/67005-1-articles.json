I am AbhChallenger (The Abh part is the race from the anime \u0022Banner of the Stars\u0022 not the name of some game group)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been playing KSP for a few years now. However, I have been using Orbiter for almost a decade before that. So getting into orbit is not exactly a new thing for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been impressed at how quickly the game is developing. The fixes to physics is the main reason I expect to spend a GREAT deal of time in KSP after the ARM patch. And after that I look forward to what Unity 5 can bring to KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore anyone asks. Yes I do use MechJeb. The reason is I focus on efficient designs that do not waste fuel. I have no problem hand flying such designs into Orbit. (I did it plenty of times in Orbiter over the years) Yet it can get annoying and a waste of time if I am doing it over and over and over again. I hope you will respect that people have different playstyles and goals. (For instance I do not plan on using MJ for the true game mode that will be done hopefully before version 1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a big hello to everyone here!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T02:44:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello AbhChallenger, and welcome to the forum. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I, for one, am not in a hurry for the game to be finished.

It seems like generally people here don\u0027t care if you use a mod like MechJeb. Everyone has their own way of playing and there is no right or wrong. That\u0027s one of the great things about KSP. You play it your way and do what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to use MechJeb, but that was because I was terrible at everything and it helped me understand things better. Since I started career mode, I\u0027ve gone completely stock and I\u0027ve started to learn how to do the things I need to without MechJeb. I very well might go back to MechJeb in the future if I get sick of manually guiding certain maneuvers just to allow me to be a bit more distracted while I play. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T15:02:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello!
