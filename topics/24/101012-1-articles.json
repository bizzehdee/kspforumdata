Rockets, spaceplanes, building contraptions or actually going to and landing on other planets/moons? if you\u0027re burnt out on one aspect give another a go. I love building stuff that never gets used. Others love using craft that others have built to fulfil their solar system conquering dreams because they hate the building phase. There\u0027s plenty to do and if in doubt build a sea faring ship....takes AGES (for me at least) and will log another 10-20 hours \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweety\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vallytine","CreatedById":138859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T14:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry I didn\u0027t reply to any messages, a few days ago I had a Cardiac Arrest, and I\u0027ve been out cold for a few days.
