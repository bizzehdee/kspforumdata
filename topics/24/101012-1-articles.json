Rockets, spaceplanes, building contraptions or actually going to and landing on other planets/moons? if you\u0027re burnt out on one aspect give another a go. I love building stuff that never gets used. Others love using craft that others have built to fulfil their solar system conquering dreams because they hate the building phase. There\u0027s plenty to do and if in doubt build a sea faring ship....takes AGES (for me at least) and will log another 10-20 hours ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nTweety"},{"CreatedByName":"Vallytine","CreatedById":138859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T14:11:50Z","Content":"Sorry I didn\u0027t reply to any messages, a few days ago I had a Cardiac Arrest, and I\u0027ve been out cold for a few days. Does anyone know if there are Docking Autopilots still around? Is that Deep Space Mission Pack inspired by 2001 Space Odyssey still here? Does Bobcat still make those amazing rovers? As for what most of the replies have been, I can\u0027t find *anything* in the game interesting anymore, seriously, I\u0027ve done it all before and it just isn\u0027t as interesting as it was. Though I keep having these \u0022Interstellar Quest\u0022 videos in my Subbox on YT from Scott Manley, what\u0027s that all about?"}]}
