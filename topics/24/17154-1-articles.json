On docking (I know, I know, it doesn\u0027t exist yet...)","CreatedByName":"Questioner","CreatedById":41387,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T20:26:10Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Questioner","CreatedById":41387,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T20:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m new here, (first post), and wasn\u0027t sure where to post this... but I\u0027m confused about why it\u0027s so hard to create a docking mod. It only needs 2 parts- a cone and an active piece that goes into the middle of the cone. All you\u0027d then have to do is launch a sort of booster mission into orbit, have it dock in back of a lander/return vehicle, apply thrust, and then you\u0027re going (perhaps not turning, unless you add a part that can go around the cone and its housing area). When you run out of fuel, have the kerbenaut in back do an eva and walk to the front vehicle, get in the vacated seat, and disengage from the docked area, flying the next vehicle. This way, you don\u0027t even need to have moving parts. In addition, even if you don\u0027t want to do all the work to create a cone and active piece to dock with, you could just hollow out a structural fuselage, and add a smaller, pencil-shaped piece just a little smaller than the hollow area, and try to dock (this would be harder to dock with than a cone, however). This came to mind when thinking about the movie, apollo 13, where they use a cone-shaped docking system- a very simple system, in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silent_prtoagonist","CreatedById":1927,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T20:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with docking isn\u0027t in physically attaching the ships; that\u0027s fairly easy, and there have already been a couple of mods that do that, albeit buggily. The problem is that the way that the game internally keeps track of all the parts in a ship makes it difficult to turn two ships into one ship, which is really what you want to do if you\u0027re making space stations or interplanetary spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T20:35:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Questioner, the code that would support having two craft as one just isn\u0027t in the game yet, plus the physics needed to handle moving two docked craft needs to be sorted out, otherwise they would disintegrate pretty quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany add-on developers have tried to do hat you suggest, and the most that can be achieved is some kind of grappling system, which is fine until you try to warp as then the craft go on rails and the physics that handles craft collisions no longer applies, meaning the craft separate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Squad have no intention of releasing a half baked implementation of docking, they feel it is better to get it right and release it whole, KSP is alpha don\u0027t forget and this is the stage where major features are added, it\u0027d make no sense for Squad to make half a docking system when they\u0027d have to go back and change it later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking is coming, not in 0.17 but some day, and like with everything else in KSP, it\u0027ll be ready when it\u0027s done \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kuulness","CreatedById":30285,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T20:40:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy would you want to dock at this current build?
