That was the first program that got me interested in programs with realistic physics engines. Over the years I\u0027ve looked for and found programs that were ok, but I never found anything (that was good) that allowed for launching from a planet with an atmosphere, orbiting, and landing like this program allows for. I really look forward to seeing this game progress. It\u0027s a blast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-05T21:17:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lightningbob","CreatedById":8135,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-05T21:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I shouldn\u0027t plug another program here but if want something more technical but less fun take a look at Orbiter. Although I\u0027ve had it for a monthe the learning curve is steep and I actually havent done much with it. This game is more fun and you can just take it out of the box and fire it up if you take my meaning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rs2k","CreatedById":7965,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-06T20:32:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth games are excellent.
