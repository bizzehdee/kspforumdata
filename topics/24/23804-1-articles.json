I am so happy to have finally discovered the great universe of KSP and all of the awesome folks that inhabit it. I have been KSPing now for almost 2 weeks and have achieved a couple cool milestones including a multi launch Refueling Space Station in Circular Kerbin Orbit (~200,000m) and I have probes orbiting Mun and Minmus, though I have not landed on either yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question involves my Space Station which currently houses 3 lander cans(2 Kerbals each, unless I am mistaken) and 2 utility craft which house 3 Kerbals each, this should be 12 Kerbals onboard and yet I only seem to have 8. The station has been in orbit for a couple of years now as it took about 12 launches to build and I am not the best at getting close without multiple rotations around the planet. Just wondering where my other 4 Kerbals went, as I have done 0 space walks and if they have passed on is there some sort of life support that will prevent my other Kerbals from following down that road?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T04:44:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo life support at this time. You can EVA a kerbal, leave him out there for a few decades, and when you come back, he\u0027ll still be there, healthy as ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s more likely that you launched a single vehicle with multiple command pods. By default, only the primary command pod is populated when launching. You can adjust this with the Kerbal Crew Manifest addon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T15:02:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"musicpenguin","CreatedById":57938,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T15:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome newcomer!
