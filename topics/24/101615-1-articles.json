I\u0027ve logged a little more than 200 hours and this game has got me hooked. I\u0027d like to say that I\u0027m in it for the long haul, but I haven\u0027t accomplished all that much! I\u0027ve only ventured as far as Minmus (with the help of dear, Mr. Manley) and have been more keen to test out different mods and parts and see what the community that has been built around this game has to offer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m interested the most in pushing my space program forward and developing neat looking (and practical) craft that can accomplish this goal. I have set up a satellite communication system with guidance from Bob Fitch and his Projects Alexandria and Odyssey, and am deeply interested in the idea of a self-sustaining extra-planetary base of some kind using the Karbonite, K\u002B, Kethane, etc. resource mods in conjunction with other station/base mods like MKS/OKS and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the artistic aspect of this game as well. While I don\u0027t have a really awesome computer right now (MacBook Air 13\u0022), it runs the game fairly well, despite my GameData folder being overwhelmed with mods. I have tried my hand at some Blender renders as well, and have not been overly successful, but I\u0027m hoping that when I do finally get some sweet spaceships and learn how to use Blender, I can share my stuff with everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for having me in this great community and I\u0027ll see you at the launchpad!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efootforhire\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s. anyone that can point me to how to add a signature line and change my avatar would be greatly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T15:13:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you have three posts you should be able to set yourself an avatar and signature in your settings.
