I\u0027ve been playing on and off for month or two now, still having trouble getting in a good orbit for munar and minus missions - most likely cause of my bigger is better mindset, however I have managed to get a few landers out to mun to blow up on touchdown. Something to do with coming in at 100\u002B m/s... just need more rugged landing gear. But gotta say this is an awesome game, to many add-ons though. I go through phases of just downloading them and then have way to much to try out when KSP loads 30 minutes later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake it easy and be seeing ya\u0027all around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T20:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T20:10:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHiya captgates, and welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad you are making progress with the Munar landing, my preference is to get into a low Mun orbit, say with a periapsis of 10km, then do a deorbit burn so I don\u0027t land at 100m/s\u002B, try to touchdown at below 5m/s for good (non explody) results \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
