I\\\u0027ve been playing around with KSP for about a week now. I feel like a 6 year old again!\n\nWhen I was a kid my parents took me to the Science Museum in london. As part of their space exhibition they had a very simple rocket simulator. All monochrome green and black, you could set number of stages, fuel load etc and try to get into orbit! Since then I\\\u0027ve been wishing for something similar and KSP seems to fit the bill pretty well!\n\nI have just managed a successful Mun landing, assisted by mechjeb since Im a little bit rubbish at killing my speed accross the surface. Hopefully I\\\u0027ll be able to get the hang of manual landing before long! Then just work out how to get back to Kerbin reliably!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sordid","CreatedById":535,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-30T07:05:52Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nHappy Launching!\n\nArrr!\n\nAdmiral Sordid"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-30T15:31:57Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nHappy Launching!\n\nArrr!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager"},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T23:38:24Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nHappy Launching!\n\nArrr!\n\nStowaway Elven\\_sword"},{"CreatedByName":"GoodGuy","CreatedById":17980,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T01:34:29Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nHappy Launching!\n\nArrr!\n\nNewbie GoodGuy"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-05T02:44:13Z","Content":"All of these silly imitators of the Cap\\\u0027n\\\u0027s signature greeting...\n\nAnyways, I\\\u0027d like to welcome you to the forums, which, as you can see, are pretty friendly and occasionally somewhat silly.
