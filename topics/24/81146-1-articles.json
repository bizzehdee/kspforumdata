Toolbar, Navball enhancements, B9, NEAR (after playing with FAR), Procedural Wings, Mechjeb, the entire suite of Klockheed Martian stuff, and KW Rockets. Learning the proper way to add mods was by far the most steep learning curve I\u0027ve ventured into, it took nearly 3 days for me to decipher the instructions and get them installed correctly. Now that I\u0027ve surpassed the NOOB stage the instructions seem obvious, but the call on the forums to standardize the mod offering was striking a chord with me at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter reading through the forums for a couple of days, I\u0027d have to say that this is the most helpful game community I\u0027ve ever seen.
