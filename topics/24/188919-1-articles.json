I started to look at a few of my favorites from youtube, one in particular\u00A0Scott Manley who I have been following for a while, about space related topics. It was space issues (including NASA and SpaceX who Ive also been following since my retirement) and many times he talked about KSP program game stuff. KSP,\u00A0Kerbal?? Kerban?? What the heck is a\u00A0Kerbal? So I watched a few topics about this and found a cool free KSP Demo and installed it. Cool!\u00A0No...Not cool!\u00A0AMAZING!! Wow and it had a link to here and I immediately signed up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave been using it for a few weeks now and even though it is very limited with just a few entry like parts and things, I just love it. I know I am going to look into KSP 1.7 or maybe 1.8 (as some have mentioned here) very soon and even KSP 2 for next year. Maybe I can talk the wife into that for my birthday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this tho, I have found a new amazing game (if not something very\u00A0special to add to my model building pleasures as well as keeping up with space stuff) with this awesome rocket based enjoyment program. I have always loved rocketry. Hope I can learn and maybe share to you all as well, soon. Thank you Squad!
