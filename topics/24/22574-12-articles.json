Just landed an SSTO kethane tanker with 4500 units on the runway, from orbit. - a modification of my \u0022K-18 Super Kornet\u0022. I like treating vehicles and such as somewhat valuable, and don\u0027t just churn out new ones, but pretend to have a stock airframe I modify for the mission, etc. I also like to do it entirely by hand, as in, no mechjeb, no calculating delta-v\u0027s even, I just tend to err on the side of overbuild and then prolong missions with the extra fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, wanted to join the forums to swap creations and ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumbeast","CreatedById":84261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T17:52:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst post, been playing the demo, and finally bought it last weekend...
