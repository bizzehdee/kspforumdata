I stumbled over KSP about a month ago, completely by accident, while watching a N1-related Youtube video; 1 hour later I achieved my first Low Kerbin Orbit, and those last few days I discovered the wonders of the KSP forums, so here we go! :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I couldn\u0027t play as much as I would\u0027ve wanted to, but I\u0027ve had a lot of fun already, and the potential in that lies in future updates and mods is just mind-blowing for the space enthusiast and student I am. LKO, M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus orbits and transfers all are routine now, next steps are powered landings, precision landings and Kerbol orbits (preparing for 0.17!). Currently I\u0027m trying hard to land on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn (with a crew of 3), but my 4 serious attempts so far all experienced various problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-1st try, the \u0022Kerbaac Newton\u0022: Went to LKO just fine, experienced spontaneous and catastrophic engine/decoupler failure 6 seconds into the TMI burn. The crew barely made it out alive, and operated a successful emergency deorbit and reentry, only to see the chutes being ripped off the top of the capsule 500m above the sea. RIP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-2nd try, \u0022Kerbaac Newton 2\u0022, revised design: A flawless flight, where each and every step went better than expected. However, at a mere 2km from the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar surface, the crew realizes that the KSC engineers screwed up badly: the lander only has 1 leg! The ascend stage is fired right away, and the Bill, Bob and Jeb make it back safely, although somewhat disappointed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-3rd try, \u0022Kerbolas Kopernic\u0022: Forgetting to raise your munar orbit back to 50km after a 5km-high reconnaissance orbit, and instead deorbiting right away is a bad idea. RIP Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-4th try, \u0022Kerbert Einstein\u0022: The 2nd stage smashed in the TMI engine upon stage separation, while not even in LKO. Mission aborted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, wasn\u0027t that lucky so far, but I\u0027m optimistic, and it\u0027s so much fun anyway! I look forward to reading you all on the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T20:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Enture, welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you can make a few youtube vids of your flights?

Aborted 1,5km above the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar surface, when the landing stage got jettisoned, victim of a very bad staging sequence (needless to say, the engineers responsible for this got fired). For a little while, Jeb seemed willing to attempt landing with the ascent stage, before Bill and Bob managed to take over the commands, tie Jeb to its chair, and bring the ship safely back home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kevinlacht","CreatedById":14955,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-19T15:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you sounds like someone we gonna see much in the future of ksp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the cummunity!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
