So now I get to do what I\u0027ve watched all my life WOO-HOO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts interesting to find how different it is to know something (gravity turn, orbit, dv etc...) compared to actually doing it. Killed Kerbals on a regular basis for awhile. Now if I could only find a pause button IRL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe modding community here is outstanding as are the mods, actually the whole community here is friendly and helpful a very nice change to some other games sites I\u0027ve been to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks Squad, its really a great game, my all time favorite.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T02:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to simulated space flight, Rabid Bat. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LvL","CreatedById":109145,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T04:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emake sure to have a great time here and playing KSP! start posting crafts, ideas, and any interesting things that you have or have done because the forum would be nothing without the people who do that.
