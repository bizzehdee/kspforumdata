I just found out about the forums and they\u0027re really awesome. I\u0027m really bad at making rockets as all of mine just rotate out of control or if they are stable they run out of fuel just as they get into orbit! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E The only mod I\u0027m using is the flags mod so I put an Australian flag on the Mun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I have some help. When I try to burn out of Kerbin Orbit I cant! It\u0027s like I\u0027m being pulled back by a leash. Is it even possible to be in a position so that you aren\u0027t in any orbit? Also can I have help with making a ship that can land on the Mun but won\u0027t lag my laptop like crazy. I currently have a computer that gives me exactly 1 FPS on takeoff and 20 FPS in orbit but that\u0027ll be changing soon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-08T16:18:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cby","CreatedById":26505,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T09:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello and welcome to the Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several different ways to keep rockets stable. Always use the one man pod so that you can use the ASAS, SAS and RCS Parts. Keep the SAS on during the assent, and use RCS thrusters in case it starts to tip. You can\u0027t go wrong with some finlets too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo have longer space flights, you need more fuel tanks and more engines. The only problem is, more parts = more lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurning out of orbits to land is easy, use the navball to guide you till your flying backwards, this slows you down so you can\u0027t orbit and start to come home. There is a symbol on the navball which shows which way is backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking a ship to land on the Mun, well like I said, more parts = more lag. However there is ways to reduce the lag. If you haven\u0027t done so already, turn down all of the graphics to the lowest settings. There is also something else i use to reduce lag. You can find it here\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/12020-Greatly-speed-up-KSP-for-everyone-with-weak-computers%21?highlight=Greatly\u002Bspeed\u002Bweak\u002Bcomputers%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/12020-Greatly-speed-up-KSP-for-everyone-with-weak-computers%21?highlight=Greatly\u002Bspeed\u002Bweak\u002Bcomputers%21\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also recommend using a mod pack like KW Rocketry. Since it contains larger and wider fuel tanks, there will be less parts and therefore, less lag for your Mun rockets. My best Lander is only two metres wide with only one engine ever firing at a time and can handle a full mission with little to no lag. Get KW Rocketry below and remember to download the low-res verson in the second post instead of the evil lag-making parts in the first post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/2448-0-16-KW-Rocketry-v0-5?highlight=Silisko\u002BIndustries\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/2448-0-16-KW-Rocketry-v0-5?highlight=Silisko\u002BIndustries\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI Hope that helps you, go ahead and put that Aussie flag on the Mun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"COBALT","CreatedById":37153,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T11:58:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThankyou, but I\u0027m confused by what you said on getting out of Kerbin orbit.

Because that\u0027s done the same way you orbit, just keep burning the way your heading to increase speed. Do you mean when burning, nothing happens to your arc? Then you need more powerful engines or more engines. Do you mean when trying to come home, your ship just sits in space? Then its because you slowed down to the point where your ship is moving very slowly, but it will come back, eventually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it isn\u0027t one of those scenarios, then I\u0027m clueless to what your trying to do.
