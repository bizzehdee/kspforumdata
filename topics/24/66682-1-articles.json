Seems like I can create a huge eliptical orbit to intercept the mun, but then later if I try to do a burn to wrap myself around the mun I get no reaction from the burn. The orbit doesn\u0027t change no matter which way I point the rocket. This has happened several times in different places. Seems like after a few burns the burns stop having any effect and if I continue I just end up running out of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, please direct me to the best, most detailed and correct \u0022get into orbit\u0022 tutorial you know of, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T02:36:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmAMGJm-bwU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as your issue, you might not have a high enough TWR to change your orbit fast enough. If you are actually doing a burn you are not likely time-warping, but it is possible so you might want to make sure you are not on x5 warp. Some pics would help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgPr4q5tj-Q?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.
