You will likely stumble upon lots of suprises! Even the mods have changed. Back in 2012, a mod that allows you to make and change planets was unheard of, but now its super normal to have a planet pack. Graphics mods are also something you might want to look at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-26T14:21:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWoah... 2012 puts you between 0.13 and 0.18, which is a wide range of time (0.18 was FIVE years ago?
