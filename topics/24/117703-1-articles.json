I posted in the sticky but now realise I should probably post my own thread if I have a specific new player question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing for maybe a week or so on and off and whilst I am getting to grips with getting into orbit etc. I\u0027m getting a little bit frustrated with not being able to work out how much fuel etc. I need to bring for the mass of the ship - I\u0027ll explain where I am with my particular problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have landed my first ship on the Mun (great feeling!) but the tank is almost literally empty so no way to get back. Built a stripped back rescue ship (1 man pod, Octo probe, 90 cap fuel, terrier engine, legs, chute) managed to land 1.2km away from the first lander, but I only have about 700m/s\u003Csup\u003E2 \u003C/sup\u003Eleft. I\u0027ve tried a few times but always fall short of an escape velocity. What would be best to do - get into a circular orbit and do a rescue that way? Wish I\u0027d put put an antennae on to get that cold hard science back a bit easier!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis kind of brings me onto my next question - whilst the game itself seems incredibly deep and well imagined, the community/forums just seems enormous from mods to tutorials and I don\u0027t really know where to start - I like maths/physics etc. so was going to look into the Kerbal Engineer mod which I think will help me with knowing how much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV I\u0027ve packed, but is there anything else that I should be reading/installing that you couldn\u0027t play the game without?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T16:20:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do favor Kerbal Engineer as an informal mod.

Then build \u003Cem\u003Ea third\u003C/em\u003E ship, with at least 6 Km/s of D-v, and send that ship to rendezvous with the first one. The rescue ship rescue should have either 2 seats or a probe and one seat. Then send it back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, build a ship which can do the same thing as the first one, but better, and run the mission from Kerbin, Mun, Mun landing, Mun orbit, burn retrograde to Mun\u0027s orbit, and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, wait until you are facing towards Kerbin, and burn straight up. As soon as you reach intercept velocity, stop, and play with your orbit until you get back home. This saves you the horizontal velocity needed to go to orbit, but risks leaving you stranded in a high kerbin orbit, needing a rescue ship with a lot of D-v to get you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth, do the same as the one above, but use your jetpack to push yourself to home. Yes, this is a viable strategy. Detach everything except your landing capsule, and be sure to grab all the science! Engage SAS (hopefully you have unlocked EVA and have a probe core!), and point in the direction you need to push. Then get out and push! When you have 1 unit of fuel left, get back in, get out, and restart the process all over again. Repeat until you have areobreaking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
