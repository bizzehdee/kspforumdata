Like, \u0022I wonder what happens if I angle my tail fins so the rocket spins\u0022 deliberately. Followed by \u0022well that wasn\u0027t very much fun... let\u0027s angle them more\u0022 and then \u0022let\u0027s add more fins, angled more\u0022. It\u0027s not like I\u0027m a monster, I did have a very effective abort stage and not one Kerbal died in testing of the Vomit Comet. Four KSP janitors quit on the spot saying, \u0022to hell with this, I\u0027m not cleaning another cockpit no matter what you\u0027re paying,\u0022 but no one died. In that rocket testing series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how did I start out...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI shot my first rocket way, way up. It fell back down but had parachutes. Over a series of refinements I got out of the atmosphere, then fell right back in. Figured out (looked it up) that I needed a gravity turn, and promptly made orbit. An ugly, ugly orbit, but orbit. Scaled up looking to get enough delta-v into orbit to have a decent shot at a Mun orbit. Took some tweaking to figure out the right balance between going big and going home, but finally got a Munar orbit. Again, not a super-pretty one, but this one was decently circular. A bit drunken inclination, but circular. Kinda hosed the return transfer and wound up with an apoapsis around Minmus\u0027 neighborhood, and not much fuel left, but a quick toot retrograde at apoapsis got my periapsis into aerobraking territory and over the course of several annoyingly long orbits, I finally got them back out of orbit and Kerbin-bound. Then I had it accelerated when the chutes opened, ripped them right off, and killed all 3 Kerbonauts. Ended up doing the whole thing over, and not much better, but got everyone back alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedesigned to build myself a simple lander, packed on some more delta-v, and got to, onto, back up from, and back home from the Mun. I got myself some mods (ISA Map-sat) and sent out mapping probes to nice little polar orbits around Kerbin, Mun, Minmus, and even Duna. Tried an ion drive solar probe. Decided I do not like multi-hour burns. At all. Launched a two-piece station, wrecked a LOT of landers trying them out on Kerbin (seriously, can we get some anti-lock brakes in the space program?) and I\u0027ve crashed ever so slightly fewer space planes than I\u0027ve launched. I\u0027ve gotten some into orbit, and I\u0027ve landed some, but I\u0027ve never done both with the same plane. Typically just before I get them close to the ground after re-entry, they go all \u0022leaf in the wind\u0022 on me and not in the \u0022watch how I soar\u0022 way - more like the \u0022define interesting\u0022 way. Ejection seats probably wouldn\u0027t be a bad investment for the KSP, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent goal is to put an insanely over-sized fuel depot into orbit, attach a modest little station module to it, and then put a fairly over-built docking ring onto that. Using that as my LKO staging point, I plan to build smaller \u0022mobile stations\u0022 with multi-nuke-engine drive sections to move them to the Mun, Minmus, and parts beyond. Ideally, one per celestial body. So like a zillion frikkin\u0027 launches, especially considering I need several probes, a lander, rover, space plane, base equipment, and the resources to run all that to go along for the ride or otherwise make the journey as well (preferably in the same window so I\u0027m not waiting forever for the next one.) I like the idea of an \u0022all-in-one\u0022 station/ship. It probably won\u0027t work, I\u0027ll probably either lose it to the Kraken or just not be able to push that much weight, but that\u0027s what I\u0027d like to build.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T15:03:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"musicpenguin","CreatedById":57938,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T15:22:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome newcomer!
