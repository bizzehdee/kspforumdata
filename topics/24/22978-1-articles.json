I got introduced to this awesome game by KurtJmac a long time ago (in version .13 or something like that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when I was going to buy the game I noticed that it could only be purchased via Paypal, and I had, and still don\u0027t, have access to that possibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played the demo, but I saw videos on youtube that teased me what I was loosing, so I pirated the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI felt horrible doing so, I don\u0027t like pirating games, much less a indie. So I promised that I would eventually buy the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it came on steam, I finally bought it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to apologize the developers, I do not support piracy, but I pirated, and I felt bad about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease do not ban me from the forums, I wanted to get this off my chest, and I would feel like an idiot for being banned just because I made an apology. (It would have been avoided if I didn\u0027t make this thread\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m very happy to finally join the community. And help the devs of this amazing game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I can play the game fairly well, I visited all the celestial bodies and returned from most of them (damn Eve and Eeloo)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I deleted my old save, and started a new one. Because my old save was from when the game was pirated and I want to play it from a clean perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI therefore ask Jebediah for forgiveness.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T01:05:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T01:19:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you came back from the dark side... good...
