I have done two successful land/return missions (one was almost a failure, so the second one was to save my Kerbal). Also had a similar situation on the Mun the first time so I have two to the Mun as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have now felt confident enough that I began construction of what I would like to be a Mun base and am curious as to how to build a rover? What kind of power source is needed in order for it to drive and can they be built in the VAB just like anything else or do I have to build them in hangar for jets, if so how do I transfer them over?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso what are some must have mods, as currently I am all stock. I also notice some videos show a gantry on the launch pad, mine does not have one is this also a mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GJames","CreatedById":58866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T13:14:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!

To move the rover over, just go into your KSP folder, saves, the savefile that your using and then into SPH. You\u0027ll find a list of .craft files, which is what the game uses to store your designs. Just drag the relevant file across to the VAB folder and your all good! You\u0027ll be able to find the right file easily as long as you name your crafts, or it\u0027ll show a folder full of \u0022Untitled Spacecraft\u0022\u0027s... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer is a good plugin to start off with as it can really help when building a rocket to get to a specific place, and letting you know more information about your orbit, height above ground level, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb is also very good, and can be used to display information like Engineer, but it can also fly your rockets for you and a whole load of fancy stuff. I would recommend learning to do everything manually first, and then using MechJeb once you know you can do it. More of a sense of achievement that way when you first do it, knowing that you did all that work, and not just an autopilot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that there aren\u0027t many mods that I would recommended when just starting, as they make the game even harder to figure out. Once you\u0027ve got the basics down, then start thinking about mods and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my opinion though, but I did this and I\u0027m having a great time, so it cant be all wrong... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E And the launch tower/gantry was in previous versions of KSP, but it got removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully you\u0027ll find this useful, and have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nova","CreatedById":71712,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T13:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your responses!
