So,\u00A0I just got this game about 3 days ago since there was a Steam sale for it. I\u0027ve always been interested in KSP. I\u0027ve started a career mode save and currently I have orbited Kerbin, scraping out all the science I can. I even researched Aviation just to make a rover to collect science around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Right now I\u0027m stuck. I want to build a plane and go do survey missions but they can\u0027t get off the ground. I\u0027ve visited the highlands and gotten science from there. I could easily go to the mountains if I could just aim my rockets correctly toward them. So, any tips on building the plane? I don\u0027t have the money to upgrade to a Lvl 2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, by the way. Thank you for the help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Delfinus","CreatedById":154315,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T19:37:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/166055-daelite101/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022166055\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/166055-daelite101/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@DaElite101\u003C/a\u003E!
