KSP is the only game I play in years. I was a console guy as a teenager, NES and that stuff, but when I saw KSP I had enough justification to support my sons gamer PC project. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot really into the game after the 1.0 launch... only to find out that some of the designs and ideas I saw on the internet that got me hooked (cupcake landers to mention the most noteworthy) would not work anymore. Bummer, but what can we do. It\u0027s still heaps of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue I have is that the game doesen\u0027t seem to recognize my joystick axis or throttle. It\u0027s a Extreme 3D Pro, and the buttons work okay. Just the axis are not seen by KSP, and yeah, it works for other games. Some help there would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the best \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDaf\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T10:07:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Daf, and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile some of the old designs and ideas no longer work, there are always amazing new designs and ideas appearing.
