I\u0027ve been a huge fan of KSP for years, along with all things space and science. I\u0027m loving KSP2, especially since For Science!, and I\u0027m having a great time perusing the forums and seeing what everyone else is creating and also hearing your opinions on the game and it\u0027s future. I love reading mission reports and hope to create some of my own moving forward. I don\u0027t interact too much online but this forum has been encouraging in that aspect, so thank you all\u00A0and Happy Flying/ Driving / Sailing / Swimming / Whatever else you get up to\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vexillar","CreatedById":178802,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-07T16:29:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks and likewise!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-07T18:57:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi!
