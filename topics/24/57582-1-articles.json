Next to that I follow the football (fan of Ajax) and I enjoy special beers and red wine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could use some advice on fuel management in KSP. I tend to burn up a LOT of fuel trying to get away from Kerbin and into some sort of orbit around it. This leaves me with very little fuel to get me to the Mun or further, and when I get where I want I don\u0027t have enough to slow down and land properly, so I end up \u0022landing\u0022 with like 250km/h. How does one launch and get into orbit without burning too much fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing: the top of this forum -IE the bar with all the buttons and stuff- is shown a tad scrambled, with the search bar and some buttons being shown on top of eachother. Is that my browser messing up, or are there others who don\u0027t see this part correctly?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T02:22:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t experienced any graphical problems on the forum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverybody burns most of his/her fuel getting to orbit. That\u0027s just the nature of spaceflight. To minimize fuel use, build the smallest mission payload possible, then add stages below it until it can get where it is going. To increase range, trim starting at the top stages and only ever add to the bottom stages. Use the minimum number of engines required to make the ship move. But mostly, just try different designs and see what works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Asthereal","CreatedById":98416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T10:02:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.

I did get a nice rocket into Kerbin orbit with half a large tank of fuel left, and a last stage with a full small tank.
