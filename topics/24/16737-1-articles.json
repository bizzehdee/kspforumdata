I had a couple quick questions right away:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I\u0027ve seen reference to the \u0027Fuel Flow Bug,\u0027 but haven\u0027t seen a straightforward description yet. I would presume it\u0027s related to the non-linear growth of burn time that comes with throttle reduction? (Excel says it\u0027s an inverse square). This quirk doesn\u0027t seem to make physical sense, and really screws up my attempts at finding Delta-V for a rocket, so I\u0027m hoping it\u0027s a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Any tips for attaching control surfaces to wings? I haven\u0027t been able to get my ailerons parallel to the wing yet, they always snap perpendicular, which obviously looks like nonsense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T04:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) After the switch to determining fuel flow through thrust and I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, they accidentally left in the other code that determined it based on throttle setting.
