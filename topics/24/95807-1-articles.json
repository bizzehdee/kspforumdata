That was one of the most extensive missions, but I used MechJeb a lot. Do you know of MechJeb?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my favorite missions so far is my big Mun science sweep. I built a lab/refueling ship and lander with all the science instruments, sent it down to land and collect science and return to refuel 11 times in different biomes. I returned to Kerbin and got 5790.6 science from the trip. If I had planned more efficiently and gone into a polar orbit around the Mun I probably could have hit all the biomes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did this 100% stock.

I\u0027m amazed I made it back to orbit from my landing site at about 600m, but I don\u0027t know if I have enough delta-v for the rendezvous with the refueler.
