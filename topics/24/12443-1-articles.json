It\\\u0027s super cool. Currently, I\\\u0027m trying to land on the mun. I\\\u0027ve yet to do this successfully - touchdown is hard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMY latest plan is to cover my lander in RCS, and do most maneuvers with these. However, I\\\u0027m running into a problem: My rocket is going through RCS tanks in the wrong order! For liftoff, it uses the RCS tanks on my lander rather than the tanks on the 1st stage engines. Why is this? I would have thought that the ship would go through tanks starting from the first stage, but this isn\\\u0027t the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Incidentally, what is the correct terminology here? My \\\u0027first stage\\\u0027 engines are actually marked as the 8th stage in the game.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve attached my rocket file.

So if you split the RCS tanks and put the lander\\\u0027s in a lower stage number the other should drain first.

I have RCS tanks in stages 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8, and yet the first tanks to drain are in stage 4!

That is a silly feature I never noticed before, as I generally don\\\u0027t use more than one or two RCS tanks.

However, I have another theory; The order in which you add tanks to the VAB. Try building a rocket minus the upper tank, disconnect everything below where you want the tank, place the tank, reconnect everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to test some more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-10T15:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can change the order that things are called upon by adding them in order like you\\\u0027re suggesting, but you have to be REALLY careful that you\\\u0027ve moved everything that needs to get moved, and the really nasty part is, if you later alter your design at all, the components get automatically flipped back to their original order, and you have to manually move them all again. \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
