Successfully launched a scale 4 stage design using Estes D engines that ended up two miles upwind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, my first Kerbal rockets are based upon such designs starting with a single stage sub orbiter for flight testing. (Similar to the old Mercury program.) The Redstone design shows the need for aerodynamic stability. In model rocket terms, as long as the center of pressure is behind the center of mass, the rocket will fly straight up while experiencing atmospheric drag. A plain set of static fins placed as far to the base as possible are sufficient for that design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current two stage design, now with the Redstone upper stage modified with a low powered third stage, needed steerable fins on its booster to hold on course. Also, a set of braces were added to stabilize the long rocket from wobbling. Once cleared of the atmosphere, flight becomes stable. That simple design has placed its Kerbal astronaut into orbit with a partial burn of the second stage. With a full burn, it will reach an intercept with both Kerbal moons. The third stage retains all fuel for lunar orbit insertion and a safe return using an aiming point of about 15,000 meters in the atmosphere. That is good for a reentry slowdown that holds G forces down to about 5Gs. Like Apollo, the ideal launch should aim for that booster to crash into the moon so it doesn\u0027t become a future hazard for later flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be doing more experimenting with that rocket to learn more of orbital, lunar insertion, and how things work. Then\u0027 I will start adding more boosters to extend its range for interplanetary flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nephew, who loved the old Amiga Solar System explorer program, will probably get hooked tonight. He downloaded the beta last night.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poldarias","CreatedById":58016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T19:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, interesting!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome the KSP community!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T02:54:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy Redstone experiment that actually made low Kerbal orbit, over 100,000 meters;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo stage rocket of 18 parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Launch stabilizers just to be safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy flight experience with that design; (only one abort caused by not activating stability right away.) Both rockets need to activate stability during the launch or they would go off course after a short time. However, the fins stabilized things so much at 10,000\u002B meters as to make the gravity turn difficult. Second stage is fired to get to apogee above 100,000 meters, then shut down to save fuel till I reach apogee for the circular burn. The larger engine version needed to burn at reduced power for the orbital insertion. The small second stage engine one may be more efficient if one gets the insertion path right after booster burnout since it lacks the power to overcome gravity at separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth rockets flew successfully, made orbit with sufficient fuel left to drop para gee to 15,000 meters with some to spare, and only subjected Jeb to a 2.7 G reentry and safe landing.

Bracing and adapter separator added. Still a bit wobbly mostly from the SAS and effects of the lower atmosphere. Have to be careful staging to avoid damaging the upper stage during ignition. Otherwise, the second stage goes out of control. Solution to save Jeb, shut it down, activate third stage and either orbit or return to Kerbal. The first two stages put me into a loop for encounter with Mum and a small burn of third stage to the second moon. However, a close encounter with Mum on the return loop towards Kerbal kicked me into escape velocity. At least, the third stage had a full tank for returning as I was now heading for a close encounter with the first outer planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting game once I learn how to use the tools for insertion into orbit of those moons or one of the nearby planets with the present design.
