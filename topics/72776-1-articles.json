Here\u0027s how it went: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t even browse the forums while logged in. It only showed that I was banned and when the ban would end. Therefore I had to log out to browse the forums. Obviously I couldn\u0027t post like that, which wasn\u0027t such a big problem until I saw someone asking for a mod that would add a note pad in the game. No one else seemed to know the mod that I was using (and still use) so I decided that the ban be damned and created another account just to help that guy. Then I begged some moderator (I don\u0027t remember who, I think it was the one with a big smiley as an avatar) to approve that post (when you post for the first time, a moderator has to approve that post for it to appear) or at least suggest that mod himself. Unfortunately that didn\u0027t happen. Fortunately my ban wasn\u0027t extended and someone else suggested that mod anyway. Then it went on like it had been for quite some time, I couldn\u0027t post, but could read the forums. Sometimes it was slightly annoying, most of the time it just kept me away from pointless arguments, I guess. Then it ended, I could post again and catch up on my inbox. One thing that did happen was that after the ban was lifted, I didn\u0027t get back into the forum games.
