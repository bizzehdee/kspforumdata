If you get a working download of 1.4.x with the proper copy of the DLC for that version of 1.4 -- then the 64bit version of everything\u00A0should run in your download directory, and you should test that once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter you have checked that everything is running in the download directory, then you can copy or move that entire download directory to a backup location of your choice.
