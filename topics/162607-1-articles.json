Very loosely, you can think of it as atmosphere pushing back on your exhaust gases.

Delta-V is essentially your ability to use engines to change your current velocity, and is determined by how much fuel you have and how efficient your engines are. You use delta-V to execute maneuvers; if you have no delta-V (no fuel) remaining, you\u0027re at the mercy of gravity, atmospheres, and lithospheres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the absence of gravity: if you are traveling 2000 m/sec to the right, and have 1000 m/sec of delta-V, you can use that 1000 m/sec to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurn prograde and hit 3000 m/sec right\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurn retrograde and hit 1000 m/sec right\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurn perpendicular to that vector and achieve a velocity of 2,236 m/sec (2000 m/sec component in the original vector, 1000 m/sec component perpendicular)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelta-V can be calculated manually using the famous Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E = Ve * ln(mass of full stage / mass of empty stage).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E is your delta-V, Ve is your exhaust velocity, ln is the natural logarithm, and it\u0027s important to remember that mass of the empty stage is not just payload, but also empty fuel tanks, engines, etc. Anything that isn\u0027t fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, you may ask yourself, \u0022where is that specific impulse everybody talks about?\u0022. That is in the Ve term. Specific impulse is equal to exhaust velocity divided by 9.8063 m/sec^2 (surface gravitational acceleration on Earth/Kerbin). As such, the Tsiolkovsky equation is often rewritten as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E = Gm * Isp * ln(full / empty)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat raises the question of why we use something so silly as Isp instead of just listing exhaust velocity. You can thank me and my fellow Yanks for\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0not switching over to MKS. You see, early in rocketry, people in the US were using ft/sec for exhaust velocity, while everybody whose nations had converted to sane units was using m/sec. To make things simpler, they just decided to divide by the surface gravity of Earth (9.8 m/sec^2, 32 ft/sec^2), getting a measurement that depended only on the unit of time, and at the end, they would just multiply back by that gravity to get exhaust velocity back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final major thing to note is what the equation looks like when you flip it around, set a desired delta-V target and ask \u0022how much fuel do I need relative to the empty mass\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfull/empty = e^(\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E / Isp * Gm)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll notice that\u0027s exponential, the tyranny of the rocket equation. For large delta-V, Isp becomes hugely important, because you get to divide \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E by Isp before taking that exponent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also imposes some fundamental constraints and requires staging: for stock (where a full fuel tank is 9x heavier than when empty), the absolute maximum you can get out of an engine without staging is Gm * Isp * ln(9).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-28T01:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223104904\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162607\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221498611142\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257441\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jas0n\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 minutes ago, Jas0n said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe delta V of a rocket is a measurement of how much \u003Cs\u003Eacceleration\u003C/s\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003Echange in velocity\u003C/span\u003E it can produce (Someone correct me if I\u0027m wrong).
