How do redshift and blueshift work? I always thought it was due to the Doppler effect, in which the speed of sound or some other wave changes relative to you, and you perceive a different frequency. The question is, how does this work if the speed of light is always 186,000 miles per second, no matter what speed you\u0027re traveling at?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If two light beams are approaching each other at 186,000 miles per second, wouldn\u0027t the distance be decreasing by 372,000 miles per second? That violates relativity...or does it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: 186,000 miles per second =~ 299,338 km/s\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T14:40:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by livefree75\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChanged 186000 mps to 299338 km/s\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T13:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Its not the relative speed of the wave that\u0027s important, its the apparent wavelength. Move towards a wave source and the wavelength you measure is reduced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Nothing is moving faster than c in any reference frame. From your frame, the distance between the two waves is reducing at 2c, but that distance doesn\u0027t correspond to anything phyiscal, its just a measurement between two points. If we substitute the light beams for two relativistic spacecraft, then we can talk about the frame of reference of those spacecraft. Both spacecraft will measure you coming towards them at near-c and the other spacecraft approaching at a slightly higher velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T13:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) You don\u0027t have to move (relative to the source) at relativistic speeds to observe the Doppler shift of color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The key is \u0022relative\u0022.

From the observers point of view, the photons would be moving towards each other at a velocity of 2c, but from the photon\u0027s FoR (frame of reference), nothing happens at all since photons move at the speed of light and therefore do not experience time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us instead use this example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are Observer O. From one direction, spacecraft A is approaching you at 0.75c. From the directly opposite direction, spacecraft B is approaching you at the same velocity. From the FoR of O, the spacecrafts approach each other at a speed of 1.5c. This is a correct measurement. However, from the FoR of spacecraft A, A will approach observer O at 0.75c and spacecraft B at ~0.96c. This conflicting measurement is also correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is important to remember is that \u003Cem\u003Einformation\u003C/em\u003E cannot travel faster than light - and since the information in Hcube\u0027s example is moving from Earth (the projector) to the Moon, not across the Moon, no rules are broken.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
