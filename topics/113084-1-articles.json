So it drained it\u0027s fuel.\n\nSo I did set up this small mission to refuel it.\n\nI go outside, hook a winch (KIS/KAS) for stability, then a pipe and refuel it.\n\nBut upon trying to reenter the pod my kerbal clones and I will have a dead (clone) on my record.\n\nI reverted to autosave, which did not feel good at all and just EVA her then did hit B. She cloned again.\n\nI will post a link to this topic in the KIS thread, because I am told this causes it, but just in case it does not, please help me solve that.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n![ewUt6gB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ewUt6gB.jpg)\n\n![2zToqiK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2zToqiK.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

She cloned herself. I switched to KSC then when I got back there were some phantom kraken forces that tore the real one (the one with stuff in inventory) apart. It did not count it as death, but now I have a body snatcher alien (with pink skin) that will destroy my space program from inside.\n\nAre the winches or pipes causing it ?
