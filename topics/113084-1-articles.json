So it drained it\u0027s fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I did set up this small mission to refuel it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI go outside, hook a winch (KIS/KAS) for stability, then a pipe and refuel it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut upon trying to reenter the pod my kerbal clones and I will have a dead (clone) on my record.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reverted to autosave, which did not feel good at all and just EVA her then did hit B. She cloned again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will post a link to this topic in the KIS thread, because I am told this causes it, but just in case it does not, please help me solve that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ewUt6gB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ewUt6gB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2zToqiK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222zToqiK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
