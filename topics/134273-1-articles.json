Rather than a boost to kill horizontal velocity, it\u0027s a boost to kill vertical that you\u0027ll need to make since your time and distance to impact will decrease as you burn. In a low TWR craft, the arc length can easily decrease faster with a retrograde burn than the craft can reduce its own velocity, making a \u0022pure\u0022 suicide burn impossible. In that case a radial-out component becomes necessary, and with a very low TWR your suicide burn starts looking more and more like a constant-altitude burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe general \u002270% of time-to-impact\u0022 rule of thumb that Snark mentioned works well enough for reasonable TWR and reasonable approach angles.

Then simply divide by your vehicle\u0027s TWR to get the altitude where you need to start your burn. The first step gives you the equivalent altitude with a potential energy corresponding to your kinetic energy, and then 1/TWR is the fraction of that altitude you would need to burn for in order for the work done by\u00A0your engines to match the work done by gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, let\u0027s say you\u0027re at 640\u00A0meters, dropping at 85 m/s, and your T/W at full throttle is 3.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n85^2/20 is 361.
