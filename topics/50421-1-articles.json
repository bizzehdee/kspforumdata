Played the tutorials, thought \u0022okay, cool\u0022, hopped into sandbox mode and went \u0022INFORMATION OVERLOAD! RUN AWAY!\u0022, closed the program because I didn\u0027t have time to study rocket parts for 2 hours, and never came back. That is, until I saw an article talking about the new career mode. So, I decided to give KSP another shot, and I have to say now, I\u0027m LOVING it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a few basic rockets (basic, because I only had 5-6 parts), got some starting science and started expanding what I could do. I got into orbit, did some spacewalks, did a Mun flyby, and am now kinda stuck. I have all of tier 3 (or is it 4? - heavy rocketry and down), and feel like I lack the tools necessary for a Mun landing (Lander Can, in-space docking mechanisms), but am not sure what else I could be doing. I plan on trying a Minmas flyby next. That should help get me some more science, but beyond that, I\u0027m not sure what else I could attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I miss some easy early science? I certainly haven\u0027t landed on every Biome on Kerbal. I don\u0027t know if I have EVA reports for every Biome on Kerbal (I might). What I need is a list of possible missions. A list of things to shoot for. Even if it\u0027s just on a website, it would be SUPER helpful. Something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Blast off (get to 40000 meters)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Orbit (Achieve Orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Mun Flyby\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Minmas Flyby\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt needs to give me science though. Orbit is only useful if I\u0027m getting there and doing some science. Same with the Mun. I don\u0027t mind figuring out what science I can do in each location, I don\u0027t need that listed, I just need a list of destinations. Something to shoot for, in an order that\u0027s achievable with what I have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know Mission Control isn\u0027t in the game yet, and I\u0027m looking forward to what you decided to do with that building. I\u0027m not looking forward to Money being implemented, so much. Failure happens so easily and often, I\u0027d hate to feel like I\u0027m wasting opportunities while testing builds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn idea for money may be to have it be an upper limit on what you can spend on each mission. As a way of preventing someone from strapping 143 rocket boosters to a dump truck to \u0022establish a base\u0022 way earlier than you should legitimately be able to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m rambling at this point. I just had to get this idea off my chest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrushfire\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-ELF-","CreatedById":52049,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T04:15:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst to say - welcome! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing - you have 4 levels of altitude to do science - low flying, high flying, low space, high space.

Do not forget Ocean also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake EVA and grab some samples. (For ocean too!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you do not need to go apollo style for Mun landing, what\u0027s more for Minmus landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is pretty much possible to do Mun landing in one piece, without undock-redock sequence. (And gives a BIG load of science, just take some solar panels with you to transmit, if your design seems to be short on delta-v to travel back from Mun)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are not confident about mun landing, try landing on minmus first. Should be much easier due to small gravity well. (Previously Kerbals could even achieve stable orbit around it using jetpack, don\u0027t know if it has changed now).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen landed successfully on Mun, launch another same rocket, and go land in all major craters. Different science is done in most of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also, do not try to buy everything on Tech tree. Specialize on needed equipment. Do not fear to read about what are you buying. It is better to save science points for needed equipment, than to spend all of them equally around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you are feeling lack of science points, develop Thermometers, pressure sensors, gravity sensors and go get some more science around. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlan to do for you - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) get unmanned control module Stayputnik, some good solar panels and batteries, and nerva nuclear engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) make interplanetary unmanned mission too duna or eve.
