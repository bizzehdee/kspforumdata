I would try turning with the a,s,d,w,e,q keys (whatever i needed to do) and then simultaneously, with my other hand, press alt\u002B\u003E key, to enter physical time warp. Thus, i enter time warp, but also adjust my trim by accident, since i pressed alt\u002B(a,s,d,q,w,e) at the same time\n\nThat\u0027s most likely what happened to the OP?"},{"CreatedByName":"gogozerg","CreatedById":127301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T22:39:29Z","Content":"I\u0027m reopening my topic instead of creating a new one, since it looks the same, but it must be a different case.\n\nThis time, I\u0027m certain the default position is centered.\n\nWhen SAS is enabled, my space station looks perfectly stable.\n\nBut as soon as I disable SAS, as long as torque is running on any wheel or can of the station, it begins to roll clockwise, then counter-clockwise, and so on, around the initial state.\n\nAnd I can\u0027t see no reason why my station wants to jiggle!\n\n![sillytorque.jpg](http://grrroux.free.fr/divers/sillytorque.jpg)"}]}
