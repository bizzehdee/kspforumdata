I would try turning with the a,s,d,w,e,q keys (whatever i needed to do) and then simultaneously, with my other hand, press alt\u002B\u0026gt; key, to enter physical time warp. Thus, i enter time warp, but also adjust my trim by accident, since i pressed alt\u002B(a,s,d,q,w,e) at the same time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s most likely what happened to the OP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gogozerg","CreatedById":127301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T22:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m reopening my topic instead of creating a new one, since it looks the same, but it must be a different case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time, I\u0027m certain the default position is centered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen SAS is enabled, my space station looks perfectly stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as soon as I disable SAS, as long as torque is running on any wheel or can of the station, it begins to roll clockwise, then counter-clockwise, and so on, around the initial state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I can\u0027t see no reason why my station wants to jiggle!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://grrroux.free.fr/divers/sillytorque.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sillytorque.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
