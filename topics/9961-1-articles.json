Dream Chaser is a small lifting body that launches like a normal capsule (on an Atlas V), and makes a gliding landing like a miniature shuttle. It\\\u0027s funded by NASA under COTS, and is rapidly progressing towards flight hardware. Skylon uses much more speculative (ie dubious) technology, and is basically a lot of technical drawings right now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe supposed payload capacity\\\u0027s 15 tons, though it should be said that the design is much larger than it looks (roughly the size of the AN-225).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spearka\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spearka\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei really like this, pity that only private companies are funding this and not, lets say...THE GOVERNMENT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s being funded by ESA...
