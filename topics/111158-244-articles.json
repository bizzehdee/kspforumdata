If you continue, warning points get awarded.   Enough points, and your access to the forums can be restricted to various levels.     And the exact points really don\u0027t matter, just follow the rules and you won\u0027t have an issue with it.  If something does happen and we need to discuss your points with you, we do that on a private and individual basis.   We do follow a set protocol for assigning the points."},{"CreatedByName":"AtomicTech","CreatedById":210823,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-25T13:15:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 30 minutes ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s pretty simple.
