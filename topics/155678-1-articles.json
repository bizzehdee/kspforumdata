So instead of moving left, I move left and up, or right and down. It is very frustrating because it makes it almost impossible to line up the docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use the RV-105 Thruster Block.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RV-105_RCS.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/e/ed/RV-105_RCS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-28T15:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPls show your ship, it may have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters misplaced. Firing 4 instead of 2 is normal when thrusters are in a X cross configuration (pic below should make this clear), but thrust of those 4 sums to give the same as 2 in a right cross.
