Dear GOD that was hard, kept tipping over. Of course my lander design was a problem as well, I made my stuff way too thin and tall. These days my landers are by default a lot wider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- rendezvous and docking. first rendez-vous took some time, and I remember spending like 100 RCS fuel on a single docking with a couple simple craft the first couple times I tried. These days I do docking manouvres on light craft with like 3 to 5 units of RCS fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- interplanetary burns. Getting a decent interplanetary trajectory still gives me trouble. Especially if the target gravity well isn\u0027t too big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Eve ascent vehicle. I literally spent 3 months dedicating almost all my KSP time developing an Eve ascent lander that could adhere to my personal goals and limitations. for reference, those limitations were: must be able to make orbit from sea level. Must be as light as possible. No external command seats allowed. Must be able to return science data from both the atmospheric descent and from the surface. Must use aerospikes as main engine power because engine Isp levels out at 1 atm pressure and really, it shouldn\u0027t. So use aerospikes where atmo pressure isn\u0027t much of an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad to invent a whole new way of staging, but in the end I managed around a 170-ton lander that could do it. I deleted it a couple versions back though. With the new parts and experience I have now I could probably do better. I might re-design after 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Single stage spaceplanes beyond LKO. Strangely enough, single-seater SSTO spaceplanes didn\u0027t give me THAT much trouble. It took a bit of learning, but not that much more that regular rocketry. A couple of posts on aerodynamics and aircraft construction on the forums really helped a lot. Mass-transport or getting SSTO\u0027s to Mun and Minmus and back was quite the hurdle though. And while we\u0027re touching on long-range SSTO\u0027s...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- SSTDuna without refuel. Didn\u0027t take me as long as the Eve ascent vehicle, but still a couple weeks. Personal restrictions on this one were: must do Runway-Duna surface- Runway without any refuel of any kind. Must carry at least 3 kerbals. Must use MkIII parts (the old ones at the time). End result wasn\u0027t perfect (she was really, REALLY hard to handle upon re-entry and when gliding. Sooooo heavy in the back) but she made it. And I won\u0027t soon forget the feeling I had when I set her down on the runway, drained of just about every possible resource but completely intact and having fulfilled all mission parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T08:54:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 08:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cirocco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Octa","CreatedById":140058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T08:58:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENothing special:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Orbital Roundevouz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Docking\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Landing w/o atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- SSTO\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T09:10:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESSTOs. and long range planes in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other wall I haven\u0027t climbed out of fear of what\u0027s on the other side is interplanetary travel.
