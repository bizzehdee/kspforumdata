The two bombs \u003Cem\u003Ecombined\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 killed marginally more people than the second Tokyo firebombing raid. WW2 was a human catastrophe where \u003Cem\u003Econventional\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 warfare was easily capable of truly shocking death tolls. Dan Carlin put it well when he discussed \u0022Logical Insanity\u0022 in an episode of Hardcore History of the same name. The Germans start by bombing civilians in the UK\u2014not necessarily intentionally, it was impossible to bomb targets in any city at that time without hitting civilians, a \u0022precision\u0022 mission would maybe land 80% of the bombs within 2 \u003Cstrong\u003Emiles\u003C/strong\u003E of the aim point, but I recall reading about bomber \u003Cem\u003Ejettisoning\u003C/em\u003E bombs and heading home, which hit a neighborhood. RAF responded by attacking Germans in kind, then Coventry happened, and Bomber Command developed the art/science of starting firestorms with night time area bombing. The USAAF stuck to \u0022precision\u0022 daylight attacks, but many bombs obviously hit well outside targeted factories, etc. LeMay moves to the PTO, and the jet stream, distance, etc make \u0022strategic\u0022 bombing virtually impossible over Japan (not to mention distributed industry/\u0022piece work\u0022). He elects to switch to the RAF Bomber Command model, and burns whole cities to the ground. BDA was done in \u0022square miles destroyed.\u0022 They also mined the Inland Sea, and the USN submarine service did what the U-boats never came close to doing, they completely destroyed the Japanese Merchant Marine. The island nation of Japan, that required outside inputs from over the water was starving, and cities were burning as fast as they got on the target list. Civilian bombing deaths in total are estimated at ~675k for Japan\u2014and technically that is overstated as by Imperial Edict in March \u002745, every male from 15-60, and every female from 17 to 40 was conscripted for the final battle (invasion), making all those people \u003Cem\u003Etechnically\u003C/em\u003E combatants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, nukes did not kill millions, and arguably their existence prevented a conventional WW3. In the counterfactual with no nukes, the US still defeats Japan while losing substantially more American lives\u2014and \u003Cem\u003Evastly\u003C/em\u003E more Japanese lives than were killed by the bombs\u2014using Okinawa as a model, the Japanese lost ~10X the US losses. 250k US soldiers dead? 2.5M Japanese. 500k? 5M. That\u0027s just on the Home Islands and still a nightmare for both sides. The CCCP then invades the Japanese holdings on the mainland... hard to even imagine the toll there. And there was a standing order for all POWs held by the Japanese everywhere in the Empire to be eliminated upon invasion of Japan\u2014most were civilians from the countries the Japanese took at the start of the war\u2014several hundred thousand people. Anyway, the war ends, and minus nukes there is still a Cold War (though it\u0027s hard to imagine people somehow not figuring out \u0022physics\u0022 and building bombs anyway\u2014they are possible, so their construction was certain, IMHO). That Cold War minus nukes would be far, far more likely to turn hot. Why not? So more deaths.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs awful as the bombs were, they were just a more efficient way to kill people, the attitude that made killing huge numbers normal was already there because of the war (at the most charitable, or just in human nature).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m talking about the entire wars not the atomic bombs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand your reaction though lol.

In August 1939, Einstein wrote his letter to FDR. The US spent a small effort from that point forward (maybe a couple million $ over a few years), but did not work in earnest until the Manhattan District (Project) started in 1942.

Also, bombing Normandy literally assumes the war started as it did\u2014in which case Germany has no path to securing the materials needed, much less making a bomb. Remember that the US pushed really hard as a race to beat Germany (loads of smart people there with the skills), Germany would have had to think of it as not \u0022a super weapon,\u0022 but, \u0022we need to beat a combination of the US/UK to get the super weapon.\u0022 So they would have had to estimate what the US could afford in terms of money and manpower\u2014and dedicate MORE manpower/$.

Japan (meaning home islands) was impacted from the start (not huge in 1942, but increasing over time). They imported all their oil (80% from the US before the war), and most other inputs into their economy. The war started to capture the Netherlands East Indies\u2014for oil. They succeeded, but they never had a large enough merchant marine to supply themselves on their own, and they started a war with... everyone. Then the US submarines of course waged unrestricted warfare on their merchant shipping. This was incredibly effective, though the sinkings right off the coast of Japan were minor to start. Much of their wartime supply came across the Sea of Japan from China, though, which kept them going until our subs owned those waters as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJapan would need to literally mine Uranium from somewhere they controlled, this was likely a huge limiting factor.

I\u2019d argue superior Allied quality and quantity meant even without B-29 air raids, the outcome on the battlefield would have been the same (until we get to the question of needing the atomic bombs to end the war, of course). In other words, the Japanese home front was largely protected for the majority of the war. On the other hand, the American submarine campaign had a major impact on the availability of raw materials, but I don\u2019t think this would have impacted a potential nuclear program- assuming the Japanese completely trust the science and go all in on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJapan had already lost long before, but they refused to surrender. The bombs absolutely worked, and precipitated surrender. For many years histories would show that Japanese diplomats were cabling home saying they should negotiate, and that they tried to talk to the Soviets. Books before 1996 lack some of the declassified codebreaking information\u2014now we know what the replies were from Tokyo. In short, \u0022No negotiation until after we bleed them on the beaches.\u0022 (paraphrase). We might have put off the invasion, and merely burned their cities to the ground the \u0022old fashioned way\u0022 (including Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which had only been spared as test targets). They still burn, it just takes more sorties. Course the Soviets then invade Manchuria, and the IJA forces in China that had a fairly calm war, then get clobbered by 1945 Soviet power, which would make their previous interaction with the Soviets look like a garden party. They would have likely been killed to a man by the Soviets, just as the Marines had to kill virtually all (they rarely surrendered), so would the Soviets. Only in fixed, old fashioned land battle, no islands... \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E TANKS (which the IJA lacked and were kinda terrified of). Also artillery.
