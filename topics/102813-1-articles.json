I\u0027m looking for a stockalike 6 meter cargo bay for the stock MK2 fuselage system. I build a lot of fighter jets and I like them to look nice so I use internal payloads instead of external hard-points wherever possible. My problem with the current parts is that the 4m bay is a bit too short for my needs, and the 8m bay is a bit too long. So I either need a 6m bay, or a 2m bay to slap on the end of a 4m bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can either:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Be awesome and make one and let me focus on building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Point me somewhere I can find one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Or point me somewhere that I can learn to make one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love you forever and ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
