One of the changes that happened in development was that the reaction wheels have changed. You were likely watching a video from before 0.90. Scott had no way of knowing that the game was going to change. However, there is a medium reaction wheel. It\u0027s in the control tab. You should have 3 of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that the game needs to be a bit less obscure about how to play it. If you right click the engine, you may see a \u0022run test\u0022 option. Click it. If not, you need to stage the engine to test it. It does say in the contract which they want, but it\u0027s not really highlighted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry to say you were misled, but not by Squad.

For engines, that\u0027s usually through the staging sequence. Which means if you activate the engine with the space bar to take off and you have to test it at 1,000 meters, you\u0027ll need to rearrange the stages to \u0022reactivate\u0022 it that way - or alternatively, if you need to fire it up before the test, either right click on it or use action groups instead of staging\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T22:19:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI get that you are agrravated and I understand why, however you can\u0027t expect to get a finished product when buying a game that explicitly states that it is still in Beta.
