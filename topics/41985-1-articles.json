We could even do a more primitive \u0022hands on\u0022 version using radial \u0022valve\u0022 parts that go on or in between tanks to control fuel flow direction. Since they wouldn\u0027t have to have physics on them, they wouldn\u0027t truly count as parts, and they wouldn\u0027t have to be more than 50 polygons in size so it wouldn\u0027t affect graphics performance to any real degree. It would keep with the spirit of KSP and, as being just a part, it wouldn\u0027t ruin asparagus stage rockets or older designs. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fifi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fifi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAbout my designs - I actually completely ignored the 0 fuel states, because there\u0027s no other way to check it other than burning all the fuel or counting tanks (which fails if they are of different size and/or different empty weight).

I\u0027ve built so many spaceplanes that I just use the old trick of building around a single fuel tank that feeds the engines, and set up the rest to feed to it so I always can control my CoM. There\u0027s a few other tricks too, but unless you really spend a lot of time messing with setting up fuel flow it probably isn\u0027t worth the while to develop them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Haze-Zero\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Haze-Zero\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wonder if you could yourself could possibly make a new resource \u0027JetFuel\u0027 that flows like RCS and then make all your jet engines use the new Jetfuel?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like a nice idea, except that on multi-stage rockets or planes you would find your upper stages drained of fuel to keep the lower stages going. There are plenty of threads with \u0022RCS tanks in action groups\u0022 and such because of it. It would be even worse if you had drop tanks for your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
