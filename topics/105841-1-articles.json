I used a ram intake to reproduce the rear of the plane.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

If you\u0027ve ever seen a MiG-15 in real life, it\u0027s actually tiny. I was at an airshow and they had a ton of planes. An F-4, F-16, F-18, F-14, F9F, A-6, A-7, even a Canberra! And then after the 30 foot F-14 there was this little tiny 15 foot MiG ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) It kinda goes both ways though, modern jets are huge when you get up close. You always see the pics and videos of flight deck crew on a carrier barely ducking under the fuselage, but it never really hits you how big they are. The intake on an F-14 is huge, you could fit two adults on top of each other in there. Very cool though Eorin, I love your work!"},{"CreatedByName":"eorin","CreatedById":79133,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:13:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Really beautiful replica, \u002B rep!\n\u003E EDIT: Ahah sei italiano anche tu\n\nsisi ^^ grazie =) ti aggiungo agli amici\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nBTW guys i have a 100% replica of a SU-37 in advanced state of WIP, so maybe tonight i might release it."},{"CreatedByName":"gmiddlemass","CreatedById":111037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T09:09:39Z","Content":"Great replica \u002B1 Fantastic work.\n\nHere\u0027s my much less serious \u0022Micro Mig\u0022 based very loosely on the Mig 17...\n\n![083735740C0AE71A324473A939C339156D3B8FAB](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/37497130781319891/083735740C0AE71A324473A939C339156D3B8FAB/)"},{"CreatedByName":"gmiddlemass","CreatedById":111037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T10:12:12Z","Content":"And a Micro Mig-21...\n\n![48B3DECEF9E430F4D2A73AC77FDA4E4AE59EA2E0](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/37497130781480696/48B3DECEF9E430F4D2A73AC77FDA4E4AE59EA2E0/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T23:17:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Great replica \u002B1 Fantastic work.\n\u003E Here\u0027s my much less serious \u0022Micro Mig\u0022 based very loosely on the Mig 17...\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/37497130781319891/083735740C0AE71A324473A939C339156D3B8FAB/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/37497130781319891/083735740C0AE71A324473A939C339156D3B8FAB/)\n\nHa!
