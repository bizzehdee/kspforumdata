I wanna say the MLRS but for aesthetics E-3 cant be beat.\n\nOhhh now it\u0027s on. Had some time today before having to pack my bags for my trip. The E.3\u0027s turret is lighter weight so in a traditional KSP battle it gets to shoot first.\n\nThe Relentless has 6 high penetration I-beam rockets that can punch through anything if aimed right. It doesn\u0027t have much gun depression because it needs to stay balanced when it fires the rockets. If it were free to go up and down it would take insane levels of SAS to keep it on target. The E.3 also has the advantage of having it\u0027s turret bearing protected by armor and is very sturdy. \n\nThe MLRS turret bearing is wide open to shoot and be 1 shot. Effectively rendering the tank ineffective. On top of that it\u0027s small I-beam missiles don\u0027t pack as much of a punch and need to be fired at the turret of the relentless or it won\u0027t do any major damage. \n\nIf we are going to do a battle I think it is best for an outside party to conduct it.\n\nI think this is a good rundown of the pros and cons of each tank I have discovered.\n\nMLRS\n\n Pros\n\n1. Absolutely huge chassis. (Shots need to be aimed or they won\u0027t hit something important)\n\n2. Gun Depression (Can go nearly full up and down. Letting it shoot anything it wants really)\n\n3. High Ammo Count\n\n4. Decent armor\n\nCons\n\n1. No probe cores\n\n2. Turret bearing wide open to shoot\n\n3. Turret is relatively unprotected and it\u0027s SAS units are easily destroyed. \n\n4. I-beam rockets can go straight through the tank\u0027s center. \n\n5. Suspension and turret kind of glitchy on the move. \n\n6. Less damaging weapons\n\nRelentless E.3\n\nPros.\n\n1. 6 High Velocity Anti-Tank rockets\n\n2. Minimally depressing turret makes aiming easier\n\n3. \u0022Machine gun\u0022 that rotates on it\u0027s own bearing can provide defense if the turret is jammed.\n\n4. Excellent frontal armor\n\n5. Strong suspension\n\n6. Turret bearing is protected\n\n7. Compact design. Turret only uses small probe cores and small SAS units.\n\nCons\n\n1. Turret traversing can be jammed by stuck projectiles\n\n2. Minimal gun depression limits targeting\n\n3. Minor weaknesses in certain parts of armor\n\n3. Lower armored turret and rockets\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T20:18:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 08:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jon144**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T21:09:20Z","Content":"When I used my BDAZ1 (MLRS chassis with Abrams turret) on your E1\u0027s with Abrams turret the result was rather interesting. \n\nLet\u0027s say I used two E1\u0027s and not more because of the frame rate.

Those girders are to stop stock projectiles. Something you keep failing to understand. \n\nI build all of my designs 100% stock because I don\u0027t like BD armory and so anyone who owns KSP can use them.\n\nThe girders are used as crumple zones to slow down incoming I-beams or deflect them entirely. This same system lets BD armory fire clear through and destroy the armor. Since I designed it for stock what stops I-beams lets BD armory shells straight through.\n\nThe armor design had only been tested to withstand stock weaponry only. I don\u0027t design anything to be used with mods.
