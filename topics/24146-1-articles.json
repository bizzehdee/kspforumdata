Namely, I want to make my plane\u0027s four jet engines all draw fuel from the single jet fuel tank behind the cockpit, but it\u0027s impossible for me to run fuel lines directly to the tank, as they don\u0027t have LOS to each other. Here\u0027s a pic, to explain what I mean:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D5smj0k.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022D5smj0k.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, the jet engines draw fuel directly from the attached rocket fuel tanks, which is a waste of oxidizer. I\u0027m sure there are modded parts I could use, or I could just modify the part configs to add a second fuel type just for the jet engines, but I was wondering if there was any way to avoid this using only a base, unmodified game. Thanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I just realized that the issue isn\u0027t as bad as I thought, as I can simply transfer the LiquidFuel from the jet tank to the rocket tanks that have been drained once I reach a stable orbit, but the question still stands, as i\u0027d rather avoid having to do this if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-26T03:33:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2013 03:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Solusphere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoldenShadowGS","CreatedById":59120,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T04:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe stick a little Oscar B or Round-8 Toroidal Fuel Tank to sit high enough somewhere that has line of site to all 5 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T04:08:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to structural parts.

I often run similar configurations, and whatever liquid fuel is used by the jets is then drawn from their tank when the rocket fires and the spare oxidizer from the outer tanks are pumped inward, balancing everything out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you find you have significantly more oxidizer than liquid fuel when you get to orbit, it means your jets used more than the one tank of fuel to get you there.
