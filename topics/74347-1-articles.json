I love this game and have tried a few different mods. I have looked threw some of the forum. I may be asking a dumb question or two along the way. I have a few mods installed and the game is very stable except for 1 problem I get error and crash a few times from it says the mono.dll tries to write to wrong memory. I have looked and the only place I see the file is the ksp_data folder. I am wondering if this may be caused by the mods. I am not a programmer by any means, but any ideas would be very welcome. anyway hope everyone is having a good day. thanks in advance for any info.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T00:08:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello kenneth keel and welcome to the forum. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m afraid folks will need a lot more information than that to be able to help.
