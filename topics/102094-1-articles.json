There\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s a whole multidimensional space to balance these around. Range, Resolution, Frequence, Colors...\n\nAnd now you really want to send kerbals at some point (if no probe would be perfect).\n\nEDIT: And the graphic-effects could really add to immersion.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T20:52:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 08:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy**"}]}
