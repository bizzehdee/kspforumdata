There too it depends on the design.\u00A0I generally keep airspeed around 100 m/s until at about 150 m radar altitude, then I level off to start bleeding it. My planes glide easily down to 40 m/s or so, and I touch down around 50, which leaves some room for\u00A0error.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe glideslope\u00A0varies for each craft but I give them enough wing that it is never all that steep. The closer you can get them to aerodynamically neutral while still keeping them passively stable the easier the final approach and landing is. Nose heavy designs are tricky to glide down easily as they tend to want to faceplant when they slow down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly there is no one size fits all answer to this, every plane is different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-03T11:51:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Space Shuttle had a specific system for this, Terminal Energy Management (TEM).\u00A0 They used the\u00A0 only available strategy, with\u00A0 very limited drag brakes (split rudder only), gear that couldn\u0027t be retracted in flight, and a drag chute, also of limited effect: they reentered on a path to be a little high and hot, then used what amounted to S turns in the last minute or two of descent to dispose of excess energy.\u00A0 And then they landed on long, long runways...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sturmhauke","CreatedById":190611,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-03T15:45:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI build my spaceplanes (mostly shuttles these days) to glide at an angle\u00A0of about 20 degrees; minimum airspeed tends to be around 100 m/s.
