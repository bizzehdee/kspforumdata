(I wouldn\u0027t mind futuristic engines at some point either that are borderline \u0022Cheating\u0022 at the end of the tech tree). More parts as well, as even with these mods some parts are missing, like being able to make proper rockets with internal parts. (Rockets that are very elongated, but break open completely to reveal a part inside) as a bad example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything to add science as well, huge plus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried Dangerous re entry, and Tac. But both of which kinda limit me more than I\u0027d like, as I\u0027m not exactly amazing at this game. I\u0027m not terrible either, but I setup a ship that can reach any planet and get back, but landing on planets, no go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that being said, I do like realism, like if anything makes you need to research longer, or more, etc.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d just love to expand my KSP game, just not sure what mods are worth my while for what I\u0027m looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JordanL","CreatedById":95655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T22:35:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere you go, this is the list I maintain for myself:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjkrLCHDTQhNdGRuY3YzV1hGR09XZlYxR3kzcnFneGc\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjkrLCHDTQhNdGRuY3YzV1hGR09XZlYxR3kzcnFneGc\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Specifically, KW Rocketry, NovaPunch and Near Future Propulsion on the fourth tab are probably most relevant to your question.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LadyAthena","CreatedById":88614,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T22:44:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JordanL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JordanL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere you go, this is the list I maintain for myself:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjkrLCHDTQhNdGRuY3YzV1hGR09XZlYxR3kzcnFneGc\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjkrLCHDTQhNdGRuY3YzV1hGR09XZlYxR3kzcnFneGc\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Specifically, KW Rocketry, NovaPunch and Near Future Propulsion on the fourth tab are probably most relevant to your question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow thanks alot, I see quite a few I may try ^.^ then pull my hair out as I try to stop KSP from crashing lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JordanL","CreatedById":95655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T22:46:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LadyAthena\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LadyAthena\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow thanks alot, I see quite a few I may try ^.^ then pull my hair out as I try to stop KSP from crashing lol\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve run almost all of these at the same time without crashing issues.
