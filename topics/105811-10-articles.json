Namely, I want to know precisely how the lab determines a value multiplier depending on its location. Does it simply read out the celestial body multipliers? And if so, does that indeed mean that a lab \u0022high in space above \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0022 generates less data from the same experiment than a lab \u0022low in space above \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0022... except for Kerbin, where it\u0027s reversed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of the descriptions I\u0027ve seen only make a difference between being generically \u0022in orbit\u0022 or generically \u0022on the surface\u0022. Since there is even the potential for \u0022splashed down\u0022 and \u0022landed\u0022 multipliers to be different (Kerbin does it!), that means that either the lab does not in fact examine the celestial body multiplier and has its own, less granular list of destination values somewhere...
