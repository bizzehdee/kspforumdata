Basically a MK2 drone without access to the part intended for the Mk2 yet. However, the cargo bay snaps and I click, but it is highlighted red and doesn\u0027t actually attach.\n\nI can build off a regular cockpit, add then add the proto to it, but if I delete the cockpit then it disables the whole build and doesn\u0027t let me make the proto the primary.\n\nIs there a way to switch the primary cockpit midbuild?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T02:46:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AaronLS**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:43:26Z","Content":"Change the root part; either press \u00224\u0022 or use the bit up with the translation/rotation icons.
