Sometimes the pad will explode when launching (due to flame hitting off center). I notice in the VAB that when I rotate around my rockets, it picks a point Off-center to rotate around too, and not the rocket itself. I\u0027ve seen this in other topics as a \u0022common symmetry issue\u0022 that may require rebuilding a rocket, but my problem is ALL of my saved rockets have the issue, as well as ANY new rocket I build... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have several common mods including MechJeb, TweakScale, EVA, Joint Reinforcement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phreak","CreatedById":81517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T00:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found out last night that if you save a ship off-center in the VAB or SPH it will be off-center when you launch the craft. Also, you should confirm that your mods are compatible with 1.0.5 (don\u0027t just copy your game data folder). I know that MechJeb is having several issues right now but will be updated soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
