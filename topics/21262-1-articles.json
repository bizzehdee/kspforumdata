I always use the symmetry button and last launch noticed my rockets engines had a little wobble in them, and I figured if I could get them stable that would stay straight and I would get a better line into space... however it didn\u0027t seem to change much. I always need advanced SAS on my ships, the regular ones don\u0027t cut it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, how does SAS work? Does on module cover the movement for an entire ship? Will multiple SAS systems do anything? Does the layer order have any effect on SAS? Does layering order have any effect on struts, fuel lines, fuel tanks, wings... anything that isn\u0027t an engine or a decoupler?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve watched a few video on youtube on how to time orbital slingshots to mun, and I\u0027ve gotten out there and gotten an orbit around it, but how do I (theoretically) get to planets past that? I could estimate an average velocity of my craft, but how could I measure distance to make sure my rocket ends up where it\u0027s supposed to?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what are prograde and retrograde...

That\u0027s realistic and unremarkable, so the important question is not what causes it, but how to control it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one thing, the longer a rocket is, the more it flexes along its length, so when designing a ship, it\u0027s best to keep it as short as possible by building outward. Right now, there\u0027s not much penalty for that because air resistance is not fully implemented in this version of the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS is supposed to be the more simple version, and is good at stopping unwanted rotation around the long axis, but not so good at stabilizing the other two axes. ASAS is supposed to be the advanced version. It\u0027s a little weaker at stopping lengthwise rotations, but better at stabilizing the other two axes. SAS exerts a force, and more than one exerts more force. ASAS exerts a lesser force, but is amplified by contol devices such as fins and RCS thusters. More than one ASAS does not exert noticeable additional control. In practice, one ASAS and no SAS is enough to control all but the largest rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two means of effecting control are control surfaces (fins, elevators, canards) and the \u0022thust vectoring\u0022-capable engines. Surfaces only work in atmosphere, while vectoring engines work anywhere, though they are slightly less powerful than static engines. If your ship doesn\u0027t have some of these things, it\u0027s essentially an unguided, ballistic missile that just goes where it\u0027s pointed, and can\u0027t be steered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, look at your ship as it flies. Are the parts flexing with respect to each other? If so, that can contribute to wobbliness. You want a rigid rocket (who doesn\u0027t?), so attaching the flexing parts to other things with struts may help stabilize the whole ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to other planets is almost exactly the same problem as getting two ships to rendezvous in Kerbin orbit. Have you tried that? Practice that for a while, and planet-voyaging will seem familiar to you when you get the full game.

It\u0027s an inherently unstable machine that require active steering to stay on track, as Robert Goddard found out after launching his. It\u0027s impossible both on real life and in KSP to build a rocket that goes straight without active steering. Since manual steering is quite hard you\u0027ll generally need ASAS or other autopilot on your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS is a reaction wheel, it can exert force to make your spacecraft rotate on any of the three rotational axis. The command pods have a built in miniture SAS which is sufficient for small ships.
