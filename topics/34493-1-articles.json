Lately I\u0027ve built a better Rocket base to get bigger ships and modules into space and have been building my modules and stations off of that base. But I want to get that original Orbital Command station onto that rocket base given that the original Rocket I built the station to use is really unstable and loves exploding mid maneuver when attempting to establish orbit. It\u0027d take about an hour to copy the design of the rocket base back onto the stations or vise versa, and I really dont want to put up with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is there a way to take two designs and get them both into the editor to combine them? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T20:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use Subassembly Loader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/subassembly-saver-loader/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/subassembly-saver-loader/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need this too: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30696-0-20-Subassembly-Loader-0-20-Compatibility-Patch?\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30696-0-20-Subassembly-Loader-0-20-Compatibility-Patch?\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-23T20:59:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2013 08:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Giggleplex777\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
