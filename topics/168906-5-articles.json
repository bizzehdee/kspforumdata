It leves behind its research station, the flag, and cargo boxes, but due to the light gravity of Minmus, it was unnecessary to split the lander in two halves as is done with\u00A0most disposable Mun landers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/nAcgJHQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nAcgJHQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/aefNyX7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aefNyX7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pilots report exceptional handling characteristics and unparalleled cockpit visibility. This\u00A0lander feels and looks almost more like an aircraft than a spaceship, and its compact frame and light mass gives it a sense of agility and responsiveness never before seen in spacecraft of this time, and certainly not in the lumbering Aurelian-class ferry landers.\u00A0Already dozens of helicopter pilots are lining up to join the astronaut corps for a chance to fly an Aquila.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/vh0Qgk2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vh0Qgk2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn minutes, Aquila 1 is soaring across the plains of Minmus, on its way to rejoin Scipio 9.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dstTCtV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dstTCtV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough the intercept happened in darkness, Aquila\u0027s overhead landing light helped illuminate Scipio and prevent a collision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1T5ueRb.png\u0022 alt=\u00221T5ueRb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/v2msQTB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022v2msQTB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalf an orbit and one sunrise later, the two ships are connected again in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dcpnuPv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dcpnuPv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter loading up Scipio with experiment data, sample containers, and other equipment from Aquila, the saddest part of the mission is at hand. Aquila has no station to return to after its long mission, and it now has no other purpose than to drift aimlessly in orbit, perhaps waiting for another set of explorers to discover it and either repurpose or salvage it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToo bad, it\u0027s probably my favorite design of this save so far...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ahjgiqO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ahjgiqO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore leaving it to its fate, the crew photographed the derelict lander as it drifts slowly out of view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9mIA0FC.png\u0022 alt=\u00229mIA0FC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there\u0027s little time to mourn the machine.

The G-forces peaked out at around 7 Gs, not the worst reentry ever, but far from the easiest for the crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/BaoKDXw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BaoKDXw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of it all, though, the three big yellow and white parachutes signify that the crew is safely home again, as their capsule drifts safely towards the ground. I wish I could have landed in the water, but oh well. If an off target touchdown is the worst thing that happens to me today, I\u0027ll count myself lucky...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/iuq5QQa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iuq5QQa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScipio 9 back home. The mission has provided invaluable data on the effects of long-term spaceflight, deep space navigation, and conducting surface activities on extremely low-gravity worlds. The first mission to interplanetary space is growing ever closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
