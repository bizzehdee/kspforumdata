I have now completed 5 missions to LKO and back to the runway with FAR and DRE. No problems at all and using the KSO mini shuttle exactly as provided.

I get a skip off the atmosphere rising back up to about 40 km altitude and thereby losing airspeed, then a beautiful glide down to land. There is no need for all that ablative shielding except perhaps on the crew cabin and on the wheels. I use DRE with stock Kerbin and traditional DRE functionality.
