All the cargo bays from B9 are of course designed mostly for planes and don\u0027t really contain an ideal cargo bay for rockets. Is there a mod out there that would fill this little void in my arsenal? Searches haven\u0027t been turning up any results. Ideally I\u0027m looking for cargo bays up to 3.75 metres\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Overjay","CreatedById":104131,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T19:05:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I\u0027ve found a collegue! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to search for \u0022Wolfpack Aeronautics\u0022.
