You can find out how much dV a rocket has with an equation called the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation. It looks pretty heavy but isn\u0027t that bad once you know all the variables, (dry mass of rocket, fuelled mass of rocket, rocket isp, etc.).

Usually the values are for a specific transfer window and transfer type. If you want to use less dV, you can sometimes get a transfer that takes longer but is less expensive, and vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps somewhat. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crush","CreatedById":59094,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T13:30:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGravity slingshots add delta-V to a vehicle (or remove it).
