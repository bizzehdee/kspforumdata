Of course that plane probably would have had 9km/s in the old aero system. Nonetheless, if I mentally put 4 more nukes on that plane to make it have a somewhat flyable TWR of 0.2 instead of a preposterous 0.067, hold my nose at the flagrant abuse of the cargo bay, put an actual Kerbal-containing cockpit on it, andgive it some solar panels, some reaction wheels, and some rcs, I expect you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll end up with somewhere close to 6km/s on orbit with that monster. Still no landing legs though, so forget about any airless bodies with more gravity than Minmus.

Not sure what your application for this thing is, but with that kind of TWR at takeoff, you could either boost a whole lot more fuel or drop half of those engines. At the TWR you have, I think a somewhat steeper ascent profile might prove more economical as well. You are speeding up so fast that your drag losses that low are going to become significant. But I must say it sure looks cool! There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a thread in Challenges titled \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Clowest dV SSTM\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 where optimizing really high TWR ascents is discussed (disclaimer: the air was the Vulcan atmosphere of 1.0.4 ). The big impression I came away with from participating in that discussion is that the Mammoth engine cluster is OP! With its very high TWR and good ISP (for a rocket anyway), it can boost the most gigantic payloads. This ship, with a Mammoth and 6 Nervs, can make orbit with 4.4 km/s dV and a TWR of 0.3-0.6, depending on fuel remaining.
