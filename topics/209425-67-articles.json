They typically are just a tad more expensive and out of personal experience I can say 128 GB is plenty for your OS and applications, but that games eat up \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of space. Then again, games sometimes benefit a bit from a SSD and sometimes don\u0027t gain much at all, so you might forego this option. Just be sure to buy a quality SSD, rather than trying to save a buck. I would advise recent Crucial drives, with Samsung being the next best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get the 128 GB drive I suggest you reserve the first x GB on your HDD for games by making this a separate partition. This is called short stroking and forces your HDD to use the faster bit of the drive for the data you choose to put on there - a hard drive gets slower the further you go on a drive (because of how the hardware of a HDD does its work). It should increase the performance in relevant applications quite a bit, just as long as you make sure there is nothing in the slower partition to cause reads when you use the fast bit, i.e. you should use the remaining disk space purely for bulk data that only occasionally gets read.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T23:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo builds for your perusal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pcpartpicker.com/user/DuoDex/saved/DVYbt6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pcpartpicker.com/user/DuoDex/saved/DVYbt6\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pcpartpicker.com/user/DuoDex/saved/T2RCmG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pcpartpicker.com/user/DuoDex/saved/T2RCmG\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been told that the FX-8350 sucks *edited out by the forum software, sorry!*, but I\u0027m not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T23:28:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat i5-4690k will run rings around an FX-8350 in almost every task, even multithreaded ones.

My thoughts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU: Go Intel, they are really unmatched performance-wise. I don\u0027t mind overclocking, so I would (and did) go Pentium G3258 on a tight budget, i5-4690K if you can afford it, matched with a micro-ATX motherboard with a Z97 chipset. Visit your local Microcenter, they often do unbeatable CPU/motherboard combo deals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGPU: You want to run Linux, so go with nVidia. No matter how good the deal you find on an AMD card, you will likely come to regret it if you use Linux. A 750ti card will fit in your budget, you might also find a deal on a 660 which will perform a bit better but use more power (I generally don\u0027t consider power usage on a gaming PC too important, it\u0027s usually not on 24/7).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAM: 2x4GB of whatever cheap DDR3-1600 RAM you can find. It\u0027s really a commodity, no sense paying extra for useless heatsinks or overclocking ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower Supply: This is an area where going cheap will potentially hurt you, and there is a broad range of quality among power supplies. Stick to a good brand (I like Corsair and Seasonic) and look for something about 450W. Modular design is quite useful in smaller builds, watch for that, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase: This is highly subjective. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811147209\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis case\u003C/a\u003E would seem to meet your needs really well (very compact, no optical bay, can fit a 10\u0022 video card) but is a bit pricey even at the sale price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStorage: Few things do more to make a computer feel snappy and responsive that an SSD, I cannot recommend them highly enough. Crucial\u0027s MX-100 line is wel-regarded and has good capacity per dollar, see if you can find a sale on a 256GB one (240-256GB seems to be the sweet spot for capacity per dollar).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T00:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour build looks good, but I\u0027d suggest (if you have to) go with a 250GB\u002B SSD and drop the HDD.
