Now, usually I\u0027d just reset the password, but the problem is that I created my original account almost 2 years ago and the e-mail I used back then is no longer accessible to me, so I just created a new account to post this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know for a fact that there are several other people who had the same problem, any ideas/solutions for this problem or is my account simply lost and do I need to continue on this one?
