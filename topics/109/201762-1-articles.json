In doing so, I found out that I was being spied on the whole time I was running KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust the fact that I bought the game and I had no idea that such a program would end up on my PC is a damned shame, and now I ask myself a question: Will Red Shell, as the program is called, be back again? Installed at KSP2. If so, then I won\u0027t buy the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want an answer from the game manufacturer, and a guarantee that no spy programs will run through the game. If the manufacturer cannot give the guarantee, it is very clear to me that there will be another program that ends up on the PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do my e-banking on my PC and when someone watches my keyboard or other data, I get angry. I already have correspondence with Valve Corporation, because the terms and conditions of KSP \u0026amp; Valve do not state that there were such programs in the installation. Because otherwise I would never make such games on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know Steam, Blizzard Entertainment Software also scan the PC for games and record some things, but when you quit them you don\u0027t have this problem.

me, based on their track experience, that it won\u0027t be in there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(For myself, I also black-hole the DNS to all of Red Shell\u0027s websites, just in case any
