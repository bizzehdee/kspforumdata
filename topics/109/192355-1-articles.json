You\u0027d want to use a hot-air balloon because the atmosphere is 90% hydrogen. The volume, temperature, and mass determine the altitude at which it floats.

Hot air balloons come in all sizes and shapes, thus I imagine that a\u00A0rather \u0022flat\u0022 balloon would be necessary for a base you would want to easily escape from. Depending on the strength of the wind, you might even want to have a balloons that act as \u0022wings\u0022 of a sort for any extra lift you can\u00A0scrape from the environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your power source is nuclear of either the fusion or fission variety (which I assume it is if you\u0027re brave enough to build a floating base on a gas giant in the first place...), you could most likely dump\u00A0the waste heat of your reaction into the\u00A0balloon to keep you afloat. As Snark has pointed out above \u2014 your reactor would need to be either \u003Ci\u003Every efficient\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0or\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Every small\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eor,\u00A0preferably,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eboth. \u003C/em\u003EAgain, this is\u00A0something I assume you\u0027d have the technology\u00A0worked out for\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0starting such a project in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow actually getting OFF the base is a different story altogether. If your deep enough down, anything with high enough quantity\u00A0of both lift and thrust should be enough to get you up and out with relative ease. If fusion is your powerplant of choice, starting out relatively empty on propellant and filling up your tanks as you ascend would be way to go. It would\u00A0probably be significantly\u00A0easier to do on a hydrogen rich gas giant than with a more \u0022mundane\u0022\u00A0combined-cycle air-breathing rocket on Earth or Kerbin (i.e.\u00A0SABRE).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe immediate example\u00A0that comes to my mind as a potential ascent vehicle is the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E-TAV37B \u0022Valkyrie\u0022 from Avatar(2009). When the\u00A0ISV Venture Star arrives at Alpha Centauri A, it uses fusion engines as its means to transfer into a lower Delta-V orbit around Pandora. After the two Valkyrie shuttles that are docked to it finish transferring personnel and payload to Pandora itself, they dip into the gas giant Polyphemus\u0027 atmosphere to scoop fuel to return to the ISV itself to make ready for the return voyage to Earth. The delta-wing shape of the vehicle should also be sufficient in making use of whatever lift there is to gain at a reasonable \u0022fuel scooping\u0022\u00A0depth in a gas giant\u0027s atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the idea itself...well, I don\u0027t think its completely necessary to the KSP2 experience, but it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0something I would like to see in one form or another.\u00A0If anything, I would imagine that the better physics for planets overall \u2014\u00A0rather\u00A0than just a thin crust of textures wrapped around an empty void \u2014 would provide the tools for modders to be able to add it in time. If there are easy to handle tools that control the ability to build bases (and it isn\u0027t just permanently and obtusely tied to us being\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eforced\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to build them a specific way on-world or off-world), then I imagine it would be doable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of what we already know \u2014 we do know that orbital shipyards, terrestrial body\u00A0base-building, fusion engines, torch engines and specialized fuel synthesis\u00A0(at least for Metallic Hydrogen) will all\u00A0be in the game, and we already have mining and\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E synthesis mechanics in the base game in the form of the mining excavators and the Covert-O-Tron.

Since intakes already scoop air in-game, I would imagine it wouldn\u0027t be so far of a stretch to have specialized intakes for\u00A0scooping gaseous\u00A0hydrogen (for fuel) or helium (for fusion) from atmospheres rich in those elements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally with allll of that said, I see two ways it could possibly go down:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) The more likely way\u00A0is that you can build an orbital shipyard, attach wings, a reactor, intakes, and engines\u00A0to it either while building it or through grabbing units (if you can\u0027t build however you want), then slowly lower it into the atmosphere of say, Jool. You scoop fuel for both the engines and reactor\u00A0with the intakes, stay airborne with the massive lift provided by the wings and the thrust of the engines, generate power to stay on heading with the reactor, and basically set it and forget it until you need to launch something from it. If your reactor generates enough power, maybe propellers would be something worth using instead or as a fallback,\u00A0depending on the density at your desired altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Orbital shipyards and base building in general doesn\u0027t let you attach random parts to the base structure itself, even with workarounds like grabbing units. Your best bet in this case is to build a giant platform with a few miniature spaceplanes/rockets, habitats, and modules docked to it instead. A lot less interesting and you won\u0027t be able to build stuff at that particular \u0022base\u0022, but still doable as long as you have the right parts for the job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, those are just my 99 cents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-14T04:02:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2020 04:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Brynderion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpelling, etc.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-14T04:09:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did a bit of research, and it\u0027d be hard to pull off. The concept is more than a bit hampered by the general awfulness of trying to get buoyancy in a mostly-hydrogen atmosphere.

I ballparked the Jupiter atmosphere as pure H2 at 200K/1 bar. To maintain 1000 tonnes of buoyancy, you\u0027d need a spherical balloon 200m in radius. I then assumed as insulation it would have 2.5mm of fiberglass (which would itself mass ~2200 tons), and I got a heat loss of 893 MW, about 9x what is being produced.

The concept is more than a bit hampered by the general awfulness of trying to get buoyancy in a mostly-hydrogen atmosphere. I don\u0027t have the time to iterate over the entire parameter space, but I have a suspicion that you might want to go below the 1-bar level just so atmospheric density increases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assumed a 1000 ton reactor producing 100 MW of thermal energy, with the hot gas inside the balloon maintained at a nice cozy 298.15K (room temperature). I ballparked the Jupiter atmosphere as pure H2 at 200K/1 bar. To maintain 1000 tonnes of buoyancy, you\u0027d need a spherical balloon 200m in radius. I then assumed as insulation it would have 2.5mm of fiberglass (which would itself mass ~2200 tons), and I got a heat loss of 893 MW, about 9x what is being produced.

That\u0027s a likely goodbye sweet prince). Eventually you\u0027d need to punch back into orbit, dock with a newer transport and then discard the old one. At that rate, it\u0027s likely more convenient just to have a dirigible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, while they are cool as hell, I wouldn\u0027t really see any purpose in having dirigible installations/colonies versus orbital counterparts equipped with atmospheric skimmer aircraft to handle mining.
