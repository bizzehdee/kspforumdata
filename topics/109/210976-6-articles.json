Of course, one can always find a challenge, but if to have a decent challenge you need to go deep into the far future and speculative technologies, it\u0027s not what KSP is to me (i.e. plausible realism \u002B complexity). I think actual space flight already has a lot of interesting challenges, which I wish KSP (1 and 2) would simulate. There are so many interesting - and real - mechanics that might make the game deeper and more enjoyable!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027m afraid the actual challenge will be like: build a HUGE rocket and make sure it doesn\u0027t disintegrate on launch and doesn\u0027t fry your PC; land on a planet and mine some Unobtainium, fuel your ship, repeat. And as a reward for all this grind you\u0027ll see some (undoubtedly beautiful, if your graphics card can handle it) fantasy planets. I mean, apart from colonies, there are basically no new interesting mechanics promised. Even a Career mode is probably not a thing, so hello overengineering!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, I just hope I\u0027m wrong and the game will indeed be as deep as most commenters here claim.
