But then, even landing at or building near the x100000 player construct could alter the timeline... Unless we ignore that for gameplay purposes, and treat x100000 player\u0027s constructs as something that can be changed in x1s timeline, and let x100000 continue unmolested in their conquest of space. Of course, in this case, they would have to timesync to interact... We\u0027re dealing with time travel. I don\u0027t know how it could be done. Maybe we are overthinking it. Perhaps players on a server all share the same world, and can accelerate their own time while others plod along?

How it basically works is this: Let\u0027s say a player only wants to timewarp for about 5 hours to do an orbital maneuver around Kerbin, while another wants to timewarp for 5 years for a hohmann transfer to Jool. A timewarp happens for 5 hours, and the Kerbin player peforms their maneuver. After this, the Kerbin player\u00A0says\u00A0the Transfer player can timewarp as much as they\u0027d like. Of course, in KSP 2, these timewarps should have a much higher maximum than KSP 1, as 5 years at x100,000 speed is about 7 minutes and 40 seconds of waiting. At\u00A0x1,000,000 speed, which is currently unavailable in KSP 1, this is only 46 seconds. Although, even during gameplay, this can interfere with some player\u0027s work, so x10,000,000 speed results in 4.6 seconds. In other words: hohmann planetary transfers are probably going to be much faster in KSP 2, especially with interstellar travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long as the Kerbin player isn\u0027t entering Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, it\u0027s fine. The game has to check for how long it will take for the Kerbin player to enter the atmosphere, and only timewarp by that much time.\u00A0The player moving through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere forces the entire game to remain in the physics warp range (x1 to x4), as long as other players allow it. (e.g. a player wanting to do some station construction definitely doesn\u0027t want x2 timewarp, so the player moving through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere won\u0027t get it.)

Though,\u00A0I think after 4 or so people this would break down quickly. It\u0027s a lot to ask for but if we had multiple options that can be set for what type of server you would like to run that would be cool but I assume that is a long shot. Getting multiplayer was a big enough hurdle to cross, having multiple types of it sounds like I might be spoiled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-15T08:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223989374\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203058\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221623743392\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180102\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mcwaffles2003\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n37 minutes ago, mcwaffles2003 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting multiplayer was a big enough hurdle to cross, having multiple types of it sounds like I might be spoiled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can play synced the whole time even if the game can manage unsynced play, still I don\u0027t see the point I\u0027m manually organising and turning KSP into a turn-based game instead of having the game deal with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust think about this scenario:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPlayers \u003Cstrong\u003EA\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EB\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EC\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EA\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EB\u003C/strong\u003E plan to cooperate on a Duna mission,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EC\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eis playing on his own for Duna exploration.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA\u003C/strong\u003E is going to build a Rover to collect samples, and launch it to Duna on \u003Cstrong\u003EWindow 1\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EB\u003C/strong\u003E is going to send an orbiter on \u003Cstrong\u003EWindow 1\u003C/strong\u003E that \u003Cstrong\u003EA\u003C/strong\u003E will use as a Relay to enhance coverage for the rover, and a Lander on \u003Cstrong\u003EWindow 2\u003C/strong\u003E to which \u003Cstrong\u003EA\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027s rover will bring the collected samples to launch in orbit, dock with the orbiter and brought them back to Kerbin.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EC\u003C/strong\u003E is doing its own thing, launching an orbiter on \u003Cstrong\u003EWindow 1\u003C/strong\u003E and a Lander with a rover on \u003Cstrong\u003Ewindow 3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlaying synced every player has to stop and wait for every other player move especially C has to stop a lot to wait for A and B even if he\u0027s not interacting with them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith my idea of unsynced play C is never interrupted and can finish his play session with time to spare and do something else.
