Sitting around for 20 minutes is boring in itself, but situations like this are solved\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eif the game supports automating this task\u003C/strong\u003E. Then it\u0027s less about sitting around for 20 minutes, and more about setting up a future node your kerbals will execute for you in 20 minutes\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eregardless of what your doing\u003C/strong\u003E. This not only leaves you able to agree to other people\u0027s time warps, but also frees you up to do\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eother stuff, including other missions, building or doing stuff with other people your playing with.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe goal isn\u0027t to focus on executing everyone\u0027s\u00A0tasks out of warp, rather its to execute\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Emore\u00A0tasks\u00A0within\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0warps, so you can warp to what you (and what the people your playing with) care about.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could make an argument that the game shouldn\u0027t make those tasks so easy, and I\u0027d agree\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eexcept\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0if your playing with other people that don\u0027t care about you executing that maneuver, then you shouldn\u0027t care about it much either and let the game execute that ask for you, so again you can focus on what the people your playing with want to focus on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA key aspect of\u00A0multiplayer should be having multiple players within\u00A0the same context to observe what your doing when out of warps. So if you and your friends are building a station, when one friend gets to the station and needs to dock, warps are off. But all players should be able to more or less \u0022setup\u0022 what their missions are doing if they aren\u0027t important, switch context to what the friend docking is doing, watch them succeed/fail, then jump back to what they were doing before hand, or if you don\u0027t care about their docking procedure you go check on other missions during the \u0022non-warp\u0022 period. If everyone is just \u0022waiting\u0022, then everyone can agree to warp to what matters next thing \u003Cstrong\u003Etogether.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy ideal KSP multiplayer is a shared experience, rather than a shared sandbox, but that means coordination is key to deal with time warps. It\u0027s a simple enough concept to understand since its essentially what you\u0027d do by yourself, except you only need to coordinate with yourself on when to warp so you don\u0027t crash some other mission out there. The idea breaks down if one wanted to just go out and do their own thing thru time, but I personally think playing that way is just single-player with shared saved data, which technically can be supported right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes a shared warp scheme forces you to coordinate when/what is going on... but I feel like that should be the\u00A0point of multiplayer in a game like this and in that sense KSP becomes more of a \u0022team game\u0022, except your playing against the environment the game creates.(space physics)\u00A0 Remove some of the \u0022busy-work\u0022 to the kerbals themselves and your more or less left with stuff you\u0027d\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Elike\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0to see your friend accomplish (or fail).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223998685\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221625182752\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208516\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Linky\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, Linky said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy own personal bet is that they already have a decent plan in place, and everything that this entire thread has guessed is wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, they have to already have a plan and are executing it.
