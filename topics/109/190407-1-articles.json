For example Jeb is the top test pilot for Keuthan Aircraft, working for a mid size manufacturing firm because of PTSD and approaching burnout. Val is one the top Naval Squadron Commanders, and one of the top 15 fifteen pilots in the Naval Air Service. Bill is a recovering addict and\u00A0a tool pusher but got a break and cleaned up, for the most part, when the offer to work with the program finally found him. I could go on, but you get the point.\u00A0 Those are just one line descriptions, full backstories really should be a few paragraphs for minor characters\u00A0to pages for major characters. The Star Wars canon is a good example of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that is a mere bagatelle you may say, or at least you may say if you are of certain cultural persuasions.

But, for example, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AlienLegacy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlien Legacy\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0is a game heavy on both backstory and plot. The mechanics of the game guide the player towards the plot. In this case about half the weight of the game is in the plot, the rest in mechanics. The extreme of this could be \u003Ca href=\u0022https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenoSaga\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EXenoSaga\u003C/a\u003E, very high on cut-scene*plot/gameplay ratio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack\u0027verse, or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0027Verse\u003C/a\u003E,\u00A0is everything.

All of these include that which directly plot related mentioned in book/movie/episode. For the sake of explaination I am going to slice plot and characterization of this, essentially all that is Backstory. But, this does not mean plot details. For example, out of the Star Wars\u0027 Verse the standing record for the Kessel Run is approximately 12 parsecs, with all the risk that implies. The safe route is at least 20, and maybe more depending on the ship. But... there is of course\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfAnotherStory\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe villain of another story\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0in which a child warren rat of an industrial world rises to become a top ace pilot and counter-insurgent operative to avenge his orphaning because some farm-boy got off a lucky shot. In that story the main events of the first Star Wars movie become the mere colour details of the \u0027Verse rather than the backstory. It really does depend on where in the \u0027Verse you stand what is backstory and what is \u0027Verse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of what makes KSP 1 what it\u00A0is, is the lack of a backstory, any kind of backstory.
