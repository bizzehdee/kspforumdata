To the best of my knowledge everyone just had to \u0022pick a height\u0022 and try to remember it to at least be able to dock their own crafts together, but if anyone wanted to download a cool rover or base to dock with they had to just hope for the best with the port offset and adjust their own version to try to make it fit closely enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022all purpose\u0022 solution I ended up with was to always use something I call the \u0022one up standard\u0022; all docking ports are always offset by exactly the height they\u0027d end up if they were stuck to the end of one same diameter part on top of\u00A0an identical same diameter part - essentially a 1,25m port is offset by 1,25m from the ground. The height isn\u0027t ideal in all cases but so very easy to remember and to work with since you only need to temporarily stick one or two fuel tanks to any craft to see with utmost precision how high the port needs to be. With the colony system the need for keeping track of ports for mobile pieces might be lower but it could also be higher, since surely many players would like to build spacecrafts that can land and drop an exploration rover that is meant to go out and collect information and then come back to dock with its mothership.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo back to the headline, should KSP2 include a protip to use \u00221up\u0022 as a standard, to make it easier for players to remember how to dock their own creations and also to make it easier for them to dock with stuff made by others - not least because of multiplayer? Should it rather be called \u0022X up\u0022 where X can be any number but the default is one? Is there another system that\u0027s better somehow?\u00A0Discussion time! \\o/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-29T17:01:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that\u0027s just the kind of thing that\u0027s interesting for the player to solve.

Assuming that surface interactions are fixed and craft stay put when parked, the most common reason to want to dock is for resource transfer. If it was possible to accomplish that just by attaching a hose, you wouldn\u0027t even need those pesky docking ports, except for things like surface base modules, and making those compatible with each other is all part of the fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFWIW my solution is just to dock all of my modules together in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, and do a test-drive too. When adding modules, I keep a reference module to compare against, and test my new ones against that. Suspension travel affects it so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s even possible to position them precisely without testing. In some cases I\u0027ve also used Breaking Ground parts to create elevatable docking ports -- that solves the problem tidily when it\u0027s appropriate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-29T17:32:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince colony construction will have it\u0027s own editor, I don\u0027t see a reason to worry about docking base components together.

The mineshafts from Pathfinder come to mind for that. I think it was D\u0027magic that has something similar too. MKS had frames that would allow you to adjust the height of your base parts and move them into position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have the Breaking Ground dlc, you could use the pistons or the hinges to help level your base and to raise or lower the base as necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are solutions to the problem. But without the bg dlc or the use of mods, it\u0027s very limited to what you can actually do in KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP2\u00A0devs know about and understand the limitations of base building and resource transfers.\u00A0They are adding solutions to make it easier to build functional bases and to do resource transfers without turning it into a chore. The BAE will allow you to assemble or edit your base with local and delivered resources. The devs\u00A0have said they are planning\u00A0to automate resource deliveries. All this is pointing to a good possibility that you won\u0027t have to dock a vehicle to a base to transfer resources. You won\u0027t have to manually dock base components together. The only reason to dock vehicles together is because you want to, not because you have to. And for the rare occasions you will have to transfer resources from one vehicle to another, there are valid solutions mentioned in the post. You don\u0027t need to create a rule for a part that will have a very small use case that most people won\u0027t care about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-30T19:28:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223874932\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197791\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221604027159\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest solution is adjustable legs and suspensions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr just a docking port on an arm that automatically telescopes and articulates to the target port\u00A0when you get close.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPre-breaking groune, i used retractable landing gear to raise/lower things until they snapped when the height wasn\u0027t quite right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter an update, even without BG, I could adjust spring strength to achieve that (though it may not work on gilly, if even the weakest setting is strong enough)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith BG, I also did articulated arms with a docking port on the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I always built to a mk3 bay standard, with a 1.25m node attached docking port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerkyJerkyWreaksHavoc","CreatedById":207646,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-30T19:32:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni just want KSP2 to come already... i dont care whether or not it has a standard docking height... i really wanna play the game so badly...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
