Also, not sure we need to invent some McGuffin for it. There\u0027s still starlight, so you\u0027d get same illumination as on a clear moonless night. It\u0027s not a lot, but it\u0027s not pitch black. It\u0027d make exploration more difficult and more treacherous, both because of poor illumination and because you can\u0027t rely on solar. But I think it would feel like a challenge, rather than frustration. So long as there\u0027s something exciting there to find, I think it would be worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne rather grim possibility is ruins of a civilization on that dead world. If a habitable planet gets knocked out clear of its orbit, say, during a stellar near-miss, the planet will turn into a snowball with no weather to speak of\u00A0within years. Eventually, atmosphere itself will condense and liquify, increasing the ocean level by some tens of meters at the most, leaving a lot of the cities open to vacuum.
