So we know the performance will be at least decent on Ryzen 7 3700X, which is why I keep bringing it up. But will one quarter of that be enough to be playable? It\u0027s very hard to say. We will really have to wait and see some real KSP2 benchmarks on variety of CPUs once the Early Access is out to start getting a measure on this. It might be that I\u0027m being entirely too pessimistic, the game will be optimized well enough to blaze through on consoles, and it will be very well playable on a good CPU from 10 years ago.

It\u0027d certainly be preferable. But technically, the plank for \u0022has to perform well,\u0022 is gen 9 consoles. If the consoles can handle it, you can ship the game, and odds are, your sales will be mostly fine. The rest is a bonus, as far as min spec for a title goes. It\u0027s a nice bonus, I\u0027m sure Intercept is going to try hard to get the min spec as low as possible, and I hope they are successful in this, but there is no concrete obligation, either financial or contractual, so until there are official specs, 3700X is the floor of what we can be absolutely certain of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikely, it will be lower, of course. As people have mentioned above, they really ought to try to hit good performance at least on recent R5 and i5 chips. But I don\u0027t think it will go a lot lower than that, and I\u0027m skeptical of support for some of the older hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe do, indirectly have a lower bound as well. We know that the plans for gen 8 release have been nixed, kind of predictably. And I\u0027m confident saying it\u0027s not because of the graphics. So we know the min spec is going to be significantly above what the PS4 Pro and XB1X are capable of. The CPU on these was very different from anything AMD released to the public in that exact architecture, but it\u0027s effectively two 4-core modules, each very similar to what they later released as part of their A8-6410 APU. So if you think of PS4 Pro or XB1X CPU as a pair of A8-6410s, you won\u0027t be far off. I\u0027ve seen people compare it to FX-8150, but while there are a lot of architectural similarities, the FX chips run at much higher clock, 3.6GHz in the case of 8150, and so each core is nearly twice as fast as that of PS4 Pro/XB1X CPU. So the only way your FX-8150 might perform as badly as a gen8 console is if you have it severely thermally throttled, causing it to drop to ~2-2.5GHz and staying there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeedless to say, we can be all around confident that the min spec won\u0027t be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0low. But there is a LOT of room between a pair of A8-6410s and an R7 3700X. The min spec for KSP2 is somewhere in there. You might call that uselessly broad, and I won\u0027t be offended, but honestly, that\u0027s all we have concrete data on. Everything else is speculation and some degree of wishful thinking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anth","CreatedById":161238,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-29T15:25:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224213734\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221672307813\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277770\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoldForest\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, GoldForest said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think most people have the R5 3600X if they\u0027re AMD.

Some of the techniques that Intercept is using are VRAM heavy, but we ran slightly scaled down versions of similar techniques on PS4 Pro hardware just fine. So, like, obviously you won\u0027t be running on ultra settings, but there is absolutely no reason you\u0027d need to completely disable any of the visual flare to make it run smooth on a 1080. So long as Intercept lets us adjust fidelity on some of these things, like quality of volumetric effects, it can be dialed in to where you\u0027ll barely notice a difference running at 1080p.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCPU-wise, again, lets hope, but my confidence isn\u0027t there.

I haven\u0027t seen that much of a problem with leaks in vanilla. Though, I\u0027m sure there are some. C# garbage collection isn\u0027t exactly the cleanest or most robust, and a lot of the lifecycle is obfuscated by Unity\u0027s scene management, so it\u0027s easier to end up with some cyclic references that prevent objects from going away.

More in some studios than others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods tend to leak like a sieve. They aren\u0027t, typically, written by professional programmers, and in my experience, people aren\u0027t taught good practices for a particular language until they start working with it in the industry. And every language I know of, with exception of maybe Rust, is leaky by default. C being the worst, of course, but languages like Java and C# create a false sense of safety with their garbage collection, which can actually lead to more code where things seem to work fine until they don\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve briefly looked at the work experience of the Intercept team members who have it marked on their LinkedIn a while back, and they certainly don\u0027t look like amateurs. Hopefully, they\u0027ll be able to maintain best practices and deliver code that doesn\u0027t leak. If the mods run in Lua, depending on exactly how that\u0027s handled, it might even help there. But there are a lot of unknowns in that regard. It depends a lot on how the memory for Lua scripts is sandboxed and on how the asset loading works for modded parts, since it\u0027s a lot easier to create a noticeable leaks with art assets than some state variables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224214160\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221672425386\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174038\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LoSBoL\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, LoSBoL said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen again, playing Vanilla KSP on my old laptops (with throtelling I7-4600u or I5-5300u and their IGPU\u0027s) over the past in planes and on holiday ran playable when you\u0027re not to demanding.\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003EI\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Edon\u0027t see a reason as to why it would be different with KSP2 and 8 years of IT development since.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is very heavily main thread bound. This is why the improvement from a decent laptop CPU to a high end desktop CPU wasn\u0027t that high. Laptops can generally boost one core nearly as much as a desktop, and the main performance edge of desktop CPUs for anything remotely recent has been more cores and being able to boost more of them to higher speeds at the same time. When only one thread in KSP is doing most of the work, a 4600U boosting one core to 3.3GHz or 4770K boosting to 3.9GHz doesn\u0027t make\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0much difference. In fact, it\u0027s pretty close to these exact 18% improvement when you look at single thread benchmarks, and for KSP, that\u0027s what matters the most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, not a lot has changed on the Unity side in the past decade to improve on that. And while there has been a lot of the improvement in cache and instruction efficiency, most of the tech improvement has been focused on getting more cores in. So if 13700K outperforms the aforementioned 4770K by a factor of 7 in overall benchmarks, the single thread improvement of 13700K is only a factor of two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, if you took a main thread bound game like KSP that runs at 60FPS on a 13700K, it could still manage a marginally playable 20FPS on that old 4600U laptop. That\u0027s still an improvement, but not what we usually think of as 8 years of progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, KSP had a lot of problems. There were per-frame update tasks that were very poorly written and optimized, resulting in majority of that performance hit, especially for larger rockets, to come from things that should have been almost instant to compute. We expect KSP2 to have solved majority of these. KSP 2 will also have a much better utilization of threads. They simply have to make good use of threads to get good enough performance out of the consoles, that are kind of running at laptop speeds, but with 8 cores / 16 threads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time, some of the tasks that were expensive in KSP, like trajectory updates and physics, are still here and have gotten a lot harder, because now we have continuous collisions, ships using engines in warp, likely higher warp multipliers to accommodate interstellar, colony management, huge ships built at space docks, and so on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost games on the market are limited by the graphics. This is why we\u0027re used to seeing 10 year difference in tech completely obliterating what used to be considered a high end game. CPUs haven\u0027t advanced nearly as much as GPUs, as there hasn\u0027t been quite the same market pressures there. And KSP was and KSP2 almost certainly going to be one of the few games where your CPU is what matters. And worse, the specs that matter to these games aren\u0027t what we usually see highlighted as important for high performance CPUs. A lot of conventional wisdom about games just doesn\u0027t imply. There is every reason to believe that KSP2 will run much better than KSP when benchmarked on corresponding contemporary hardware, but we\u0027ll really just have to wait and see how Intercept went about building this game in regards to how it will scale with lower end modern CPUs or some older hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gotmachine","CreatedById":163039,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-30T21:48:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224214215\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221672436423\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t seen that much of a problem with leaks in vanilla.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are massive memory leak issues in vanilla.

We\u0027ll have to see how much optimisations KSP2 has made, but I\u0027m not worried about that, they knew exactly what problems needed to be solved to get the performance better then KSP1.

There is every reason to believe that KSP2 will run much better than KSP when benchmarked on corresponding contemporary hardware, but we\u0027ll really just have to wait and see how Intercept went about building this game in regards to how it will scale with lower end modern CPUs or some older hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can fully agree again, I mentioned before that KSP is not a \u0027gamers\u0027-game and indeed, it will again be single performance bound and we\u0027ll have to wait and see to confirm, but I remain confident that you won\u0027t need a high tear PC and you should be able to run it on a 5 year old laptop with visuals turned down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncremental single core performance development however is not because lack of market pressure, but because we\u0027ve hit the ceiling of what is possible on that front\u00A0 almost a decade ago, we\u0027ve only been getting small optimisations each generation since.
