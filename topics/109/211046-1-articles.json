And that has me wondering, does that imply that other star systems will be more realistically scaled? It would certainly be interesting, and it lines up with another thing we know about KSP 2, that being places further away are more difficult to navigate. Having increasingly realistic scales as you get further away from Kerbol would indeed contribute to that difficulty curve. It also seems like a great lore opportunity, like maybe some kind of stellar effect has lead to a region of space having denser matter than usual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-12-14T18:40:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2022 06:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Tux1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-14T18:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think so.

I think a known exoplanetary system is a more interesting idea. The only problem is that our ability to detect exoplanets is kind of weak, so all these star systems look very barren in comparison to Sol. It\u0027s likely that many of them are filled with many more small planets and other objects, plus moon systems around the known planets, but we can\u0027t detect these things to make an accurate maps of them. However, astronomers have gotten pretty good at making simulations of star system formation that closely match the known features of a system so that the resulting simulation can be studied in far more details. Naturally, Sol is the main target of such research, but I\u0027m sure there are simulations of other star systems. So if we wanted to have a system in KSP that\u0027s pretty much \u0022This is a real system, best we can tell,\u0022 I\u0027d take a simulation of one of these star systems with known exoplanets and use it to fill in the gaps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-15T21:21:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with realistic scales similar to our solar system is that they can be very boring.
