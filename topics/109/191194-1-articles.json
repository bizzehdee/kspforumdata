Would love to go on a major keyboardspree on the topic but that will have to wait until my most important experiments and prototypes are done, hopefully later this year barring any mysterious globally looming virus mutating and killing me or some other such\u00A0amusing event happening. At any rate all I\u0027ve found in the raw data everywhere indicates that gravity isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E monolithic force - just like you can\u0027t have a magnet with only one pole, and just like a magnetic field can\u0027t get any denser than what the carrier photons permit the gravitational pull has an upper limit of how densely the carrier particles can be packed.\u00A0This means\u00A0a neutron star is the densest it gets and a black hole is just an even bigger neutron star with enough surface area for the carrier particles to reach far outside in great enough\u00A0numbers to affect light substantially.\u00A0This also makes far more sense when you look at supposed\u00A0observations of \u0022ring shaped black holes\u0022 that are\u00A0thought to be\u00A0black holes that somehow became neat little rings that are perfectly stable and balanced. Right. Something as outlandish as infinite density\u00A0ending up\u00A0in a perfectly uniform manner so it doesn\u0027t break up in two\u00A0cores but\u00A0stays as a stable neat donut should have been a pretty good clue that something is amiss with the whole concept. Funny how a rapidly spinning and flattened neutron star fits the observable profile perfectly instead huh? Like I said this all annoys me endlessly, there is actual observational data that directly indicates major faults in\u00A0a number of\u00A0widely accepted theories just like this mess. This is what happens when someone forms a hypothesis\u00A0after playing for too long with too little hard data, any slight faults in the original observations\u00A0multiply in\u00A0each\u00A0step until you end up with nothing but pure speculation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEhhhhhhh...

Neutron stars are made of neutrons not because general relativity is wrong, but because of the very well verified Pauli exclusion principle. Neutrons will not occupy the same space at the same time. A black hole, however, is a neutron star which had enough mass to create a gravitational field significant\u00A0 enough to overcome the Pauli exclusion principle\u0027s repulsion. This repulsion is due to the strong nuclear force, a well documented part of quantum chromodynamics. This does not require the overthrow of general relativity, which has been verified in all its predictions to an astounding degree of accuracy.\u00A0 Additionally, the graviton is postulated as the gauge boson of the gravitational force, much like the electromagnetic force has the photon. Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces, and the graviton is it\u0027s smallest component. No wonder it hasn\u0027t been detected yet. Finding it would pave the way to a quantum theory of gravity, such as string theory. Other theories postulate that it does not actually exist (Quantum Loop Gravity).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo one says black holes have infinite mass, just infinite density.

I\u0027m extremely sceptical of gravitons in their purest sense existing, what we see as gravity is overwhelmingly likely to be other forces we are familiar with acting on specific particles that are in a low energy state where they don\u0027t behave in such a way that we can observe their presence the way we normally look for them - instead they act to pull nearby matter together and appear as a kind of\u00A0\u0022virtual\u0022 gravitons. Would love to go on a major keyboardspree on the topic but that will have to wait until my most important experiments and prototypes are done, hopefully later this year barring any mysterious globally looming virus mutating and killing me or some other such\u00A0amusing event happening. At any rate all I\u0027ve found in the raw data everywhere indicates that gravity isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E monolithic force - just like you can\u0027t have a magnet with only one pole, and just like a magnetic field can\u0027t get any denser than what the carrier photons permit the gravitational pull has an upper limit of how densely the carrier particles can be packed.\u00A0This means\u00A0a neutron star is the densest it gets and a black hole is just an even bigger neutron star with enough surface area for the carrier particles to reach far outside in great enough\u00A0numbers to affect light substantially.\u00A0This also makes far more sense when you look at supposed\u00A0observations of \u0022ring shaped black holes\u0022 that are\u00A0thought to be\u00A0black holes that somehow became neat little rings that are perfectly stable and balanced. Right. Something as outlandish as infinite density\u00A0ending up\u00A0in a perfectly uniform manner so it doesn\u0027t break up in two\u00A0cores but\u00A0stays as a stable neat donut should have been a pretty good clue that something is amiss with the whole concept. Funny how a rapidly spinning and flattened neutron star fits the observable profile perfectly instead huh? Like I said this all annoys me endlessly, there is actual observational data that directly indicates major faults in\u00A0a number of\u00A0widely accepted theories just like this mess. This is what happens when someone forms a hypothesis\u00A0after playing for too long with too little hard data, any slight faults in the original observations\u00A0multiply in\u00A0each\u00A0step until you end up with nothing but pure speculation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe things you see on the internet...
