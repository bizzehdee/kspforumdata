Doubly so since when the LV-N was \u0022adjusted\u0022 to have a tendency to overheat, the mere concept of heat radiators (and reentry heat) wasn\u0027t even in the game yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s an OOOOOOOOOLLLLLD stat of the LV-N. Did I mention the part where they INTENTIONALLY made this engine bad \u0022so that it doesn\u0027t replace all the chemical engines when you\u0027re in a vacuum\u0022? I probably mentioned that before.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s a bad design decision, and if you\u0027re going to do that, you might as well not even put the LV-N engine in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe WHOLE POINT OF A NUCLEAR THERMAL ROCKET is that it\u0027s BETTER than a chemical engine. If that means it has to move to a higher cost node in the tech tree, fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason (in KSP 1) that the LV-N shouldn\u0027t have any of these \u0022bad habits\u0022 is because we don\u0027t GET anything better than it. There is no \u0022LV-N but we worked out all the bugs\u0022. So the one we DO get should be the one that they already worked out all the bugs (like the obscenely high mass, and the utterly arbitrary tendency to overheat).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing able to do engine burns while under time warp isn\u0027t what\u0027s needed for the LV-N. That\u0027s a solution for the ion engine\u0027s thrust being too high right now. The LV-N is not at all like an ion engine. It produces a significant thrust (even tho 60kn isn\u0027t a lot, it\u0027s a lot more than the single-digit kilonewtons of the very-much-too-high-thrust ion engine in KSP 1). What I\u0027m trying to say is that even in the sad sorry state the LV-N is currently in in KSP 1, it is still a \u0022High Thrust\u0022 type of engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIRL, burns with such engines are supposed to last anywhere from \u0022less than a minute\u0022 to \u0022maybe 20 minutes\u0022 for chemical engines. And considering that the IRL NERVA had a thrust greater than the IRL RL-10 (an upper stage hydrolox engine) with roughly double the specific impulse, I\u0027m not convinced that \u0022thrust while on rails\u0022 is the solution for the long burns of craft attempting to use the LV-N.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd still nobody here in this thread has given me a satisfactory answer as to why I can make a chemical rocket stage that performs better than a nuclear stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBetter how? Let me show you the ways:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nChemical stage beats LV-N stage by having a lower part count (mostly because radiators, but also because long 5m fuel tank \u002B KR-2L Rhino engine = good stuff, compared to needing like 20 LV-N\u0027s to get a similar thrust to A SINGLE KR-2L Rhino)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHigher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E overall (those LV-N\u0027s are HEAVY, so heavy that in fact my best idea of how to best use them is not as an engine but as a piece of ballast for a submarine\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the numbers, the downsides of using a chemical stage are quite minor in comparison to the upsides. When I do the math, I figure that I sacrifice maybe at most a couple kilometers per second of delta-V when comparing the chemical solution to the nuclear one. That right there is wrong. That right there should be \u0022you sacrifice maybe 5 kilometers per second for choosing the chemical engines\u0022. That\u0027s how much better nuclear engines should be than chemical ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there\u0027s a hidden qualitative downside to using the chemical solution. It\u0027s boring. I wanna use the shiny nuclear engines, not the \u0022you\u0027ve had something like this since maybe your 5th hour of playing Science mode\u0022 vacuum-optimized chemical engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI WANT to use the LV-N. But it\u0027s not worth it. This gives me INTENSE cognitive dissonance, because the results of the math are basically directly opposite to the results I expected. Not only are they unintuitive, they\u0027re perverse in that the chemical rocket solution is \u0022by design\u0022 always better than the nuclear solution, for the reason of \u0022Because HarvestR and/or NovaSillisko said they shouldn\u0027t be too good or we won\u0027t have any engine variety\u0022. Who are they to say that there SHOULD be engine variety? That\u0027s not how it works IRL, and that\u0027s not how rockets work at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes, HarvesteR made the game originally.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes, NovaSillisko made the original model for the LV-N.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat doesn\u0027t mean they had a good idea of what they should act like as far as the numbers go.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeck, the Mainsail (yes, that mainsail) used to have a tendency to overheat just like the LV-N does now, granted it wasn\u0027t particularly severe, but it was there. That happened for a reason that was good at the time, but has been coded out of the game subsequently (Engines used to have their heat animation tied to how hot the part physically was, meaning to progress the animation you had to make the engine itself actually hot, but now we don\u0027t have to do that anymore because a new PartModule was created to handle linking the engine heat animation to the position of the throttle instead).\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is my strong opinion that when the Mainsail lost its tendency to overheat, the LV-N should have as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor what it\u0027s worth, in my own playing of KSP, I entirely remove the ability of the LV-N to generate any kind of heat (via commenting out one line in the engine\u0027s part config file). That and reducing the dry mass by an entire metric ton makes the LV-N into something worth using on something other than a spaceplane with a very specific design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-20T23:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell we already know there will be at least one more NERVA engine and I personally hope there are 4 or 5 variants with different applications like Nertea\u2019s Kerbal Atomics mod.

The actual NERVA\u0027s vacuum thrust was around 300kn, and the NERV\u0027s is 60kn. The actual one was still a lot less high-thrust than a lot of other chemical engines, but it still had at least a fair amount, enough to be used as a sustainer and not just solely a deep-space engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink of the tradeoff this way: Chemical engines get high thrust for medium to low efficiency, electric engines get super-high efficiency but with absolutely miniscule thrust, and NERVAs get about twice the efficiency of the chemical engines (but nowhere near the electric drives) for a moderate amount of thrust. You can still reflect that thrust-versus-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E tradeoff dynamic while keeping true to the actual capabilities of a nuclear thermal rocket. In KSP2, let\u0027s say, the updated NERV could have something like 120-150kn of thrust with the same isp, letting it be a little more useful as a sustainer while still being outclassed in thrust by methalox engines and in efficiency by electric ones (and potentially outclassed in both of those by more exotic types of nuclear engines that could come to KSP2, like the SWERV(?), but we\u0027re not there yet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-04T08:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224214957\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197513\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221672670720\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223516\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wheehaw Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/2/2023 at 3:45 PM, Wheehaw Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I\u2019ve said before about life support, every time KSP1 added more realism, the game got a bit harder and much more satisfying and enjoyable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s true about gameplay, not realism.
