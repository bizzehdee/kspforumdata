I believe having 1st person EVA with the insane graphics would make the game wayyyy more immersive, and just looking at your crafts in the eyes of a kerbal would be amazing. Although there may be constraints that I\u0027m not aware of, I feel like this could be feasible for KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
