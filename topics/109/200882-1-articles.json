And that\u0027s why it doesn\u0027t matter much if it\u0027s a black hole or a neutron star from that distance - you are nowhere near the surface of a stellar mass neutron star, let alone the event horizon of a stellar mass black hole at that point. So it\u0027s just a compact object you wouldn\u0027t even be able to see that you can maybe use for an extreme Oberth maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA supermassive black hole is far more exciting, as you can traverse its event horizon in one piece, but that comes with all sorts of technical problems. Orbits near event horizon aren\u0027t conic sections, so you have to properly integrate them as if you were doing n-body physics, and even then, doing so with relativity in mind is problematic. Time dilation alone, which diverges at actual event horizon, seems like an absolute gameplay barrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo compact objects effectively come in two varieties, as far as implementing them in KSP goes. Game-breaking or boring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, one thing that might actually be exciting is a red giant / neutron star binary, with giant\u0027s atmosphere being swirled into the neutron star. And though you probably couldn\u0027t get close enough to that neutron star\u00A0to have any real gameplay reason to do so, because yikes, it would, at very least, look absolutely spectacular, and could still be an interesting star system to explore. That\u0027s the only kind of stellar mass compact object that\u0027d be worth having in KSP2, in my opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
