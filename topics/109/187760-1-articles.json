Ideally, I think the game could potentially introduce the ability to weld certain parts together, effectively eliminating the joint physics for that part.\u00A0 It could maybe be a later tech discovery (maybe have struts available earlier, and strut-less welding unlock later on) and primarily focus on inline connections, primarily through similarly sized parts such as fuel tanks, while it would not work for radially mounted parts.\u00A0 That could be a good sweetspot, allowing you to eliminate some of the wobble of tall rockets (and simplify physics calculations to boot) while also preventing abuse of the system to create more physically unfeasible designs.\u00A0 Certain types of procedural parts could also be an answer, though I\u0027d prefer if the game primarily keeps to the stacking mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ModZero","CreatedById":89470,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-27T16:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223661112\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187760\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566918757\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155685\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DStaal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, DStaal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of these - Life Support in particular - I want to say \u0027leave it to the mods\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say leave a lot of things to the mods.
