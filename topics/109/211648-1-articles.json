An absolute potato will not be able to run the game\u0027s physics at anything like a reasonable framerate, and since people tend to upgrade graphics before the CPU,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the type of procedural placement Intercept uses typically runs as a compute shader on the GPU, I can\u0027t imagine this being a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a concrete example, we\u0027ve been running large open world jungles on PS4 Pro with the view distance that would be totally fine for KSP2 without significant impact to the frame rate. I mean, it\u0027d drop below 30 occasionally, but that was even before the final optimizations round. And we know the KSP isn\u0027t coming to 8th gen consoles, at least for now. So this just isn\u0027t the limiting factor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that building large worlds that look neither empty nor cluttered is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehard work\u003C/em\u003E, and doing this for dozens of worlds, keeping all of them unique, is particularly taxing. The terrain tech we were seeing was still being tweaked half a year ago. This isn\u0027t leaving the artists a lot of time to really make these worlds work. I don\u0027t know how good the final product will be, but I don\u0027t think what we\u0027re seeing right now is that. And yeah, that does mean that worlds might end up feeling a bit barren during the early access and, honestly, possibly even a bit into the release. I don\u0027t think they\u0027re going to be anywhere near as bad as planets in KSP were, but you shouldn\u0027t expect AAA hand-crafted game levels of detail on every patch of land on every planet. That\u0027s just not possible to achieve. KSP2 will definitely fall somewhere in between, and hopefully high enough to keep exploration interesting. We\u0027ll have to just wait and see, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-23T07:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224222721\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211648\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221674421197\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209905\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wpetula\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, wpetula said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVall is a jagged ice world\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that could be minmus. vall in ksp2 looks a lot less green than ksp 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alexoff","CreatedById":145774,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-23T20:51:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is difficult to distinguish commercials from KSP2 from modded\u00A0 KSP1 without a corresponding caption.

Because I\u0027m willing to bet the answer is not well. Sure it will still run well with a couple mods. But add in all the stuff and it won\u0027t. And there\u0027s all the stuff that mods can\u0027t fix, the base core performance of the game, the kraken attacks, stuff only rebuilding the code from scratch could fix. And for me one of the most important things to interest me in ksp2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the ksp2 team has done a good job, it means less kraken explosions which alone is good enough for me, and at the end of the day I think that alone would be good enough for most ksp players. When it\u0027s out and folks start seeing how well it performs, less kraken, much larger part counts, word will get out and the ksp core players will be on board. Especially with the promise of interstellar and colonies soon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also doubt slightly less than perfect graphics will scare off the casual folks too. For them the selling feature is built in tutorials promising to make the game easier to pick up and play. When ksp2 comes out, a couple main stream streamers will give it a try, everyone watching will see the tutorials and if it is in fact easier to get into. And that will be enough for anyone who was on the fence about the first ksp due to being seen as too hard. The game doesn\u0027t need to look the best to get most of the market I think it was going to get anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way ksp1 looked didn\u0027t stop it at all from achieving a wide market and great success. And I\u0027m willing to bet very few players bought ksp1 based on the visuals of mods. And again I\u0027ll add that ksp2 will also be moddable. Modders will be able to start from the greatly improved baseline of ksp2 instead of ksp1. Give it a couple years and it will have just as many graphics improvements mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also like to point out that many players don\u0027t mod the game. I\u0027ve seen polls here and on the reddit that generally get to about 50/50 modded to unmodded. And you have to keep in mind that the forums and reddit generally attract the more hard core of the player base. Especially for the casual players, I doubt most of them mod the game, or have even seen what parallax and other mods can do. I\u0027ve played 2000 hours I haven\u0027t even bothered looking into those mods and don\u0027t know what they can do. I\u0027d be willing to bet that a large segment of those people outside the ksp community don\u0027t know what modded ksp looks like either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I disagree completely that ksp2 not looking as good as a heavily modded ksp1 will cause a massive negative impact on sales. Already it looks much better to me just adding some clouds and the improved surfaces, and the features promised in the first step of early access are far more than just small improvements on ksp1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also don\u0027t think getting hung up on comparing a game to what can be done by modders willing who work for free for untracked hours is productive. Its basically saying game devs don\u0027t deserve to get paid just because others are willing to do the work for free in their spare time. I can point to dozens of games that got major mods, where the game devs got \u0027outdone\u0027 by the community. And still the later installments still sold just as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-25T01:52:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224223546\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211648\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221674601375\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022193216\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheLoneOne\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, TheLoneOne said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes but think about this, the KSP two devs code these features full-time and get paid to do so, and yet they are being outdone by modders with little to no budget who do their thing for free, in their free time. the new eve build is better cloud-wise than ksp 2. parallax makes the terrain they are showing look really bad. the ksp 2 devs are doing all they can I\u0027m sure, but I can\u0027t help but point out that maybe just maybe, they have been outdone by the community, and it\u0027s going to make them look really bad when that turns out to be absolutely correct.\u00A0 I think they promised too much to us for their own good, trust me, if the game is just ksp 1 but slightly better it\u0027s going to fail when they open early access in less than a month, it won\u0027t generate sales from enough people outside the ksp community...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is still just fixating on the paintjob and not the car.
