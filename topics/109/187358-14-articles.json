These different agencies could compete for achieving \u0022firsts,\u0022\u00A0compete for contracts from a common pool (and if a given agency fails a contract, not only could they be penalized, but their competitors could be given a shot at the contract instead!)\u00A0or, on the other hand, could cooperate to achieve bigger objectives together, say with each player/agency contributing a module to a giant space station, or contributing something to a multi-stage interplanetary mission.\u00A0If the larger mission succeeds, each player could then earn a reward commensurate with their contribution!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother, related, idea might be giving players the ability\u00A0to create contracts for each other! Say you launch a satellite, but can\u0027t quite put it in the right orbit before it runs out of delta-\u003Cem\u003Ev\u003C/em\u003E; or say you\u00A0land on the Mun, but your rocket tips over and your crew is stranded. Instead of sending a rescue mission yourself, you could create a contract for another agency to rescue your crew / refuel or reposition your satellite for you, and offer them funds, science, or reputation from your own budget\u00A0in compensation! You would still benefit by getting your crew back (the whole Kerbonauts-join-their-rescuer\u0027s-crew mechanic would probably best be disabled for inter-player contracts) or by getting a satellite in the right orbit (potentially achieving the objective for your \u003Cem\u003Eown\u003C/em\u003E contract, and thus getting your own reward), and your rescuer would not only get the reward you\u0027d put up for them, but would also gain the satisfaction of knowing they helped another human being (as opposed to\u00A0merely completing a computer-generated contract for a fictional agency run by a random number generator).\u00A0There\u0027d even be an incentive for players to specialize; one player might become the server\u0027s expert on planetary landings, for example,\u00A0while another might run an orbital tug, becoming an expert in rendezvousing with other players\u0027 craft and refuelling them or efficiently putting them on new orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotably, this is something that multiplayer mods for KSP1 cannot currently do \u2014 currently, the only form of multiplayer available, even through modding,\u00A0seems to be everyone sharing a common funds/science/reputation/Kerbonaut pool. I think everyone running their own separate agency would be a good way for a more competitive, yet still constructive, style of play to work in KSP2, and I think it\u0027d add a lot to the game experience!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI 100% agree with this person\u0027s whole proposal\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223911545\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221611071453\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209472\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wubslin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, Wubslin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and that gives me another idea: radar ranges!

It\u0027s not that hard a concept to think up a solution for. And for your other points, again the idea of competitive actions or combat would be completely optional. I\u0027d be happy enough with a KSP 2 where orbital collisions are possible. I\u0027d be *overjoyed* if the game also was moddable enough that someone with my kind of mindset could overhaul the game into a fighting only game. But at the same time, I don\u0027t think some innate stock capability for combat or other offensive action would immediately transform the entire game into some kind of charlie foxtrot. By the way, you\u0027re misinterpreting what I\u0027m saying. Engine changes wouldn\u0027t make KSP 2 into a war game, gameplay feature implementation would. And as I\u0027ve said before, my ideal KSP is one where the primary player interactions are trading and flying together, but where violence and griefing are possible. Like if billy bob and his four friends claimed ownership of Tylo orbital space, and were demanding a flat 200 credit fee for using the moon to gravity brake into orbit of Jool, maybe it would make for interesting gameplay if they had the authority to laser you with a few probodobodynes as they swung by when you refused to pay up. It would be up to everyone else in the system to decide whether that is fair, and then up to those people to take action about it, diplomatic or otherwise.

At this given distance, the crafts are immediately \u0022frozen\u0022. Ship A\u0027s motion relative to ship B is drawn in a straight line out to some distance, and Ship B\u0027s motion relative to A is drawn out to some distance as well. The outline of each ship is extended out in these directions as a boundary which represents where collision is able to occur, and this \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022shadow\u0022 is treated as an instantaneous boundary of collision. For a brief moment of close approach, both ships could be considered as thin, solid extrusions reaching out some distance which is far greater than the dimension of the \u0022collision bubble\u0022 and in existence simultaneously. If the slender extrusions intersect each other, the game will count this as a collision at whatever the relative speed of the two craft is. Any kind of destruction or other damage physics can be secondary to this process and applied after the fact. The span of time in which the two ships would have crossed their respective collision bubbles using traditional motion should be so vanishingly small that no player or automatic control system should be able to affect its outcome - to allow the system to remain a decent approximation of a collision. This system might not kick in until relative speeds exceed a few hundred meters per second.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022g9Zjgxw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022141.67\u0022 height=\u0022971\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/g9Zjgxw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThis is just one way of coming up with a mechanism for orbital collision.
