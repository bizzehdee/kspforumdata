Truly, I am hoping someone can implement a special relativity mod so that we may be able to interact with special relativistic phenomenon and build intuition of its workings, similar to how the based game accidentally teaches orbital mechanics and develops intuition for things like angular momentum.

We ran simulations on 60 to 750 cores distributed over a variety of supercomputers in Amsterdam (the Netherlands, Europe), in Tokyo (Japan, Asia), Edinburgh (UK, Europe) and Espoo (Finland, Europe). Regardless the network latency of 0.32 seconds and the communication over 30.000 km of optical network cable we are able to achieve about 87% of the performance compared to an equal number of cores on a single supercomputer. We argue that using widely distributed supercomputers in order to acquire more compute power is technically feasible, and that the largest obstacle is introduced by local scheduling and reservation policies.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey call it\u00A0Simulating the Universe Structure formation on Heterogeneous Infrastructures, or SUSHI (yes, really).

The cells are stored in a tree structure, parts of which are assigned to each supercomputer.
