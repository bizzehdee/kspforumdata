This is why I\u0027m so adamant about no EA, no \u0022Beta\u0022, and allowing them as much time as they please. Because KSP1 is held down by the cruft from it\u0027s past, and no amount of patching would fix it entirely. Therefore, KSP2 isn\u0027t just unlikely to benefit from this idea. It\u0027s much, much more likely to hurt it in the long-term.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerminator K-100","CreatedById":204357,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-17T20:21:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223927134\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200389\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221613471677\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/16/2021 at 5:34 AM, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem is, every mechanic has to be available because even after a year of testing with the best QA team in the world, this community is so creative that we will find bugs anyway.
