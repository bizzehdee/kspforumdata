Every tech \u0022unlocks\u0022 automatically for you depending on three things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- if you did the science experiments for the tech\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- if you found / harvested the resources necessary\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- if your level of knowledge and discoveries is sufficiently advanced (every part could have hidden milestone triggers that unlock it)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s also assume that we obtain useful information about the universe only through practical science (ground and space telescope, sending probes, doing experiments etc.). This information then allows us to design more complex successful missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s also assume that the progression also favors unmanned before manned missions, as it should. And that kerbals need life support because manned missions are damn hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that there are good incentives to build space stations (science, mining asteroid resources, and orbital construction etc.) and colonies (science, discovery of planetary points of interest, transportation infrastructure, resource mining etc.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s assume that we need to build and upgrade the communications network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s assume we have to explore and exploit the Kerbolar system first, then investigate other stars, exoplanets, build the necessary knowledge and material infrastructure that allows us to design interstellar ships and send them hurling into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen we get there and start over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s also assume we take into account the long and slow process of prototyping, testing and iterative design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the accidents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the story / lore / mysteries / Easter eggs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, my worry is this: it\u0027s a damn huge amount of work even without any grinding!

How is there going to be time to explore multiplayer features if we start with single player only?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really think multiplayer has to be baked in or directly linked with the single player adventure.

If you ever played KSP with different base and resource mods, KSP2 won\u0027t be much different. The only real differences would be there wouldn\u0027t be any jank because of the mish-mash of different mod authors ideas for how KSP should work.
