While yes, KSP is about managing your space program with funds/reputation the mechanic adds unnecessary complexity which distracts from the main goal, which is to launch and fly rockets, not wait for them to be built. You could even create the lore, that when you launch a new rocket, the point in time doesn\u0027t coincide with the moment where you launch it; i.e. instead of the designing and launching phase being right after the other, rather think about the design having been developped some time prior, same as production.
