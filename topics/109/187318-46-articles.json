There\u0027s nothing particularly interesting underwater, just the same surface as everywhere else, except prettily dappled with sunlight. Subs also require quite a lot of kludging to make them work -- for example the stock prop blades don\u0027t work underwater which means you need to roll your own from various aerodynamic surfaces, and you need to get creative with ore tanks to weigh them down sufficiently to be able to dive in the first place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince KSP2 is clearly doing wonderful things with environments, my wish/hope is that this extends to underwater biomes.

It would be cool though if there are some resources that are more abundant in undersea biomes, or unique science stuff that you can do there, for example, so that there would be an actual reason to go there -- with a few parts that let you design seagoing craft, both surface and sub-surface, without having to kludge so much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPicture related:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gM66Cj7.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gM66Cj7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RyanRising","CreatedById":79932,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-16T13:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I\u2019ve only now realised I\u2019ve been thinking about KSP2 as an overhaul and expansion to KSP1.

I don\u2019t want to be interstellar within a month of getting the game lol, I feel that\u2019s just too fast and that we should have to really earn that with lots of time and effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) more reason to have rovers. Perhaps there could be more things to use scanning arms on and there is more reason to use them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) scout out an area before you begin building a base there. So probes to scan the surface, look at elevation and ores and biome and stuff like that, as well as rovers that actually explore the area to get an up close view to see if it\u2019s suitable. Then small manned missions to get a legit Kerbal view of everything and see if it\u2019s suitable for a habitat. (Very tedious, but perhaps it could work as a career\u002B game mode)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) I hope that the game is still played like \u201Crocket science Lego\u201D where the parts have predetermined measurements and you have to work with what you\u2019ve got (and if you want particular things that aren\u2019t base game, then you\u2019ll just have to clip things and drain tanks etc). I just don\u2019t like the idea of parts where you place it and then you get to device for instance how tall a 2.5m fuel tank is. I like the current system where there are like 10 tanks and you just have to mess around and find out a look and system that suits you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand finally, I just hope the graphics live up to my expectations after all the footage we\u2019ve\u00A0seen lol, it looks beautiful so far!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
