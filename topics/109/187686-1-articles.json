In that- if I pull a hard bank (hard yaw left) the Kerbals should be thrown right in response. If I pull hard positive Gs, they should be squished a bit with their heads pushed back- negative Gs should cause them to be pulled forward (head tilted forward) and their eyes bloodshot red. Eyes should go limp (or eyes shut) when they GLOC. I\u0027ll address this further in my laundry list of ideas post here soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dicapitano","CreatedById":190176,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T09:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223659861\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187686\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566790495\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277770\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoldForest\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, GoldForest said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can do full missions in KSP 1 in IVA view already, Scott Manley did a video on this subject.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut I agree, More A in the IVA please.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all the nice IVAs available... is would be cool to be able to move around the spacecraft/base.
