The only difference between them is the requirement of either Kerbals with the weight penalty for their command pods, or a com network and coms gear, which is trivial to set up and is good practice for manned missions anyway.

There must also be a shallow and long-enough on-ramp to ease players into it. For example, whatever the mechanics of it are, it should be effectively ignorable for round trips to Mun and Minmus. I wouldn\u0027t object if the difficulty settings allow you to tune it -- e.g., choose between hibernation and permadeath when LS runs out (which is technically pretty much cosmetic), or adjust a snack consumption coefficient -- but if the LS system itself is so trivial and so isolated from the rest of the gameplay systems that it can be simply switched off without any significant knock-on effects, then it\u0027s not worth doing at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that worries me about KSP2 is feature creep. The interstellar and colonial aspects -- never even mind multiplayer -- are big challenges as it is. I am worried that the game might end up with a ton of half-baked, half-broken features that will be frustrating to deal with rather than challenging, interesting, or fun. There are a fair few subsystems in the game already that are nonessential, and IMO they should be left out altogether if there isn\u0027t enough time or resources to do the well and integrate them properly into the core gameplay. I\u0027ve very much enjoyed playing with CommNet and robotics, for example, but if it means a more robust core game, I would not mind that they drop them (and maybe then sell them to us again as DLCs).
