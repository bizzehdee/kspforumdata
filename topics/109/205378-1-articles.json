For kerbin you should be able to recover with losses anywhere on the surface, but for colonies, is there a radius depending on the size? Do you have to land the craft directly on a structure like a runway or landing pad, or wheel it into the hangars?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, what happens to the craft? On kerbin, if there is money, is the craft converted into money or is it kept as its consituent resources? On a colony, if a craft is too large to fit in the hangar, are you able to recover or launch it again? Do you have the option to keep the craft \u201Cintact\u201D in storage or keep the parts instead of scrapping them for materials?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy personal preference is that for colonies, you actually have to land on some sort of structure and then you have to build storage hangars that can fit certain sizes of craft if you want to relaunch them. Additionally, I\u2019m not sure if I want this, but potentially having the scrapping process be inefficient in smaller colonies so that you have an incentive to keep parts and reuse them, which generates interesting rocket engineering challenges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: The relaunching thing is only if the construction hangar is too small to accommodate the ship, if it is large enough then the ship can just be rebuilt.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-25T18:59:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2021 06:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by t_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperspace Industries","CreatedById":212417,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-28T12:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think on kerbin, the system will probably be exactly like ksp 1, with its recovery system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn colonies on the other hand, I think a system where you have to land in a certain radius is good, this radius could be expanded by adding recovery rovers and suborbital shuttles to go to the supplies/craft and recover it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
