Lots of things that make landing on the moon hard in real life were removed or simplified to allow more people to get to it. Things like n-body physics, \u00A0the problems of radiation and life support, and yes, even axial tilts. It doesn\u2019t matter that these were development holes or technical limitations, the devs still made those simplifications into intentional design choices.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo better explain how adding axial tilt while navigating to the very first new body in the game is not good for learning, I\u2019ll share an anecdote about my experience. I wanted to try out modded KSP and decided to start with realism. Principia, Kerbalism, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, but I kept the stock parts because why not. The underpowered parts were ok, I just had to make better rockets, but when trying to get to the Moon, I had to first learn how to deal with engine failure, how to add redundancy to everything, how to get the right inclination for a transfer (that part I already knew but if I was a new player\u2026) how to circularize in the new, larger scale, and then how to deal with oxygen and food problems, which took me a few tries, and then how to navigate with n-body physics\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point there is that all of those features add realism and most don\u2019t necessarily make the game harder, they just require you to learn more before doing things. I found myself discouraged by the amount of trial and error learning I had to go through to even get to the moon, and I ended up switching mod packs shortly after my first landing. The more things someone has to learn per step they take into the universe, the more likely they will not take that step, and we already know that most people already find the Mun too daunting a step to do a landing.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not to say that we shouldn\u2019t have axial tilt in the game or even the Kerbol system. I\u2019d honestly be fine with Duna getting a 30 degree (or less) tilt, it\u2019s not like I depend on getting a perfectly equatorial landing site anyways. And the rest of the planets, tilt away! But between Kerbin and the Mun, there need to be only essential pieces of learning, like how to transfer between two bodies, or how to circularize an orbit. Tilt can be introduced later on, perhaps at Minmus, where you don\u2019t need to learn all the lessons from the Mun because you know them, and you only need to learn about tilt and inclination. It\u2019s like baristochrone trajectories; I want them in the game, just like axial tilt, I just don\u2019t think that they should be introduced when first going to the Mun. Just like tilt, it is not that people can\u2019t understand it, it is that it is a complication that can distract from the more essential lessons being taught by that celestial body.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-14T07:32:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that when KSP2 is released Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus will look very similar to KSP1, with no axial tilt on Kerbin, and Mun\u2019s orbit having little or no inclination. \u00A0Which is fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI appreciated the addition of extra launch sites in KSP1 because using the one up around 45N added a challenge similar to what you would deal with if you had axial tilt- every launch is going to have an inclined orbit. \u00A0But you can always go back and use the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E facility if you don\u2019t want to deal with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been led to believe that KSP2 will include additional solar systems, and maybe the ability to build bases and launch facilities on other CBs? \u00A0If that is the case, I think adding some tilt to those extra CBs would add to the game. \u00A0I personally sometimes get bored having every launch be nearly identical. \u00A0Launch, angle to 90 degrees, repeat. \u00A0It sometimes feels repetitive, maybe even grindy. \u00A0Maybe I\u2019ve played the game too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne advantage with Kerbin\u2019s non-tilted orientation is that you don\u2019t have to wait for launch windows to go to Mun or Minmus. \u00A0For Mun you can launch any time you want, and if you\u2019re going to Minmus there are two launch windows per day. \u00A0Actually Minmus\u2019s inclination is so small (I think about 7 degrees?) that you can also launch for Minmus pretty much any time, and don\u2019t lose much efficiency. \u00A0That does make it easy to continually practice maneuvering to those CBs, without always having to wait for a decent launch window. \u00A0It does get repetitive though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"intelliCom","CreatedById":209738,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-14T08:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224154469\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208696\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221657730575\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022216853\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sciencecompliance\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, sciencecompliance said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get that you\u0027re talking about the game\u0027s coordinate system and the fact that all the planets\u0027 poles point in the same direction, but, if you weren\u0027t aware, axial tilt in real astronomy is based on the angle of a body\u0027s axis relative to its own orbit around whatever body it\u0027s orbiting.\u00A0 I only say this because if the \u0022axial tilt matches the orbital inclination\u0022, then that body actually has zero axial tilt (also known as obliquity) in real astronomical terms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGotcha.
