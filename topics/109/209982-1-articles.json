Director\u0027s commentaries or roundtables, for example, or long documentaries about technical or creative challenges that a studio faced during production. Stuff that exists almost entirely outside of the actual marketing, and feels like it\u0027s made purely to scratch the itch of the most dedicated of fans. One that I\u0027ve been thinking a bunch about recently is the Making of Halo 2 documentary that came on a DVD in the limited edition of the game. I love that one because of how candid it is, with Bungie\u0027s employees at the time talking about how so much of Halo 2 wasn\u0027t working and how so much had to be cut or completely redone near the end, and how they weren\u0027t sure they could actually deliver on what they had promised. I don\u0027t follow enough videogame BTS stuff to know if that kind of\u00A0 blunt, introspective documentary still exists in modern times for modern games, but KSP2\u0027s development has reminded me considerably of Halo 2\u0027s development (the delays, studio politics, the promise of living up to and exceeding a game that accidentally became a huge hit, etc), and I\u0027m hoping that we\u0027ll get some unadulterated fly-on-the-wall stuff like that for KSP2. Obviously I wouldn\u0027t expect T2 to even consider letting Intercept be totally candid prior to launch, just as I\u0027m sure Microsoft didn\u0027t want Bungie oversharing with the fans until Halo 2 finally launched. But I\u0027m so curious on the details of what this game was supposed to have been like when the launch date was 2020, and how it changed, and why those changes have delayed it for three years so far. I find stuff like that, seeing the nuts and bolts of how people wrangle with big problems to be so deeply edifying and inspiring; after all, the greatest teacher, failure is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-10-03T01:03:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2022 01:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by whatsEJstandfor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadmeat24","CreatedById":173932,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-03T13:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, I would be really curious to hear about some of the things that happened in development once the game is released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketRockington","CreatedById":223189,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-08T01:45:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe we\u0027ll hear from some of the staff at some point, I think you\u0027re right that T2 wouldn\u0027t want to share what honestly happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-08T04:33:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would absolutely adore a technically-minded making of, but Id be shocked to see any kind of personal/political/business-side blow-by-blow on the transition from Star Theory to Intercept.
