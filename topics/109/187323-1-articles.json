All in all, simulating n-body gravitation almost certainly takes fewer computations per second than, say, flying a 100 part ship through an atmosphere.\u00A0 Further proof of this is the fact that, as far as I know, the Principia mod for KSP that adds n-body gravitation doesn\u0027t have a significant effect on performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as difficulty, AFAIK as long as you don\u0027t try to do any weird stuff it behaves pretty similarly to patched conics. The biggest problem I see is stuff moving out of its orbit over time, but an automated station-keeping feature would be enough to deal with that, which shouldn\u0027t be too hard to add. I\u0027d even be okay with it if there was some sort of easy mode option where station-keeping doesn\u0027t consume delta-v.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, I\u0027d be pretty excited to see n-body gravitation in KSP 2.

If the planets themselves also orbit with N-Body I think trajectory plotting on the map mode and time warp might be somewhat challenging. I agree that Rask and Rusk almost guarantee some amount of N-Body in the game. I have to imagine there will need to be some level of cheating though. Like the feature in KSP where as you mouse over your trajectory you see where your target body will be at the time you are at that point in your trajectory. This would be brutal on true N-Body because you can rapidly jump between massively different timestamps. Easier done if you can just cheat and lookup where the planet is at that time because it doesn\u0027t obey N-Body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn second thought, maybe not that bad. As you calculate your trajectory you could store the locations of all the planets at every point calculated in addition to your craft\u0027s location. Given that there won\u0027t be millions of planets the RAM requirements wouldn\u0027t be too intense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-20T22:51:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2019 10:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by TheFrizz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Optionalcoast","CreatedById":107346,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-20T23:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think n-body physics would add a nice progressive gameplay element.
