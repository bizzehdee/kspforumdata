To my mind the best way to think about it is O2 and Water are 100% recycled and all you\u0027re really considering is food mass--calories and nutrients. You also don\u0027t want players to have to worry about LS right away... more like on journeys in excess of 15 days. So offering some kind of consequence free grace period is smart. Let\u0027s pretend that Kerbals eat 1.25kg of food per day and its 50% water. With a 15 day grace 3 kerbals traveling to Minmus and back would need .025t of food, and for a 100 day asteroid mission they\u0027d need less than .5t. That means for anything less than interplanetary you\u0027re just using simple food tanks, getting used to the idea of a simple consumption rate for stations, early bases, etc. Once the idea of a depletable resource is casually introduced though you want to give players ways to optimize it: extending its value with \u003Cem\u003Erehydrators\u003C/em\u003E. Conceptually rehydrators would be reusing the 50% water mass of the food, making it useful for twice as long. I would add basic food rehydrators in 1.25m and radial variants, which at 1t\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(249,249,249);\u0022\u003Ewould break even mass-wise for 6 kerbals over 266 days, making long term stations and bases and interplanetary missions that much easier.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext in the progression I would start adding greenhouses and hydroponics bays. Let say these operate\u00A0at 80% efficiency while just reprocessing compost, or could incorporate fertilizer to reach 90% efficiency, or could operate\u00A0in \u0027growth\u0027 mode to work at 110%, (generating 10% extra food for future missions with more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E fertilizer). But for a 10 Kerbal mission to Jool you might pack a 4t greenhouse and 2t of fertilizer rather than 2t of recyclers and 10t of food. This would create mass incentives not just to make upgrades, but to think carefully about how long your flight was and what the breakeven points are, just like we do with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and total fuel mass now.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the lead up to interstellar missions I\u0027d start including full-on food reprocessors that operate in the range of 99 or 99.5% efficiency. They might be large and heavy (maybe 8t at 3.75m?) but would greatly reduce food consumption on bases, colonies, and multi-decade interstellar missions.
