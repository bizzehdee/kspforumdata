More specifically, I\u0027ve been thinking about what mods came first, what mods became immediately popular, what mods created offshoots and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewhole\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0dependency subgenres, what mod endured and were refined, what mods faded to obscurity, what mod came and were either supplanted, incorporated, or made defunct by being rolled into the actual base game. As time went on, mods were less and less about making an idea possible, but to work in conjunction as a part of a mod suite with mods made by other people. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E scene is a good example of this crystallization in time, as a complete sub-community ultimately congealed around a very, \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0specific goal. Many may know, but few remember that it effectively all started when someone supersized Kerbin to be earth-sized. Everything else was natural, \u003Cem\u003Epredictable\u003C/em\u003E progression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI daresay modders haven\u0027t forgotten the \u0027good old days.\u0027 I expect the modscene to just about explode immediately, just as soon as people take stock of what is, well, \u003Cem\u003Estock \u003C/em\u003Ein KSP2. In a meta sort of way, I\u0027m almost more interested in seeing what modders will \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eprioritize\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0than to see what KSP2 is in and of itself. We can only speculate, of course, but it\u0027s kind of a recurring daydream for me at this point. Whatever the sequel brings into the fold as being part of the stock gameplay, we can be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecertain\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that it will not be as deep and as complex as what some people want it to be. Life-Support is perhaps the subgenre I expect to see the greatest amount of man-hours poured into right off the bat, no matter how much of it was rolled into stock KSP2 gameplay. Then, as the more casual players come to grip with what exactly the stock game can offer, and what it can\u0027t do, we\u0027ll see QoL and Utility mods being pushed in a second wave following growing demand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf nothing goes wrong, and I\u0027m usually the pessimistic sort, I think KSP2\u0027s initial market grasp will be considerable. When the first game came out, space was not even close to be as popular a topic as it is today. The world has changed a lot since June 2011 (I think some of that change \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0safely be attributed back to KSP1). Even just the accessibility to videogames in general has made great leaps in the intervening years. KSP1\u0027s ongoing development since does help in figuring out how it will work out, but nothing is certain. As long as the launch isn\u0027t a total botch job, I expect things to get\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0interesting in 2023.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a really good thread up already about what mods people want to see be part of the base game, but since there\u0027s no way to please everyone, I imaging a lot of people will be let down, however gently. Whatever is and isn\u0027t, I\u0027m looking forward to see how things will\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eprogress\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in the coming years. In my case, I could easily wonder who will be the next Scott Manley, or if the man will reprise his instrumental role? Could he even still be as major a role as he was early on even if he wanted? Like I said, the scene has changed so much since it all started. It\u0027s all so wonderful to think about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Just in case, I\u0027ll clarify this much. I don\u0027t consider stock KSP1 to be \u0027feature-complete\u0027 and a modded game only inches closer to an impossible ideal. I consider modded gameplay to be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eintegral\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to the experience. When I speak of the modscene and modders in general, I understand their existence to be inseparable from the game itself. They are, as far as I am concerned, part of the development process just as much as the actual development team. I don\u0027t expect this to change with the sequel.

Planet packs will certainly come in relatively soon I think, as soon as people get a hang of how to do that with the tools KSP 2 provides (since it actually WILL provide tools to do so, unlike KSP 1 which needs Kerbalism to be able to do that).\u003Cbr\u003E\nObviously the first few planet packs to come out will be rather bare of features, and will likely be intended to be installed alongside the existing planets and stars, rather than as a replacement for any one of them.
