Don\u0027t get me wrong, it\u0027s possible to get to a much better performance even on Unity, but it\u0027s a very bad starting point. It made sense for KSP based on how Squad started out, but for KSP2 it\u0027s a huge handicap. The initial decision was clearly based on a promise to reuse a lot of assets and code to speed up development, which is now just a dead weight given the scope increase of the game. Worst part, it looks like Intercept is sticking GameObjects over ECS, possibly partly because of this, which means we\u0027re stuck with PhysX in KSP2, which is about the worst physics engine out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is not a complicated game. What little is somewhat involved is entirely custom. Which means that a good engine for KSP-like game is one that provides you with a simple way to stream in terrain and planets, gives you a modern renderer, and has decent physics. Because every modern mainstream engine will give you the first two, it comes down to a physics engine. And in that regard, Unity is the only one of the bunch that\u0027s the wrong choice.

So they literally Kerbaled together KSP, learning as they went along with lots of mistakes in the core code that can\u0027t be undone w/o re-writing from scratch, hence KSP 2.\u00A0 Should look at how many games are built on the Unity engine, you\u0027ll likely really be surprised.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAre there better game engines for very specific aspects, yes, but at the expense that it can\u0027t do the others, specifically accommodating\u00A0\u00A0a massive, game world that requires extreme precision in asset placement.
