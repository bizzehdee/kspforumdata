to 3D printers are themselves the products of long, complex industrial processes, so 3D printing\u00A0just slightly shifts the problem of needing a huge\u00A0industrial base, it doesn\u0027t eliminate it.\u00A0 Without that base, you\u0027d still have to truck in resupplies of 3D printer ammo.\u00A0 Plus, 3D printing is SLOW compared to conventional manufacturing techniques.\u00A0 I think it\u0027s already about as fast as it can go, as the previous\u00A0bit of material cools just enough to take the weight of the next bit without deforming.\u00A0 This makes it unsuitable for mass-producing highly consumable items.\u00A0 It\u0027s more for durable goods or things you don\u0027t need many of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to modifying ourselves, that\u0027s definitely going to go ahead full speed whether we like it or not.\u00A0 Not just genes but implanted machinery of all sorts.\u00A0 There are too many rich guys who want to live forever\u00A0who will make this happen regardless of legality, and there are enough poor people who think it\u0027s cool to get the laws changed in hopes the tech trickles down to them eventually.\u00A0 So eventually, we\u0027ll become the Borg.\u00A0 Or even better, just pure machinery without all the messy organic luggage.\u00A0 This whole thing would solve a lot of problems all along the way to completion so I see it as a desirable outcome in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally have no desire to live forever.\u00A0 Or even more than my 3 score and 10, if that long.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t ask to be here and in

about the necessity of self-sufficiency for life support is that otherwise, it\u0027s micromanagement Hell.\u00A0 There is no middle ground.\u00A0 Either you don\u0027t have to worry about it at all (in which case, the whole system is pointless overhead), or you have to worry about it too much, at the expense of doing basically anything else.\u00A0 That has always been my personal experience with using all the LS\u00A0mods (except Kerbalism) for many years, which is why I\u0027ve recently decided the whole thing is counterproductive and have stopped using LS.\u00A0 I gave it a VERY good and thorough evaluation\u00A0and I believe my conclusions are inescapable \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

a life support\u00A0mechanic is how frequently you have to interact with it (by whatever means) to prevent disaster.\u00A0 If disasters can\u0027t ever occur, then LS is a complete waste of time, effort, and CPU cycles.\u00A0 Might as well not have it and get better FPS.\u00A0 So, for this discussion, we assume Kerbals will die unless the player makes periodic inputs to the LS system.\u00A0 But the more often the player has to make such inputs, the more the system is just annoying micromanagement, the less it\u0027s an interesting game mechanic,\u00A0and the less other things the player can do in the limited interval of realtime the player has to indulge in KSP.\u00A0 And no matter what timescale you set the periodic inputs on, it will ALWAYS be too often at some point in the game, and so infrequent at others as to be utterly pointless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider this situation...\u00A0 You have configured your LS system so it only needs input once per game year.\u00A0 But you\u0027ve got a ship that will be 20 years on passage to some distant location, and that\u0027s really all you care about right now.\u00A0 No other pressing business, so you just want to warp ahead 20 years to play the arrival of this ship.\u00A0 But you can\u0027t.\u00A0 You can warp ahead no more than 1 year at a time, fiddle with LS somewhere, repeat.\u00A0 20 times minimum during the passage.\u00A0 More if you have several colonies/bases/long-term ships\u00A0and their intervals of needing tweaking aren\u0027t in sync (which they probably won\u0027t be).\u00A0 So maybe 50-60 such interruptions during the trip.\u00A0 Each time you have to fiddle with LS, you have to go to 1:1 time, switch to the colony/base/ship that needs tweaking, and do what needs doing (which might involve flying a whole inter-moon\u00A0trip to truck in some supplies from elsewhere).\u00A0 So lots of real time goes by without much game time elapsing, meaning your 20-year ship makes very little progress.\u00A0 This is similar to, but WAY worse, than having to deal with all the spam messages from deployed science in BG.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way to avoid this problem is to increase the LS tweaking interval\u00A0to the point that it never interrupts anything, which is the same as saying everything is self-sufficient, which makes the whole LS system a total waste.\u00A0 Which is why life support SHOULD NEVER BE STOCK (although it appears I\u0027ve lost that argument).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo getting back to orbital shipyards.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, something\u00A0in orbit can\u0027t sponge up any resource other than sunlight.\u00A0 Everything else it needs has to trucked in.\u00A0 But (in most mods where you have more resources than just Ore), the same also goes for surface bases/colonies.\u00A0 You NEVER have all the resources you need right under the colony so you ALWAYS have to truck in the rest from elsewhere.\u00A0 Unless this process is automated (some mods support this to varying degrees), you have to take time out from\u00A0your warping to do this trucking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it seems to me that the least detrimentally impactful way to do any of this is to automate it all.\u00A0 Making a colony self-sufficient for LS means putting it where it can get all the resources it needs.\u00A0 If not all those resources are available on-site, add modules to the colony that automate harvesting and transporting the remaining resources.\u00A0 If you have that sort of system, then it should be no problem extending it to orbital colonies.\u00A0 They just need more resource-acquisition modules, or be near a surface colony that has such modules, plus another to export resources to the orbital station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 way might be to add the ability to make kerbals go into cryo sleep automatically if they run out of Snacks. So, your robots work, you can still switch there and gather resources. But if you\u00A0want them to work on a new colonizer craft, you need to wake them up with Snacks (like me), this way, your kerbals essentially become useless without essential Snacks,but they won\u0027t need micromanagement.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-30T06:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding 3d printing, it will never be able to make things like high performance turbine blades that need to be *single crystal*.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could make Ikea furniture, but not superconducting coils for a fusion reactor, of lenses for a laser like in an ICF drive, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the colony operation falls under speculative engineering, not science, I\u0027m much less perturbed by that... plus I can ignore colonies except for fuel production (ok I\u0027ll use 1 vehicle producing colony per star\u00A0system, once I\u0027ve gone interstellar)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nikokespprfan","CreatedById":136115,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-30T08:51:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223662567\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187697\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221567084846\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022194394\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nejc\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, nejc said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat just replaces one unobtainium - low pressure metallic hydrogen -\u00A0with another - some material that can support planetary scale\u00A0pressure whilst being lightweight.

My preferred design of life support (no played experience though) thinks about the player not in terms of periodic imputs that the player has to do to every craft with kerbals, which indeed becomes a logistic nightmare that no-one wants to play when you even think about it. But rather it sees it as a part of the game loop, a part of the challenge of getting something done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what tends to be the game loop for a given mission: build a rocket, test the rocket, fly the rocket, accomplish your goal. You could make it so that part of the game loop of establishing a colony is to make it self sufficient, and then once it is it never needs player input anymore. The player has now completed its objective to establish a colony, and it can go about it\u0027s business.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn analogy is this. Say, in KSP2, you could have airship colonies or bases on gas giants, or on venus/eve-like planets. While you are setting up the base, you would require the player to make the base floatable. If the player cannot do that, he will fail, that\u0027s just part of the challenge. However, if the player succeeds, would you want to simulate the floating stability of that colony for the rest of game time, and require the player to keep fixing any issues that might pop up? NO, just NO. You\u0027d want to accept it was stable, flag something in the code, and tell the player he was ready to move on. Anytime the player comes back, the colony will be there, unadorned, hanging in the sky. No periodic input, but useful as part of the game loop of establishing an air colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother anology could potentially be made to leaving space stations be when they are in a suborbital trajectory. I mean, that will fail, you have to get it into a stable orbit before you can look away, that is just part of the challenge. But once you do, the game will not simulate all the microforces that real spacecraft experience, that tug them out of orbit (n-body rammifications, atmo-drag well \u0022out\u0022 of the atmosphere, etc.). Those phenomena are approximated away. You space station will now be in a stable orbit forever. (Now, all that\u0027s barring the obvious differences that orbital mechanics is more important to the essence of KSP than LS, and that this way of stabilising craft forever was not intentionally for this but instead a result of just using simplified orbital mechanics, however the way the gameplay works out is what I want to demonstrate here)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I know your opinion on colonies when it comes to self-sufficiently (which is vital to the difference between our assumptions), but colonies have much lower burden of being utterly realistic when compared to, say, near-future engines. You have some liberty, especially after the 3D printing part of the discussion. Besides, when it comes to the \u0022you never have all things you need\u0022, I would be very much in favor of the kind automation you mention.

Yes, no game is 100% realistic. But at the same time, no game is 100% detached from reality either (otherwise you would just have stuff randomly happening for no reason). Realism isn\u0027t a yes/no binary, but a spectrum, or a sliding scale. So the question isn\u0027t \u0022is it realistic?,\u0022 but \u0022where do you draw the line?\u0022 And as has been stated earlier in this thread, many of us find \u0022speculative engineering, but no speculative science\u0022 to be a reasonable place to draw the line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, I would claim this is where \u003Cem\u003Ethe KSP and KSP2 devs themselves \u003C/em\u003Eare attempting to draw the line. The devs are comfortable abstracting away the finnicky engineering concerns that the average player would not want to deal with, such as tank ullage, engine ignition, or throttle depth, but the engines are still based on well-understood scientific principles and concepts. Additionally, the speculative engines shown in the trailer (with the obvious exception of metallic hydrogen, of course), such as MPD thrusters, Orion drives, or ICF drives are all based on well-established scientific principles. These are all engines that we know for sure can be built in real life. They may not operate as efficiently as they do in the game, or they may have engineering challenges that make them not worth actually using, but they \u003Cem\u003Ecan be built\u003C/em\u003E, and would operate according to scientific principles that we already understand today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think it\u0027s worth pointing out that the KSP2 dev who\u0027s been doing interviews said in at least one of the interviews something along the lines of \u0022oh, we read a paper saying metallic hydrogen exists, so we feel confident including it in the game.\u0022 This, combined with other instances of devs failing to understand the science (such as not knowing that binary systems can\u0027t be modeled accurately by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E approximation), leads me to believe that their decision to include metallic hydrogen engines does not stem from a conscious choice to handwave the science in favor of gameplay, but rather from a misunderstanding of the science itself. And that is, ultimately, the most concerning aspect. I honestly would be much more okay with it if the devs understood the science and were choosing to ignore it than the current situation, in which it seems the devs do not actually understand the science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-31T05:19:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2019 05:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by chaos_forge\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-31T06:43:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223663944\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187697\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221567228687\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264960\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chaos_forge\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, chaos_forge said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI honestly would be much more okay with it if the devs understood the science and were choosing to ignore it than the current situation, in which it seems the devs do not actually understand the science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy is it so concerning that the devs don\u0027t actually understand the science?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Incarnation of Chaos","CreatedById":197414,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-31T07:35:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223663977\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187697\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221567233797\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167629\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brikoleur\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n50 minutes ago, Brikoleur said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy is it so concerning that the devs don\u0027t actually understand the science?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from the fact KSP is a game where the core gameplay literally is science (Orbits, Delta-V, etc.);
