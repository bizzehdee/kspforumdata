I personally think of the game more as an introduction to basic mechanics and a way to have fun exploring those mechanics in creating things that could never exist in real life. That\u0027s what makes it a game and not a simulator. It\u0027s like you said very close (well, not really very close but that is splitting hairs lol), but no space agency such as NASA would settle for \u0022very close\u0022 and no population or government would spend billions of dollars on \u0022very close\u0022, they want exact.

The fact that it\u0027s not exact. Things like the \u0022kraken\u0022 that can get you at any time when it doesn\u0027t make sense and the fact that you can actually complete missions when you mathematically really shouldn\u0027t be able to.
