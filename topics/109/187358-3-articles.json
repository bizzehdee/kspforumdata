Some folks love the sim aspect of cruising their rover around or their crane and actually putting stuff together. So we can co-op. I deliver cool base modules, they stack them up.

To have the power to interact in kerbal is to have the power to destroy. If the power to destroy exists, there are going to be griefers. It is known.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all cases, we have some real problems with synchronization due to the \u0027time warp\u0027 nature of the game. We *need* time warp to accomplish any of the goals in the game - even a mun mission is nuts if you try to do it in real time. So time warp is a given. That right there is, I think, the essential problem with MP. How do we allow for people to conduct missions according to \u0027their own\u0027 schedule, without ruining other peoples planning.

Things like docking ports etc could still be \u0027active\u0027 to allow for interaction, but it would be more like as if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E had a docking port bolted to it. This would allow players, via some sort of process to put some things \u0027into statis\u0027 and beyond the ability of other players to interfere with. It could be done in alot of ways, but simply having \u0027ownership\u0027 of a ship and then a toggle to put it \u0027on rails\u0027 or not would be easy. Likewise, a \u0027merge ship\u0027 option could be easily implemented, so that once you dock to a ship on rails, you can vote to have your ship \u0027merge\u0027 with the railship, and then the railship owner accepts the request, and poof, your module is now \u0027bolted\u0027 to the on-rails unit. I think that there would need to be a two-step process for putting anything on rails - for instance, anyone in the local physics bubble has to agree, or the server has to majority vote agree, or the server owner needs to agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027ship on rails\u0027 thing is also a possibility for handling different ships owned by other people. It would be possible to treat *every* ship, not owned by you, as \u0027on rails\u0027 and indestructible. That would be a big lever to prevent griefing, especially in competitive games it might be sufficient to just run it that way 100%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would introduce some weirdness, especially w.r.t. docking; if you just \u0027bounce\u0027 off\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think something like the above system I describe is how the devs would need to handle a thing like the colonies they are describing, or the orbital \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E structures.
