For my type of playing, you gotta have an instance of ksp for stock; an instance for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E; an instance for mks; and a lot more; and if you want to experiment with\u00A0a mod,\u00A0new instance. All of them are in different versions. Every time you have to do all the steam console things and some same mods but a different version in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E. All that and only one instance is linked with steam, and will break if there was an update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m proposing is, a completely overhauled main menu and loading in ksp 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, ksp is fully loaded after you are in the main menu. The right version, the right mods. I\u0027d like a new way of getting into the game sorta like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nthe game doesn\u0027t load before you go into the main menu, but when you go into a save\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nmultiple versions of ksp accessible and you can choose what version a save runs\u00A0on\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\na ksp folder with directories ksp 2.x, the different versions, with saves and game\u00A0data inside\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\na mod manager which, when you install mods, you can choose which versions for which instances and saves it will run on\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, the main menu only loads the framework for displaying the main menu, and when you load a save, a specific version of ksp and mods you installed on that specific save will run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can cut the need for multiple instances of ksp taking up huge space on your computer(since only the GameData/Squad folder changes in between an update) and\u00A0make modding easier. Linking all the versions into steam, and not having to rely on steam to give you automatic updates that break the game; instead, ksp manages the updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a mockup of the ksp folder in my mind:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#2e3035;color:#ffffff;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wNFn5uW.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/wNFn5uW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst post, what do you guys think?\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-10T16:21:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2019 04:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Matrick13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"azander","CreatedById":147372,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-10T16:58:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you understand the filesystem (your image looks like you are on Linux) well, you can use Symlinks (at least under 1.7.x and older, haven\u0027t tried 1.8.x yet) to point to a mega-folder containing all the mods you use, then each instance only has a Symlink to the central mod folder under the GameData Folder.\u00A0 You can do similar with the basic KSP game files/folders pointing to the stock version.\u00A0 This will cut down on disk usage, and will allow you to share any settings that the mods store in their own folders.\u00A0 I do not recommend sharing your saves folder though, loading and unloading save games in different configurations can cause ships to vanish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example: ( \u0027-\u0026gt;\u0027 means Symlink)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP_1.7.3_stock\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 -Basic game, no mods\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP_1.7.x_MODS\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 -All the mods you may use\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP_1.7.3_NFonly\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0|- GamaData/ModuleManager.4.0.2.dll -\u0026gt;
