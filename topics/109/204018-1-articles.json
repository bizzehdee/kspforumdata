It doesn\u0027t scale like that. Even if you grab some exotic enthusiast grade CPU with absurd thread count on high performance cores, you aren\u0027t going to be able to leverage full performance of it, and there is no real way to distribute the load between multiple game servers without a major re-write to the core loop. If the game is well written, there isn\u0027t some silly cap on resources, and players don\u0027t build anything complex, something in health double digits might be doable.

The most mad lads thing would be a complete custom server written in a civilized language, like C\u002B\u002B or Rust. Problem is that you\u0027d have to port every component, every behavior, every feature of every planetary body, make sure everything\u0027s simulated just so... Depending on how server-client is handled that can range from legendary challenge to impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there is a more realistic scenario. Say you wrote a custom server that just handles open space in ballistic trajectories. So long as networking isn\u0027t too obfuscated, that might be a weekend project. Next, you make sure that while flying solo you can still interact with your craft and update server. If the game\u0027s client-authoritative on forces applied to piloted rockets, this might be a freebie. Otherwise, a bit of work is needed. At this point, this custom server can already handle a silly number of people - tens of thousands wouldn\u0027t be a stretch running in the cloud -\u00A0who are all flying in the same shared space, but can\u0027t physically interact with each other. So the hard part is solving this interaction. And you do this by running Intercept\u0027s stand-alone server for every player hub. The easy version is to have pre-determined locations where players can meet up. Say, every planet and every moon gets a server. Maybe some specific orbits of some specific bodies as well for orbital stations. Only a fixed number of players would be allowed to gather at one of these at any given time, but you could absolutely instance it. So, like, if you are on Kerbin, you\u0027re playing on a version of Kerbin that has up to 8, maybe 16 players on it. But once you depart Kerbin and go build a colony on Lathe, or something, you could be meeting players from another version of Kerbin server visiting you there.
