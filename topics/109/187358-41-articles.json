These games suffer from a great deal of lag (looking at you Space Engineers), when calculations have to be performed on multiple computers in real time as things happen... it gets ugly; processing power for even high end computers is sub-par... my Z690 Unify X mated with a 12900KS even struggles (rock solid on A64/Intel Burn/Cinebench for 24hrs, at 5.4ghz golden core, and 5.3ghz all core).

I think its overly ambitious, and it sets the dev team up for failure, and their fans up for a huge disappointment. In the perfect world if we were running our games on \u0022future tech\u0022 (quantum computers) where there was a 100-fold increase in processing power... would I like KSP2 to have multiplayer? YES... PLEASE! and ABSOLUTELY...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027m a realist, and KSP2 has a lot of moving parts (pun intended)... so if multiplayer turns out to be a half-baked function of the game, with no \u0027true\u0027 playability in the state that hardware is currently in then, I say \u0022leave it out for now\u0022.

However, the functionality of that game, and its ability to run on certain platforms was all but a failure. The rebound to that was a gaming culture that snapped back at CD Project Red, and darn near collapsed the studio as a whole; it actually affected financial markets.

I\u0027d love to see functional massive multiplayer, but I honestly think that\u0027s still 10yrs or so out with a sim program like this.

On the one hand, yes griefing exists, and on the other, there are tools to stop it if necessary. Your experience with WoW or WoT sounds unfortunate and unpleasant, but different games are designed differently and KSP can be nicely grief-free with easy design decisions. Here are the differences that KSP has or can have that reduce or stop griefing compared to other games:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- KSP is a very time-intensive game, because it takes longer to execute actions. While pushing someone into an unfavorable position can take probably up to a minute of setup, hitting a station with a missile can take up to 15 minutes, starting from a nearby celestial body. This has a double effect of discouraging grinders and giving more time for others to respond between actions.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n- KSP is not a competitive game, in that it does not have inherent systems that require the game or authorities to be impartial in their judgement. If someone is considered attempting to grief, they can be banned without having to justify reasons.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- KSP will probably have players interacting with each other over long periods. This means that unlike in online games where a grieved will just move on and keep griefing, grinders in KSP will be stuck with the same people if they want to keep griefing, which gives time for moderators to ban and rollback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-KSP isn\u2019t run in a match environment.

Well as a field mechanic for a rental company I will get a call to goto a jobsite, lets say a welding machine for an example. Ill pull up at the jobsite. Put on the ol\u0027 hard hat open the door get out and walk up to the equipment and begin to look it over. Ill check the basics. oil, engine coolant, belts, fuel level, and just give it a overall look over looking for anything obvious such as fluids on the ground, melted wires, etc....anything that will indicate a equipment failure. Now keep in mind I\u0027ve only been at this machine maybe 2 mins and here comes the customer walking up....\u0022 So what did you find wrong with it?\u0022 \u0022I got a crew on the clock that needs this machine how long is it going to take to fix it?\u0022 At this point im thinking to myself \u0022Is this guy for real? I literally just pulled up to the machine haven\u0027t even diagnosed it to know what\u0027s wrong with it and this guy expects me to predict the future!\u0022 So I proceed to explain to the customer I cant answer his question because I just got here and haven\u0027t had a chance to diagnose the problem. I don\u0027t know if any parts will need to be ordered or if its something simple I can repair quickly...again I don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong with it yet! The customer depending on his mood may make a comment like \u0022Well, I thought you were a mechanic? If you cant fix it perhaps we just need to get another machine out here!\u0022 Keep in mind we are at about the 5-10 min mark since I pulled up most of that time was spent answering stupid questions that could of been spent actually trying to diagnose the equipment in order to get answers to those previous questions. So with all that being said lets apply this same scenario to KSP2 and multiplayer where the devs are the mechanic and we are the customer. So we ask the devs questions about multiplayer such as will it do x,y,z? Or will it have x,y,z? We get no answers on anything and I think I know why. For one they are still working on it and trying to diagnose issues. Until those issues are worked out or diagnosed with a solution the question is not answerable. In short THEY dont even know.\u00A0 And hell if i was a betting man i\u0027m sure the thought is or was in the past considered if multiplayer is even doable at all.\u00A0 But I think we have some other issues as well. The devs (mechanic) is not communicating that with us (customer) leaving us guessing. Why? Just be honest and state the facts and situation. Its not that hard or complicated unless YOU made it that way at which point you better double-down and put that fire out or the problems are going to start stacking up.\u00A0 So did the devs bite off more than they can chew by announcing the multiplayer feature before the netcode was even devised? Thats like the mechanic telling the customer \u0022 ill have it fixed in a jiffy!\u0022 before he even knows whats wrong with it. He would in essence be BS\u0027ing the customer correct?\u00A0 So now 3 hours have gone by (3 years for KSP2) and the customer, who is now angry realizing the mechanic BS\u0027d him, wants to know what\u0027s the holdup. You told me it would be fixed in a \u0022jiffy\u0022.........well?\u00A0 Then the mechanic just ignores him. How do you think that scenario ends? So this is where we are at now with KSP2 and multiplayer. No communication. Customer left guessing. Time delays. And we are still no closer to getting that machine running and dependable. Would a simple screenshot have gone a long way to appease the customer? \u0022This is what I found wrong. This is what I need to do to get you up and running. And this is the approx time it will take to make that happen\u0022 Why is this concept so hard? A screenshot takes a whole....what? 30 secs to take it and shoot email off to the community manager or just post it yourself?\u00A0 For a mechanic to tell the customer \u0022 It will be ready when its ready!\u0022\u00A0 Is the same as the devs telling us \u0022KSP2 will have multiplayer\u0022 3\u002B years prior and now with yet another delay.\u00A0 The word \u0022transparency \u0022 its a term or mantra we seem to use alot these days.
