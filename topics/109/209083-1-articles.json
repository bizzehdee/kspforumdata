Developers are prioritizing showing off early stuff. It makes no sense to spoil the stuff that will happen late in the game and instead leave it to mystery.\u00A0 As importantly, we can assume that before the scope of the game expanded, the version of the game we saw before the first delay was expected to be finished by 2020.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor what the game was planned to be before the first delay, I think we\u0027ve already seen most if not all of it. I am fairly certain initially only one other solar system was planned, and that was the deb deb system.\u00A0 This makes sense for a few reasons, only one of the planets we have seen in the original trailer has not been confirmed to be in the deb deb, and that is rask and rusk. However considering rusk and rask is a planetary system that will inevitably end in them crashing into each other (as confirmed by the devs), it really only makes sense to be in an early solar system (like what deb deb is). If there was more to the game at that point, then why would they show off nearly an entire solar systems contents and not share the load of dampening surprise. Pre first delay, if there was another solar system planned, it would\u0027ve already been in the works and assets would\u0027ve been in a state you could show off, it makes no sense to ruin the exploration of one system while keeping another system untapped for marketing. Not only that, but deb deb makes the most sense for ease of implementation. Deb Deb is a \u0022young kerbin\u0022, this means it has roughly a similar star, which means in terms of height of orbits of planets, size of the sun, etc it would\u0027ve been roughly similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of new parts, I don\u0027t think it would be that much. One thing that\u0027s interesting about the early trailers is that\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eno radiators are shown on any of the vehicles\u003C/strong\u003E. Considering the introduction of procedural radiators, we can assume that they are now a large aspect of gameplay, despite this however, this was absent in the initial plan of the game. A major aspect of late game play was simply not there, and probably not even planned for predelay ksp2. Not only that, but operating under the assumption of there being only one other star system, having a wide array of interstellar and local engines just doesn\u0027t really make sense. You\u0027re only going to use interstellar engines for literally going from two different locations. Id guess initially an orion style for your first interstellar engine, a\u00A0Daedalus for your next, and finally some exotic interstellar engine like a helical engine. We know that Deb Deb will have similar orbital heights to Kerbol due to a similar star, this means that for local travel, there\u0027s really no new niches that need to be filled. The only new parts that would really make sense would be parts that are just this part but better, a better NERV style engine, a better chemical engine (metal hydrogen), etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of colony gameplay and life support, I think it was planned to be far more simple then currently. The only minor hint that life support was going to be a concern in ksp2 is the use of ringed habitats seen in the trailer, however these could\u0027ve easily been in the game at that state mostly to serve the gameplay function of looking cool. If you look in the cinematic trailer and pay close attention, you\u0027ll notice a distinct lack of variation in the colony buildings. We know now that kerbals will probably need food, considering a colony module shown to be a garden, however considering that food being a resource that\u0027s critical to worry about, its odd that this was never shown off in the initial trailer. I think that in the predelay ksp2, colonies served the gameplay function of advanced \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, rocket building, and that was it. In terms of life support, it was basically non existent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most noticeable difference between ksp2 pre delay and currently however is by far graphics. Graphics is the first thing players notice about a game, and its critical for marketing you put a good foot forward. The graphics we saw in initial gameplay was likely roughly planned to be equal to the graphics that were planned to be released. Keep in mind that developers would likely put most work in terms of look of a planet towards the planets they expect to be most seen and cared about, so compare the early image of eeloo to the most recent images shown (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/199981-kerbal-space-program-2-knowledge-repository/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EJust scroll down in knowledge repository \u003C/a\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, what was the original scope of ksp2? While we may never know (devs once youre done finishing the game some documentation here would be lovely, Id happily watch a ksp2 documentary or something), from what we can tell not much, it mostly seemed like ksp 1.5, slightly better graphics, some new parts and some new planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-22T23:20:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2022 11:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Strawberry\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-23T00:21:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224157039\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209083\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221658531016\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222150\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Strawberry\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Strawberry said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno radiators are shown on any of the vehicles\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vessel landing on Merbel had radiators.

I think we knew early on the core dev crew wanted interstellar, colonies, and multiplayer, but as you dive into to actually delivering those things in a satisfying way a lot of other less obvious problems crop up that you need to solve. Things like how does UI work for brachistochrone trajectories at interstellar distances? What are the actual rules and management needs of supply runs? How do we create a robust set of tutorials to get new players over that steep initial learning curve? How do colonies actually function and what are the progression dynamics of exploration and resource gathering? Even without covid I\u0027d have been deeply suspicious of any claim that these subtler problems could have been solved in a way that produced a truly rich game within a year let alone 6mo of the initial announcement.
