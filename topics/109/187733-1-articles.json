You could maybe have three different skybox textures: one for visible light, one for near-IR and one for near-UV that would get more or less transparent depending on the vehicle\u0027s velocity. Some additional red-blue hue gradient could also be applied to to the visible light texture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-27T00:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like this idea but it sounds rather difficult to implement.
