No code from the original has been used. Nate and others have explicitly said that KSP 2 is being built from the ground up. New code, new engine (Well, still unity, but I also heard they are building their own game engine beside it to handle some stuff better), etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExisiting mods will NOT be compatible with KSP 2. You won\u0027t be able to drop KSP 1 mods into KSP 2\u0027s gamedata folder (If it still uses the gamedata structure) and expect them to work. Mods will have to be rewritten or reworked. Especially parts mods since KSP 2 uses PBR textures and none of the KSP 1 part mods use PBR. That should be too hard to do though. As for plugins, it\u0027s a completely rewrite of the codebase. I don\u0027t expect \u0027minimal\u0027 work when it comes to them. The whole plugin might have to be rewritten.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224227425\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211860\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221675498208\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209738\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022intelliCom\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, intelliCom said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, assets like sounds and graphics should be far easier to transfer over, but code will definitely need to be redone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart mods will have to be reworked.
