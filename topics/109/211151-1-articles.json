That is, if I start a game when it first comes out, is it likely that I can continue to use the same save up until the final release? or is it more likely that I\u0027ll have to keep restarting?\u003Cbr\u003E\nI understand the point of early access, and issues that may cause a save to become incompatible are always a possibility, but does anybody know how likely that is to occur?
