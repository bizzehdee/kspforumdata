It was mostly just an afterthought, haphazardly bolted on, using some default Unity joystick modules.

I have got the whole set to work (in KSP1) only after I used thustmaster\u0027s fancy tweaker applications that map certain buttons to keyboard inputs and certain movements to \u0022movement values\u0022 (whatever that means), and even edit some C# code to change certain input values (KSP1 uses some default Unity joystick code and it is quite bad).

The other half is chucking the entirety of the existing KSP 1 wheel code into a volcano and getting something that doesn\u0027t have \u0022binary\u0022 stick/slip physics to it (as it is it seems that either you\u0027re gripping or you\u0027re slipping, there\u0027s no middle ground where \u0022you\u0027re slipping enough to not flip over but you\u0027re gripping enough to be able to climb moderate hills\u0022 as it is in KSP 1.
