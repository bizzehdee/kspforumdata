For those who aren\u0027t aware, the basic concept is that an aqueous solution of an ionic salt of fissile material (usually\u00A0Uranium) is pumped into a nozzle or reaction chamber where it undergoes a supercritical reaction to create thrust from the water. In short, it\u0027s basically an Orion drive except it\u0027s a continuous nuclear explosion rather than intermittent pulses. Suffice it to say, there\u0027s serious potential for this to be a high thrust and high specific impulse torch drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022file8LWV03RT.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002226.95\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/613789556520517632/882648893295329310/file8LWV03RT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat image is via the old game informer interview, by the way. I feel fairly confident this is what these engines are, especially considering there appear to be dozens of little apertures dotting the inside of the engines\u0027 nozzles. This \u0022shower head\u0022 configuration would agree with what prior to KSP 2 being announced were basically the only two concept\u00A0sketches in existence for such a rocket engine:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BLGCOEk.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022121.46\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221044\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/BLGCOEk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeeing as this is a really cool rocket engine that would deservedly be the brachistochrone-between-planets Expanse drive that we all wish for in KSP 2, I thought I would give some thought as to how I personally would design such an engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IqGJmZa.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/IqGJmZa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my concept for a fully self-propelled nuclear salt water rocket engine. It runs on an aqueous solution of enriched Uranium Bromide, as well as a second aqueous mixture which contains a dopant that is exceedingly good at absorbing X-rays. As opposed to the NSWR engine that appears in Nertea\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EFar Future Technologies\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0(I love your mod!) and what I expect will show up in KSP 2, this engine requires no external electrical input to run motors. In fact, this engine will actually generate large amounts of electrical current when operating.\u00A0It\u00A0\u0027s sort of a cross between the steam Rankine cycle that\u0027s likely keeping your lights on this very moment, and the old expander cycle rocket engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now wait a minute\u0022, you might ask, \u0022I know a thing or two about the expander cycle! Because of the square cube law, those things can only get so big. And surely a machine that makes a constant nuclear explosion isn\u0027t going to be tiny, right?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is correct that under normal circumstances, at larger scales the expander cycle has insufficient surface area for even normal chemical propellants to be pumped. The key lies in the way heat transport occurs within this engine. Because the fission reaction is hot enough to produce X-rays and the interior of the nozzle is constructed from a material which is relatively transparent\u00A0to these X-rays, heat transfer actually occurs volumetrically through the thickness of the nozzle channel rather than convectively through only its inner surface. Of course there is no math here but I\u0027m assuming the heat picked up through this process will be enough to expand the shield water into a dry, intense superheated steam. One\u00A0consequence of the radiative heating\u00A0is that the inner wall containing the cooling pores must\u00A0relatively delicate and a balance between the extreme pressures on either side of it are required to avoid collapse. Steam which went into turning the turbine is sent through a bank of radiators - because no spaceship is cool without glowing orange panels on it somewhere. The radiators allow the steam to condense down into a liquid again and be sent back into the shield water pump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I think is worth noting about this concept\u00A0is that it is very miserly when it comes to dumping material overboard. The shield water which serves to both power the entire engine through turbines and also insulate the engine walls from the furious heat of the X-rays is actually the main reaction mass of the engine. Since the nuclear reaction takes up only a tiny part of the total mass flow rate through this engine, it makes sense for the vast majority of the water in the system to be of the simple inert shielding variety.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KyAeids.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KyAeids.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we take a closer look at the nozzle itself, you\u0027ll see that I\u0027ve taken a far different approach than what appears in the material we have so far for Kerbal Space Program 2. Rather than support the reaction inside a combustion chamber of some kind or even a more focused nozzle, I feel that the conditions generated by the fission reaction will be too extreme for anything except the slightest deviation from the classic Orion drive pusher plate. You\u0027ll also see that, outside of the main laminar flow jacket, shield water is injected normal to the inside of the nozzle rather than parallel to the flow of the nuclear fuel. The intention here is that a sort of \u0022stagnation zone\u0022 sets up that ensures shield water does not truly exit the engine until it\u0027s hot enough to either repel the steam front developing inside the nozzle walls or else eject out the back at a significant clip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what do you guys think? I of course am satisfied with the design of the engine as it appears in game now, but I thought this was a fun thought exercise and really got me thinking about the possibilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-03T02:23:03Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2021 02:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Wubslin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zaffre","CreatedById":211990,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-01T18:11:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood post.

And I don\u0027t know how I would take this wrong, considering everything I posted is completely unvalidated and you have simply pointed out this much. Yes, there are a few unsolved questions in the design. For one, it\u0027s basically a given that any prompt (aka not kept alive by the decay of daughter products like in modern power reactors) fission reaction is going to be able to propagate through the UBr4 solution far faster than any real turbopump could reasonably move it. This leads to a few things. For one, the reaction will basically climb up as close as it can to the laminar nozzle which will basically be one neutron MFP away. At this distance, the radiative heat transfer to said nozzle will be extreme.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne way of solving this problem would be to have the nozzle be ablative and consumable, with a very large length of honeycomb constantly extruding out while the engine is in operation like a thermic lance. Another option would be to take the UBr4 nuclear fuel and mix it with an extreme amount of the dopant responsible for making the normal shield water absorb x-rays. Transport of energy out of the reaction due to x-rays will be inhibited at first, so there\u0027s no telling what kind of effect such a design change might have.\u00A0The third\u00A0option, which is the option I imagine to be more sensible and one which I didn\u0027t write about, is\u00A0to actually have the stream of nuclear salt water be subcritical on its own and require the addition of more neutrons from an external supply like a gun pointed at the flow. That way the reactivity could be carefully controlled, and also be able to happen further away from the nozzle itself. How you can shoot a beam of neutrons through so much heat and water, I have no idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother unsolved problem is the specific details regarding heat transport from the reaction to the shield water flowing through the engine bell. Excuse my language here but to quote the old plumber\u0027s adage, \u0022excrements don\u0027t flow uphill\u0022. Simply put, the highest pressure zone in the entire coolant loop needs to be the exit of the turbopump moving the shield water.\u00A0 In addition, the entirety of the layer of water flowing down through the engine bell needs to be at a higher pressure than the zone lining its inside, so that water will actually exit the pores to receive heat and turn into reaction mass while cooling the rocket. Allowing all of this to happen at the same time as the water turns into basically the stuff that came out the back of the Saturn V and have it constantly be a downward gradient in pressure is difficult, to say the least. Not to mention, the fact that the inner lining of the nozzle needs to have a low enough atomic number and be thin enough that the x-rays skip right over it and absorb into the shield water layer inside means withstanding those conditions will be even harder. The coolant heat injection process is almost like an inside-out nuclear light bulb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224027474\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204628\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221630628655\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205123\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nate Simpson\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Nate Simpson said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://s.studiobinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Michael-Jackson-Popcorn-GIF-Meme-Eating-Popcorn-Featured-StudioBinder.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022What\u0026amp;#39;s so appealing about the Michael Jackson Popcorn GIF?\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://s.studiobinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Michael-Jackson-Popcorn-GIF-Meme-Eating-Popcorn-Featured-StudioBinder.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHa, I\u0027m glad it got your attention.

And yeah, if you can direct a completely ionized exhaust via magnetic fields then that would obviously be the best shot at preventing your engines from picking up heat and getting destroyed.\u00A0 I\u0027m not exactly sure where you\u0027d get the current to run those nozzles without an external power supply though. Maybe absorptive surfaces could still be placed near or just downstream of the nozzle such that a traditional Rankine power plant could be run? You would probably want to swap NaK instead of water for miniaturization\u0027s sake. There\u0027s certainly no making the nozzle from superconductors, considering how hot it gets. Maybe electrical current could somehow be tapped off of moving charged exhaust products? I have no idea, especially considering the exhaust has no net electrical charge. My knowledge of plasma dynamics stops about at the right hand rule. I do agree though that running shield water through the inside-facing walls of the magnetic coil nozzles would be a good idea to prevent overheating and neutron embrittlement like you say. Maybe if you have some extreme pressure of water you can tap off from somewhere then perforations could be added to create a hybrid of the two designs. Who\u0027s to say?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, have you thought about adding some more expanded, less luminous \u0022cones\u0022 of exhaust coming out the back in vacuum to represent where the confinement ends?
