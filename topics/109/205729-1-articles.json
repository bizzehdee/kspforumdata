If we are going to have small craft with high-power engines, I would like to see a small but powerful endgame radiator. Also, unless some serious optimization has been done, all of those small structural parts are going to seriously lag out the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, the good stuff. Colonies can have absolutely immense parts, and ships share some parts with colonies, as the Daedalus ship had the exact same tanks as the dock it was attached to. Solar panels have a larger maximum size in the last colony, and there are absolutely immense dishes for long range communication. There are larger tires than before, and they don\u0027t have long attachment sections which means they are more customizable. There is also a new pod for rovers, which has a sort of hexagonal profile (not sure if this will be expanded into a whole \u0022rover\u0022 size class but I\u0027d like to see at least a cargo bay and battery section/probe core with the same profile) which is shown with a large stick antenna and the new storage containers, which are hexagonal. (still not sure why sci-fi has settled on the hexagon when a sphere or cylinder contains more volume for the same surface).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the sort of overlooked stuff. The rotating habitats don\u0027t appear to be one pair but actually a collection, with a center rotating section and an outer ring, which can be attached to the center by multiple points, indicating that the way that attachment works is going to be different than KSP 1. Or it could just be one part, but it doesn\u0027t look that way. Second thing, some ships have comms dishes put on spokes far from the central body. I\u0027m not sure why this would be, unless it had something to do with interference and radiation, but then wouldn\u0027t keeping the dishes close to the craft, safe behind the radiation barrier be better?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, that\u0027s all I found interesting. If there are more things in other gameplay clips that provide more information, put them below!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-24T18:37:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027ve said that all the parts we can see in the trailer will be in the game.
