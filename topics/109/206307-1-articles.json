I thought rule #1 of product naming was \u0022Make it easy to remember\u0022? But enough about that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, knowing that it has to run well on what we currently refer to as \u0022next-gen\u0022 consoles, you could get a good idea of what the ACTUAL \u0022recommended\u0022 system requirements are, based on what the system specifications of those consoles are.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is made rather easy because both Xbox and Playstation, of both the \u0022next gen\u0022 and the \u0022current gen\u0022 are basically using almost-off-the-shelf multi-core 64-bit x86-based AMD cpus, with integrated AMD GPU\u0027s.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is in stark contrast to things like the PS2 and PS3, where the architecture was entirely alien (to PC users) (with the PS3 technically having an 8-core CPU, tho at the time practically nobody knew how to do multi-core programming well).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom that, I think that a 1050ti will maybe struggle a little bit with KSP 2 (as IIRC the GPU in a next-gen console is comparable to a GTX 1660 or RTX 2060 (maybe 2070, not sure, but certainly not 2070 super)).\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, the much more pressing matter will be the CPU. If you don\u0027t have a fairly capable CPU, the game will probably have somewhat low (but stable) FPS with part counts around 150-300 (at least until something explodes, but that\u0027s to be expected).\u003Cbr\u003E\nI myself have an i7-9700k (no overclock, but water cooled, so \u0022thermal constraints\u0022 are a non-issue meaning it\u0027s always at the max 4.9 GHz turbo clock on basically all the cores all the time), and to be honest I\u0027m not sure it will keep up, with the sheer size of the things I think I want to build in KSP 2.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause even if they ARE automated, I don\u0027t want to have to wait for 20 supply missions just to ship over the fuel for whatever gigantic mission I\u0027m creating next. I\u0027d much rather get the job done in less, but larger, shipments. I also don\u0027t like the idea of \u0022lots of little missions to make a colony\u0022, I\u0027d rather send 1-5 potentially gigantic \u0022colony (segment) in a box\u0022 vessels, that on their (collective) own are capable of setting up a colony to the point that it can start contributing to my interplanetary resource flows and industrial base.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo I know if I can even do that in KSP 2? No. Does that mean I\u0027m not going to try? Also no. Because at its heart, to me KSP is all about making the biggest dang rocket you can make (or afford) that won\u0027t fall apart on the launch pad, in order to do the most things at the most places in the solar system that you can, all with ONE (or very few) launch(es).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zozaf Kerman","CreatedById":219910,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-26T21:12:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/12748-sciman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002212748\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/12748-sciman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SciMan\u003C/a\u003EVery well written and reasoned.
