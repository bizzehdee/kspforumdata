I was a field supervisor, fairly high up in the company.. i only answered to a handful of people. A guy who was just a manager of one of our affiliates SOLD his company to the owners of our company, in exchange for a sum of money, and a position as a part owner of the new merged company, with direct control over all operations for the division his former company was responsible for. As a part owner, he also had the ability to make policy, and eliminate people from other divisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe didn\u0027t like me very much. We butted heads constantly, but because of the fact that i was in another division, and untouchable by him, his resentment grew, and grew. As soon as he became a partner in the company, he set a plan in motion to get rid of me. One day, during a particularly difficult job, he harassed me on the phone. I argued with him, and he threatened to create a new position within the company with an identical job description to mine, hire someone, and then eliminate the position i was occupying, \u0022this is how i\u0027ll get rid of you\u0022, he said to me. Unfortunately for him, i had him on speaker...i thought i was alone, but it turns out the customer i was servicing overheard the conversation. They, unbeknownst to me, called the company our company was under contract to, and made a huge stink, threatened to cancel their account. Next thing i know, i\u0027m in a room with one of the owners (not the one who was trying to get rid of me), who\u0027s telling me about the whole thing.... this effectively put an end to the guy\u0027s plans to get rid of me cleanly. Sadly, i couldn\u0027t outmanuver him entirely. He decided to do things the hard way, and pushed me out of the company, making me as miserable as possible, along the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tell this story, to illustrate that i have first-hand knowledge of how these things happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jansn67","CreatedById":158367,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-04T17:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tragedy began in 2017.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Numberyellow","CreatedById":172745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-04T17:18:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223797023\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194406\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591288474\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022136115\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nikokespprfan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, nikokespprfan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwall of text\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like this.

It seems to be catching.

I\u0027ve been working in game development for a while now, in studios covering a broad range of sizes. This crap is not the sort of thing that\u0027s done. Pulling the IP, that happens occasionally. T2 does own it, and if they have no trust in\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Epeople developing the game\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0they can pull the IP and give it to \u003Cem\u003Esomeone else\u003C/em\u003E. This is always sad to see, but it happens. That\u0027s not what happened here. First of all, poaching from contractor is EXTREMELY poor taste. I wish I could say it never happens, but it\u0027s rare, it\u0027s frowned upon, and even when an employee from a contractor firm comes to you and says they want to switch to your company, it\u0027s usually handled with care. Poaching a third of the studio in one go? That\u0027s extremely bad look. You buy the studio, then you offer contracts to everyone in the studio you acquired. I\u0027ve been part of such acquisition, one\u00A0that has been done purely to get the team, and acquisition is how it\u0027s done. Not a LinkedIn message. And these two things in combination? That\u0027s just bad. The fact that you\u0027re hiring back people from whom you\u0027ve taken IP, including the team\u0027s leadership, screams that you\u0027re not doing it because of lack of trust in ability of team to develop the product. This is extremely scummy. Even by standards of large publishers this is bad.\u00A0My trust in T2 handling KSP IP has hit an all time low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also worried about the timeline now. Knowing the attitudes in game development, outside of a few team heads who were undoubtedly lured with very high salaries, people who went over to T2 are the ones who are less certain in their work, who are not sure they can find another job, and these are not your best people. All of the people who were critical to the project\u0027s smooth transition almost certainly left, because they can get another job even during a pandemic\u00A0and they aren\u0027t going to take this crap from T2. (Our studio is still hiring, so are most others. I constantly get invitations from head hunters for jobs all over the country. It\u0027s not quite as easy as it was before pandemic, but getting game dev job is still not hard if you\u0027re good at what you do.)\u00A0I\u0027m sure Intercept will\u00A0be able to staff these positions eventually, but that takes many months, sometimes over a year, and that means Intercept will not be firing on all cylinders for the near future. Looking at the current openings, they are missing some critical people, primarily in senior engineering roles that are notoriously difficult to fill, and which are absolutely required to ship a performant, stable game on a tight schedule.
