You\u0027re talking probably 15 or so celestial bodies that orbit the Sun, most of them with at least one moon, and some with up to 50. Not to mention the parts (see next argument). The estimated release date I have is early June, and postponing it for the minimum month and a half could push it into August.

This is because KSP parts are specifically designed to be marginally overpowered on Kerbin, and perfectly balanced in something like JNSQ. This still means they are 1/3 as powerful as real engines and tanks, and getting to orbit would be a hassle, as would actually getting through the tech tree.

It has already been said pretty clearly that KSP2 will use the same Kerbol system as KSP1 and at the same scale. I tried \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E once and ditched it pretty quickly as it\u0027s far more difficult to get into orbit, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP stuff was bewilderingly complicated and Earth looked abysmal compared to the real thing. Basing anything on a real place is risky because people will see all the ways it doesn\u0027t look like the real thing, whereas the Kerbol system is based on the real solar system closely enough that it\u0027s obvious what the analogies are (Duna = Mars etc.) but at the same time it\u0027s different enough that you can have a Jovian water-world and a Martian moon that\u0027s geosynchronous and tidally locked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stock scale Kerbol system is more than big enough considering how few people who start playing the game a) make it to orbit, b) get to the Mun and c) land on the Mun (I\u0027m basing that on what I read when there was a KSP2 stand at a games expo a few months ago). Anything that makes it harder to do those three fairly simple things will drastically reduce player retention, and people who try a game and give up because it\u0027s too complicated aren\u0027t exactly a ringing endorsement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother important point is that we haven\u0027t visited most of the real solar system to any great extent- a few rovers on Mars, some landers on Venus and a handful of probes to the asteroid belt and the outer planets; we\u0027ve only ever set foot on the Moon, which in astronomical terms is like going to the bottom of your garden, and that\u0027s not likely to change particularly soon.\u00A0There\u0027s hardly any data out there for a great many of the bodies in the solar system, so basing it off a fictional one means you can make things up without being bound by realism and instead are free to make something far more interesting like the binary planets we\u0027ve already seen in the KSP2 trailers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m currently playing through with JNSQ as the stock planets aren\u0027t all that difficult to get around especially with all the mods out there; but then again I\u0027ve been playing for a while now and chose to try something more challenging. It was either that or waiting the 60 years or so of game time for a probe mission to fly to Neidon-\u00A0I tried a few stock-scale planet packs too including OPM and XPC, but simply adding more planets doesn\u0027t always improve the game.

You need more or less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, and things take more or less time. Both of these problems can be fairly trivially solved even by less experienced players. This burn or transfer is taking too long, use timewarp. Not enough deltaV, add more rocket. Making a big rocket isn\u0027t any more difficult than making a small rocket, especially with parts for various sizes of rocket. A big tank and engine is more capable than a small tank and engine, without using any more parts. For an upscaled system, you need only make the rocket bigger, without also increasing the\u00A0payload.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, I \u003Cu\u003Edo not\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0think it should be upscaled for everyone, and it probably won\u0027t be anyways. We already know that for better or worse, stock scale is a thing. That being the case, if people are advocating for a larger scale, why have just one?

As I\u0027ve mentioned previously, SMURFF does a great job at this, and even allows you to change how much it tweaks. If something like SMURFF was added, it would give an additional level of difficulty customization not found in KSP1, especially when alongside a rescale factor.

Its things like limited ignitions, ullage, fuel types, life support, and non-magical reaction wheels most of all. Some of these things *cough* ignition limits *cough* are even exaggerated in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E for difficulties sake. While these features *may* add realism, KSP is first and foremost a game. Realism, difficulty, and entertainment are fully independent of one another, as much as having a real scale earth does not mean having ullage and ignition limits.

KSP1 lacks any real tutorial, and just throws new players into literal actual rocket\u00A0science with nothing but a few hard to find in-game help resources. This situation has improved slightly with each new release. Maneuver nodes, Offset tools, KSPedia (someone has to have used it by now), and in game delta V and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E readouts have made things easier, but only for those that already know where to find them and how to use them.

Getting to orbit is the most fundamental thing in KSP, and teaching new players how to do this should not be made harder\u00A0by limiting them to 1950s era rocket tech. Future technologies may actually help to aid in this, providing an easy way to get to orbit in a tutorial, while allowing for chemical propulsion to be made for difficult for actual career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-04T01:57:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223765885\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192875\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585946141\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184845\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MechBFP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, MechBFP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vast majority of people I talk about KSP in real life are like \u201COh, so you can fly around the real solar system???\u201D \u00A0\u201CNo it\u2019s a smaller\u00A0fictional solar system.\u201D\u00A0\u201COh... well that is stupid.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNuff said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave these people played any other video games ever?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh so it\u0027s like real, actual war?\u0022 \u0022No if you die you come back a couple minutes later.\u0022 \u0022Oh well that\u0027s stupid.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223765898\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192875\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585947758\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002217022\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dragon01\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Dragon01 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want do scale it down 64%, and then stock parts becomes \u003Cem\u003Ealmost balanced\u003C/em\u003E, without any tuning required. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EOf course, you can scale up the Kerbal system to an approximately the same scale, and get similar results.
