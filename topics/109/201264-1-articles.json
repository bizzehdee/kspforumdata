So while you\u0027re waiting on years to go by for those distant missions, you\u0027re still running some more local stuff and improving your infrastructure (more relays, gas stations, surface rovers and bases, etc.). In the end, I always seem to come down to tourism as my primary mechanism for game play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question here though is about the interstellar travel and the time it would take to get to another system. It can take IRL a lot of play time for one of my Jool or Eeloo missions to play out while still handling local stuff. Wirth KSP2, we\u0027re going to have colonies that probably require a lot of management over time as well. How long do you think it will take us in real play time before we even get to explore any of these other systems, let alone colonize them and create new space construction in them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a side note, it has occured to me that our communication system might need an upgrade as well if we are to send data back in between systems, or control a drone piloted ship along the way. I imagine that the interstellar ships might run on an engine that can only be fired up when far enough away from a star, and will travel so fast that there would be no orbital trajectory to intercept. This could speed up travel times in between systems, but to what end can we expect from this? The restriction on being far from the star might be necessary to prevent straight jumps between planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-28T10:52:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223945519\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201264\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221616809952\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188635\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jclovis3\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/27/2021 at 2:52 AM, jclovis3 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow long do you think it will take us in real play time before we even get to explore any of these other systems, let alone colonize them and create new space construction in them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepends on how much you use time warp.

I don\u0027t think there would be that much micromanagement needed. Just build it and let them to their job, expand if necessary.
