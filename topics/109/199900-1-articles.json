(IE some features are a paid DLC released later, giving more time and funds) I\u0027d rather spend more money over time for a\u00A0good game with good DLC, than spend less money now for a game that doesn\u0027t grow without mods built using free labor.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m patient enough, and the first game is good enough to hold me over until then.

There was definitely loss of efficiency, it was harder to test builds, and we straight up lost a couple of weeks in transition to working from home, and some companies lost closer to a month, but it still adds up to a few months, not years of delay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEducated guess, based on information released, is that the original plan for KSP2 was basically a face lift. A prettier version of KSP on newer version of Unity. Basically, a glorified DLC with some rework to make better use of updates the engine\u0027s been through and ensure smooth release on next gen of consoles. Interstellar and colonies are a pretty big addition, but the way it was presented initially, can still be looked at as a couple of DLC packs. This matches up against timeline, the early press releases, and the fact that the game was given to Star Theory - a tiny little studio with no experience in making large games. They were supposed to take KSP, update the rendering, add some new rocket parts for interstellar, and ability to build modules on planets, plus add another star system to explore - probably just the one. A reasonable scope and timeline for Star Theory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing, this changed after response to E3 video in 2019. I don\u0027t think Take 2 / Private Division expected such favorable feedback to announcement. Game started growing in scope, probably with Nate Simpson as primary driving force with a node from someone at Private Division.\u00A0Colonies becoming central element of gameplay progression and interstellar expansion, multiplayer that was just mused about became a core feature. Larger ships, more star systems to explore. Much, much bigger game. Somewhere in the process of negotiations for that scope expansion, Private Division and Star Theory came to an impasse, and Take 2 authorized creation of Intercept Games. Pandemic hit just as development was ramping up in a new studio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe combination of much larger scope, new developers, and the pandemic does sound like the right amount of factors to delay the game into 2022. I doubt Intercept went into what can be qualified as full scale production until late spring to early summer of 2020, and you aren\u0027t going to make a game like this in less than two years. And while it\u0027s not exactly starting from scratch, given the scope change, it might as well have been. The only part I\u0027m a little upset about is that they kept trying to make it look like they\u0027re trying to salvage original timeline with some delays when it was clear that wasn\u0027t going to happen. Announcement that game would be delayed to 2022 should have come out sooner. Other than that, this seems about right for the size of the project they\u0027re working on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for announcing early, I really do think Take 2 honestly expected to ship KSP2 much sooner as a much smaller game. And on the net, I\u0027m glad we\u0027re getting a proper sequel rather than just a remake. So I\u0027m happy to wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-29T03:00:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223916209\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221611857399\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey still have their weekly Show n Tell thing, right?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo they don\u2019t.

Park in circular around Kerbin, set Minmus as target, look for ascending/descending nodes. Put a maneuvering node on one of them and adjust the normal/anti-normal until the new ascending/descending node reads 0 degrees - it might move to a different place, that doesn\u0027t matter. You can adjust retrograde at the same time to keep orbit circular, or you can fix it later.\u00A0After you execute that node, encounter with Minmus should be very easy. You can make it trivial by using KSP subway map. Minmus is 930m/s from 80km parking orbit around Kerbin. So if you put your ship into an 80km circular orbit with same inclination as Minmus, just create a new maneuvering node, dial in 930m/s for prograde, and then slide that node around orbit until you see an encounter. You can\u0027t miss it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis does cost some extra delta-V for inclination change, of course, and there are ways to save that fuel by making sure you are doing correction late in transfer. That requires waiting until Minmus is in a good place for such transfer, however. Another pro strategy is timing your launch and going for 6\u00A0degree inclination orbit that closely matches that of Minmus right away. Both of these are harder to execute but will save you a lot of delta-V on inclination change. Minmus doesn\u0027t require you to be terribly fuel-efficient, though, so you might as well go for simple and fix your inclination in parking orbit as described above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are other planets/moons you can\u0027t time nearly as easily and have eccentric orbits on top of odd inclination, so if you haven\u0027t had trouble with them, you were lucky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-30T13:13:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223916768\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221611935967\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022207217\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dr. Kerbal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Dr. Kerbal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.
