There must be some trick up the sleeves of the devs regarding UI feedback to the players if we are expected to be landing on our own runways and landing/launch pads regularly.\u00A0 Or, do we think it will be just that, unforgiving and left to the modders if you want something along the lines of the ksp1 trajectories mod?\u00A0 I\u0027m curious to see what other people are thinking regarding this.\u00A0 Should we get that sort of UI assistance, or would that be making the game too easy and punish those that desire the challenge?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-12-22T18:03:40Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2022 06:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by DrCHIVES\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drakenred65","CreatedById":154503,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-22T21:29:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_Voh7NgDE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI prefer max thrust \u201Cslam landing\u201D\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SolarAdmiral","CreatedById":107350,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-22T21:49:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m definitely hoping to see something like this too.

All you can do is get something close and then adjust the thrust and orientation to stay on that path. So that requires not just precise computation, but also numerical control of the landing craft. I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll have the adequate automation capability without mods, and even with mods this would have to be a fairly comprehensive one. Perhaps something with integration into some equivalent of kOS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn vacuum, it\u0027s a bit more forgiving. For a single landing stage, you can compute precise time that engines must go to max thrust, and so long as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is locked to retrograde w.r.t. surface, you should be within tolerances.
