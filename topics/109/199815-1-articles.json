Please note most of this is speculation and what I\u0027d prefer ideally, and I\u0027ll probably mention whenever something is confirmed.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI. Core Function of a Base/Colony (EDIT: Most parts of this section have been confirmed to be in KSP2 after I wrote this-- thank you, Nate Simpson!)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor most of us, when we\u00A0think of a base or colony in KSP2 we think of the ridiculously precariously positioned orange glass domes atop large metallic poles on an atmospheric planet around another star, as described in the KSP2 trailer. I love this concept, but I want to break down the core functions of a base and colony to see what they might look like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all I want to provide distinction between a KSP1 base, a KSP2 base, and a colony. In my ideal mind, \u0022bases\u0022 that we put on planets like KSP1 will mean nothing like a KSP2 base or colony. A KSP1 base would be an assortment of ship parts with landing legs attached. Ideally KSP2 bases and colonies won\u0027t be anything like this, and they both use base parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But wait,\u0022 you ask, \u0022what\u0027s the difference between a base and a colony now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me I\u0027d find it best if bases were described as anything made of base parts, and colonies were bases that could make more kerbals and base parts for\u00A0the colony, i.e. sustainable and containing a colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you wanted to make a simple mining factory on Minmus that sent back pods of Mintium to Kerbin, you might not have a need for kerbals at all, and ergo it might be a nonsustainable construction, contianing no kerbals. It\u00A0just mines, builds ore pods, and launches them. This obviously would not count as a colony, but rather a base. A fairly lackluster base, but still a base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, let\u0027s say you had a metropolis of dozens of biodomes on Duna. It mines, filters water and oxygen out of the rocks (or whatever life support Kerbals would need), puts ore into a massive \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and base construction facility, AND\u00A0it has the capability to make more base parts and attach them onto the end. This obviously would be a colony-- it can create more space for the kerbals, feed them, and let them reproduce. However it would also be a base, as a base would be a sort of umbrella term in this case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my ideal world, a\u00A0base\u0027s core function can be whatever, but it needs to be made out of base parts. It matters not whether it has kerbals in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA colony\u0027s core function would be a subcategory of bases that\u00A0let kerbals reproduce, so they may split up amongst other craft that the colony also creates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EII. Kerbals and Colonies\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first kerbal-related point I want to address is reproduction. Kerbals will reproduce somehow in colonies, and it\u0027s likely we\u0027ll need something to let them reproduce in colonies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen a lot of debate on whether life support should be added or not. I\u0027m still not entirely sure on what the consensus would be, because I don\u0027t think colonies should require nothing, but I also don\u0027t want them to require a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you made them require nothing to reproduce, then I\u0027d probably be against that, because then you\u0027d just need to set up a random biodome on a planet and use that to fill ships full of kerbals if you lacked an easy way to just hire more astronauts. Plus KSP2 has been confirmed to have a truckload of new resources, and it would be a shame if none went directly towards kerbals themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever I also don\u0027t want Kerbals to need oxygen, food, water, unobtanium, Mintium, and several other prerequisites to reproduce. That\u0027s just mad. I also don\u0027t want ships themselves to require any more than electricity for life support, but colonies definitely need\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea what kind of stuff they would need. Perhaps they need some sort of snack, but that would also raise the question as to why they don\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0need snacks. The KSP2 devs have one big question ahead that they need to solve, and I hope they choose wisely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, kerbals aren\u0027t just there for reproduction. Right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the expenses of huge biodomes and kerbal-related infrastructure they need to have purposes more than making more kerbals and planting more flags. In KSP we have things like laboratories and surface samples, which are great and all, but a new variable has just been added to the game, one so big that kerbals may become obsolete:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently automated bases have every bit as usefulness as colonized bases, except the making more kerbals part. From what I\u0027ve seen so far kerbals don\u0027t work or build or help with bases at all, which I do not think is a good idea. I think engineer kerbals specifically should help with bases a lot. Let me show some ideas for one moment:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngineers: help speed up build processes of everything and improve resource mining\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScientists: help speed up base R\u0026amp;D more (will elaborate in a future section)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPilots:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...wait, what should pilots do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here\u0027s where a bajillion dollar idea struck me: we redo a bit of commnet stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently commnet would work for probes like this: if the connection to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is good enough, you can control probes. BUT WHAT IF, instead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, you could also connect to pilots in spacecraft or at bases? Pilots would then have a use at bases obviously, as if you weren\u0027t easily able to connect to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, you could always just connect to Duna Autopilot Base, aka DAB, and use that as your remote control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBases with pilots could act as extra DSN stations!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, if a base had a scientist on board and an R\u0026amp;D lab or something, perhaps transmitting data can also go to that base instead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are my ideas on the relations between Kerbals, Bases, and Colonies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIII. Delivery and Automation\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think, at some point, Star Theory confirmed the existence of delivery missions that can be run autonomously without interaction to some extent. I\u0027d like to elaborate more on what my hopes and dreams for this system is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCore concept: a programming language. Whether it be a simple VPL like Scratch, or a more complex written language like Python or kOS, I\u0027d love to see some way to give craft the ability to write, edit, and run code. An example would be slapping a Computato 3000 onto the side of a booster, and when it detaches, it will begin its script and boostback to land at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively it could be something more simple than even a VPL, where you select the pickup location, the dropoff location, and actions to complete at either side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA major issue I see with this is the physics range. Said booster would attempt to land on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, from which the parent rocket is already tens of kilometers from. In KSP, the physics range is 2.5km(?). Sure, we can always increase it, but when is too much physics range? Is this a decent solution at all?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething that could be done is improving the non-physics warp, which they have confirmed they are doing to some extent, and have that also run the scripts and detect landings. They\u0027re already adding the ability for engine burns to be warpable, which means this could be the near future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor automation to function properly, they have 2 options: increase or make unlimited the physics range, or have advanced warp features. Or a combo of the two, as these aren\u0027t mutually exclusive features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch additions could make MONUMENTAL changes for KSP as a whole, and I would elaborate further but my fingers are really killing me and ergo I shall cease typing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIV.\u00A0Coming Soon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe sure to remind me to continue this every now and again, as otherwise I will forget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-29T03:05:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2021 03:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by LittleBitMore\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESection III added, Section 1 partially confirmed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-25T07:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni tink bases that are made with parts would be what the colony is built upon. so that you would kinda need a base to make a colony.\u00A0 i also tink normal spacestations and bases should have more use such as a way to generate money or maybe even be able to fabricate small parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-25T08:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBases need resupply missions to work and rotate the crew.
