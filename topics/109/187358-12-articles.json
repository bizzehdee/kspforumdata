I share some of the concerns, while at the same time being far more relaxed than others. I am sure the developers are seeing these debates too, and I hope there is some discussion around how best to update the community regarding their progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there is \u003Cu\u003Eone really important question\u003C/u\u003E that I am keen to know, and that is \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ehave the developers determined the UX question of multi-play vs time warp?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0If they have, then I\u0027d love to know how, and if they have not then I\u0027d have serious fears as to effectiveness of the design process, as this question gets to the heart of some pretty fundamental areas within the philosophy of KSP, and by extension will heavily influence the design parameters of the underlying physics engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to explore these with this forum, and invite thoughts and comments to see if the collective brainpower of this forum can help in any way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESo what is the problem?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell in a nutshell, we take it for granted that KSP uses \u0022real\u0022 physics. That means that, absent the cheat menu (or equivalent mods), you cannot instantaneously move from point A to point B: to do so takes time, design (i.e. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E) and skill (manoeuvring). Time spent traversing the vast interplanetary void can be compressed into a human-enjoyable span through time acceleration. This puts the a god-like power of time compression into the hand of the player/observer\u00A0and, for KSP1,\u00A0just works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWell what happens when there are two observers?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell if one is strictly an observer, and one is a player, then we have the situation of watching a Brad Whistance or Matt Lowne YouTube video: one observer entirely devolves authority to time compress into the hands the player, who uses that power as they see fit for their enjoyment/control and for the benefit of their audience. Similar authority could\u00A0be envisaged\u00A0where\u00A0players are\u00A0cooperating on a single vessel/goal and one player is assigned a role of \u0022captaincy\u0022, but the crucial point is that role has the responsibility, and would typically be trusted\u00A0not to want to time warp their vessel into a planet at max speed - deliberately or otherwise. This would be possible as a multiplayer solution, but how roles would be shared and defined would significantly determine the viability and enjoyment of the players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat if other people\u00A0don\u0027t want to hand over all time-compression authority to another player?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf two people are simultaneously and actively playing on different vessels, then their flight characteristics, and hence time-compression wants, will be different. For two players a compromise should be straightforward: player 1 could highlight\u00A0that they want to accelerate time, player 2 could either agree\u00A0or disagree. Where they agree time can then accelerate\u00A0to the lowest accelerated speed they both accept; where they disagree time remains in the lowest\u00A0speed needed by either of them\u00A0(which is probably, but not necessarily always, single speed). Given minute changes in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E can adjust the time it takes to intercept with a planet from seconds to weeks apart, this could cause some challenges on a multiplayer mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis already causes some problems for both players, making the experience slower and potentially less enjoyable, but what happens when there are 3, 4, or more active players in a single game reference, each of whom are making active or passive choices to change game speeds. Very quickly the likelihood of all players finding unanimity\u00A0drops to zero, and that\u0027s before you consider the possibility of AFK or \u0022trolling\u0022 influencing the situation. In that situation, envisaging a \u0022large scale\u0022 form of play, one spanning any significant distance, becomes difficult at anything other than \u0022real time\u0022 speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOk: so each player chooses their own speed: problem solved?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot really: that solves the single player experience but makes the multiplayer interaction little more than the ability to see \u0022ghosted images\u0022 of where players would have been or will be. Meaningful/physically accurate\u00A0interaction between vessels in space becomes near impossible, and the multiplayer experience is reduced to short-term flights around one or more agreed \u0022rendezvous\u0022 points. And even then, within those points the interaction can only be between players consenting to a single time reference, so you would not see, for example, a player screaming in from inter-planetary space to seamlessly join in with multiplayer action, unless that person was willing to accept some for of \u0022time-slippage\u0022 where they move from control over their time reference, to not controlling it. These \u0022bubbles of unreality\u0022 would partially solve a multiplayer requirement, but arguably run counter to the ethos of KSP, where reality is, broadly, a \u0022firm\u0022 concept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESo multiplayer in a \u0022realistic game\u0022 is impossible?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s hard to answer that: certainly you cannot require that people give up their lives to \u0022feed the tamagotchi\u0022 of a mission that happens to need to require all participants converge on a single point in real-time over missions that might last weeks or even years of in-game time if they do not have any control over that reference time, but equally you cannot easily compress time universally to the enjoyment of all players, without giving them individual control. Flight simulators have certainly found solutions whereby voluntary \u0022bubbles\u0022 allow single-reference interaction if a player so chooses, but those are arguably quite specialised games and may not appeal to all of the\u00A0KSP demographic, and (going back to the original point of this post) almost certainly needs to be coded in from deep within the game engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA multiplayer mission to the Mun, for example, would be fundamentally different to a multiplayer experience of players flying planes around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. And also\u00A0incompatible with each other. Could a multiplayer approach accommodate both? Possibly, but you may need to decide which \u0022version\u0022 you were playing prior to launch, and would easily become quite confusing for players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what do you think? Am I over-stating\u00A0this problem? Are there other solutions?

KSP2 has indicated, for example, supply routes being an important mechanic for establishing permanent colonies. In multiplayer you can coordinate so one player builds the station, another player establishes a supply route for say liquid fuel, and another establishes a supply route for water or what-have-you. Simple tools like ability to mark a location/waypoint for the intended base/station to coordinate these efforts and the option to spectate the status of each other\u0027s mission involves more interaction than passively watching ghosted images. Each player would see the results of the efforts combined in the final colony/station etc. and whatever further mechanics KSP2 operates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doc","CreatedById":92176,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-19T11:36:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223804584\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221592393297\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118580\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mattinoz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/17/2020 at 1:28 PM, mattinoz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecent comments suggest funds are being de-emphasised in the game maybe but could actually be used to umm.. resolve such a paradox .
