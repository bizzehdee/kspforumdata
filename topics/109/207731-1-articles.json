However, you do have to worry about it when the shield is very far in front. If the shield (or exhaust shield) is a non-negligible time ahead of the main craft, a particle traveling sideways can use that time to start outside the shield and move into the path of the engine bell. To get full coverage, the exhaust would have to expand every rapidly to catch any particles that are traveling sideways, which is not ideal for Isp, as that is a lot of energy that you could have used for thrust. So, sweeping out the path wouldn\u0027t really work, you probably would do best with a shield only a few dozen km away from the craft at most.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-14T03:15:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224116523\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207731\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221649905590\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, sweeping out the path wouldn\u0027t really work, you probably would do best with a shield only a few dozen km away from the craft at most.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, then if the exhaust is thin, what about the shield having a port in it for the exhaust (yeah, I know, heat heat heat) but the remaining disc of the shield would protect the engine where the exhaust didn\u0027t cover it.\u00A0 That boundary between the exhaust and the shield port edges is highly problematic though, lol.\u00A0 Still, the cone shaped shield would have the same concerns with heat\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-14T03:37:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat could work a lot better, but I can\u2019t remember why the Daedalus engine is a dome (since the actual reaction is in a rather small area the engine could easily be much smaller) and I\u2019m just going off of the hypothetical that there are a lot of neutrons and other fun stuff bouncing around and you don\u2019t want to bottle that up.
