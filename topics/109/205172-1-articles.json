Probably- interstellar drives suck as Daedalus have theoretical delta-V that runs into tens of megametres per second (a megametre is a million metres, or a thousand kilometres) and while Kerbal stuff is usually worse in terms of mass ratios (everything is heavier, so less delta-V) it\u2019s not too outlandish to suggest that a Kerbal craft could theoretically go from Kerbin to Duna inside 12 hours with a semi-brachistochrone trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut- and this is the key point- why would you want to? Such a feat is also possible with KSP and the right mods, but it\u2019s a lot easier (and less expensive!) to go the long way round with a Hohmann transfer, and if you really wanted to go straight there you\u2019d use a mod that can accelerate time and/or allow thrust under time warp, which KSP2 will allow exactly because using interstellar drives will take (Earth) days to accelerate to their top speed and back down again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-08T10:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in the days when we had no Mun and no time warp, real time was the only way to orbit Kerbin.
