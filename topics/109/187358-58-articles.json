In real life, crafts that are close together in space (and velocity) have a lot of time to react, and usually can plan things out ahead of a confrontation and in the hours following it. However, in a game with time warp, the amount of time it takes to plan a trajectory is a significant percentage of the time it takes to intercept or evade someone. On top of that, you can\u0027t just hit someone who has already warped away because that would feel terrible. So in a KSP 2 combat mod, there will likely be a condition that ties players\u0027 clocks together if they are actively in combat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-13T22:03:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224198402\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221668358246\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022216984\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyFall2489\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, SkyFall2489 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DMP/LMP model is called Subspace warp, referring to how the players at different times are in different subspaces.
