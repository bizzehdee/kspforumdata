It feels obvious when you\u0027ve been playing a while, but I\u0027ve seen quite a few new players trying to, for example, attach a liquid fuel engine to a command pod without any fuel tanks\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C/em\u003E, because coming from a gaming background, it\u0027s certainly not a given necessity, and if you don\u0027t have a background knowledge of spaceflight, it might not be something that immediately occurs to you. This is actually the reason the tech tree starts with a solid fuel engine - because you \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E just stick that on, and it\u0027ll work, which might be the difference between the game catching someone\u0027s attention and just shutting it down, never to be played again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I wouldn\u0027t mind different fuel types, but it\u0027s important that they be\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Einteresting\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0and\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Edistinct\u003C/strong\u003E. In my mind, this is the problem with hydrazine and methalox engines. As far as I can tell, methane is just a slightly worse kerosene/RP-1, with the only really advantage being that it could synthesized off-world easier. Would that even make much of a difference, especially given that by the time a player would be thinking about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, they probably mostly\u00A0switched over to the more \u0027advanced\u0027 methane engines anyway? In that case, it\u0027s not even a real choice - it\u0027s not an interesting decision,\u00A0it\u0027s just an outright replacement for kerosene\u00A0after a point that could easily be just represented by new engines.\u00A0Hydrazine could be interesting... but the real world benefits of it are that it solves real world problems - namely, it\u0027s hypergolic, so it\u0027s easier to build multiple-ignition engines using it. This isn\u0027t an issue in KSP, given all engines have infinite ignitions anyway, and changing that would add more unnecessary complexity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHydrazine also raises another problem - realistic accuracy. Hydrazine doesn\u0027t use liquid oxygen as an oxidizer, which could raise more questions than it answers - really, the only thing it\u0027s accurately depicting is that hydrazine is a fuel used for small engines. Again, there\u0027s a reason KSP uses the generic Liquid Fuel rather than anything specific. By abstracting, you remove the problem of accuracy entirely - any resemblance to real life fuel is entirely coincidental, which is why for the 1.0 release they were able to drop the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of every engine in the game by ~50, and allow it to be synthesized from \u0027Ore\u0027 without any major complaints about it being inaccurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, this all sounds really down on alternate fuels, but I would say Liquid Hydrogen is a perfect example of a good one! Having played with Cryo Engines for a bit, it\u0027s definitely a fun option. It\u0027s more expensive and much less dense than Liquid Fuel, but has a much higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, which makes it plenty \u003Cstrong\u003Edistinct\u003C/strong\u003E enough. But it\u0027s also\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Einteresting\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0- it has the added issue of boiloff, which makes it impractical for anything beyond the the inner Kerbin system, but you can mitigate it later in the game using more advanced tech to store it indefinitely for long periods of time using electric charge, which even ties into another system. It just\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efeels\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Elike a very different fuel, used by a very different class of engine.
