We have seen space colonies on duna and I think we can imagine them on other terrestrial bodies, some here have even speculated at floating colonies and flying ones in jovian atmospheres.... But I don\u0027t think many here have talked about colonies in space. In KSP 1 anything like this was kind of limited to expanding the number of seats and adding a lab.

Outside of the orbital \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, the rest of the shown esthetic, in my opinion, looks like over sized MKS/FFT and stock parts.
