If they allow you to turn off things like volumetric effects, clouds, and procedural vegetation entirely, that\u0027s going to be a huge win in GPU resources spared. But even with these features disabled, and with things like shadow and texture quality tuned down, KSP2 is still likely to take considerable GPU memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also not sure how much motivation there will be to try and get it as low as possible. CPU is going to be a major bottleneck for KSP2. There aren\u0027t a lot of PCs out there with potato graphics and a good CPU, which means the min spec target for GPU is probably not going to be all that low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-28T21:44:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP1 provided some helpful options, for people using regular computers, as opposed to gaming PCs.\u00A0 \u00A0I hope KSP2 does similarly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use a laptop that I bought in 2016,\u00A0which is the only time\u00A0 I ever bought any more than the integrated graphics \u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 CPU i7-6500U at 2.5\u202FGHz\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 GPU AMD R7 M360, 2\u202FGB memory\u003Cbr\u003E\nand with this I turn most graphics settings down, but keep shadows to help in landings, and use Environmental Visual Enhancements with a simple configuration file to give me clouds to help with situational awareness.\u00A0 This laptop performs better with KSP 1.10 than it did with 1.0, maybe due to streamlining in KSP or maybe in Unity.\u00A0 (For example, KSP 1.0 would often miss key-up events, so if I pressed the key to rotate the view it would oven continue rotating after I released the key.
