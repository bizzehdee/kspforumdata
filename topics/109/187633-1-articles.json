KSP battery capacity, fuel to electricity conversion rates, mass of batteries, etc. were IMO not properly matched to the real world. Also, there are a lot of electrical techs, which never got into KSP and could make gameplay more interesting. I\u0027m ready to help free of charge and under \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E if necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have searched through the internet and found no way of contacting both the publisher and development team of KSP2. Does anyone know how to contact devs? PM me if you do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case devs read this forum, here is my mini-resume. I graduated from the Siberian aerospace university (specialty - aircraft control systems), got a Candidate of Science degree - Russian equivalent of PhD. Focus of my thesis was a power converter for solar arrays of communications satellites - you can find the abstract by phrase \u0022\u0430\u0432\u0442\u043E\u0440\u0435\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442 \u0425\u043E\u0440\u043E\u0448\u043A\u043E pdf\u0022 - it is in Russian though. I worked as a lecturer for five years and then as an assistant professor for four years\u00A0in the university. For the last two years, I am a chief designer of avionics for heavy UAVs. I have 1421 hrs in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-25T18:34:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the offer, but there are legal reasons why they\u0027d be reluctant to accept work from a volunteer helper, and there are practical reasons why code from someone outside a team would not mesh well with work from inside the team.

Such thinking and designing and balancing work does not require any code (apart from illustrative examples maybe) and can be done in a design document.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing prohibits you of making a design document with all the 1) gameplay considerations, 2) tidbits of interesting info to be inspired from or nod to, 3) advised code-implentation techniques and 4) part balancing tables, that you\u0027d like to pass on to the devs, then posting that on the forums. Heck, maybe the dev\u0027s will see it, run at least the mentioned interesting tidbits through one of the teams\u0027 designers, and maybe some stuff makes it into the game that way. The devs are known to speak to experts. Especally if it is interesting or elaborate stuff I would not be surprised if they\u0027d consider/read it just because lot\u0027s of thinking work is already done, especially when it comes to balancing. From there, any resistance is the same as if you were on the team, where descisions need to be made taking in lots of factors. Just don\u0027t forget to explain everything you do extensively, instead of expecting them to reverse-engineer it from the changes you propose, because that strategy will not work very well I can promise you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only difference is that you don\u0027t know for sure wether they check it, and they might not tell you about the obvious problems only they know from their perspective inside game development.
