And considering KSP2 will have multiplayer, It would be lovely to be able to move around the ship you build with your friends.

Most IVA\u0027S are non-functional even in the most basic forms. For me to use the IVA functions, they 1st have to correct the sight lines for the cockpits and improve the readability for the flight instruments.
