But the article seems fairly single-sided (probably because it\u0027s hard to get any quotes from T2/PD - people want to keep their jobs), and desperate times call for desperate measures. Keep in mind that the switch from Star Theory to Private Division was the first thing we heard about KSP2 in a long, long time.

They\u0027ve bought a game with a certain culture and you don\u0027t do that if you don\u0027t intend to stick with it.

Turns out they made cast iron blocks, flywheels, transmission gears, linkages, and even did steel work for frames for the Model T and Model A Fords. Well, Henry Ford\u0027s car company became so big that it needed a new headquarters building. So, in the process of moving to Detroit, Michigan, an entire cargo container of office items was lost (think of the container as being a 4\u0027x4\u0027x6\u0027 wooden crate). In that crate were invoices dating for nearly a year of money owed to John and Horace. Because the invoices were lost, Henry Ford refused to pay until the invoices and bills of lading could be found. In 1929 currency, that was $52,650.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two brothers were pretty mad at Ford and decided to go into business for themselves building cars.
