However, the amount you can accommodate should have increased significantly, order of magnitudes is likely an apt descriptor. The tech that has been shown off appears to be much more scalable. Its also using a roughly ten year newer version of the underlying engine, which brings in fundamental improvements in asset streaming and memory management options - Likely more than ten years worth of improvements, since upgrading versions over KSP1\u0027s dev cycle wouldn\u0027t have inherently implemented all the new techniques.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI doubt it will increase in a material way when colonies and interstellar launch, but only because the actual changes don\u0027t require those game mechanics to be implemented.
