this thread as well.\u00A0 I have been playing KSP since beta and touch back into the game at least once a year to run a new space program and over the years I have my list of (more or less) essential mods I use whenever I can when playing KSP.\u00A0 A combination of several types of mods but collectively they greatly improve my overall experience with the game.\u00A0\u003Cu\u003E While yes, all these are mods, having to rely on mods for what I would consider base game play is unreliable.\u00A0 Many of these mods listed below play into each other and really expand on the science elements (more variety has always been better for me), or more meaningfully expand on the kerbals themselves.\u00A0 I find I care much more about the game when I have to consider the needs of the kerbals themselves, giving them a meaningful purpose to be included, and really ups the immersion and realism factor up for me.\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*SCANSat: Basically the first mod I ever load.\u00A0 Greatly enhances the unmanned phase of my exploration.\u00A0 Gives a meaningful purpose for sending out probes and playing with orbits so I can map out a planet and use that information for planning ahead to my landing phases (maned or unmanned).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E (Kerbal Attachment System): Basically an essential mod for me.\u00A0 I love the aspect of having my kerbal\u0027s function in a reasonable way.\u00A0 Gives them a more meaningful purpose to actually send manned mission beyond planting a flag.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E (Kerbal Inventory System):\u00A0Basically an essential mod for me.\u00A0 I

necessary/essential element to my game play.\u00A0 Needing to factor in the needs of my kerbals into my ship designs and overall space program adds a realistic and fun challenge.\u00A0 Makes the Kerbals more meaningful from a sandbox perspective.\u00A0 Base game makes them feel much more like cargo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*MechJeb: Pretty much an essential mod.\u00A0 Being able to autopilot operations means I can walk away at times (for life reasons), or have an autopilot handle some of the trickier maneuvers I am not good at.\u00A0 Greatly improves my enjoyment of the game and I consider to be essential to my gameplay.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbal Engineer Redux: should really be base functionality.\u003Cbr\u003E\nChatterer: Just makes for a funner, and more immersive game play

though mod support is spotty, so has limited effect.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMagic Smoke Industries Infernal Robotics: Having this type of functionality I really wish was base game.\u00A0 The mod itself I have never had reliable results with and usually ditch it, but having robotic arms (etc), would be a fantastic addition to the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nScience Alert:\u00A0Quality of Life
