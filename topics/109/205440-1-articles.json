And of course, according to our best knowledge on metallic hydrogen, as soon as you release that pressure the hydrogen will return to it\u0027s normal \u0022solid\u0022 state, instead of staying metallic (that part where metallic hydrogen isn\u0027t stable at lower pressures is the whole reason why several people on the forums have very vocal opinions against rocket engines using metallic hydrogen). Anyways, enough about metallic hydrogen, let\u0027s get back on topic of making Minmus be a ball of mostly ice, right where it is in its orbit (both around Kerbin and around Kerbol).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a different idea that would make it easy to have Minmus be icy year-round no matter what. But it\u0027s not about changing anything about Minmus.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe whole Kerbal star system is scaled down roughly 10x from the IRL Earth\u0027s solar system, right? What if it\u0027s ACTUALLY that small, and not just \u0022small for gameplay reasons\u0022?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat would mean that the STAR that Kerbin\u0027s around would have to be smaller, right? Smaller stars that are in their main phase of life (where they\u0027re fusing Hydrogen to Helium) are much \u003Cs\u003Esmaller\u003C/s\u003E (EDIT: Cooler), so that would mean that Kerbol is actually a \u003Cs\u003Esmaller\u003C/s\u003E (EDIT: again, I meant cooler) star than earth\u0027s Sun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat would by default make Kerbol not a G-class star (which is what Earth\u0027s Sun is).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, if Kerbol\u0027s a smaller star, it would be cooler. Not sure where it would land exactly, but it would probably end up as either an M-type star, or even a brown dwarf, either of which are barely sustaining a fusion reaction and therefore are the longest-lived but also COOLEST stars (temperature-wise and output power wise).\u003Cbr\u003E\nPut Kerbin (and therefore Minmus) around a Type-M or Brown Dwarf star, at it\u0027s current orbital altitude, and I\u0027m pretty sure that Minmus being made of ice would have no problem staying icy whatsoever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only problem is that the spectrum of the star isn\u0027t redder than our star, at least according to the eyes and cameras of the Kerbals.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have an explanation for that too. The eyes of the Kerbals are adapted to the output spectrum of the cooler star, so what they think is \u0022white\u0022 light, and what they think is the \u0022visible spectrum\u0022 of light, might not be the same as what we\u0027ve defined to be the \u0022visible spectrum\u0022 of light, since that\u0027s based on OUR HUMAN EYES and not Their \u0022Kerbal\u0022 eyes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause of the cooler emission spectrum of the smaller star, Kerbals would probably be able to see significantly into the Infrared wavelengths, along with the plants also having photosynthetic cell mechanisms that operate on longer-wavelength photons than the reds and yellows and greens (not so much blues) of Earth plants. They might not even have a cone cell type that\u0027s sensitive to what we perceive as \u0022blue\u0022 light (or whatever they use for photo-receptors, who knows, Kerbals have literally nothing biologically in common with Humans).\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically the issue becomes that image data they generate for their own use would be tailored to the colors of light that their eyes are sensitive to, which thanks to evolution would most likely be the light wavelengths that make their way thru Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere the easiest. And if Kerbol isn\u0027t a G-type star, then the range of wavelengths that Kerbal eyes are sensitive to would NOT be the same as the range of wavelengths the Human eye is sensitive to.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for why Kerbin has liquid oceans and Minmus isn\u0027t a melting iceball, well Kerbin might have an atmosphere with a lot more greenhouse gases in it than Earth\u0027s atmosphere, therefore artificially raising the surface temperature to something similar to Earth\u0027s surface temperature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to sum it up, Minmus might be made of ice if Kerbol is in fact a smaller star and the Kerbal eyes are adapted to that spectrum instead of our Sun\u0027s spectrum so Humans and Kerbals don\u0027t agree on what color is what, which is why everything looks fine to us playing KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-11-01T17:53:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2021 05:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-01T19:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy headcanon was that it was salt, hence the terrible taste.
