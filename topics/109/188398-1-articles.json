I did, of course have tons of fun playing KSP, regardless. However, there was always something that I felt was missing to make it feel complete. So to that end, I\u0027ve thought of an interesting Idea to give everyone a sense of urgency, and extra excitement in the game. This is just an idea, and I know not everyone would agree with it, However, It could easily be made optional when starting a new game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 In the original KSP, there\u0027s not much you could do to the base game without messing up the \u0022flow\u0022 of the game, but in KSP2 we know we\u0027re going to be traveling to other star systems.. this gives a unique chance to showcase some other interesting things that perhaps others haven\u0027t thought of.. This could be in the form of \u0022Timed catastrophes\u0022... For instance:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 If we are discovering other star systems in the game, we could find exotic planets (as is planned) and some really cool places to land... But what if one of those planets was in danger of being destroyed?\u00A0 A comet flying around that star system could be set to collide with one of the planets after a set amount of time... The only way to actually get to play on this world (perpetually) would be to actually divert the comet... Now I\u0027m not talking about something tiny.. I\u0027m talking about something a mile across. With the new game engine rebuild, we now have the ability to thrust during timewarp, and thrust on non-focused ships. Hence you could put some ion thrusters on there, and let it do it\u0027s thing to get it moved out of the way of the planet, hence saving a part of the game that you wouldn\u0027t have otherwise, if you simply leave it collide. It could then leave behind something (within the reasonable realms of programming possibility) where the collision took place, that you could do science on. (planetary debris?) This way it\u0027s not a total waste either way.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 This event needs to be set at a reasonable time from the start of the game so we don\u0027t have to go into total panic mode, trying to unlock everything at light speed, but it does stick as a thorn in the back of your mind, and give you something to aim for, other than just collecting science so you can go other places and collect more science, to do the same thing over and over. Just one event like this could really spice up the game, at-least for me. However, if you don\u0027t like the idea of one of your planents blowing up, simply un-tic the box for the comet in your game settings when setting up the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 Something like this would be relatively easy to set up, so I think it should be a thing. We could even have more than one event like this. We could have a super dense one that takes 1,000,000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E to move. (to move this one, you WOULD have to go into panic mode)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 What do you guys think?\u00A0\u00A0 Comments? suggestions?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-22T18:00:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2019 06:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Talavar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kernel Kraken","CreatedById":181383,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-21T15:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is actually a cool idea.

A planetary explosion could literally be used on any planet. You cause a severe light burst, then remove the planet, and leave behind a replacement model that\u0027s basically destroyed. or just a debris field (would have to think on this one)... Anyway, you pay the fee, and from that point on, it\u0027s up to you on what happens.. Sick of Dres always hanging around doing nothing?

I do understand the recalculation of orbits that you\u0027re talking about once the gravity well is gone, but i believe it would be doable, however. This was already accomplished in ksp1 by a mod about 4-5 years ago that I used (which I was going to link but it seems to have been lost in time), except that he didn\u0027t implement an explosion, or a left-over nebulous effect. He just deleted all assets, and the gravity well (i believe he just set gravity to 0 for the rail) on impact, and it was instantaneous There was a small pause during the craft orbit updates, but it was barely noticeable (and I was using an AMD 8800k). If it was implemented now, a preloaded explosion effect would play, and the nebula effect could be preloaded as well, (as were all assets in KSP1) and basically hidden, and simply swapped with the planet when it was time. The gravity well would simply be released or zero\u0027d out. The scope of this is relatively small.. It would be nice to see it done by the team themselves, so it would have a professional look, actually have an effect, and be part of the coding itself. Quite frankly with a whole team, with the small amount involved, this could probably be accomplished in a day or two. (or just one night by one dude with a large pot of coffee.. \u003Cspan\u003E:D)\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 (Edit) I couldn\u0027t find that mod, but I did manage to find another one that accomplished the same thing, only in the form of a bomb that you sent at the planet rather than an asteroid.. Sadly it broke after he \u0022updated\u0022 it a second time, then It seems he lost interest.. lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002295721\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7377110163\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/59128-the-planetbuster-9000/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:212px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-23T08:46:22Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2019 08:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Talavar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
