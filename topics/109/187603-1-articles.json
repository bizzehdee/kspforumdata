ANd if that\u0027s the case, that brings me to my second thought, rovers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the trailer we see a heat shield get ditched by a casing, and it clear has a rover inside, possibly with a skycrane configuration. Is this rover reentry pod going to be stock? And we getting dedicated rover parts in KSP 2? Like we (Sort of) got in KSP 1\u0027s Breaking Ground update?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf we are getting rover parts, that would be awesome to tackle hazardous environments with. Rask and Rusk might need robotic rovers, and possibly more planets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
