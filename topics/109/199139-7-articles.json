Which is kinda why I think the poll is slightly confusing. Its not about \u0022playing this game\u0022at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust like LEGO\u0027s, you can build\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eamazing \u003C/strong\u003Ethings, do\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eamazing things\u003C/strong\u003E, and Kerbal\u0027s themselves are \u0022there to enjoy\u0022. However I see Kerbal\u0027s being in the game for a very specific important \u0022higher purpose\u0022 that your welcome to 100% dismiss and still have a great time.\u00A0\u003Cb\u003EIts their job to act as inspiration for real human achievement thru being relatable.\u00A0\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you focus only on the game, you can see it as a simulator with green little men. Which is totally fine. However if you focus on the game\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eas a messenger\u00A0and platform for STEM\u003C/strong\u003E, you\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Emust\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0have the Kerbals there. The fact the game is fun, the fact Kerbals fail, and flail around and just so happen to stumble in to rocket science is what makes the game endearing. The fact its endearing beyond just purely technical is what puts KSP above other \u0022games\u0022. Its more than a game in many ways. Imagine KSP as-is, except replace Kerbals with generic astro-people. Obviously you want to keep them alive, but they just become cargo. Obviously they are to represent humans going to space, heck they could even\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ebe\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0actual humans going to space. Cool, there\u0027s your space simulator. However, if you see the game as a platform to teach STEM whats better than having your \u0022professionally trained astronaut\u0022 grinning ear to ear as he reaches orbit,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eits that child-like awe inspiring face that everyone should have when being presented with the awesome-ness of space, science and the future.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might not agree, and just want to focus on that simulator part of the game, and that\u0027s totally fine too. The game is made for many, and the Kerbals are there as they are for a bigger purpose. The game can still be fun without them, but then its just another game. This is why the poll doesn\u0027t really capture the right options. They are essential\u00A0because they literally\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eare\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0bigger than the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir story and origins are from a\u00A0kid strapping tin-foil \u0022kerbals\u0022 to house-hold rockets isn\u0027t so there is a \u0022mass payload\u0022.\u00A0 Its so they can represent and inspire people to do great things in the real world for science and for humanity.
