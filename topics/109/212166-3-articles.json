Take any series that was originally meant for kids and teens, but that has a significant adult following. Star Wars, superhero movies, whatever. I would contend that any audience member who says they don\u0027t like some aspect of these series for being \u0022too childish\u0022 or whatever are actually just reacting to the reality that they are no longer the target audiences. They don\u0027t like being reminded that the thing that has meant so much to them is no longer explicitly made for them. It\u0027s just another form of gatekeeping. One brought on by, I think, the embarrassment of being an adult fan of something that\u0027s \u0022too childish\u0022. The feeling of, \u0022Well, I like this thing, and I\u0027m a serious adult, but now this thing makes me feel like a child! But I\u0027m a serious adult who likes serious things, so this thing must be wrong; not me!\u0022 I understand that knee-jerk reflex, but I would 1000% argue that that\u0027s a wrongheaded reaction, and that, by trying to view media through the eyes of people who are not like you, you\u0027ll get to find so much more joy in art.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think part of really, truly growing up is understanding that it\u0027s OK for things to not be made for you.
