Labor law says you can\u0027t get rid of them because they\u0027re injured, so you HAVE to put them somewhere. They wanted to buy Star Theory, Star Theory wasn\u0027t willing to sell on Take-Two\u0027s terms. so they pulled the contract, poached the staff, and got everything they wanted, without having to make any compromises. Assigning a new team to the project wouldn\u0027t have been a viable option, as it would have resulted in lost development time while the new team got up to speed, and it probably would have resulted in a product that was substantially different from what\u0027s currently being worked on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey wanted the company, and that\u0027s essentially what they got, because a company is nothing, without staff.

(Which is the 2nd biggest goal of any company.) There can be other circumstances that we don\u0027t know about to why these people left Star Theory.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStar Theory was forced to close their business after not being able to find new contract to work under, or sell a new idea for development.

If you look at certain wordings in the article, it is clear that Schreier approached the story from a \u0022poor indie guys, they didn\u0027t deserve that\u0022 mindset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe article begins:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne Friday evening last December, employees of game designer Star Theory Games each received the same unusual recruitment message over LinkedIn.

All of the employees? Or just the few that Schreier was able to talk to? Look at the rest of the article, most of the comments are from former Star Theory employees. Of course they are not happy with how things turned out, who would be? This is now their bias coming through in their comments, understandably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there are other wordings like \u0022It was strange and disconcerting news...\u0022 or \u0022cutthroat standards of the business\u0022 or \u0022extreme tactics\u0022. This makes it clear to me that the article is not intended as a mere report of the things that happened, but Schreier wants to tell a story. The story of a small indie studio eviscerated by big corporate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide note: when I started as a journalist, I was mostly criticized for my writing style by my colleagues and bosses, not my fact checking or objectivity. Sometimes entire paragraphs were re-written by them to make them \u0022prettier\u0022 or \u0022more exciting\u0022 to read, at one point even completely distorting the meaning of an article at which point I protested and retracted my name from that piece.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe view inside Star Theory was that development on Kerbal Space Program 2 was proceeding smoothly, according to the people who worked on the project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, who said that?

What was their measure of \u0022proceeding smoothly\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this does not come accross as me trying to discredit Schreier. Far from it, I applaud him getting that much information out of the events that transpired. I myself tried to find out more about the dealings that led to the transition from Star Theory to Intercept but hit many brick walls on that end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, and this relates to EVERY type of media, be it an article, a news broadcast or yes, also my youtube videos, every type of media is produced with at least some type of bias. There is no objective truth in media. The only thing you as a journalist/reporter can do is to try to be as objective as you can, get as many facts as possible and have the guts to accept facts that are not in line with your own confirmation bias. The latter part has become a huge problem in media general over the past 10 years, by the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on the information available to him, I do believe Schreier wrote the best article possible, but with a certain picture he wanted to paint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, to my own bias.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am over 40 and have lived through 4 to 5 takeovers in my line of work. Some friendly, some hostile. In neither case was the transition completely smooth. And in every case there were things that happened that left a sour taste in my mouth. Especially the first one, that was brutal. There were shouting matches, tears, thrown objects, almost fistfights, livelihoods destroyed. During another transition, the new bosses fired a pregnant woman, which is illegal where I live. They then retracted their decision for fear of litigation and payed her a hefty amount of money so she would leave on her own and stay silent. What happened to ST sounds like a walk in the park compared to that.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLoyalty in business doesn\u0027t mean much, to be honest. That\u0027s why there are contracts.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had people claiming \u0022I\u0027ll stick it to the new bosses\u0022 or \u0022when they do this or that I\u0027ll leave, that will show them\u0022 just to have them stick around for a few years more after realizing that other companies wouldn\u0027t treat them any better but probably would pay them less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I really want this game to succeed. Does that cloud my judgement? Maybe. I like to think I am old and jaded enough that stories like the current one don\u0027t faze me anymore and that that is the reason why I can stay so calm in the face of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-04T06:25:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2020 06:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by ShadowZone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"decimal-simplex","CreatedById":76184,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-04T07:06:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are absolutely appalling and unethical business practices on display here.

As far as I know, the devs are not jobless, they work for a Take-2 subsidiary. So livelihoods were not destroyed. I will get my game by Fall 2021, and if it\u0027s not as good as promised, or has exploitative \u0027surprise mechanics\u0027 then I wont buy it,simple as that. As customers, what is it exactly that we lost?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But-But the devs will be subject to inhumane working conditions..\u0022 Do you think Star Theory was a utopia where every body held hands and sang \u0027Kumbaya\u0027 around a camp fire? No, Star Theory\u0027s bosses would have overworked their employees to meet targets.

KSP 1.3 was probably the last \u0027free\u0027 KSP version that we had the fortune to enjoy. But, you are upset that your passion is seen as a money making scheme by a multi-billion dollar company? Yeah, they are business men. Greed is their nature. Can you hate a poisonous snake for biting you wen you touch it in it\u0027s burrow?

Yeah, what would have been a \u0027Buy at release\u0027 would now be a \u0027Buy after reviews\u0027. Most of the devs still have\u00A0 a job. \u003Cu\u003ETake-two made an unethical move, and it\u0027s an unethical move no matter what the apologists say\u003C/u\u003E.
