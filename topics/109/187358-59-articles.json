You\u0027re going to have a few relatively small places with rich deposits that everyone will tend to cram around, and because you don\u0027t want the server to automatically delete things most of it is just going to be abandoned half-hearted starts by casual players who might not even play the game anymore. Maybe thats not a big deal on Gurdamma, but with thousands of players over time you\u0027re going to have hundreds of bases glommed around the best spots on Minmus, and 80-100k up around equatorial orbit is going to be a floating trash heap. There could be 5-10 thousand spent stages and abandoned half-built stations in that area alone. Even if they aren\u0027t collision hazards I don\u0027t really want to have that stuff all floating around while Im trying to dock.

As t_v and I discussed at some length there are some significant problems that are created by having different players exist in their own isolated time-bubbles and then collapsing them willy-nilly. Objects no longer behave in a fashion consistent with real physics as viewed by all players. Ideally when a player time-warps they should see every object in map view--planets, moons, all of their vessels and all \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E players vessels--all move naturally through their orbits and not pop in and out of existence. That\u0027s what makes gravity assists and intercepting things in transit and coordinating deliveries possible. If I set up a delivery route from my base on Minmus to a friend\u0027s base on Duna the process of that transfer should look the same and take the same amount of in-game time for both of us. Otherwise I could tell a player \u0022hey I\u0027ll deliver 1-zillion uranium\u0022 and then time-warp a decade or two and they\u0027d have it all show up at their base instantly. You can have a space race in player time, but you can\u0027t really have a space-race in \u003Cem\u003Ein-game\u003C/em\u003E time because everyone\u0027s in-game time is different. Its important to understand that the solar system is a clock-work like place, and vessels are a part of it.

Visually, when someone changes something, that change doesn\u2019t show up for you because it would be inconsistent with your reality (a ship that was orbiting Kerbin 5 minutes ago shouldn\u2019t be at Duna, right?) and so it is hidden away from you, until you warp forwards and you enter a shared reality, without any inconsistent jumps. Everybody sees things at different positions, but those positions match up exactly occasionally, when someone catches up to someone else. Vessels do pop in and out of existence in reality, but you don\u0027t see that, you see the ship go gray until you warp and see the ship pop back into existence, but in the exact same spot as you were expecting it to be at that time, so there are no spatial jumps.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224200039\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221668728900\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsignificant problems\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still think that the problems are much more minimal than previously observed, at least on the orbital mechanics side, but the extent to which these things mess up has probably been evaluated in play testing. The point is that these problems exist, and can\u0027t really be resolved under this system. Resource problems are a whole new can of worms. You can take the Local Bubble approach and stop people from transferring resources when it would cause a problem, or you can once again have the issues of future ships with more resources interacting with earlier ships.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I had a few questions about the leapfrog model which I think point out a few points of inconsistency. Here are a few hypotheticals; how would you deal with these? These problems are exacerbated with larger time differences, but they still exist with small time differences.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayer A has a station in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E in year 100, that has been around for a while and people have had the chance to see it. Currently, the last interaction was in year 100. Where does player B, who is in year 101, see that station? Do they see it, or does it disappear once player B warps past the point where Player A is?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, Player A then uses a tug to move that station into GKO. For a few minutes, that station is not able to be interacted with, but ignoring that, where does Player B see the station, from their vantage point in the future? Does it jump to the GKO orbit, adjusted for the time difference? Or was it hidden all along, so there\u0027s no harm? To be clear, hiding the station poses a problem, which is that the player that is the farthest ahead in time is effectively alone and the only way to leave that state is to wait for other players to warp ahead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, Player B has resource routes feeding their colony that pass through Player A\u0027s base. None have triggered since year 100, but now the station is in a different spot. When the next window happens, does the route just break? Or if it doesn\u0027t, what does Player B see?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourth, Player A is sending the tug over to the station. The same route system is set up but is more frequent, so the last supply mission passing through was after Player A\u0027s time. Player A cannot access their station due to interaction rules so there is no risk of it changing orbit, but now they cannot dock their tug. How would this be resolved, simply making Player A warp to Player B\u0027s time? This becomes a big problem when players set up supply routes between colonies, as entire sections of critical infrastructure could get blocked off when someone goes into the future.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, assuming that Player B in the future can see the new position of player A\u0027s station (as it is in the future), what happens when player A launches a new supply run feeding the station from the Mun? At the start, player A\u0027s trajectory is suborbital, so from player B\u0027s perspective it has already crashed into the ground and disappeared. But once in LMO, player A leaves the mission for a moment to deal with an aerobrake somewhere else. Does player B see the new craft in its orbit? What are the rules for how long something needs to be present for it to project into the future?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zaffre","CreatedById":211990,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-18T01:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad to know that competitive \u003Cem\u003Eand \u003C/em\u003Ecooperative modes are coming.
