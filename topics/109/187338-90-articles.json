It depends on how you look at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this might not be how it works in ACTUAL KSP 2, but let\u0027s just say for example that it works like in KSP 1, with each part having one config file.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom that, you can easily figure out \u0022how many parts are in the game\u0022 by counting the number of config files that are parts that are included with the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd because procedural parts are adjustable parts but you only need one config file to represent them, you \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E end up with a game that has enough parts to allow the same amount of creativity in designing your creations, but uses LESS config files (and therefore \u0022less parts\u0022) to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, from another angle each procedural part can be said to contain many parts \u0022inside\u0022 it because it\u0027s adjustable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis definition is still entirely valid, but I find it less useful than the first definition because if you can just type in \u0022nearly any number\u0022 into each of the various adjustable parameters for the part, you end up with a functionally infinite (aka \u0022big enough that just saying infinite doesn\u0027t change the answer enough to make a difference\u0022) number of parts even if you have just a single procedural part in the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, they\u0027ll probably put limits on just how big of a number you can put in those boxes, and might also put limits on just how small of a change you can make to each value, just so that they don\u0027t have to use 64 bit signed floating point numbers to represent the shape of a procedural part because really the difference between 0.001mm and 0.1mm being the smallest change you can make to a part won\u0027t make or break the design of any large craft, and if you really need a wing that is 100m long you can probably make it out of several 10m long sections without angering the physics engine that much. And within those limits, you can make pretty much any shape or size part you desire or have need of, suited (or not) entirely to the task at hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you want my opinion on if there are going to be more or less parts in the game, going by the \u00221 part = 1 config file defining a part, even if it\u0027s a procedural part\u0022 definition, well here it is:\u003Cbr\u003E\nShort answer:\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have no idea! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLonger answer:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u0027s a lot of changes coming to KSP 2, some of them add parts, some of them take away parts, but I think that overall we\u0027ll have a \u0022more complete\u0022 list of parts, even if the overall number of different parts is smaller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDetails:\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think we\u0027ll lose a lot of parts that we currently have in KSP 1:\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe\u0027ve seen in the latest trailer that we\u0027re probably only going to have a limited number of different wing panel and aerodynamic control surface parts to choose from, but they\u0027ll be procedural (effectively more parts, but less \u0022config files for parts\u0022).\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe also know that we\u0027re getting procedural radiators, but I haven\u0027t seen any data that shows if the KSP 1 non-procedural, sun-tracking (orients to edge-on to the sun), deployable radiators will still be in the game, or if those too will indeed become procedural.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty certain that we\u0027ll also be getting procedural fixed solar panels, because well that\u0027s just low-hanging fruit if you already have a framework for making procedural flat parts like wings and radiators, but again we might also be getting solar panel parts that are procedural in more ways, like being able to choose if they can be deployed, retracted, track the sun, or have a cover to shield them from aerodynamic forces while retracted (likely only a few different kinds of solar panels in any case, with procedural options filling out the areas \u0022in-between\u0022 the default options).\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe do also know that we\u0027re going to be getting fuel tanks that are 7.5m or larger, which would be new parts even if they\u0027re procedural in length.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIIRC (but I forget where I saw it), we\u0027re going to be losing some parts that are dedicated to having only a single resource in them, because now we\u0027ll be able to choose the contents of fuel tanks when in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (and maybe after, but that\u0027s something a mod will take care of if it\u0027s not in the vanilla game on day 1 or \u0022eventually\u0022). So the \u0022liquid fuel\u0022 and \u0022Rocket fuel\u0022 fuselages for 1.25m, mk2, and mk3 form factors will be unified into one line of \u0022generic fuel tanks\u0022 that will have options to set what\u0027s actually in them. This might also get rid of many of the monopropellant tanks, tho I\u0027m not sure of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I also think we\u0027ll GAIN a lot of parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen at least a few \u0022new-looking\u0022 crew capsule parts in the various feature videos that have been released for KSP 2, so that\u0027s more new parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think that they will be filling at least some of the gaps in KSP 1\u0027s parts offerings.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThose gaps in KSP 1\u0027s parts list include:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no good \u0022booster\u0022 type engine that fits a 0.625m diameter fuel tank (the Spark is more a \u0022mid-stage\u0022 engine, as it has \u0022okay\u0022 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E at both sea level and vacuum, and middling thrust, I want a BOOSTER engine that\u0027s heavier (maybe 0.375t), has higher thrust (maybe 40-50kN), as well as higher ASL \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E but lower Vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E. Such an engine might also make a good option when clustered on a 1.25m diameter low-mass booster stage that you\u0027d otherwise have to put a full Swivel engine on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s only the one length of 0.625m \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel tank (the Oscar-B), there should be a whole range of lengths that preserves the Oscar-B\u0027s excellent ratio of fuel amount to physical size (lengths should range from 1x Oscar-B to 8x or 16x Oscar-B, making the 0.625m diameter finally usable for tiny launch vehicles without turning into a wobbly noodle rocket).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d really like more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster options that use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E instead of monopropellant, my large upper stages that dock things and then de-orbit themselves really could do with having lower part count instead of having over 12 Vernors just to get full 3-axis control in both translation and rotation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that the idea of an engine that responds to the main throttle that uses Monopropellant should be expanded on, the Puff is plenty good but I\u0027d love a version I can put on a 0.625m stack, as well as versions that have good ASL \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, as well as lower thrust versions intended for probes (IRL plenty of satellites use \u0022monoprop\u0022 aka Hydrazine for both \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and main propulsion).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is only the one Ion engine, and there is only the one NTR engine (I know that KSP 2 is adding at least one more NTR engine, thankfully).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere should be a higher efficiency option for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters available, likely this means some form of quick-responding Electric propulsion thruster miniaturized into a series of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E parts (both linear ports and many configurations of multi-port blocks).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilding on the 3 points above this one, I think there should be an entry-level electric propulsion option (as in you unlock it BEFORE the xenon ion engine).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis would be a Resistojet or Arcjet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nInitially, such a thruster would pass Monopropellant thru either a heating element or an electric arc in order to generate a jet of hot gas to be ejected out an exhaust nozzle.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf it wasn\u0027t already obvious, the laws of physics that dictate how rocket engines means that resistojet thrusters must have a lower vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E than Arcjet thrusters, because the propellant that is passed thru a Resistojet does not reach as high of a temperature as that passed thru an Arcjet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of the higher efficiency \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster options I was thinking of in the point above this one is Resistojet or Arcjet \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E parts, the advantage that these would have over say a small Xenon Ion engine re-purposed as an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E port or block would be that Arcjets and Resistojets are very versatile when it comes to what propellant they are willing to work with, so with these arcjet/resistojet \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E parts (and the associated engines which respond to the main throttle), you should eventually be able to unlock the ability to use them with other propellants instead of Monopropellant, such as Methane (aka KSP 1\u0027s Liquid Fuel), Hydrogen (good for vessels using NTR engines), Xenon (in a pinch, and this might be the way that the Kerbals discover that Xenon makes a good ion engine fuel), and even Atmospheric gases (assuming the presence of a related intake device more usually used for air-breathing engines, this last option would make it possible to build jet powered \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E craft that don\u0027t have to carry around Monopropellant unless they also visit the vacuum of space).\u003Cbr\u003E\nIdeally (because Arcjets and Resistojets are SO versatile), you\u0027d be able to choose which propellant to use in-flight without needing an Engineer to go EVA and actually change the plumbing, because it should be as simple as having more than one propellant supplied to the appropriate thruster or engine. Now that I\u0027m thinking of it, provided a steady supply of electricity such \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters and engines would also make ideal propulsion for a craft that relies on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, because there\u0027s gotta be SOMETHING in those rocks that you can refine and push out a rocket nozzle, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, you know what a good way to push around an asteroid is? Sorry, this isn\u0027t a DART reference, instead I\u0027m advocating for a Mass Driver part, that would take any mined resource and eject it at great speed in a very specific direction, in order to create thrust. This doesn\u0027t have to create a lot of thrust, or be particularly high specific impulse, but either or both of those things would be very welcome. It would however probably have to take a lot of power. And this would be a great way to do two things. I\u0027ve already mentioned the use of a mass driver for propulsion, but there\u0027s more things you can do with this. You can throw rocks into high suborbital trajectories. If you put tiny rockets on those rocks, you can get them all the way into a stable orbit, for later collection by vessels that service an orbital station. From there, that station can make use of those raw materials, which means you can put the refinery in orbit instead of on the surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust like using a mass driver for propulsion, it would take a lot of power, so it\u0027s probably best suited to use in a Colonization and Resource Gathering context, so maybe it isn\u0027t in KSP 2 on day 1. But I\u0027d love to see it in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to parts that KSP 1 doesn\u0027t have that I think should be in the list of parts that KSP 2 has:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are literally zero \u0022single-part\u0022 solutions for engines that fit a fuel tank diameter of 5m or larger, and we know we\u0027re getting at least 7.5m diameter fuel tanks (and probably larger) so that\u0027s a gap that needs filling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no \u0022low profile landing engine\u0022 similar to the Poodle but built for a main body diameter of 3.75m (or 5m and above but that stems from the above point).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are no SRBs that have thrust vectoring that are of a diameter smaller than 2.5m (the Kickback should have it at least).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpeaking of SRBs, there are no SRBs larger than 2.5m, and there are no SRBs that are optimized for use in a vacuum by the presence of a larger exhaust nozzle to improve vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow on to the tiniest of the SRBs that are in KSP 1, the Sepratron.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe need more options for separating spent stages from our main launch stage:\u003Cbr\u003E\nA nose-cone that incorporates a Sepratron-like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E (available in many diameters as well as perhaps Mk2 and Mk3 fuselage nose cone form factors).\u003Cbr\u003E\nA Sepratron-like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E that mounts in-line but fires out the side to help push away the bottom of spent liquid-fueled booster stages (or creative people could use them as the final braking rockets for a lander that has parachutes for landing something on its side but doesn\u0027t quite have enough parachutes to slow down to a safe landing velocity, sort of like how the Soyuz capsule works IRL).\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d love to see Radial and In-line decouplers that have built in sepratron-type separation SRBs, because that saves even more parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the reason that I barely ever put the separation and ullage thrusters on my KSP launch vehicles is for one reason, and one reason only: I want to minimize the number of parts I use on the launcher, because that means I can use more parts on the payload (or just have a less laggy rocket overall).\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t matter how much optimization they do, more parts will always and forever mean more lag and a lower framerate, and vice versa less parts will always and forever mean less lag and a higher framerate, assuming you have the same computer parts for both sides of that test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA procedural airbrake would be a nice part to have, I guess it would replace the existing airbrake (or there could be more shapes of airbrake available).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would also be nice to have Grid Fins available as a type of toggleable control surface (as in they would fold out from the craft like on the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, or alternately be able to be fixed in place (and largely ignored by the aerodynamics simulation) as they will be doing on Starship\u0027s SuperHeavy booster stage).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso would be nice to have Starship type control surfaces available, that way we could make craft that do a similar \u0022belly flop and flip\u0022 type EDL sequence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah and if I can ask for the moon and have a chance of getting it, a type of \u0022landing gear\u0022 that I\u0027d love to see is Airbags (complete with the bouncy-castle in a breeze like \u0022bounding over the surface of the planet or moon\u0022 type final part of the EDL sequence, like what happened with Spirit and Opportunity, and Sojourner before that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrFancyPL","CreatedById":94843,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-25T19:59:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224189971\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187338\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666586294\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179192\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Serenity\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/24/2022 at 6:38 AM, Serenity said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverytime they add a major feature there will have to be a cycle of optimizing it and then breaking it again until the completion of the next feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEhh, where I know it form?
