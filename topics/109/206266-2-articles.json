Personally, I would be fine if things had to be preprogrammed, but I know a lot of people who would be turned off by the difficulty of creating a working landing script. This is not a problem that can really be circumvented, because there isn\u0027t really a way to make the coding system both highly customizable and easy to use. More inputs, outputs and math abilities adds more complexity and having a magic \u0022land this thing\u0022 function destroys the whole point of the system. KSP 2 is not going to compromise on the physics, but is going to try to let people experience that physics with as much ease as possible, which means that the average person who has little interest in even simple coding should be able to play the game and not miss out on major parts of it, such as probes.

Of course we want to bring kerbals along on missions, but we don\u2019t necessarily want to bring kerbals along on \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E mission. Both crewed and uncrewed missions should have their place, and we shouldn\u2019t need to write a script and just fold our hands on our heads and watch for one or the other. As a toggle? Sure why not, but adding a scripting language isn\u2019t trivial either (fun as it would to use) and Id be happier to see it as an expansion or mod.

Depending on the mission type, you may or may not need a Kerbal present. You should have the same control whether or not a Kerbal is present. The argument is about a rather trivial point. As I have said before, KSP is a game, not a true simulator. So annoyances like signal delay can be ignored and you still have the same game play. If you want harder game play, use either self imposed restrictions or a mod that makes things harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically at a certain point, Intercept has to have a cutoff on options.

Signal delay applies to data transmission only, not to craft control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for instance, if you want to send a craft out to Jool to gain science, you\u0027re going to have to wait maybe an hour or two for science data transmitted from Jool to get to Kerbin in order to be able to use it to unlock things or advance the game in some other way. (All time delays are \u0022I didn\u0027t do the math\u0022 AKA pure guesses with not much thought given to figuring them out by math and then scaling them to the size of the Kerbal solar system).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn low Kerbin orbit, the delay is entirely absent, because it would be so small as to not make a practical difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeosynchronous Kerbin Orbit, the delay would be on the order of a second or two.

Since we\u0027re making a point of NOT applying delays to command signals, this delay still makes effectively not a lot of difference, if you went back to the tracking station immediately after transmitting some science data from Minmus you\u0027ll just have to wait like 30s in the tracking station for it to show up to be able to be used to unlock things, if we\u0027re even doing that with KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna, the delay becomes somewhat tiresome to just time-warp thru, it takes a few minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDres, maybe half an hour to an hour.

However, the option to have probes (or manned vessels with probe cores) execute commands on a schedule should still be included (tho NEVER MANDATORY) because sometimes you have too many craft arriving at a planetary body all at once and your attention ends up suboptimally divided between all of them in order to get them all to capture into an orbit around that body. This most often happens to me when sending missions to explore Jool or Duna, because I send a Science mothership, a Refueling lander, and a Science lander to work with the mothership, all on their own transfer vehicles, and the way that ends up working for me is that usually they all arrive within like 10 minutes of each other, and that means that I have to be really fast at switching which vessel I\u0027m piloting in order to avoid having one or more of them sail off into deep space because I was busy executing the capture burn of another vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EnderKid2","CreatedById":145622,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-15T17:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can warp fast enough that days take a fraction of a second, and probably will have even higher levels of warp to handle the years required to travel between systems, Waiting an hour isn\u0027t an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-20T16:02:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Waiting an hour isn\u0027t an issue\u0022 Well obviously, but that\u0027s the whole point of how I designed that post.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy method gives people who want realism in their communications something to chew on, while not being a significant detriment to the actual gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember, we\u0027re trying to make it so it doesn\u0027t drive new players away, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack on the subject of communications networks, it would be super nice if the game was capable of handling well over 1000 orbiting vessels (on rails not firing any thrusters) at any one time, because we\u0027re going to need a lot of communications relay satellites to get full coverage of all the planets (take how many planets and moons there are in the game, multiply by 3, and then add one more for each major planet in the game, that\u0027s how many communications relay satellites I personally would need).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I need so many satellites is that I will not accept partial coverage, so I use 3 small relay satellites around each planet or moon, and then around each major planet I additionally put a large relay in a highly inclined high orbit that can push the signal all the way back to Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat adds up to something close to 100 satellites, and that\u0027s just for the Kerbol system.
