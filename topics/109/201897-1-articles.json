I think KSP stands distinct enough that it will make roughly the same kind of sales regardless of whether it comes out in the summer or winter. So if they\u0027ll think they need more polish time, I don\u0027t think anyone in PD/T2 will object to a late November to early December release. Again, I don\u0027t think they see it as ideal scenario, and I\u0027m sure late summer to early fall is the target, but if it slips, it slips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if it slips past holiday, then they\u0027ll probably want to delay it longer and we might see a spring \u002723 release. Very much not ideal, but nobody wants to release in January/Februrary, unless the game is a total flop, and you\u0027re just trying to make some money on people suffering from contend draught and ready to play anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed, the only reason I believe the holiday season is very unlikely is because it seems to have never been a option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Minmus Taster","CreatedById":206159,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-04T22:27:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it will happen midway through2022, just over a year from now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometime in late spring early summer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
