From Shana\u0027s explanation about topology and game design (around min 6:30) it sounds like the basic structure of biomes, experiments, and gathering science to unlock parts will probably be carried into KSP2, with added emphasis on tying these biomes to interesting and unique geological spaces, which sounds great. This is echoed a bit by Tom\u0027s mention of \u0027goodies\u0027 to be found in Dres\u0027 equatorial mountain range (could be \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E goodies as well). I know it\u0027s been a somewhat controversial topic in KSP but Im personally pretty happy to see science continue to be important to exploration and development. At the same time I think a lot of people would agree science in KSP1 had some big issues, primarily clickiness and grind, that would need to be resolved. There were also some issues with the structure of the tech tree itself. There\u0027s also the factor of KSP2\u0027s vastly expanded scope both in terms of planets and new technologies that would need to be taken into account.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor feedback I thought we could talk about the pros and cons of science in KSP1 and ideas for how KSP2 could make something great out of it. In all likelihood they\u0027ve already got a pretty strong feeling about it but its fun to speculate. First off I think there are subtle but important pros to the biomes \u002B point-buy system: it\u0027s an open way to reward players for visiting new places and gives them the flexibility to develop as they choose. You\u0027re not tied down to a linear set of tasks to get the parts you need. Whether you go land on Minmus first or orbit the Mun or do a sub-orbital mission to Kerbin\u0027s poles you\u0027re still making progress. I also just like it conceptually, that science and doing experiments and discovering new places are critical to actual gameplay. A lot of people have proposed radically different solutions to the science system but few that I\u0027ve seen seem to achieve these pros while making the game more fun.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen, sadly, there are the cons. The most common complaint I see is a general sense of grind, but there are a lot of sources for this feeling. Right off the bat there\u0027s gameplay and UI issues. The way the experiments and biomes are structured players are begged to right-click several very small parts, sometimes hidden inside service bays, and then individually dismiss half a dozen readout screens, often in mid-flight. It\u0027s a huge distraction and even when hot-keyed and becomes tedious really quickly. The second problem is a pacing problem caused by the shear volume of science and potential experiment repeats. Besides asking players to manually conduct science while landing and taking off it encourages a huge number of repeat missions in KSOI leading to a near complete tech-tree before their first interplanetary mission. Then there\u0027s the tech tree itself, which is a mess, and a host of other minor issues with science labs, balance, lack of mapping, etc.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGiven all that I do think it\u0027s salvageable and with some work could be really fun and great.

My major turn of for the KSP1 science system was how much it felt like fetch quests, rather than actually doing science.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy dream for that game was to have more things which you\u0027d actually get data from, values which change per location, stuff you could plot, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other problem was how much it was linked to scoring simple points, rather than science for the sake of science.

KSP 1 play throughs with a lab unlocked will end as soon as a trip to duna brings back its first haul of data, and even sooner if players revisit the mun or minmus. Ideally in a play through, I would like to have to visit the jool system at least once before finishing science progression. With the expanded KSP 2 tech tree I\u2019m sure that players will have to go to more places to finish the tree, but it could potentially be completed by the end of the first interstellar voyage, depending on scaling.

Essentially, each planet can offer science but the tech tree is broken into sections so that you can\u2019t rush to endgame content prematurely. For example, gas giant science would be good for advancing ion/plasma propulsion. Kerbin would allow you to unlock initial technologies in every field, and gas giant planets further in progression allow more advanced technology in ion propulsion. To avoid the chore of going back to an easy destination to get the science that you didn\u2019t collect during that phase of progression, going to a late-game planet will give you the science to fill that branch of science in.

Unlike most people who are assuming that Intercept is just going to copy verbatim what Squad did with the career and science modes.

You should have to have it sampling whatever it monitors for a while before it returns some amount of science points. Running the experiment should require both some (small) amount of power, as well as either an Experiment Storage part on the craft, or a communications link TO a craft that has an experiment storage part (to act as a \u0022store and forward\u0022 type relay satellite), or ideally a communications link directly back to Kerbin (potentially thru more conventional \u0022direct radio relay\u0022 satellites).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe science lab would no longer operate with samples collected directly from the environment.

Either way, you\u0027d need to then transmit the results back to Kerbin to get the actual science points out of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFurthermore, as you send more non-lab science experiment data back to Kerbin, you\u0027d automatically unlock more advanced experiments for the science lab that would have greater science point returns.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHopefully this would both keep the science lab useful throughout the progression of the game, as well as not make it \u0022too good for a tiny expenditure of effort\u0022 like it is currently.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, turning the science lab back into a different kind of experiment makes it no longer worthwhile for a vessel to have more than one science lab unless it\u0027s running more than one kind of experiment at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-04T01:47:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224050620\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205479\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221635944558\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113880-shdwlrd/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022113880\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113880-shdwlrd/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@shdwlrd\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Sorry, man.

KSP is currently lacking a lot of useful information players would want like altitude and slope maps, biome maps, etc. and using orbital scanners would be an excellent way to deliver those. It also seems like the prospecting process will be more complex so using experiments to locate resources and determine concentrations could be really seamless. Determining atmospheric height and density and radiation levels could also be important, along with predicting whether you\u0027re going to overheat on a given re-entry profile or optimize radiators for local heat dissipation. The important thing is that the information isn\u0027t just flavor text, it\u0027s actually useful for navigating space and playing the game. I would personally tailor the slate of experiments to answer these specific questions so each experiment felt vital. The question remains though--are these experiments also providing science points that can be applied to research? Like are there places with pure scientific data? Unique geological features or signs of life?

Lets say these categories are observational, physical/practical, and theoretical sciences. Observational science is like using ScanSat to start filling in the blanks with new planets. Physical/practical science you have to go to some place and get a sample, or use a new experiential part for some time to help unlock for future use. (The Kerbals don\u0027t seem like the type to test a new piece of equipment for decades before actually using it.) Theoretical science is used to gatekeep advanced technologies and to help fully unlock experimental parts for common use. (Much like how aircraft manufacturers are continuously looking at and testing new designs to increase efficiency.)

Im not so sure we need ALL experiments to be available from the start, just for them to appear shortly before we need them. You\u0027ll notice I\u0027ve dispensed with a lot of existing reports that gobble up player time and don\u0027t produce valuable information, while adding some for advanced prospecting, altimetry, and aerobrake prediction. Some of these could also unlock predictive modeling on new bodies\u00A0 in the simulator mode they\u0027ve shown previously. The main thing here is to disincentivize endless biome-hopping and repeat missions, and to push players to reach beyond KSOI earlier.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome key ideas to start off:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Make most experiments passive (on by default with low ec draw) always pay out 100%, and be applicable in fewer situations. For instance the thermometer provides a steady service (revealing heat bars) and automatically produces data once per biome. No manual clicking. Others would pay out as a percentage of a total scan like the barometer and orbital scanners. Orbital scanners should also work like SCANsat by passing over the surface ideally in polar orbits at optimum altitudes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Take experiments out of the tech tree and tie them to Boom event rewards, possibly along with building upgrades. In the example below we\u0027d say Tier 1 is available from the start, Tier 2 unlocks on your first Munar/Minmar landing, Tier 3 on your first interplanetary landing, etc. along with lots of other parts held behind Boom event gates. That way there would be no reason to tediously farm science around KSOI, and you\u0027d be highly encouraged to get out and land on Duna or Moho as early as you could.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Let science deplete across an entire body based on collection. Once you have complete orbital scans and 3-4 surface samples it should be effectively mined out. The way to game this would be to make some biomes more scientifically valuable than others, so you\u0027d want to land in 3 or 4 diverse locations to get your max value but not feel inclined to biome hop to every one. This could also be increased by discovering anomalies with their own inherent science value.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) Clean up the UI/UX as it relates to data vs science and the science lab mechanic. Most experiments should transmit automatically, but they should still take time to analyze at the R\u002BD facility on Kerbin. The best way to increase this research rate would be to employ off-world science labs that could convert data into usable Science that could be spent on parts. As you expand and build more colonies with more and bigger science labs this processing rate could be further increased.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n5) Make anomalies into their own little Boom events with special rewards and tailor them towards interesting geological formations and the search for life. There could be lots of associated perks like better resource scanning, increased \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E extraction and processing, better radiation shielding or LS efficiency, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0027s a stab at a slate of experiments to make all that happen:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTier 1: First few launches to first Munar/Minmar landing and return\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThermometer \u003C/strong\u003E(passive): Determines temperature in each biome and enables heat-bars on parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBarometer\u003C/strong\u003E (passive): After passing through the air column shows atmospheric height and density.
