Bugs are a valuable source of food for humans in space and (as a university student conducting research on the topic) I think that we should\u00A0be eating a lot more insects in the future. It would be wonderful if KSP2 would show Kerbals to have not just a completely vegan diet, but an insectitarian diet too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, in real life insects are major pollinators of plants and they are great decomposers of soil, their byproducts act as an amazing fertilizer and the indigestible chitin from their exoskeletons can be extracted and processed into chitosan, a building material. I think that Kerbals should have similar bug-like creatures to accompany them on their space adventures, so that KSP players can learn what insects can provide us in real life space exploration!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-24T19:49:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2020 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by cubinator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"probe137","CreatedById":207436,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-24T22:56:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems like a great idea!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"starcaptain","CreatedById":166799,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-24T23:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore food for the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Econtent creators\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0flavortext at\u00A0once!
