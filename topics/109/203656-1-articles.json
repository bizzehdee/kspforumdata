Im so used to gently coasting around the solar system in graceful ellipses its going to be quite a thing to learn brachistochrone trajectories and efficient solar escapes. There\u0027s a lot we don\u0027t know yet, and things that I just don\u0027t know about the reality of interstellar travel. Here are a few questions I have. We\u0027ll probably have to wait till near release to find out most of these but I thought I\u0027d throw them out there to for us to think about.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) How many star systems will be available? And just how far away will they be? At KSP\u0027s 1/10 scale that would still put Alpha Centauri at .43 ly, or 400 billion kilometers. Compared to Jool at 72 million km thats a loooong way. It also seems like any in-game nearby star should have at least a couple of planets to make it worth visiting, which isn\u0027t too outlandish. Proxima Centauri, Wolf 359, and Lalande 21185 each have two confirmed exoplanets, Tau Ceti and Luyten\u0027s Star have 4, and HD 219134 has 6.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) What kind of max acceleration do we think these crazy sci-fi engines will be capable of? I recall that a ship accelerating at 1g would reach nearly the speed of light in about a year and could reach Alpha Centauri within 6. That sounds kind of absurd though and I haven\u0027t seen any near-futurish proposals that approach those speeds. Project Daedalus was designed to reach 12% the speed of light over a little less than 3 years and perform a flyby of Bernards Star in about 50 years, and Longshot and some beamed energy proposals I\u0027ve seen range from 40 to 150 years to orbit nearby stars. At 1/10th scale those kinds of speeds sound more reasonable. And it would be a little easier to excuse omitting relativistic time dilation.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) What are some other implications for interstellar travel? Will other stars have meaningful relative motion that we\u0027ll need to account for? Bernards star is moving at about 90 km/s and Alpha Centauri is moving at about 24 km/s relative to the sun, but that might also be scaled down by a factor of 10? or omitted for simplicity? Something I don\u0027t even\u00A0know is if the sun\u0027s bow shock is dangerous at all radiation-wise?\u00A0 If there are binary stars how will that effect orbital navigation? And of course this doesn\u0027t begin to consider all the wacky new planets they might have planned.\u00A0 Will there be a discovery mechanic that unlocks them\u00A0\u00A0when you reach a certain technological level and tells you a little about what to expect so you can plan your grand colonization projects? Or will you want to send fly-by probes first?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyone else been thinking about this?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-06T21:30:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2021 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dientus","CreatedById":209823,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-07T02:52:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224000693\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203656\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221625603727\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill other stars have meaningful relative motion that we\u0027ll need to account for?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis.

If we were to imagine that Eeloo\u0027s orbit is caused entirely by some external source, then it has to come close to Eeeloo\u0027s apoapsis, which is actually not all that far out. If some mysterious planet X is lurking far away from Kerbol, surely, it\u0027d be much further than that.\u00A0However, the fact that Eeloo\u0027s periapsis is close to Jool\u0027s orbit makes it way more likely that Eeloo\u0027s orbit was altered by Jool\u0027s gravity. In the latter case, current orbit of Eeloo tells us nothing about what deflected it into inner system to begin with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, Eeloo and Jool don\u0027t currently pass all that close to each other - closest approach is about 16 million km due to inclination, which is greater than distance between Kerbin and Kerbol. If Eeloo was deflected by Jool, the orbits had to have come a lot closer than that some time in the past. It\u0027s hard for me to say if perturbations from Jool\u0027s gravity alone could account for that much drift. But then, there is no other obvious source. Unless a rogue planet happened to pass through Kerbol system at some point in the past, I have no other explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-08T08:27:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224001106\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203656\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221625689410\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277241\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MKI\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, MKI said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t be surprised if alternate star systems just \u0022orbit\u0022 around the Kerbal one or all orbit around a shared point, making the entire setup similar to Kerbin and its moons.

Im so used to gently coasting around the solar system in graceful ellipses its going to be quite a thing to learn brachistochrone trajectories and efficient solar escapes. There\u0027s a lot we don\u0027t know yet, and things that I just don\u0027t know about the reality of interstellar travel. Here are a few questions I have. We\u0027ll probably have to wait till near release to find out most of these but I thought I\u0027d throw them out there to for us to think about.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) How many star systems will be available? And just how far away will they be? At KSP\u0027s 1/10 scale that would still put Alpha Centauri at .43 ly, or 400 billion kilometers. Compared to Jool at 72 million km thats a loooong way. It also seems like any in-game nearby star should have at least a couple of planets to make it worth visiting, which isn\u0027t too outlandish. Proxima Centauri, Wolf 359, and Lalande 21185 each have two confirmed exoplanets, Tau Ceti and Luyten\u0027s Star have 4, and HD 219134 has 6.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) What kind of max acceleration do we think these crazy sci-fi engines will be capable of? I recall that a ship accelerating at 1g would reach nearly the speed of light in about a year and could reach Alpha Centauri within 6. That sounds kind of absurd though and I haven\u0027t seen any near-futurish proposals that approach those speeds. Project Daedalus was designed to reach 12% the speed of light over a little less than 3 years and perform a flyby of Bernards Star in about 50 years, and Longshot and some beamed energy proposals I\u0027ve seen range from 40 to 150 years to orbit nearby stars. At 1/10th scale those kinds of speeds sound more reasonable. And it would be a little easier to excuse omitting relativistic time dilation.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) What are some other implications for interstellar travel? Will other stars have meaningful relative motion that we\u0027ll need to account for? Bernards star is moving at about 90 km/s and Alpha Centauri is moving at about 24 km/s relative to the sun, but that might also be scaled down by a factor of 10? or omitted for simplicity? Something I don\u0027t even\u00A0know is if the sun\u0027s bow shock is dangerous at all radiation-wise?\u00A0 If there are binary stars how will that effect orbital navigation? And of course this doesn\u0027t begin to consider all the wacky new planets they might have planned.\u00A0 Will there be a discovery mechanic that unlocks them\u00A0\u00A0when you reach a certain technological level and tells you a little about what to expect so you can plan your grand colonization projects? Or will you want to send fly-by probes first?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyone else been thinking about this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is 10% scale or perhaps less, say 1000x distance to Jool or in the 50-100 billion range.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe seen the huge fusion craft\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ECW2GF3UIAAUyvw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002257.36\u0022 height=\u0022452\u0022 width=\u0022788\u0022 src=\u0022https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ECW2GF3UIAAUyvw.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Musk this is an starship, you are building an fully reusable heavy lift rocket who can be refueled in space)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe have orion pulse nuclear but that is very marginal for interstellar, decent chance the above will overtake it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWill we get antimatter, some of the power plants we seen hint about this as they are gigantic, scaled more for powering countries than an small colony.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey also hinted about an Epstein\u00A0 style engine as kind of the end game reward.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe can do burns while not having the ship in focus.

This make its easier with very long games, dlc and mods with new stars and binary stars who will rotate around their center of gravity.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n-----\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy guess is that going interstellar will be longer than deep space missions in KSP1.
