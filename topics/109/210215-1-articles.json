You \u0022can\u0022 return data recorders to \u0022within recovery range\u0022 of anywhere that would accept an antenna connection, but this doesn\u0027t gain you anything over just transmitting the data. It might be the only way to do things for some missions tho, due to mass, power budget, or tech limitations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut another way, data recorders act like \u0022a battery for sensor data\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll probes and command capsules would have a pretty small data recorder built in, enough to store the data of one instant experiment, or the data from most of an orbit of a sensor experiment.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere would be a separate data recorder part (in several sizes) that would be able to add on to that capacity, if needed (and if you have more than one sensor going and expect to lose signal, you\u0027re going to need that extra data recording capacity).\u003Cbr\u003E\nLater tech data recorders would be smaller and lighter than early tech data recorders, eventually going to solid state data recorders that are packaged in a radiation vault (still lighter than a rad-tolerant magnetic tape recorder, because it\u0027s just a few chips in a thin lead box).\u003Cbr\u003E\nData recorders \u0022charge\u0022 or store data when the antenna can\u0027t handle transmitting the data back to somewhere else.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis can be because the antenna doesn\u0027t have enough bandwidth, and/or it can be because the antenna doesn\u0027t have a valid connection.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut if the antenna has a valid connection, and the antenna is not using all the bandwidth that it can carry, the data recorder will fill in the extra bandwidth to allow the antenna to operate at full speed, until there is no more data in the recorder.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo if you have a high-bandwidth experiment like a video camera, you should really be using high bandwidth antennas, tho these would obviously take a lot of power to run.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut if you have a low-bandwidth experiment like a thermometer, you\u0027d probably want to save power by choosing a lower bandwidth antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause no matter what bandwidth of science data signal is being carried by the antenna, it uses a fixed amount of power to transmit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it CAN still makes sense to use a high bandwidth antenna even on small probes, because there\u0027s a trick that reduces the power needs. You need a data recorder AND the antenna tho.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s called \u0022Data burst mode\u0022. This makes a data recorder and an antenna work together.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe data recorder stores data until it\u0027s mostly full, and then (using a lot of power but only for a short time in the high bandwidth antenna) the antenna will transmit the data in the recorder until the recorder is empty.

Physical experiment data like surface samples would be gathered instantly, and you would get only a vanishingly small amount of data from transmitting it without a \u0022sample analysis\u0022 experiment to go with the \u0022sample collector\u0022 experiment (similar to the sort of instrument used to analyze soil samples that\u0027s carried by Curiosity).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo generate sensor data, you would need 2 things:\u003Cbr\u003E\nPower to run the sensor(s),\u003Cbr\u003E\nA place to put the data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are 2 places to put the data:\u003Cbr\u003E\nA data recorder,\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn antenna that has a valid connection to any of (a crewed science lab, a colony with a research lab, or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E itself).\u003Cbr\u003E\nAntennas are the primary means of moving data around. You \u0022can\u0022 return data recorders to \u0022within recovery range\u0022 of anywhere that would accept an antenna connection, but this doesn\u0027t gain you anything over just transmitting the data. It might be the only way to do things for some missions tho, due to mass, power budget, or tech limitations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut another way, data recorders act like \u0022a battery for sensor data\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll probes and command capsules would have a pretty small data recorder built in, enough to store the data of one instant experiment, or the data from most of an orbit of a sensor experiment.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere would be a separate data recorder part (in several sizes) that would be able to add on to that capacity, if needed (and if you have more than one sensor going and expect to lose signal, you\u0027re going to need that extra data recording capacity).\u003Cbr\u003E\nLater tech data recorders would be smaller and lighter than early tech data recorders, eventually going to solid state data recorders that are packaged in a radiation vault (still lighter than a rad-tolerant magnetic tape recorder, because it\u0027s just a few chips in a thin lead box).\u003Cbr\u003E\nData recorders \u0022charge\u0022 or store data when the antenna can\u0027t handle transmitting the data back to somewhere else.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis can be because the antenna doesn\u0027t have enough bandwidth, and/or it can be because the antenna doesn\u0027t have a valid connection.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut if the antenna has a valid connection, and the antenna is not using all the bandwidth that it can carry, the data recorder will fill in the extra bandwidth to allow the antenna to operate at full speed, until there is no more data in the recorder.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo if you have a high-bandwidth experiment like a video camera, you should really be using high bandwidth antennas, tho these would obviously take a lot of power to run.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut if you have a low-bandwidth experiment like a thermometer, you\u0027d probably want to save power by choosing a lower bandwidth antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause no matter what bandwidth of science data signal is being carried by the antenna, it uses a fixed amount of power to transmit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it CAN still makes sense to use a high bandwidth antenna even on small probes, because there\u0027s a trick that reduces the power needs. You need a data recorder AND the antenna tho.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s called \u0022Data burst mode\u0022. This makes a data recorder and an antenna work together.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe data recorder stores data until it\u0027s mostly full, and then (using a lot of power but only for a short time in the high bandwidth antenna) the antenna will transmit the data in the recorder until the recorder is empty. The cycle then repeats.

Not even a blank page, just no page. Once the body is discovered (possibly with an orbital telescope) it would show up as a grey sphere representing the player knows something is there, but there is no clue as to what it is. In the bottom image to the right of the red rectangle is the portion with maximum blur. This is what the body would be covered with using a level 1 scan (advanced telescope from a distance or perhaps a crew report from orbit). Inside the red square would be a level 2 scan (Orbiting probe with a low tech camera). Inside the yellow box would be a level 3 scan (Orbiting probe with a more high tech camera). Finally, the green square, a level 4 scan (which wouldn\u0027t show up as a box but perhaps a 20km radius circle around where a site was prospected.

Easy, antennas are the thing used to send or receive radio waves, and like I just said, lightning bolts put out a lot of radio waves. If there\u0027s also a microphone on the weather station, a relatively low-power and low-capacity microprocessor can be used to measure the delay between the lightning strike and when the thunderclap arrives at the weather station, and from that divide by the local atmospheric speed of sound to get a distance to the lightning strike. With a network of such sensors, you can build a map of where lightning has struck recently, and this is done IRL on many weather radar sites (look thru the options on the display to find it, it should be there and not too hard to find).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what does that mean for KSP 2? Well, to me it means that you could gain either science or get paid to put out a network of weather sensor stations around Kerbin, maybe for max science return or payment you\u0027d need to put down X per biome, with Y meters distance between the sensors. Ideally they would be placed in a way that forms at least one triangle, so just dropping them out the back as you fly overhead in a straight line wouldn\u0027t be ideal (you can\u0027t triangulate with a straight line unless the sensors can also tell what direction the data came from).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut even more in line with what KSP 2 is all about, you can measure planetary surface weather (and solar weather as well) using satellites and probes. IRL, we technically have a weather satellite around Mars right now (it also does mapping and communications relay duties, NASA seems to use all 3 capabilities pretty much equally).\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd that probe we have in Mars orbit has been critical to our ability to further explore Mars with probes. It will also likely be critical to the manned exploration of Mars (or replaced by superior equipment), whenever we\u0027re ready to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, the point is this. If you can run a sensor for longer than \u0022spit out one measurement and then don\u0027t do anything again until the player interacts with it\u0022, the player should get rewarded for that.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, obviously, sometimes that\u0027s not possible because of constraints of communications, time, or power, so the sensor type experiments should retain the ability to be operated in \u0022one-shot\u0022 mode as all experiments operate in KSP 1 (this would use a lot less power and not take any appreciable amount of time to transmit the data, but it would also severely limit the amount of science data you\u0027d gain from it to say 5% of the total compared to an experiment that is allowed to run to completion).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re getting the idea that I want science in KSP 2 to work more or less a lot like it does in Kerbalism in KSP 1, well that\u0027s exactly correct. The main reason I don\u0027t use Kerbalism in my KSP 1 games is because it \u0022adds too many things and makes KSP not play like KSP\u0022 to me (and yes I realize that that is an opinion, and therefore totally subjective, I\u0027m not trying to start an argument about Kerbalism here).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExperiments that return data over time are good, some experiments can\u0027t do that (surface samples are the only one that comes to mind at the moment, and no I don\u0027t think the materials bay experiment should be an \u0022instant\u0022 experiment because when we sent a \u0022materials bay\u0022 into orbit IRL using the Shuttle, it did indeed \u0022run over time\u0022 before it was recovered and brought back for study, if you want to look up that experiment it was called the LDEF, or Long Duration Exposure Facility).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-01T22:19:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/12748-sciman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002212748\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/12748-sciman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SciMan\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I enjoy that real antennas take into account things like atmosphere for antenna transmittability for specific frequencies as well as some frequencies can have higher bandwidths with lower range, not to mention the use of gain and its interaction with power consumption. I also really enjoy the idea of having cones of connectivity. I get that all this maybe that may be too niche and more of a mod territory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as the interaction between acquiring data, data storage, and data transmission, I like the idea of having data buffers like hard drives and holding experiments as such (very similar to kerbalisms manner of science data storage).\u00A0 As for data completion, I think instead of taking multiple samples with the same equipment at the same area to get the full amount of science points feels a bit grindy, forcing players to repeat projects they have already done leaving people with a \u0022can we be done with this and just move one\u0022 type of feeling. At least that\u0027s my take for very simple experiments like gathering temperature but I do think there should be a tech buildup over time for more involved experiments that have a more central role in other gameplay mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe an attribute that could be added to science experiments in general could be SNR (signal to noise ratio) where experiment reports could show a graph with error bars or lightly colored wide lines with a darker colored thin line running through the average.\u00A0 The true data that exists in the game wouldnt be shown, but a noise algorithm could generate a \u0022false\u0022 data readout that would appear correct in line with how science is actually not 100% precise.

IRL, you can\u0027t really get that much science done with only a sample scoop, especially if your land in a rocky riverbed. Your sample scoop simply won\u0027t be able to pick up those large rocks, even if your lander or rover is perfectly capable of landing in or traversing over such terrain without issue.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor a rocky riverbed (or other rocky terrain), you\u0027d want something like a rock drill, maybe the kind that extracts a core, maybe the kind that just pulverizes the rock and collects the created rock dust in a small container for conveyance to the sample analyzer system.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf it extracts a core, it\u0027s kinda hard to analyze it on-site with robotic equipment, but you could store it and eventually return it to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to be analyzed there.

Additionally, if the sample had any complex chemicals in it (maybe organic in nature?), the laser beam would certainly have caused those chemicals to be decomposed by the intense and highly localized heating, so in your spectrogram you\u0027ll be sensing the decomposition products not the chemical itself, and that means there\u0027s going to be an amount of uncertainty about what exactly that chemical compound could have been, because you\u0027ll only be able to detect \u0022what elements and what relative abundances\u0022, not so much \u0022what configurations were the atoms and molecules attached to each other\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWater is easy enough to find with this method, but true evidence of life (complex organic chemicals) needs another experiment that collects samples a different way and doesn\u0027t expose them to such harsh heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s rocky terrain covered, what about more sandy or dusty terrain?

There are a lot of great ideas above but more than anything we need to keep our eye on the ball here and simplify this equation.

If there is an incentive to do more than 6 total science missions for the Mun or Minmus something is wrong.

What we\u0027re ultimately trying to do is connect up 3 things with the fewest possible steps: maneuvering vessels to new places, increasing the amount of useful information the player has in-game, and unlocking parts. Now, I love those\u00A0 atmospheric charts, but for most players they just don\u0027t mean much. They aren\u0027t telling players what they actually want to know: \u003Cem\u003Ecan my vessel survive re-entry at its present trajectory\u003C/em\u003E, and \u003Cem\u003Ewhere will it land\u003C/em\u003E. Rather than barometers and thermometers giving you a graph they should unlock automatic\u003Cem\u003E overheat prediction\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Etrajectory factoring drag\u003C/em\u003E. The graph is much, much more opaque than data the player can easily see in engine, in map mode. You don\u0027t need an encyclopedia. You need \u003Cem\u003Eflight visualization tools\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis touches upon the biggest problem with Science in the game: its purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInitially we were all in awe with KSP; you can build your rocket, launch it, and land it somewhere else.

You\u0027d still have Moho, Eve, Kerbin, Duna, etc, but you don\u0027t know their exact orbits; they need to be discovered first, and measured. Moons? Only after putting a probe in orbit. Atmospheric parameters?
