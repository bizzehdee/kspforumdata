and why should you care in the first, both planets seem to look mostly the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets look at Rask \u0026amp; Rusk during their reveal in game at PAX east 2019:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f81acfcbafa940f4d9f2a85437859df89b396f96\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/4463399/f81acfcbafa940f4d9f2a85437859df89b396f96.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis may or may-not just be me, but Rask \u0026amp; Rusk look visually different from the tidal forces acting on each-other, lets assume that Rask is the top one and Rask is the bottom in this image for this post, from this angle Rask looks like a madness combat head, and Rusk looks like a cracked egg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might seem like a small change but this helps us to visually distinguish the two from each other, and it\u0027s also a great example of tidal distortion for the player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the more modern design of Rask \u0026amp; Rusk from Episode 4 of the KSP2 feature video\u0027s:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FAxeJmO.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/FAxeJmO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the most part it looks stunning and for the most part it\u0027s a huge improvement from when we first saw them, but now there\u0027s a small issue, I have no idea which is which now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing I can tell them apart is that Rusk seems to have more lava than Rask, and in my opinion that\u0027s not enough to make them unique, why would you want to explore both of them other than necessity to do so for a contract or colony supply mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess my point after all that is that Rask \u0026amp; Rusk just don\u0027t have interesting enough individual identity to explore each of them in detail like what seems to be the goal with the planets in the game, and I\u0027m even going to make the bold claim here that aside from the cool lava, both of them kind of look like boring rocks compared to the stuff the devs put on other planets in terms of actually exploring their surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a cool system, but not very cool planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd with that I now set you free from my rant, thank you for getting through the whole thing, I of course don\u0027t know anything about Rask \u0026amp; Rusk other than the pictures I\u0027ve seen and might be totally wrong of course, have a great day\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-11T14:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou ever tried to orbit a binary system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Minmus Taster","CreatedById":206159,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-11T14:45:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224101491\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207230\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221647009289\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou ever tried to orbit a binary system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not, I was never questioning the interesting orbital challenge, they are very interesting and I\u0027m looking forward to messing around at that system, I\u0027m saying that from an exploration standpoint both of them are basically the same which might de-motivate people from spending to much time trying to explore both of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ahres","CreatedById":180308,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-11T15:18:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I see what you\u0027re saying, I know Intercept is trying to make planetary science as realistic as possible (think Minmus being glassy instead of icy).
