Some of the games made with it include Cuphead, Cities Skyline, and even Rick and Morty VR.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think they associate the poor performance with unity and not the graphics API. There is a difference. It\u0027s the graphics API that causes the poor performance. DX9 is old. Really old now. 2002 it came out and support dropped around 2007 iirc. 12 years. That\u0027s a long time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople are suggesting there will be the same performance or worse with KSP2 and I can\u0027t bring myself to believe that, not unless they dont upgrade from DX9, which I\u00A0feel they have. If they are using DX11, DX12, or even DX11 with DX12 upgrades, performance will shoot up I would imagine nearly 4 to 10 times. The same could be said for AMD\u0027s Vulken API.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish people would see that unity isn\u0027t a bad engine. It isn\u0027t the problem.
