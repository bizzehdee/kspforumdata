not a no-brainer, and which way is \u0022better\u0022 depends heavily on context.\u00A0 It\u0027s a case-by-case thing, and has to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EApparent assumption #2:\u00A0 Any bug that\u0027s found, will be fixed.\u00A0 If you ship with bugs,

\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewants\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to ship with bugs, and certainly there are indeed bugs that do in fact \u0022slip through\u0022 (in the sense that nobody noticed them before release, and they come as a nasty surprise after shipping).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s also the case that some bugs are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edeliberately not fixed\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, for a variety of good reasons.\u00A0 The two main reasons for deliberately not fixing a bug generally have to do with two things, cost and risk:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECost:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Suppose a bug is a pretty minor edge case, but would be huge and expensive to fix in terms of engineering time.\u00A0 You could have some minor cosmetic issue that doesn\u0027t bork gameplay, or some race condition that happens very rarely and can be worked around when it happens.\u00A0 If fixing that bug would take weeks of work (and maybe require slipping a ship date, or neglecting other more important fixes)... better to just ship with it in there, and maybe mark it for fixing in a patch release later or something.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERisk:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Code is complicated and densely interconnected.\u00A0 Any time you touch \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eone\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E thing, you take the risk of breaking something \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eelse\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Some bugs are low-risk to fix because they involve code that\u0027s fairly \u0022standalone\u0022 and other stuff doesn\u0027t depend on too much.\u00A0 On the other hand, some areas of code are more sensitive, and touching them at \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eall\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E can be very risky, because you can invalidate many weeks of testing that went into the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecurrent\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E behavior and could have to re-test everything again and maybe cause other breakages elsewhere that you end up not catching before releasing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may help to think of it in terms of a medical analogy:\u00A0 There are some medical conditions that you might deliberately choose not to treat, either because the cost of the procedure would be exorbitant relative to the benefit (\u0022we can remove that inconspicuous mole for you, but it\u0027ll cost you $10,000 out of pocket\u0022), or because it would introduce other risks that are dangerous (\u0022we can fix that minor pain that occasionally annoys you and that you usually just take an ibuprofen for, but there\u0027s a 5% chance that the surgery will kill you\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sturmhauke","CreatedById":190611,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-11T18:53:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

would function as a ladder and have a way to exit/enter when you reach a platform on the top.\u00A0 Something happened in one of the 1.7.x updates that messed up ladders in this sense.\u00A0 I need to

not effect game play and was easily avoided by those who preferred not to incorporate such things into their designs.\u00A0 Then they decide to fix it months (years?) later and it destroys or disrupts favorite craft.\u00A0 Not sure why we needed the Wheesly and Goliath engines fixed in this sense.\u00A0 Now reverse thrust on at least the Wheesly doesn\u0027t work if something is clipped to the side of the engine.\u00A0 They fixed what never needed to be fixed, and in the process introduced a bug that disables reverse thrust in some craft designs for no reason.

damaging it (and no way to fix it on site) so I just hung around Kerbin and only did sandbox stuff, pretty much all the way up to present... even left the game completely between December and

other considerations, like \u0022is it kinda moot because we\u0027re about to completely replace that entire section of code anyway,\u0022 but I digress.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAs a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eplayer\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, you only have visibility into #1.\u00A0 How expensive or risky a bug is, will generally have very little correlation to how \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebad\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it is.\u00A0 You could have a trivial \u0022oops, I put a \u0027not equals\u0027 in a spot where it should have said \u0027equals\u0027\u0022 that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecompletely borks the game\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E but is a painless one-line fix with essentially zero risk.\u00A0 Or, you could have a bug that looks minor and cosmetic but is actually symptomatic of something very deep and highly metastasized in the code base, so that fixing it would be a ginormous and/or dangerous thing to do.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E#2 and #3 absolutely \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eaffect\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E

experience with bugs is so often frustrating to players.\u00A0 All we can see is how the bug \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eaffects\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E us, without any visibility whatsoever into cost and risk\u003C/span\u003E and the like.\u00A0 So when we run into a really annoying bug, it\u0027s extremely tempting to blame the company:\u00A0 \u0022Gosh, those bozos, how could they not have spotted this?\u00A0 Do they not even play their own game?\u0022\u00A0 And when a bug is reported, and it doesn\u0027t get fixed for a really long time, it\u0027s extremely tempting to blame the company, too:\u00A0 \u0022Gosh, those jerks, they must not care about the players at all!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is unfortunate-- because often there\u0027s a perfectly reasonable explanation for the situation and the developers are actually making all the right decisions (\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efor the players\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, even if they don\u0027t know it).\u00A0 Unfortunately for the devs, those reasons aren\u0027t \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Evisible\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E to the players, so the devs just have to endure getting yelled at by people who don\u0027t realize they don\u0027t know the whole story.\u00A0 And those reasons are often things that the devs actually can\u0027t talk about publicly for various reasons... which means they have to just live with getting yelled at for crimes they haven\u0027t actually committed.\u00A0 It sucks.\u00A0 However, it goes with the job, alas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(And, yes, sometimes there \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eare\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E companies that are incompetent, or cavalier towards players.\u00A0 But that tends to be the exception more than the rule, in my experience.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m not saying players shouldn\u0027t complain about bugs.\u00A0 If they paid money for a product, and it doesn\u0027t work right, in a way that significantly affects their enjoyment, then of course they have every right to be unhappy about that, perhaps even angry.\u00A0 Just... for anyone reading this, please do remember that developers are people too, and these are folks who work really hard and are doing their best.\u00A0 So when phrasing the complaints, try to keep some perspective when setting the tone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sturmhauke","CreatedById":190611,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-11T20:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022
