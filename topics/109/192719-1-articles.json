The primary issue i would see is that for 3D graphics it\u0027s difficult to simulate cutting the ends off a tank and converting it into a usable space; you could have models swap in for different stages. Those would be governed by some logic, but you\u0027d need at least 3 models for it (Tank_Base, Tank_OpenEnds, Tank_Converted).

The primary issue i would see is that for 3D graphics it\u0027s difficult to simulate cutting the ends off a tank and converting it into a usable space; you could have models swap in for different stages. Those would be governed by some logic, but you\u0027d need at least 3 models for it (Tank_Base, Tank_OpenEnds, Tank_Converted).
