I do need to ask though, does FMRS work with DMP? I could see it working as timelines aren\u0027t synchronized anyways so traveling to the past shouldn\u0027t be a problem, but it looks like it requires making a separate game save state\u00A0and backtracking to the point of staging apart the 2 seperate vessels then rejoining to the original save timeline while giving credit for the vehicle that has landed and been recovered then deleting it from the original. But if this is the case, combined with DMP, would it not also duplicate all other craft in the game while everyone else has been flying uninterrupted?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

In FS19 you need to have EXACT MATCH mods down to the version in order to work if mods are involved. This can be a real issue, especially if you will not run say for example mechjeb, but, I have it. what now? are we forbidden from playing together? Or you run Eve and Scatterer but, I do not.

From what I remember of DMP is that over its history it has been glitchy at best. If I am still remembering right is that SOME do not consider DMP to be a good implementation of multiplayer at all. I personally do not know how DMP works, never used it, never will. As again, I personally do not see multiplayer as a good fit for this kind of game. Yes, people want it, but, for me, I do not. I do truly understand the fun of playing with friends, I enjoy flying in formation and running missions with my brother from another mother in DCS, but that is a combat flight sim, this is not that. I can ramble on and on about it, but, the short and simple of it is, KSP was built as a single player game, and it should remain as such. KSP2 is having multiplayer added in, but, I again, personally think that\u0027s going to \u0026lt;personal opinion\u0026gt; work out about as well as career and science mode did, which, \u0026lt;personal opinion\u0026gt; did not work out well at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I have said before, KSP and KSP2 to me are single player games and for me, will 100% remain as such.
