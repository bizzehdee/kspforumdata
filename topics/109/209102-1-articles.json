However, spaceflight as we begin sending people to Mars and beyond will require advances in more areas than just propulsion. What future technologies would you like to see in KSP 2 that we have not really seen yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor one, I would like very advanced composites. Material science has shown amazing progress recently, and I would love to see parts that have ludicrously high stress, impact, or temperature tolerances, that are very light for the role they have, or that have other properties that interact with gameplay systems (for example, if wear and tear due to dust or atmospheric particles was a thing, materials that don\u0027t wear down and actively repel particles)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd secondly, I would love to see advances in energy storage. Ion batteries are great, but there are so many possibilities out there that have roughly the same chances of being viable as future propulsion proposals, and I would like to see all my colony\u0027s energy capacity represented in a single 3.75m part storing a huge amount of anti-iron.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat would you like to see?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rutabaga22","CreatedById":221143,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-24T18:48:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to see power generation stuff.

The problem is that with only a tiny bit more complexity, you get something we could actually build, starting TODAY.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThings like this could be an ideal means to get raw resources from the surface to orbit, to then be collected up and loaded on to a vessel more suited for the depths of interplanetary space.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would trade \u0022colony power output\u0022 increase, for \u0022colony fuel consumption\u0022 decrease. Additionally, constructing it would obviously require a large amount of raw materials, proportional to the velocity you want to get out of the system, so it would be able to be constructed in \u0022chunks\u0022 of a fixed velocity increment, and then on the end of the track you\u0027d be able to set the elevation angle relative to the horizon for the payload\u0027s trajectory. This means that while you might not have the space at your Tylo colony site to get up to full orbital velocity, so instead you might opt for a track that is much shorter but the payload is released at a significantly upward trajectory compared to the horizon, that way it still gives an overall reduction in gravity losses but you can use much more efficient, lower thrust engines to circularize the orbit instead of having to rely on high thrust-to-weight engines which tend to have lower specific impulse, thereby increasing the payload mass ratio of a vessel sent to Tylo orbit from such an acceleration track.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMass drivers would would be especially viable on bodies that have no atmosphere and low gravity (which usually go hand-in-hand at least in the inner solar system).\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor instance, on Gilly you\u0027d need to accelerate something to less than 100 m/s to send it to Gilly escape velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven Minmus is an excellent candidate for this (finally a good use for the vast flat plains of Minmus, might need a ramp on the end of the track tho).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLofstrom Loops are basically mass drivers but for planets that have a significant atmosphere, because they\u0027re dynamically suspended above the atmosphere by the velocity of a circulating loop of iron segments held away from the walls of the tube that protects that loop from the atmosphere by magnetic levitation (or during startup/shutdown, regular old roller bearings).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-29T21:00:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2022 09:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-29T21:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224159226\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209102\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221659127526\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, SciMan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m talking about things like mass drivers, Lofstrom Loops, Laser/Microwave Launch, heck even Rotovators, that kind of thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for bringing this up, now I know what a lofstrom loop is!

It\u0027s like a space elevator, but it doesn\u0027t need \u0022uber-strong materials\u0022 to build it. It does need a very reliable source of power, and a very finely tuned control system. But it does what a space elevator does, in a way that we can actually (theoretically) build right now with pretty mundane materials as far as absolute strength goes (the magnets might be the hardest part, but weaker magnets just make the thing bigger and potentially more power-hungry, they don\u0027t make it less capable).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow it works is like this:\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust like a Lofstrom Loop, you have a loop of iron segments.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut instead of accelerating it horizontally along the surface until it\u0027s going faster than local orbital velocity, it is accelerated VERTICALLY.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe upward velocity of the segments is more than capable of bringing it up to geostationary orbit (and then quite a bit more, escape velocity is a good place to start if you want the upper platform to sit at geostationary orbit altitude).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe construction is as follows:\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt the bottom, you have a gigantic magnet that takes downward-traveling parts of the loop of iron segments and re-directs them to go upwards, as well as a bunch of coils arranged to form a linear motor to impart further upward acceleration on to the segments (keeping the speed of the whole loop maintained, and then some margin to spare both for contingencies, startup/shutdown, and for actually performing useful work of lifting payloads to geostationary orbit).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe platform at the top has a similar gigantic magnet, however the purpose of that magnet is the reverse of the one on the ground. It bends the trajectory of upward-moving segments of the loop and re-directs them downwards. There are no acceleration coils at the top, however there likely would be trajectory control coils on both ends (with some form of thruster array at the top to cancel out any reaction forces from the control coils).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can take this concept and scale it up or down as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the smaller sense, the space fountain becomes a \u0022Dynamic compression beam\u0022, because it uses dynamic forces to carry compression loads. Multiples of these can be used to build even larger buildings than current materials science would permit, without having to have the ground floor taken up mostly by structural elements and elevators.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the larger sense, you get Dynamic Orbital Ring structures, which are \u0022orbital\u0022 rings that use space-fountain type technology to stay suspended stationary above the surface of a planet while not having the requirement to be at geostationary altitude. This can be used to make multiple sets of rings around a planet, in any given direction.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTaking this concept even further, if you weave a dense enough network of these dynamic rings at a given altitude, you can build things suspended in the spaces between the dynamic ring members, leading to the concept of an \u0022orbital super-shell\u0022. And if you put that around a star, with solar panels on the inside, you get a supra-stellar shell, or Dyson Sphere. Build that at the right altitude, and somehow manage to dissipate the heat, and you can build a habitable region on the OUTSIDE (not inside) of that Dyson Sphere, with a surface area in the range of hundreds of thousands of times the surface area of Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with that knowledge, you can see how the lowly Lofstrom Loop can be the start of a civilization moving up the Kardashev scale many notches (and 2 is \u0022many\u0022 in this case, since just moving up 1 notch is something that would alter everyday life to something only remotely like what we currently know).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
