I think I speak for a lot of people here when I say that this is a mistake. I believe Take Two and Intercept are heavily underestimating the amount of players on these platforms, and will essentially screw over at least \u2153 of their playerbase, inherently making the game less popular since not everyone can afford a gaming PC. It\u2019s also not a question of hardware either, the new Apple Silicon chips are incredibly powerful, and should be able to run KSP2 with ease. My M1 MacBook Air is able to run KSP smoothly\u00A0with several graphics mods and many, MANY parts mods. Don\u2019t underestimate Linux machines either, they used to be THE go-to for modded KSP. This is why I believe that, rather than putting resources into Xbox One and PS4 support, Intercept should refocus those resources towards Mac and Linux support at launch. We represent a much larger part of the playerbase than most people think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-18T14:24:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224066882\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206025\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221639820608\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022211017\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheKrakenHerder\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, TheKrakenHerder said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nat least \u2153 of their playerbase\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally prefer Linux, for what it\u0027s worth, but this is probably not true.

I\u0027m pretty sure no one on these forums is a blind Mac fan-person, and so the debate over whether they are good computers made by a good company is not one that will change anyone\u0027s opinion. For the first part, you seem to be treating Macs sort of like consoles, which I think you were also against supporting. Essentially, the argument is that \u0022if the average person\u0027s computer with [x] operating system (be it macOS, xbox, playstation, etc) is going to have a hard time running KSP 2 (debatable when looking at the newer chips and other factors) then support for that operating system should be dropped because it is an investment for less return than only releasing to operating systems where the average computer is powerful enough.\u0022 Okay, so playing some devil\u0027s advocate, most people using windows have laptops that can barely run Chrome, let alone a game. Does that disqualify windows as an operating system? In my opinion, no. The audience for verbal space program should be anyone who wants to buy it, whether their computer is powerful enough or not. This drives sales and is good for the company because more people will buy the game on more platforms, if you want to look at it from an economics perspective. The only factor that goes into determining support for an operating system is whether it will increase profit, and in all of these cases it will, even on the small linux community. So, before taking your justified hatred of a company and turning it against the consumer, just realize that the decision has probably already been made to include Mac, as it will increase profits and it will not take too much extra time. You are not the only one waiting, everyone else here is also waiting. Have some patience and allow the minority of people here who use Mac and Linux (because they are both the topic of the discussion) to have their game, even if it means you have to wait a bit longer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-27T19:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224069651\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206025\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221640567857\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor those people who run Linux or Mac systems...is there a specific reason you can\u0027t emulate Windows at least long enough until support is there for your OS of choice?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI already dual boot for games (and in fact I\u0027m in Windows right now), but I just feel more comfortable using GNOME Shell than Windows.

The version of KSP that we got for consoles is pretty bad compared to the PC/Linux version, you can\u0027t do much at all in it because the computing hardware in those consoles simply can\u0027t keep up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Mac laptops and PC\u0027s, the situation is mostly the same as a console, except you have maybe a few hardware options you can select from when ordering it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, unlike a Windows/Linux PC, and unlike ALL Laptops, field upgrading a Mac laptop or PC is largely impossible, or at least you MUST use parts ONLY from Apple, else the thing won\u0027t work or will have tons of bugs. And even if you DO want to upgrade it, and have the money to pay for it (which will cost more than you\u0027d have to pay to do a similar upgrade on a Windows/Linux PC), the upgrades that are available for a Mac PC or Laptop aren\u0027t for the parts that are crucial to game performance (GPU and CPU), instead they\u0027re things like adding more of the same speed of RAM (which only matters if you don\u0027t have enough), or things like switching to an SSD (or larger/faster SSD if it already has one).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince games don\u0027t really care about those things beyond meeting the minimum requirements, these upgrades don\u0027t make much of any difference to performance in games (OK switching from an HDD to an SSD will likely significantly speed up loading times, but that\u0027s not a real performance increase that would allow you to build vessels with higher part count while maintaining a similar framerate).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnlike consoles, with Mac PC\u0027s and laptops you could probably get KSP running on a Mac to support mods, but again that depends on how locked down Apple wants the operating system to be (which could change with the new M1 chips coming out).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hardware constraints are why I think that KSP 2 should not release on Mac operating systems, at least not to start off with. Maybe later, but right now I\u0027m trying to advocate for decisions that will lead to the minimum amount of \u0022distractions\u0022 to finishing the core KSP 2 game itself, and supporting additional platforms on launch day is something that I would indeed consider to potentially be a distraction unless the market for it is large indeed (and I mean like fully 1/8 or more of total KSP 1 sales were from that platform, which I\u0027m almost certain excludes Mac, and maybe even Linux).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason that Linux and Windows are operating systems for which I DO fully support launch-day compatibility is quite simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re not \u0022locked to one or a few hardware configurations\u0022 like you are with consoles or Mac PC\u0027s (and all laptops regardless of operating system).\u003Cbr\u003E\nTherefore, you\u0027re not constrained by what the manufacturers of your computer considered to be \u0022affordable by most people\u0022 which they do so they can sell a lot of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re free to spend as much money on your computer as you want, which lets you do something with a Linux/Windows desktop PC that you can\u0027t do with any other type of computer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can BUY performance, without having to change the operating system radically to support it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill most people that own a PC buy the performance needed to run KSP? Probably not, because like you said, most PC\u0027s out there have barely enough performance to run even a web browser competently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the stat that I\u0027m interested isn\u0027t the \u0022Average PC\u0022, instead it\u0027s the \u0022Average \u0027high performance\u0027 PC\u0022. That\u0027s a whole different thing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMost \u0022High performance PC\u0027s\u0022 built in the last 2-3 years should be more than able to run KSP 2 sufficiently.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt least, that\u0027s what I expect the hardware requirements to reflect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all consoles, you\u0027re stuck to a given level of hardware performance. You get what you get, you can\u0027t improve it or else it\u0027s no longer that console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Mac\u0027s, it\u0027s similar. You\u0027re stuck to a given level of CPU/GPU performance. You get what you get, because the parts are electronically keyed to each other so that only a very specific part or small range of parts is compatible (which is done by Apple so that they can be the sole supplier of compatible parts, and therefore charge you an exorbitant rate for upgrades).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Windows and Linux, the only limiting factors are your personal financial situation, and the global availability of parts. Those two factors can also be leveraged against each other to make up for shortcomings in either one. If you\u0027re on a tight budget, you can choose a less capable but more available part. If you need as much performance as possible, you can spend more for better parts, even if those parts aren\u0027t as common.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe thing to keep in mind is that Windows and Linux are FLEXIBLE in the hardware that they support. This gives people who want to play KSP 2 on those operating systems a wide leeway in deciding how well they want the game to run or look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Oh and that \u0022wide range of hardware support\u0022 is also why the drivers in Windows behave oddly from time to time. There\u0027s simply too many different potential hardware configurations, it results in a nearly infinite amount of edge cases where things work \u0022almost the way they should, but not quite\u0022, so there\u0027s simply not enough time in the day for Microsoft to make exceptions for all of them, so some of them fall thru the cracks. If they did manage that gargantuan task, it would take them 20 years or more to make a new version of the operating system, and you\u0027d have at least minor updates every week if not more frequently. You should be grateful that Microsoft allows third party hardware manufacturers to author drivers, at least that reduces the workload to a point where it can start to be tackled, but even then some things will still fall thru the cracks.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEND EDIT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou just can\u0027t do that with consoles, or Mac PC\u0027s and laptops. And that\u0027s why I don\u0027t think they\u0027re worth supporting (at least at launch).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-01T20:22:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2022 08:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-01T21:04:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the clarification!

The question is \u201Cis the average \u2018high performance\u2019 pc able to run KSP 2 in this operating system\u201D which is yes for all operating systems in question, and \u201Cis the hassle of making new code worth it?\u201D Which is hopefully the debate. To be honest, the devs don\u2019t care about the exact hardware of a user most of the time, they care if they have to rewrite code or use different libraries due to said hardware and OS. If you want to rant about hardware companies, go to their forums and bash on nvidia for making their gpus differently so that games can\u2019t run on some cards or something. We get it, macs and consoles are worse for developers than modular hardware or prebuilt running windows. Just drop the hardware part because we know that if it is not too much of a hassle and KSP can run on devices, the devs will support it. Now, we can argue if it is too much of a hassle for the target audience, which is still unresolved from the start of this the thread.
