You could do it with unmanned drones ahead of the arrival of your fragile Kerbal residents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for shadow shields, I could see it working with several standard sizes like the heat shields we already have, though procedural would be ideal! Procedural trusses would be even better. No matter how you introduce it, I 100% do not want the shields to be built in to the reactors/engines. Having custom shields and their resultant shadows could introduce a really fun constraint vaguely analogous to the problem of fitting parts inside a fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I\u2019ll add that I think I remember Nate Simpson saying there would be no relativistic interstellar particles or other obstacles you\u2019d need to shield from precisely because they wanted to avoid forcing players to make completely shielded \u201Cpill ships\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224129741\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208111\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221652137944\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as a note in the most recent interstellar travel vid the vessels they show do seem to have a variety of radiation shields both at the front of the vessel and separating engines from critical parts of the vessel. Some even have multiple shields as if there\u0027s a max radiation limit for things like radiators and lower limit for crew necessitating a secondary shield. It\u0027ll be interesting to see how this mechanic plays out. As far as the effect on kerbals themselves I think a ship full of dead kerbals is too grim and punishing. Id rather see things like LS and habitation and radiation folded into an overall health or happiness rating that would effect science returns, harvesting and processing resources, population growth, etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood point! I expect different parts of the ship to have different shielding demands, so you could potentially fine-tune your protection with smaller shields rather than just one big saucer.
