I know this has come up in the past but rather than necrobump I thought Id see how folks are feeling about this nowadays. I think there are a lot of ways automation could make the game less frustrating, aid in things like milk-runs, stage recovery, cut down on tedious tasks like long overland journeys, etc. but it also has the potential to take the player out of the equation and\u00A0make the game very boring, where you just click on something and watch the game play for you.\u00A0It may be that this kind of thing is out of scope for Intercept, but given a lot of the resupply tasks colonies and space stations might require and the desire to control/recover multiple stages at once it might be nice to to see some functionality?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAre you against it entirely?

Docking autopilots should allow the player to dictate the orientation of the craft as it docks for instance, launch autopilots should have parameters for the altitude of the circular orbit they are meant to achieve, landing autopilots should allow the player to designate a landing site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think these are all reasonable checkpoints for people (obviously order and conditions are up to debate). Those that have achieved them should at that point have a very\u00A0good handling on the mechanics involved manually executing the relevant maneuvers and understand fully why the autopilots are doing what they are doing. I believe this game will be extraordinarily more complex and ask players to complete orders of magnitude more flight missions and to those that want to progress and manage an interstellar space civilization/network should be afforded\u00A0 these quality of life features in stock to allow them to macromanage more fluidly and gain focus on not just flight but mission planning as well. I think we all want to live vicariously as our own Buzz and Neil , but I know I would also like to experience being an administrator and planner as well and do not think I am alone in this nor do I feel I am wrong or out of place to hope for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not mentioned in here automation in the form of custom written scripts as in kOS. I do hope something similar is included and even perhaps a VPL to allow greater accessibility for non programmers. This would allow for much greater nuance in planning and seeing ones own vision of a mission be completed as they see fit. I also see plenty of potential for players to learn new skills that would be practical in the real world as those uninitiated to the programming world would be given an opportunity to use code not to just display some text or execute a sorting algorithm, but actually fly a rocket. What an inspiring and motivating invitation to those beginning to learn code. That said, nothing like this has been confirmed, none the less hinted at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have also not mentioned how colony automation should be implemented as we have little information to work with on how colonies will even work and I feel talking about automation with such little information to be a bit premature. That said, I am happy \u0022milk-runs\u0022 have been confirmed as running all those missions would take an extremely long time and become more of a chore than exciting creative play as well as a distraction from the greater game at hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: One thing worth considering also would be mass or dimension limits for the autopilot features so only landers of a certain mass/size could have automated landings and only rockets below a certain threshold could have automated launches or docking procedures\u00A0and further researches could upgrade these limits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-18T10:48:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2021 10:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by mcwaffles2003\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-18T14:17:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice breakdown \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/180102-mcwaffles2003/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022180102\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/180102-mcwaffles2003/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@mcwaffles2003\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0. It\u0027s probably a sticky wicket not knowing much about what Intercept has planned for release or after or what they\u0027d rather leave to mods. Given the ambition of the currently stated scope I think SOME form of automation will be important, especially for colonies. This could of course be\u00A0abstracted by more or less \u0027magic\u0027 transfers of resources, but if there were other reasons to implement mech-jebby functions maybe there\u0027s a way to kill two birds. A couple of examples that could be really cool:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) You build a mining base on Ike that harvests ore and uranium, and a base on the surface of Duna that produces ore and life support. You then build tankers that ferry both those resources to a station in orbit above Duna where you\u0027re building a big Jool or interstellar vessel. Each tanker does a proof-of-concept run where the resources are loaded and brought to the station. The Ike tanker then draws off some LS to keep the miners happy, and the Duna tanker loads on some Uranium to keep the lights on at your Duna base and both return to their origins. The player can then set a schedule for how often these flights repeat and the automated system does the rest. If you miscalculate your inputs and the identified resources aren\u0027t present when the next leg is scheduled to depart a little warning pops up to tell the player to adjust.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) You have a colony on the surface of the Mun thats a few kilometers from a very rich source of He3. You build a harvester rover that can mine the ore, send it out to the extraction zone, run it until it\u0027s full, then return it to the base where it unloads for processing. You then build multiple copies of that harvester, set waypoints in the He3 deposit and set a schedule for them to drive out and return.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) You do a Spacex style test-launch of a lower stage, sending it to the approximate altitude and distance you plan to separate, do your back burn, and fly it back down to a landing pad at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Later you can set that subassembly to execute that maneuver when staged so you can follow your second stage to orbit knowing the game will (probably) land your first stage safely.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) You have a crew compliment of 6 for a first-landing on Pol. You tell everyone on the vessel to disembark, where they then begin wandering around, ogling the landscape, causing little antics etc. You can then click on any of them without switching vessel and issue commands to plant a flag, repair a landing leg, collect surface samples, set up a long-term science experiment, etc, at\u00A0without micromanaging each task.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIm sure given just how complex players\u0027 vessels\u0027 and different conditions are this is probably a hugely complicated thing to program, but it could also really make this game if done well. It might be nice for instance if timings and quantities of resources to be transferred were stored in the schedule and could be adjusted on the fly. This might make the interface a little more cumbersome but it would save players time having to repeat tanker-runs with only small corrections to onloaded/offloaded resources. So long as players understood the system wasn\u0027t flawless and there were warnings when problems arose (Insufficient resources at departure point! Specified docking port blocked at arrival point!) and players could make manual corrections I think it could be an amazing system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-18T15:41:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2021 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Admiral Fluffy","CreatedById":210816,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-18T15:18:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy favorite idea is cosmetic, but i would also like rover automation.\u00A0 Like the rovers drive around and do stuff.

The fact is that people respond to incentives, and gamers playing a game will gravitate to the easiest way to play it. If you give them the option to automate manoeuvre node execution or various other flight things from the get-go, that\u0027s what they\u0027ll go with, and it\u0027ll become the primary way to play the game. Flight will become an optional gameplay mode.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny game needs a\u00A0 focus and a few central activities it\u0027s built around. Supporting systems have to make those core activities more enjoyable, engaging, and exciting. Like, if you\u0027re making a shooter and decide to add RPG elements, these elements have to enhance and enrich the core experience which is shooting things; if instead they detract from it or make it optional, the end result isn\u0027t going to be as good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your intention as a game designer is to make a vessel design \u002B colony building \u002B\u00A0resource management game, then it would make more sense just not to implement flight and all the physics associated with it. It\u0027s\u00A0 a huge effort. Instead, put that effort into making the vessel design \u002B colony building \u002B resource management that much deeper, richer, more complex, and more engaging. It could be a terrific game if done properly. It just wouldn\u0027t look much like KSP at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe central activities in KSP2 are building air- and spacecraft, flying them, and using them to explore exciting new worlds. The colony aspect supports that: it creates gameplay reasons to design, fly, and explore, and creates new opportunities for designing, flight, and exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, I believe that any feature set or subsystem in KSP2 has to support that core set of gameplay activities. If instead it conflicts with or dilutes them, it shouldn\u0027t be implemented in the first place, and that effort should be spent on something that does support and enhance them instead. This is the case with certain types of automation. For the same reason, it\u0027s important that automation is only unlocked at the point when the manual stuff would otherwise become rote and repetitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, since KSP2 is intended to be so moddable, I\u0027m pretty sure that there will be mods out quite early that unlock whatever gates the game puts this kind of thing behind, so KSP1 veterans who are bored of flying things can get what they want too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Burning Kan","CreatedById":163619,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-18T20:47:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwith this two mods u can do almost everything automaticly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rPh1DfwJpMA?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6394395226\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/151340-19x-smart-parts-continued/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:195px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlutoISaPlanet","CreatedById":206057,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-18T21:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223974802\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202463\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221621367535\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main question is whether colonial supply routes\u00A0will be simulated by in-game craft or just implied by magically transferring resources on some set schedule.

Even the routing could get very complicated.

The former really should be available right from the beginning so players can do their first orbital circularization burn. The latter I think falls into that give-a-man-a-fish zone where players might learn more from being given a tutorial and a transfer window date (or even a porkchop graph?) and let them noodle out the hohmann maneuver themselves the first several times.

You could even have them unlock based on total off-world population, the idea being your spacefaring civilization is now producing kerbals experienced enough to fly themselves.

If you give them the option to automate manoeuvre node execution or various other flight things from the get-go, that\u0027s what they\u0027ll go with, and it\u0027ll become the primary way to play the game. Flight will become an optional gameplay mode.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny game needs a\u00A0 focus and a few central activities it\u0027s built around. Supporting systems have to make those core activities more enjoyable, engaging, and exciting. Like, if you\u0027re making a shooter and decide to add RPG elements, these elements have to enhance and enrich the core experience which is shooting things; if instead they detract from it or make it optional, the end result isn\u0027t going to be as good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your intention as a game designer is to make a vessel design \u002B colony building \u002B\u00A0resource management game, then it would make more sense just not to implement flight and all the physics associated with it. It\u0027s\u00A0 a huge effort. Instead, put that effort into making the vessel design \u002B colony building \u002B resource management that much deeper, richer, more complex, and more engaging.
