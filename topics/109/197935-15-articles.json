Has always been that way but nowadays, more so. So if a game can be dumbed down to reach a wider player base, it probably will be. Microtransactions, a min-maxing model, dlc-oriented sales etc., those things have ruined many of my favorite things lately and I cant shake the feeling that KSP2 will veer off towards that in some way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKsp1 is excellent BY ACCIDENT, if you think about it. It started unpretentiously with what was almost a mobile phone game and took off unexpectedly, with a small team and a lot of comunity content by competent fanatics.\u00A0It never followed a normal roadmap. Now however a studio picks up the franchise when it already has a reputation, and conducts development of a sequel\u00A0as any other major comercial game of the present. That is why constant postponements, few DDs about peripherical details make me shudder.
