You see someone who helped you out before, and you talk to him and he explains he needs help building a orbital shipyard. He has already put some of it in orbit around Kerbin, only requiring one more launch to make it operational. You say, \u0022I can do it, give me permissions to the ship and it\u0027s timewarp.\u0022 So he gives you the permisions and he goes off line. His ship is now in your timeline bubble, until he is given permissions of the ship.
