If science took time to transition between colonies, that would be interesting because colonies in a far-off star system would not have the same access to parts as the Kerbol system, and might need to spend some of their research points to unlock tech nodes that were already unlocked just to get new parts in time for important missions. This doesn\u0027t punish the player for uncontrollable (pushing buttons with delay) or easily avoidable (delay ahead of time) things, and also generates interesting gameplay. So, I think that craft should be immediately controllable as long as comms are open the entire way through, but science should spread slowly across the galaxy (maybe even slow enough that colonies could be seriously offset from each other, or make it a difficulty setting to change the speed)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually think this is a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereally cool idea.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0If science and new parts are limited by the speed of light it would mean that different solar systems would feel isolated to the player and would help emphasize the vastness of space between stars, something the devs have repeatedly said that they want the game to teach people.

It\u0027s ultimately just about a correlation between two (or more) particles. You can think of it this way: imagine you have a box that you know contains one spoon and one fork.\u00A0 You blindfold yourself and randomly put one of those into another box. The two boxes can now be thought of as an entangled system. You don\u0027t know what\u0027s in either box, but, if you were to look in one, you\u0027d immediately know what\u0027s in the other. Looking at it like this, it\u0027s easy to see why it can\u0027t be used for communication. Suppose you mailed one box to your friend across the world.
