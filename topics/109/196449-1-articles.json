KSP1 wasn\u0027t limited in what it brought to the table in terms of interesting sights to see and I really hope we can get some new stuff going forward. Heck even some unique ground scatter on Non-Kerbin planets that could support life would be pretty cool (plants, trees, maybe some sort of giant mushroom perhaps for us inclined to the fun of fungi? Perhaps mega-flora like massive lilypads we can land on that are scattered throughout the oceans of some far off planet?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat would you guys like to see added as an easter egg to spice the Kerbal solar system and the one\u0027s beyond it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-22T03:14:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2020 03:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Krulliam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-22T10:55:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been wondering that too...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe know that the terrain\u00A0itself will be more detailed, even if the\u00A0the basic geography remains about the same.\u00A0 With better \u0027ground scatter\u0027 generally, and maybe \u0027Breaking Ground\u0027 style scatter features integrated as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy gut feeling is that there may be a new \u0027Monolith\u0027 equivalent, but I am guessing they will probably all be in random locations (like the green ones) rather than having some in preset positions (black ones)\u00A0as they are now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the other \u0027anomalies\u0027 I think there will be couple of types, \u0027Natural\u0027 like unusual or\u00A0distinctive terrain features (Niagara Falls, Ayre\u0027s Rock etc) and \u0027Constructed\u0027 (Pyramids, Ancient/Alien ruins, crashed UFOs etc).\u00A0 But I expect these will\u00A0be in set locations, as they are now, but probably not the same locations as KSP1 (with the odd exception for things like the Armstong memorial).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OvinandRusk","CreatedById":206785,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-22T11:36:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMakes you wonder about what they got planned\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Souptime","CreatedById":204451,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-22T15:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOoh i got an idea: Some old parts from KSP1 scattered around the system, You could scan\u00A0them with a rover arm and the description could be like: \u0022You find what seems to be an old part from our space program, How did that get there?\u0022 Or maybe some KSP1 easter eggs like a small plaque on kerbin near the space center as a memento to KSP1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
