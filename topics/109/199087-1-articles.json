It would put an interesting twist on the game, but only would be available in the Normal and Advanced Difficulty. (Of course, clear weather is possible.) In Normal, you could get low winds, medium winds, rain, partially cloudy skies, and snow. In Advanced, you would get low winds, medium winds, high winds, rain, rainstorms, thunderstorms, partially cloudy, cloudy, heavily cloudy, snow, and hail. I think weather would be a good addition to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-26T17:01:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I recall correctly, don\u0027t quote me on this; take this with a grain of salt, KSP 2 suggestions and stuff don\u0027t go in the pile with KSP 1 stuff.

Doesn\u0027t have to be anything terribly complex, but it would add a lot of variety both to Kerbin and to some of the other worlds. Looking at what they\u0027re doing with atmospherics, it looks like they\u0027re planning to have stock clouds, so this already gets you part of the way to having weather.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think that physics effects on craft should be a difficulty toggle. I don\u0027t know if making severity of visual weather a difficulty setting is worth the hassle. All-or-nothing is definitely an option, and things like fog and other low-visibility conditions might be easy enough to turn on and off, but for weather overall, I\u0027d prefer a more global approach, where a very rudimentary 2D fluid sim runs across the planet\u0027s surface to determine the weather. You can make that work with a mesh of just a few hundred points and it will give you realistic cyclone systems, predominant wind patterns, etc. I think that\u0027d be worth the effort, but the downside is that if the sim says you\u0027re having a thunderstorm, you\u0027re having a thunderstorm. But so long as you can toggle severity of the wind effect on your craft and how bad visibility gets, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a big deal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jack Mcslay","CreatedById":208257,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-27T00:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you\u0027re overestimating how hard it would be to implement and how much it would actually add to the challenge.

So long as you aren\u0027t going for meteorological precision of predicting weather a week ahead, you don\u0027t need to run it with particularly high resolution or too many parameters. An isosphere with a few hundred points over the planet is adequate for such simulation, and you just need to track pressure, temperature, and humidity for each. Final step is faking vorticity by simply having wind blow along isobars at speed proportional to the pressure gradient, and you generate rain wherever relative humidity hits 100%. There are ways to improve on that by tracking these parameters at several altitudes. That would let you detect unstable atmosphere - which is a more reliable indicator of a thunderstorm, and identify areas that should contain fog. But it\u0027s not strictly necessary for basic sim. I\u0027d see how it works with pure 2D first, and then go to 2.5D model if necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-27T08:51:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast time this was discussed I was against it because it would just be a waiting simulator for Kerbin and a random failure mode for other atmospheric planets/moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat pretty much remains my opinion, but I see a window of opportunity to have it as a meaningful and engaging gameplay loop, not as a system on its own, but as a consequence/reason to launch and do weather analysis with satellites and probes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-27T09:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it would be particularly hard.

Anyone who did the Eve mission going in cold probably ended up with some stranded Kerbals at best. Likewise, one could say that inclined orbits are just a waiting simulator and/or random failure mode if you arrive at a planetary system and then realize that inclinations of the moons are all wrong relative to your arrival trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the trick is balancing it out so that you have options of planning around weather or pushing through it by being over-prepared. If inclement weather is punishing but not catastrophically so on its own, it could be a great gameplay element. Do you take the risk landing on Duna as soon as you can? Or do you drop some probes first to generate a forecast? Maybe if you have a backup for solar power, some extra fuel to land against the wind, and a more rugged lander, then you don\u0027t need to wait the sand storm out, and you can just go for the landing. And I don\u0027t think the weather on Kerbin should ever get so bad that you can\u0027t launch. But maybe in a strong wind you aren\u0027t going to get that nice 0\u00B0 inclination orbit just by holding the rocket steady at 90\u00B0 heading during gravity turn. So do you wait for better weather or do you eat the time and fuel cost of fixing your orbit once you clear the atmosphere? The biggest impact could be visibility for airplanes, but even there, simply adding a glide slope indicator to the navball when you\u0027re near a runway would basically let you do everything IFR. Given how instruments-heavy orbital transfers and even docking in the game are, I don\u0027t think having players learn to fly instruments\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eif\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0they want ability to fly planes in any weather is a huge ask. Likewise, learning a crawl landing is one more skill to tackle crosswinds, but it\u0027s not actually more advanced than anything else you have to do in the game. And nearly all of it is emergent gameplay you get simply for having weather.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there\u0027s a way to do it right, where it\u0027s purely an addition to the game. But your concerns are definitely valid as far as it being very easy to screw up and make weather into something that\u0027s just an annoyance. We\u0027ve seen Squad bounce a bit back and forward between a more relaxed game and more punishing sim, especially as far as interaction with atmosphere goes. Even parachutes started out as one-button problem solver, then became a huge headache, and now we have them more or less balanced where you have to put some thought into it, but aren\u0027t likely to crash just because your re-entry wasn\u0027t quite perfect. It sounds like Intercept is taking this as a lesson and are going to work on balancing all these aspects out, and I think if they were to implement the weather, they\u0027d be able to tune the severity of it to be a kind of challenge that will reward you for planning around or powering through as fits your play style or choice for particular mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jack Mcslay","CreatedById":208257,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-29T14:42:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223900465\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199087\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221609202363\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikewise, one could say that inclined orbits are just a waiting simulator and/or random failure mode if you arrive at a planetary system and then realize that inclinations of the moons are all wrong relative to your arrival trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlitches aside, that\u0027s entire the player\u0027s fault for not planning orbits correctly.

You can hit Jool \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E at pretty much any angle you want for free, so your encounter with Laythe is a guarantee, but your final inclination in Joolian orbit is going to be a function of when you arrive. So you have to time that if you want to end up in a plane similar to that of Bop.

You can bring a bit of extra fuel, timing just Kerbin-Jool window, and then hope your final orbit around Jool is good enough that you can fix with your reserves, being fully prepared to scrub your mission or strand some kerbals if you end up in particularly bad plane.
