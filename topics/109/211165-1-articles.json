Since there is now a sequel coming out soon that has the benefit of interstellar travel, and with it a myriad of other planets that could be found among the stars, it really feels that the idea is truly in the trash bin. But, should it? Would anyone really be against having gas planet 2 in the Kerbol system? I mean, it can\u0027t be exactly like what was originally planned, otherwise Eeloo would be a moon, and it\u0027s been around long enough on it\u0027s own that it doesn\u0027t feel right stripping it away from it\u0027s current position. Also, there is now a proper Saturn analog in the Deb Deb system, so using gp2\u0027s original idea of that being a Saturn analog in the Kerbol system seems somewhat redundant. Perhaps then it can be more of an analog to one of the ice giants, Uranus or Neptune? I don\u0027t know. But again, I ask, with the introduction of new star systems, does it make sense to still want a gas planet 2?

I quite agree making the surfaces more interesting is critical though. So far the general surface quality looks quite high and they\u2019ve heavily hinted at making anomalies a bigger part of the game. That plus a much more involved resource system and colonies will make the experience much more rewarding.
