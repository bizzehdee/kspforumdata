This is my first post on the forum. Considering I\u0027m coming up on the thousand hour mark in KSP it would do me some good to finally stop lurking and sign up.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThere\u0027s been a lot on my mind on the topic of what would represent \u0022the perfect Kerbal Space Program 2\u0022, and although I don\u0027t have the full picture in my brain of what a perfect version of the game would be to everyone, I do have a lot of ideas kicking around that I\u0027m desperate to get out somewhere other than an unseen post on the KSP subreddit.\u00A0 So with that in mind, \u003Cem\u003Emy \u003C/em\u003Eperfect KSP 2 would include things like:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u003Cstrong\u003EA way improved IVA interface\u003C/strong\u003E. It should be possible to conduct almost your entire mission from within the cockpit of whatever vehicle you\u0027re piloting, with the exception of fiddling around with hardware on your ship or doing crew transfers and the like. There definitely should be something approximating the map view on a monitor inside the craft, as well as selectable cameras pointing fore and aft, dorsal/ventral etc. Essentially IVA in KSP 2 ideally would leave the IVAExtended mod in the dust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. This one might be a lot to ask for, but \u003Cstrong\u003Ean ability to change the orbital mechanics system\u003C/strong\u003E in the base game at will in the launcher settings would be an amazing feature. There could be a \u0022normal\u0022 difficulty setting for instance, and \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022normal\u0022 mode would feature the traditional patched conics system (with the exception of course of Rask and Rusk, which uses restricted three-body mechanics.) I think it would be really cool if there would also be a \u0022hard\u0022 difficulty setting which would apply restricted n-body \u003Cem\u003Eeverywhere\u003C/em\u003E, so that you get something much more akin to the Principia mod but with a more refined UI. The map mode in this setting would have nice clunky selectable knobs for choosing map frame of reference and whether the view is inertial or not. In situations like flying near Rask and Rusk it will be important to select a non-inertial frame of reference so you know when you\u0027re going to make a collision.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E3. \u003Cstrong\u003EProjected point of impact when on suborbital trajectories. \u003C/strong\u003EThere\u0027s going to be a lot of advanced flying in KSP 2, and I think one of the nicer features that could be included would be a branching line to your trajectory, or perhaps simply an \u0022X marks the spot\u0022, which shows where on the relevant body you\u0027re going to make an impact. I know there are certain mods that do this already, but having it in the base game would be excellent. In a vacuum the line of impact will branch from your normal orbit line to compensate for the fact that the body is rotating underneath you, and in an atmosphere it will also compensate for your current coefficient of drag and lift and whatnot. Ideally it would also be able to account for having your engines on.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E4. \u003Cstrong\u003EAnother solar system which is basically our own in scale. \u003C/strong\u003EThis is one of those things that I actually do think the developers might already have planned for the game. We\u0027re going to have access to torch drives in the late game which allow for going further (or going the same distance and being able to be lazy, as it were.) One excellent feature would be to have a solar system which is full of planets similar in size to Sol\u0027s, complete with far more demanding delta-v challenges that the more futuristic propulsion systems will be up to the challenge of. Or for that matter, far larger conventional ones. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E5. \u003Cstrong\u003EA black hole!\u003C/strong\u003E This is a no-brainer. There will be all kinds of opportunities to include exotic space objects in the game. Black holes, being the coolest of all the exotic space objects, are a natural choice to be included in KSP 2. Depending on how the developers feel about this one there are several ways to do this. You could construct an entire system of planets around an \u003Cem\u003EInterstellar-\u003C/em\u003Estyle Gargantua black hole with a gently luminescing accretion disk providing warm \u0022sunlight\u0022 to the planets, or you could have a lone Cygnus X-1-style binary pair of a blue supergiant and a solar-mass black hole which is positively SCREAMING X-rays in all directions. It could be a challenge just to get near that one without vaporizing! Either way, I\u0027ve played the event horizon mod. Just like the mod, any black hole in KSP 2 should be a complete bear to do maneuvers around. I\u0027m talking dozens and dozens of km/s for useful maneuvers.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E6. \u003Cstrong\u003EOther miscellaneous exotic space objects\u003C/strong\u003E, even bordering on the fantastical. Rask and Rusk are clearly a toned-down Rocheworld stand-in. What other kinds of crazy destinations could be dreamed up and included in the game? How about a \u0022Mesklin\u0022 planet, whose surface gravity is intolerable at the poles yet spins so fast that it deforms into a giant disk which experiences only a few G\u0027s of gravity at the equator?Anything like it or other stuff included on the Atomic Rockets \u0022Fabulous Locations\u0022 page would be a great choice. You could have a planet that is really just a little nucleus of rock surrounded by an atmosphere thousands of kilometers deep, where the density gradually increases and the distinction between submarine and aircraft becomes blurred. You could have extremely violent binary neutron star pairs whose one-second-long years produce tides that induce deadly stresses in ships that get too near. Tidally locked worlds with halves desert hell\u00A0 and frozen wasteland separated by a twilight band of alien vegetation and hellish winds. The possibilities are endless.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E7. \u003Cstrong\u003EGreatly expanded options for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u003C/strong\u003EFor starters, a big selection of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters ranging from \u0022easily inhaled\u0022 to \u0022utterly absurd\u0022 would be great, especially if available using a wide variety of fuel types. If you wanna go really crazy you could add the ability to tie main thrusters into your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E system, so if you wanted to do split-second 180s all you\u0027d have to do is put some quad-clusters of mainsails all over your rocket. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E8. \u003Cstrong\u003EAbility to change the amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E authority. \u003C/strong\u003EThere are times when I\u0027m fighting to maintain orientation while plowing through an atmosphere, or when flying an airplane, that I really wish the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E would have a little more conviction in keeping the nose pointed where it needs to be. A slider which controls \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E aggression, or even the ability to change parameters in the PID system under the hood, would be really handy for moments like that.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E9. Sometimes I wish I could \u003Cstrong\u003ECreate maneuver nodes while sitting on the ground. \u003C/strong\u003EThis one would be really nice for when I need to lift off from a moon and make a quick intercept, or if I\u0027m unsure of the heading I need to start pitching towards. Being able to know exactly which way to burn off the ground can help a lot with that. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E10. \u003Cstrong\u003EMake all auto-timewarps take five seconds, regardless of how much time they\u0027re skipping through. \u003C/strong\u003EPretty please? Unless there\u0027s constant thrust involved of course.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E11. Another good one when it comes to flying is to \u003Cstrong\u003Eallow for planning periapse passes in maneuver nodes\u003C/strong\u003E when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is low. If I\u0027m in a 70 by 70 parking orbit of Kerbin and need to inject to Jool but my rocket can only pull a tenth of a G, I\u0027m going to need to do a bunch of periapse passes to avoid dumping all my gas straight down Kerbin\u0027s gravity well. In current KSP this is all fine and good until you start the burn on the second pass, at which point the maneuver node flips out and begins announcing you need 54687498 m/s in order to complete the injection. A good solution would be the ability to plan periapse passes right into the maneuver node interface. For instance you would start a node, and pull on the icons until you have your burn, but then you click on the \u0022periapse pass\u0022 button and your trajectory immediately behind and ahead of the node changes from blue to red- indicating the span of time in which you want to be firing your engines. You can drag this red section to be longer or shorter, but it will always be centered on your node. Depending on how wide the line is i.e. how long you\u0027re going to be burning on each pass, a counter will happily report to you the number of passes you\u0027ll need. Dragging the red line to be longer means fewer passes but more gravity losses, the counter will stop and warn you when you get to escape velocity, etc. etc.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E12. \u003Cstrong\u003EImproved navigation tools in the base game\u003C/strong\u003E would be awesome. I know they plan on having a delta-v map baked right into the game, but also having diagrams for planetary phase angles required to do transfers and diagrams showing where in orbit said ejection burn should be conducted would be cool. It would also be excellent to have a porkchop plot generator baked in as well. Really a whole suite of navigation tools akin to \u0022diet Mechjeb\u0022 would be ideal. I don\u0027t think they should go all the way on the automation because sometimes using Mechjeb makes me feel like I\u0027m watching a movie instead of flying a ship myself. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E13. \u003Cstrong\u003EAutomatic stationkeeping around the Rask/Rusk Lagrange points. \u003C/strong\u003EHow cool would it be to have a huge void city hanging out right there at the Rask/Rusk L2 point for my friends to come and visit? Regular deliveries of whatever \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel I\u0027m using would of course be needed to maintain the halo orbit. Speaking of massive void cities... \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E14. \u003Cstrong\u003ETreating large structures as single rigid bodies\u003C/strong\u003E unless violently collided with would do wonders to save my PC from certain torture. The main reason I never really make huge space stations or surface bases in KSP is because I got sick of my frames tanking to 3 per second whenever I closed in less than a couple of kilometers away. If you have elements that move such as centrifugal habitats, those could be a second rigid body. Just keeping the part count below 9,000 would be nice. Of course if your friend comes screaming in and rams the side of your station at 300 m/s then it goes back to many rigid bodies in order to simulate the destruction.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E15. On the topic of other players and destruction, an \u003Cstrong\u003Eoverhaul of the way the game handles high speed spacecraft \u003C/strong\u003Ewould allow for things to actually collide in orbit, and in the process open up the potential for orbital combat. I know there are people who maintain that KSP is all about peaceful exploration, but c\u0027mon. I should be able to joust in a retrograde orbit with my friends if I want to. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E16. I guess I\u0027ve kind of been implying it but \u003Cstrong\u003Emultiplayer needs to be separate craft flying simultaneously. \u003C/strong\u003ETime warp craziness aside, multiplayer where your friend is having all the fun flying and you\u0027re just sitting there as a copilot is no fun. I\u0027ve heard people suggest that\u0027s how it\u0027s going to be pulled off to solve the timewarp problem, but what kind of fun would that be? You should be able to race jets.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E17. I think it would be really cool to see \u003Cstrong\u003Eresource trading in multiplayer\u003C/strong\u003E to act as an incentive to play the game more. It would also be a good mechanic to diversify interactions with other players. Maybe someone else has spec\u0027d out into mining X resource on a celestial body which is basically the only place to get that resource, and you need some. Rather than go to the trouble of constructing a huge refinery there (or facing an attack of some sort if they have their refinery on the only good deposit), you could trade with that person using something that you have. Maybe you\u0027re the only guy on the (server?) with a high enough tech level to manufacture Wyvern engines. You contact them, and strike up a deal. Side note: making certain critical resources endemic to certain areas (especially small ones) would be a good way to encourage staking of territories. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E18. Finally, I think that the general form that KSP 2 multiplayer should take is that of \u003Cstrong\u003Elarge multiplayer servers with the server available for download \u003C/strong\u003Eso that it can still be played years and years down the line. Central servers are nice and all, but no one wants to see multiplayer disappear altogether just because somebody decides that they don\u0027t need to support it years and years down the line. I should be able to take an old rig and keep it in the corner as a KSP 2 server in 2042 if I want to. Either way, a big point I would love to see is that any given server is a persistent game hosting many, many players all interacting with each other.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E19. \u003Cstrong\u003EHave kerbals react appropriately to extreme G forces.\u003C/strong\u003E I wanna see Jeb struggle to breathe if I step on the gas and pull seven G\u0027s! I know they already move around a bit but \u0022extreme G load\u0022 would be something you could add as easily as \u0022state of extreme panic\u0022.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E20. It would be great if you could \u003Cstrong\u003Esmoothly change the rigidity of part connections in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. In the original KSP there\u0027s either 0% rigid or 100% rigid with no in-between. I think it would be nice to be able to reduce the amount of back and forth hotdogging my especially-long rocket will do on ascent without having it be extremely brittle.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E21. Something that would go nice with that weird deep atmosphere world is the inclusion of \u003Cstrong\u003Elighter than air lifting bodies \u003C/strong\u003Ewhether blimp, dirigible, hot air balloon, vacuum shell etc. would be cool for making floating bases. The vacuum shells would be for thinner atmospheres only.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E22. \u003Cstrong\u003ETons more things to do on the surface \u003C/strong\u003Eof various planets and bodies would be excellent. More interesting terrain, more in-depth resource harvesting, more in-depth base construction and manufacturing supply chains would all be things ripe for gameplay opportunities.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E23. Lastly, it would be really cool to see \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe remnants of some long-dead alien civilization\u003C/strong\u003E in the form of an abandoned stanford torus or hollowed-out asteroid that you could potentially land on/in and explore. If you wanted to go really crazy you could make it a giant Banksian orbital or something.

I can easily keep myself amused without artificial objectives. I\u0027m slightly worried the new colony system may prevent this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. (Keep) single player mode. I\u0027m not interested in multiplayer. I like isolated worlds. I like being the first person to land on a planet or moon, and the sense of wonder. The thought of landing on a populated Mun with huge bases and rockets zooming around everywhere wrecking everything fills me with dread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Lots of interesting propulsion tech and construction methods, on small scales as well as large. I\u0027m worried KSP seems to be evolving into ever bigger and more robust parts with everyone building enormous rockets. I like building small stuff and refining it to be as efficient as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Better predictions for target intersects on the map screen. The current prediction only seems to update when you pass a certain point on the orbit, sometimes can\u0027t predict more than one orbit, and often just turns into a flickering confused mess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Some simple remote control or programming of detached stages, and them being subject to physics rather than on rails, e.g. probes attached to first stages to recover them to the pad or later stages or landers that can be de-orbited while you continue to fly the primary craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Options to remove categories of parts you never use. I only build rockets, I don\u0027t care about aeroplane parts and I certainly don\u0027t want to build boats or submarines(!). The game would load faster if I could de-activate selected categories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the preview graphics look amazing.
