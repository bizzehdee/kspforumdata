Trailing body flaps I suppose are already there for KSP1, but this would have to work on the sides as well for full control - and with S.A.S. The control laws would have to take into account the direction the vessel is moving (\u003Cem\u003Ethis would usually be bottom first\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E for the entry stage\u003C/em\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I will be needing a re-entry fin canard\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E on the front, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. a combination of a canard and starship fin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"isdi0","CreatedById":207247,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-16T15:36:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be cool, I agree\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kedrednael","CreatedById":177175,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-16T15:45:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps in KSP2 you can also reshape control surfaces to any size you want.
