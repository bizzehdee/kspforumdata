I thought it would be advantageous to deliver fuel from the Mun or Minmus, Minmus turned out better due to the lower gravity, but still the problem of extracting the fuel and sending it to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E was a lot more complicated and time consuming than simply launching filled tanks from Kerbin.

This was aided by the development of a rendezvous method where I could estimate the right time to launch and generally reach rendezvous within a single orbit, so it took very little time and effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee I think creating incentives that are so strong that players will always play one way is not actually what we\u0027re after. I found that setting up fueling from Minmus easier and you found launching from Kerbin was easier. That\u0027s okay! And of course both options will be much less time consuming with automated supply routes, and the ability to actually build whole vessels outside of deep gravity wells will change the calculus again. This is why I mentioned chess earlier. The idea isn\u0027t to just keep adding rules on rules on rules, its to carefully tune them so that lots of players will find lots of different strategies that work for them. For instance we\u0027ve talked in the past about how the game might work without money. Now, on the surface one might think \u0022well now there\u0027s even less incentive to build off-world because everything is free\u0022 but that doesn\u0027t necessarily need to be the case. I think a good solution would be giving \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E a fuel/resource depot that refills over time up to a certain cap, and would require spending science to upgrade. That would mean players could either invest at home in bigger and bigger launch vehicles from Kerbin or could invest science in developing colony tech and develop that way. If you\u0027re spending resources at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E then its really just a starter colony and obeys most of the same rules, it just happens to be in a deep gravity well and under a thick atmosphere. There are also now boom events to consider, which may hold some unlocks and bonuses that encourage players to actually land a probe on another planet rather than grinding endlessly away in KSOI. You deliberately want those incentives finely balanced so that there are always interesting strategic choices.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-12-11T17:03:42Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2022 05:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-11T17:41:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224207757\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210976\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221670775381\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re literally incorrect.

But the beauty of the game is that you really don\u0027t have to play the easiest version of something. In KSP1, for instance, I\u0027ll almost never launch any kind of interplanetary ship that doesn\u0027t have twice as many seats as it needs for the crew, because I want to give the Kerbals a comfortable amount of space. In theory I could just strap a mk1 cockpit to a NERV, but I want the added realism (as much as a game about little green aliens going to space can be realistic) of giving the crew enough space that they don\u0027t lose their minds on the way to their destination. Putting in similar self-imposed restrictions is a good way to get around the fear of KSP2 being too easy - whether that\u0027s overbuilding things to be redundant, NASA style, or refusing to use certain kinds of engines for fear that they\u0027ll trivialize the good old fashioned art of a Kerbin - Mun transfer. Other people will take the easy road, but I mean, who cares? They\u0027ve been doing it all this time already anyway, and they\u0027ll keep doing it in KSP2. (To go back to the crew space example, you don\u0027t see me getting mad at Matt Lowne for sending 500 kerbs to Laythe on a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E with about 1 cubic meter of space per kerbal!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR, you can always put restrictions on yourself if mod developers and Take Two both fail at giving you the level of depth you need, just as has always been the option in KSP1. Personally, I think it\u0027d be really fun to see someone manage to build a full colony with only conventional chemical rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Also, a lot of the suggestions for added depth in KSP2 are hinted at, implied, or outright stated to be coming on launch: radiation protection, life support, waste heat management, better maneuver planning, improved orbit physics,etc. So not all of your restrictions will have to be self-imposed.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"garwel","CreatedById":141813,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-11T21:49:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224207546\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210976\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221670720157\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268648\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Master39\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Master39 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point here is that you\u0027re presenting your personal preference as some sort of objectively better option, a deeper and more meaningful game, when it\u0027s really just that, a personal preference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re proposing to make doing the same things people used to do in KSP1 more difficult, instead of adding any real new destinations or objectives.

In the same manner, you and other people talk about your preferences: you want new destinations, for instance. It\u0027s fine by me, and I\u0027m a bit surprised by people who get aggressive simply because I have different opinions about a video game. But well, it\u0027s the Internet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is one premise I disagree with though: my desires and fears make no sense, because modders will add everything the base game lacks. The very same argument applies to other planetary systems and new parts. In fact, adding new celestial bodies, engines etc. is easier than adding completely new mechanics in the sense that you are only changing game\u0027s resources, not its code. If KSP2 has something like a built-in Kopernicus (IIRC, it\u0027s been promised) and better engine support for multiple solar systems, anyone will be able to add new planets, stars, moons and whatnot as well as all sorts of realistic or completely fictional engines and other parts. We\u0027ve even seen with KSP1 that modders are often better at that than game devs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOTOH, adding completely new mechanics to the game works much worse. In KSP 1, it usually involves various hacks, custom interfaces that feel alien to the stock game and to other mods, lots of compatibility issues, performance impact etc. There is a limit to what you can do with gameplay mods and how well optimized they can be without completely breaking the game or other mods.\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003ESo in fact, game developers who actually write its code are best placed to add such features. Maybe even more importantly, designing these features, making them balanced, fun and easy to interact with also takes a lot of effort. Unpaid modders who usually work alone or in very small groups can hardly replace a full-fledged game dev studio here.

With your experience, I\u0027d recommend trying it out and seeing how branching outwards adds more depth to the game than more levels of brute force Isp and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, I did my first (sadly un-recorded) Jool-5 mission a few months ago after going back to Stock, and the mission had a lot of considerations to manage. I could have replicated the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cost by simply having a mission go between Minmus and the Mun a few dozen times, but landing and returning from Jool\u0027s moons requires rockets that are different from those that can land on the moons. I had to consider whether I wanted my mothership to be able to land (which meant balancing fuels for each part of the trip) and how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E each sub-lander should have. I put together an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E system to refuel on Pol and consolidated the Vall and Bop landers, but Tylo and Lathe have completely different requirements to the rest of the moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of them is atmospheric and a vacuum-designed craft would not be stable, and the other needs the most \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E possible to land and get off of. Designing a lander to be able to get off of both planets (while staying small enough to transport via the mothership) was more challenging than if both planets were just differently sized balls of rock, and presented interesting gameplay. Overall, the mission was a lot more in-depth design-wise than it would have been if all the planets were, as you said, just about the size of the rocket.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is, having these destinations is one way that the game gets more depth. This works in Stock as well as with challenging mods. If you decide to do an interplanetary mission, you will discover another side to all the mechanics you added via mods. Your life support mods now present an interesting balance between longevity and weight, when you only had to optimize for one or the other before, in bases or ships. Your part failure mods are now much more complex and interesting to manage as the complexity of interplanetary landing missions dwarfs even surface bases on the Moon or Mun. Your radiation, signal delay, and fuel boil-off mods suddenly take on a new dimension as you have to manage distances, times, and circumstances that you never had to consider near your starting planet. I\u0027d recommend even attempting a crewed landing on Mars or whatever planet is easiest to get to with your mods, and you might see how people are satisfied with even the simplified mechanics of Stock, applied to interplanetary and now interstellar challenges.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Catto","CreatedById":137773,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-11T23:05:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPshhhhh i don\u0027t want space travel at all\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t even want travel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-11T23:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224207893\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210976\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221670796400\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022141813\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022garwel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, garwel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nonce you\u0027ve been to one planet, the difference is only the size of the rocket and the textures you see on the screen\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause Stratzenblitz\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E infinity sea-level ship works the same way as any other rocket and took 0 imagination to build...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the only difference is the size of the rocket then you\u0027re not even bothering to learn how you can make these trips more efficiently.
