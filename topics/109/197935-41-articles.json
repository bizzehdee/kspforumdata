The fact that they aren\u0027t showing it to you isn\u0027t because they don\u0027t care or arent good at their jobs, its because they are wisely keeping some WIP under wraps until its 99% dialed in.

Imagine if they were to show some half-baked glitchy version of multiplayer rife with continuity problems?
