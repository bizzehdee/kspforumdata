I\u00A0would like to post this to commemorate all who developed Kerbal Space Program.It\u00A0is truly a miracle that a single\u00A0idea gave rise to one of the most beloved simulators of our time. And none of that would of been possible if it were not for a small,\u00A0talented, and supportive gaming studio. Few developers are authentic enough to listen to their community and support the game every step of the way. Their efforts have now created a new gaming genre. And it\u00A0will continue to become a completely new gaming experience. PC and console players alike love this game and are going\u00A0nuts for what will come after Kerbal space program.

Yes I do not know much about\u00A0how games are made. But take a look at some\u00A0of the most disliked video game trailers of last decade. The most\u00A0notorious\u00A0of which was call of duty infinite. Their fans clearly felt betrayed and did not want another sci-fi shooter. Players want developers that can support and listen to their fans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-25T15:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome content has been removed from this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonal attacks are never helpful to any discussion and are disallowed under the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/guidelines/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ECommunity Guidelines\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to discuss the merits of various ideas, but keep the personal remarks out of posts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank You for Your Understanding,\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP Moderation Team\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-26T03:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet again, some posts and comments have been removed.\u00A0 Please folks, you know the rules of this community.\u00A0\u00A0 Feel free to attack the argument, not the person.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-26T05:31:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I don\u0027t feel like the amount that Squad listens to the community has waned over the years.\u00A0 The process by which they collect feedback, and their manner of communication to the community has\u00A0evolved over time, but our feedback hasn\u0027t exactly\u00A0fallen on deaf ears.\u00A0 Early on, like REALLY early on in the alpha days of KSP 1, the community was small and the dev team indeed had more direct interaction.\u00A0 But as the game grew in scope and depth, so did the KSP community, which led to community managers, less talking directly to the devs as the staff itself grew, etc.\u00A0 But if the last several\u00A0years of updates are any indication, they ARE in fact listening to our feedback (not necessarily implementing everything we want obviously).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor those of us that have been around KSP long enough, I can\u0027t tell you how many mods are no longer in use because of features or gameplay aspects Squad has added to just the base game for free; I\u0027m not even talking about DLC\u0027s.\u00A0 On occasion, they even reversed plans when the community waved their hands in protest (a la the great \u0022ROUND8\u0022 revolt of 2015).\u00A0 And let\u0027s not confuse \u0022development disagreement\u0022 with \u0022ignoring the community\u0022.\u00A0 A development team, even when faced with overwhelming support for the addition of a\u00A0potential feature, may still disagree with what or how something will be implemented based on a variety of reasons, such as coding/engine/hardware performance limitations, development time/budget, priority over other features, bug fixes, or simply long-term direction for development of the game, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the interaction that Star Theory has or has not had with the\u00A0KSP community, that\u0027s sort of open to interpretation.\u00A0 However, (again\u00A0my opinion)\u00A0I don\u0027t think we know enough about what, where, or how in regards to the state of KSP 2 development\u00A0to make a determination on whether Star Theory is \u0022involved enough\u0022 with the community.\u00A0 The fact they apparently talk to Squad on a regular basis, and their creative producer\u00A0is a diehard KSP fan, along with other members of their staff, I\u0027m not too worried.\u00A0 When it is\u00A0permissible to talk to the community about\u00A0KSP 2, I\u0027m sure they will.\u00A0 I think it is quite unlikely that the value of that communication would be\u00A0lost on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-26T15:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do have to share my appreciation for Squad.
