Will have any changes to it? I love seeing diversity in parts and how cool rockets and specifically landers can look but currently there are only 2 landing modules (alternatively lander cans) in the \u00A0base KSP1 tech tree. I feel like this is too little even with the additional landing module in the Breaking Grounds expansion. Additionally there are only 6ish normal Command Modules in the KSP1 tech tree, I feel like this too little with the scale of KSP2. Will there be more part diversity especially with modules in KSP2 and just in general with early game tech tree parts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand if the question still can\u2019t be answered if the game developers feel like answering a question like this might be too revealing before launch. \u00A0Needless to say, I\u2019m still really excited for Kerbal Space Program 2. The developers of the game are some of the best most active developers, especially Nate Simpson who is such a good person to be representing Kerbal Space Program 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for taking the time to read!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- the spy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-11T06:42:20Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2022 06:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by TruffleSpy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-11T09:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmaybe. but also maybe earlygame in ksp 2 willlast much shorter in ksp 2.\u00A0 what im the most sure about is that late game parts will have moore variation\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
