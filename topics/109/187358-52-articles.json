Going back to the minmus base example, if the players were only separated by space, they would see each other doing their activities even if they couldn\u2019t reach each other, whereas if they were also separated by time, one player \u003Cstrong\u003Emight not even see that the other is active in the area\u003C/strong\u003E. Given that several systems only have multiplayer as visual interaction, and that even the subspace bubble solution goes to some lengths to give the appearance of other players doing things, even if it is just a recording, you probably also know that seeing other players doing their things is an important part of the experience. So, \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy would you choose to watch a recording that you can\u2019t interact with, when you could watch real-time actions that you can\u2019t interact with?\u003C/strong\u003E Also remember that once you close the spatial gap, \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou then have to take the extra step of closing the time gap, which I would prefer not doing if it means all my craft in transit overshoot their destinations.\u003C/strong\u003E I personally would be stuck always looking at recordings of players, even when we are driving around on the same square kilometer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are a really good set of questions, and the reasons I\u0027m so conflicted between the two approaches. I think they\u0027re worth breaking down consecutively.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) \u003Cstrong\u003ECan you see where (and when) a player is active?\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThe answer under both paradigms is yes\u003Cem\u003E, mostly.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EIf I\u0027m in the subspace paradigm I can zoom out in map mode and potentially see where a player\u0027s active flight is, but only if they\u0027re in a stable orbit. All transits will be either visible nonsense, traveling to planets that aren\u0027t where I think they are, or more probably just not visible. If I\u0027m in the leapfrog paradigm Im going to see vessels as they are in my own time. So if someone\u0027s vessel is en-route to Jool I\u0027ll see it as it was when I am, not as it is when another player who\u0027s a few hundred days ahead of me sees it. However, we\u0027ll both see the same orbital path and have a coherent and consistent idea how we would intercept it if we wished.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) \u003Cstrong\u003EW\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehy would you choose to watch a recording that you can\u2019t interact with, when you could watch real-time actions that you can\u2019t interact with?\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThe simplest answer is most probably you don\u0027t actually want to interact simultaneously except under very specific, probably rare circumstances like rover racing. Most of the time--intercepting a station or vessel or landing basically anywhere--you don\u0027t want to try to be hitting a target whose position might arbitrarily change during the encounter. That is unless you\u0027re racing or fighting you almost certainly would prefer other players were \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E changing vessels\u0027 courses in real time. If you\u0027re trying to build together or trade anything\u00A0then there should be some kind of way for players to communicate permissions, agree on quantities, etc, but that\u0027s a real-time interface that\u0027s separate from the in-engine, map mode, trajectory-tracking view. You almost certainly want to establish those parameters up front with anyone you might interact with.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, this is just a hunch, but my guess is in the sense of local, temporally consistent reality the timing between interactions between vessels wouldn\u0027t most often be off by more than a hundred days or so. The reason for this is transfer windows. With groups of 3 or even 12 players you\u0027re going to get these waves of launches right around windows that all arrive with more-or-less similar trajectories at Duna, Eve, Jool , etc. all around the same time. You might be off by 20 or even 50 days but most of these things are arriving pretty close. If you were to skip a window to any given planet no sweat, you\u0027re just coming down the pike several hundred days later, which is fine, because you\u0027re still ahead of the last-edit date of everything that arrived earlier. Later in the game with things like Duna-to-Jool windows and crazy torch engines things might get a bit weirder,\u00A0 but even to get to that point one thing is certain--a great deal of time has passed. You\u0027re watching a recording of where things were the last time other players left them, but you can still interact with them because you\u0027re coming in\u003Cem\u003E after they did.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) \u003Cstrong\u003EY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eou then have to take the extra step of closing the time gap, which I would prefer not doing if it means all my craft in transit overshoot their destinations.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EYou don\u0027t though, again, because by the nature of traversing time and space you\u0027re already going to be ahead of the things you\u0027re encountering most of the time.\u00A0They\u0027re no longer greyed out because by the act of transit you\u0027ve leapfrogged them. The only trick would be if you want to dogfight or race rovers around Laythe together and some players are hundreds of days behind others. In that case you have two choices: Prep your vessels and colonies for a long warp to catch up, or more probably--just start a new sandbox group session outside of your coop-build where you can do anything without screwing things up, because as far as I can imagine none of things that you would do in-synch\u00A0 has anything to do with progression.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

Yes, you\u0027d see a craft with a trajectory going nowhere, but you aren\u0027t going to be able to intercept it outside of the transfer window without a very expensive burn, so just like the planets line up while you are intercepting in the leapfrog model, the planets line up while you are intercepting in the subspace model.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224185985\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221665797119\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, this is just a hunch, but my guess is in the sense of local, temporally consistent reality the timing between interactions between vessels wouldn\u0027t most often be off by more than a hundred days or so. The reason for this is transfer windows. With groups of 3 or even 12 players you\u0027re going to get these waves of launches right around windows that all arrive with more-or-less similar trajectories at Duna, Eve, Jool , etc. all around the same time. You might be off by 20 or even 50 days but most of these things are arriving pretty close. If you were to skip a window to any given planet no sweat, you\u0027re just coming down the pike several hundred days later, which is fine, because you\u0027re still ahead of the last-edit date of everything that arrived earlier. Later in the game with things like Duna-to-Jool windows and crazy torch engines things might get a bit weirder,\u00A0 but even to get to that point one thing is certain--a great deal of time has passed. You\u0027re watching a recording of where things were the last time other players left them, but you can still interact with them because you\u0027re coming in\u003Cem\u003E after they did.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile players that play more slowly and skip transfer windows will be fine (because the other players probably play enough to catch up), the discrepancies become much larger and more negative when a player plays less. That player might arrive at Duna at the \u003Cem\u003Esame transfer window\u003C/em\u003E as the other players (or one later, but that shouldn\u0027t hurt them), but everyone else is already colonizing Jool. Unlike the player you talked about, this one is not only coming late to the party but is also behind, which means they can\u0027t interact. At this stage it shouldn\u0027t matter too much since time warping a few thousand days won\u0027t interrupt anything important. But one that player is colonizing Jool (on-pace with the other players according to the in-game clock, or maybe a few years behind if they warped once they got to Duna), they can\u0027t catch up without messing up some new mission, and the other players are simultaneously moving way into the future, doing interstellar missions lasting decades and building up their infrastructure over centuries. If someone was at that point but was a few centuries late in-game, they could still interact with the other players since they are after the last interaction (they would lock down everyone else\u0027s bases through that though), but someone who arrives late in real-time won\u0027t be able to interact, and in the end-game, catching up by decades or centuries is infeasible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that was the first thing, that players who just play less are really negatively impacted even if everyone stayed on pace, and then the second thing is that I don\u0027t think people will stay on pace. If you have a player who jumps on the first transfer window available and a player who skips a few, neither one of them are going to change pace. It is the responsibility of the faster player to warp to synchronize with the slower player, and call me a cynic but I don\u0027t see that happening very much.
