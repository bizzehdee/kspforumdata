Humans are emotional creatures and feelings pervade everything we do. Are customers satisfied? Do vendors and subs feel screwed over? Do clients trust you? If you have a bad quarter or make a big mistake does your employer or investors have faith that you\u0027ll fix things? It\u0027s based on numbers, but having the theory of mind to understand how others will react is absolutely fundamental to it.

Of course you can take shortcuts and burn people to eek out a few more bucks, but if you\u0027re actually trying to build real value over the long term you need to maintain your reputation. Honor your agreements, pay your bills,\u00A0and treat people honestly and fairly. Thats just across the board.
