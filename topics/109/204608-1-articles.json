There are a few semi-knowns: prospecting is going to be important, there will be harvestable resource(s), and from that we\u0027ll be making rocket parts and at least 8 different fuel types. What Im really hoping for is that different bodies and different regions on those bodies will have different overlapping resource values that make selecting colony sites important and will drive players to adapt unique development strategies based on what they find. For instance one location might be richer in uranium\u00A0and metals for making rocket parts, another might have better access to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, H2, and geothermal, and it would be up to the player how to exploit and combine those resources and what types of fuel-infrastructures they should invest in. Ideally there would be sites that were very attractive because they had more overlapping value, but that no one place would have everything you need so you\u0027d have\u00A0to be clever about how you built and moved things around.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs far as intermediate resources go I tend to agree that while Factorio has some kernels that might be useful its way more complicated than colony resources should be (although assuming universal plumbing takes care of most of that). Still, some intermediate resources might facilitate flexible player strategies without overcomplicating things, especially if they were dove-tailed into fuel production. For instance you could start with basic resources like Metalic Ore, Ice, Hydrocarbons, and Regolith, from which you could produce raw materials like Metals, Uranium, and Polymers for making rockets but also \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, Monoprop, H2, MH, and HE3 depending on what processing equipment you\u0027d built. Part of the evolution of your colony then would be shifting your resource collection and processing capabilities to expand what kind of engines you could utilize, for instance by shifting hydrocarbon extraction toward polymers for making new habitats as you phased out \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and phased in H2 rockets.\u00A0This all might still be too much, but thats something Im sure Intercept has put a lot of thought into and will be testing like crazy before release.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-02T16:54:04Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2021 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-02T18:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57710-k2/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002257710\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57710-k2/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@K^2\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105624\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pthigrivi\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0if you look at Pathfinder, MKS, ELP, Ground Construction they have reasonable production trees associated with them.

They work well until you reach a point where all you\u0027re doing is moving resources around. At that point they fall apart. That\u0027s a KSP1 limitation.

Once you figured out the production chain, it wasn\u0027t too bad. (Had to look at the configs to figure out what did what.) Only 1-2 intermediary products required from raw resource to finished good to complete the chain.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
