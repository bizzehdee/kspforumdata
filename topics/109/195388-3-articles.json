If KSP2 is going to move away from being a tycoon/management game and focus on just being a rocket building and flying simulator then you may be right that this system is overly complex and doesn\u0027t really add anything. However if the devs want to improve the management aspect of the game then time management is a huge aspect of this type of gameplay and needs to have a full suite of construction time and related features to properly flesh it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s fine and all, and a fair debate to have.

Mods are great and all but why not give the player more control over what they want out of the stock game? Personally I dislike mods and have never used them. That\u0027s just me.

Where\u0027s the harm in letting the player choose for themselves if that\u0027s something the devs can offer? I personally wouldn\u0027t care either way if it was in my game, but I\u0027d rather at least have the option there for me to just click it on or off, than for me to have to go download someone else\u0027s stuff to do the same thing. (No offense to the modding community out there.) Of course the argument could be made about every mod out there and why it isn\u0027t in the stock game, but of course then that debate would never end soo... here we are. The real question is, is it worth the developer\u0027s time to make the thing in the first place? Construction timers? Eh. I\u0027d rather them develop something else more interesting. But if they feel it\u0027s going to make the game better, then why not let them?

But when I eventually build up my Adventure Mode to the point I have six separate missions going on at the same time, is a construction timer going to seriously impact my experience playing the game? No. I\u0027ll just go do something else in the mean time. We won\u0027t be spending the entire game in the first phase of development of our space program. Eventually we\u0027ll move past that and we\u00A0won\u0027t even regard the timers as an issue there. Sure that doesn\u0027t solve the \u0022problem\u0022 (If that\u0027s how you choose to see it) of them being there in the first place. But this is why difficulty options are a thing. Not just in KSP either. A whole plethora of games from Doom to Minecraft have them so a player can choose how they want to experience their gameplay.

For me its the other way around. I really dislike how it currently works in stock and thus always play with KCT. What I don\u0027t buy is the notion that it doesn\u0027t add anything of value or that it would scare new or existing players away. Several posts in this thread have presented what I see as good arguments for things that a construction time feature would bring to the game. I won\u0027t reiterate them in detail here, but the whole concept of having to plan not only the missions themselves, but also the timing of them, is very appealing to me. I\u0027m sure there are others who feel the same way. Now I know this too comes down to personal preference; what\u0027s appealing to me might be appaling to you. However, everyone who wants this feature included seems to agree that it should be optional or at the very least a separate game mode. This, I think, would be an acceptable compromise between those who want the feature and those who don\u0027t. Sure, anything new added to the game will inevitable cause bugs and that\u0027s a valid concern, but if we shy away from expanding the game because of that, then it will never grow at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSaying that it\u0027s a pointless feature if it can be skipped via time warp is true to an extent, but the same could be said for all other aspects of the game too. By using the built-in cheat menu, quicksaving and loading, or even just playing in sandbox, we can neuter just about every challenge presented to us. The question is, do we? In the end, it comes down to how dedicated we, as players, are to the way we want to play the game. I like the idea of things taking time to build and will adapt my style to that end. Having said that, I can see how construction time with no or few other parameters tied to it or affected by it could be seen as boring and a waste of time. Personally, I think that in order to really get the most out of it, other additions would have to be made as well. Things like life support, parts/craft inventories and maybe even part failures, but that is a whole other topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the idea that adding construction time would somehow cause a substantial loss of customers seems, at least to me, to be based mostly on pure speculation and possibly a hint of projection. I have a hard time seeing how new players, coming in fresh with no preconceived ideas of what KSP should be, would think of this feature as anything other than just another part of the game. If they don\u0027t like it, they will just not tick the box that activates it. The same could be argued for existing players who are not interested in this new feature. I think it\u0027s fair to assume that most of them would also leave the option off. Of course, this is now speculation on my part, but based on how past additions to the game\u0027s mechanics have panned out, I think it\u0027s a reasonable conclusion. If the option to disable construction time was not there however, then I\u0027d be squarely on the side of those who decry it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately, for me at least, it doesn\u0027t matter too much if construction time is added or not. I like the concept and would definitely use it, but it\u0027s not the hill I\u0027d choose to die on. Especially since there will most likely be mods that provide the same functions and probably more. That being said, I find it slightly arrogant to say that those who really do want this feature added should instead be forced to rely on those mods (and face the problems that come with them), when the feature in question is one that should be fairly easy to implement in stock and one that would be completely optional to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-08T12:06:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223816967\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195388\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221594203877\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278020\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, AlamoVampire said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, us stating: put X feature in and i wont buy it/use it and the inevitable debate that makes is a good tool to gauge ideas.
