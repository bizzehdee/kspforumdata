From my understanding, we\u0027ve seen a couple variations of Nuclear energy production for colonies in the game. Solar panels have always been a big part of producing energy for various crafts and satellites, but I was curious to see if anything regarding \u003Cstrong\u003Ewind, wave, geothermal, or biogas\u00A0energy\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0has been referenced somewhere? For example, if you\u0027re on a planet with strong tides a coastal colony with wave-based energy generators would be plausible.\u00A0 Or if you\u0027re on a planet with a dense atmosphere and plan on building a colony at higher altitudes perhaps some wind turbines would be best.\u00A0I think it\u0027s great that we get to see near-future technologies being implemented into the game, but there are a great deal of other viable ways to generate electricity on other planets. Technologies such as these are becoming increasingly more affordable. I think in the early stages of colony construction renewable energy technology could be a vital solution as they don\u0027t require a source of fuel (Disregarding resource cost for construction of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs someone with experience in Environmental Science, I think implementing alternative energy production is crucial in any desolate environment due to minimal maintenance and cost. This might even make colony placement decisions more interesting by strategically developing colonies in locations where environmental features matter and\u00A0they can be self-sustaining without the need for additional input of fuel resources. Let me know your thoughts!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-24T03:37:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes. We do! And welcome!

Thank you for sharing. I\u0027ve gotta say it definitely changed my thoughts on how viable tidal energy would be on other planets. Our planet is extremely complex in terms of climate systems. Unfortunately there are a lot of systems that wouldn\u0027t be at play that contribute to tides and waves on planets with simpler designs in KSP. Things like nutrients in water, and even biological factors like microorganisms all contribute to how water flows across large bodies. Our planet relies on Thermohaline\u00A0Circulation, which is driven through a number of variables. (Temperature Distribution, Ocean Depth, Salinity, etc.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like mapping the strength of ocean currents on a map similar to how wind strength would be mapped would definitely be a stretch because there are a larger sum of variables at play when it comes to tidal formations and the strength at which waves form. The best way to dumb something like this down would be with two variables, How deep is the water, and what is the proximity of orbiting bodies. Planets with closer moons would have stronger tides overall than planets without moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, waves would be stronger the closer you are to a shoreline or coast, and then overall are either increased or decreased via the mass and proximity of orbiting moons. As we\u0027ve seen with some of the exoplanets mentioned before, how these planets interact would be a huge problem. Normally a simple one time calculation would be done at the beginning of a game to determine these maps, but if the distance between planets and moons is changing it would definitely impact tidal formations. Depending on how complex these calculations are, it could use up unnecessary processing power for something that has a single use.

However, the time and effort needed to code, implement, test, and playtest it would be. It\u0027s a complex system and ultimately the gameplay impact is going to be fairly marginal. A weather/climate simulation with wind, precipitation, etc. would have a much bigger impact, and Nate has already said that that\u0027s off the table.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kernel Kraken","CreatedById":181383,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-01T15:10:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming Kerbals are a plant-based water creature, I want to melt my dead ones into Biodiesel for colony generators.

One of the best parts in it was finding the perfect location for the kind of fortress you wanted to build. Finding somewhere with coal and flux and iron and magma and proximity to water but not TOO much water was not easy, and it was super rewarding when you did find it, and even more rewarding when you managed to put those resources into use.

In my mind, this could avoid having to cope with the intricacies of geothermal power (finding the right spot, drilling, building a heat exchanger) ingame.

Again, it would theoretically be feasible (game-play-wise) to use\u00A0 overall mean value (i.e. average surface wind speed) for each planet to determine how much energy can be generated with a given turbine.
