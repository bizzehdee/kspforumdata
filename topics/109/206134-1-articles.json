Imagine if all our wildest dreams came true? Also, while rewatching the colony generator parts, they had kerbals meandering around. Now that may have been just added for scale or what not, but i wonder if when you set up colonies there will be A.I. Kerbals that have like preprogrammed tasks that are just kind around. Like random ones welding big generators or just, well, walking around. Like when they said that when you do a supply run for fuel or ore or what have you, you only need to do it once, then its automatic afterwards.
