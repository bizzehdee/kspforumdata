With new hyper-volatile fuels in the new game, how will explosions be revised?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally hope that when a craft explodes, each exploding part will apply a certain explosion force in a radius (decreasing as the explosion dissipates) which can push other craft and parts. This could lead to a lot of creativity, such as dropping bombs of Orion drive fuel to launch craft very fast and would also incentivize landing safely if you want to preserve your kerbals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"intelliCom","CreatedById":209738,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-24T04:15:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProject Orion mass driver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-24T04:19:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2022 04:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by intelliCom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-24T05:44:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExplosions will be better in KSP 2 as in better than parts exploding, probable AoE effects one fun feature is that crashing an pulse nuclear rocket hard will set off all the charges, kind of like HMS Hood but with nukes.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot very realistic but very kerbal \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gussi111","CreatedById":212979,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-24T18:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI heard that parts will explode differently depending on the amount and type of fuel used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaf","CreatedById":64587,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-30T16:33:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed, but i think so far devs talked mostly about graphical effects, not the physical model of the blast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brandon10044","CreatedById":218581,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-31T18:25:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ll more than likely, from what the Developers have talked about, see a lot of variety in terms of graphical effects and sizes of explosions, which would be really cool!
