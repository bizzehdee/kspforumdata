Sure, you won\u2019t feel too bad if the game is delayed again with this perspective but that is not the point here. My view of this discussion is that it is about specific details to get an estimate of a release date, not a \u00AB hope for the best, mentally steel yourself for the worst \u00BB situation.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor the engine rewrite, that does take some time but if that were the main limiting factor, take two would simply pump more artists into the project because it is cheaper that way. Same goes for the engine, with the exception of multiplayer most problems can be solved by adding more people. My hypothesis is that development time is being used on tweaking the various systems of the game and finishing up procedural generation in the meantime.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the timeframe question, to be honest, a twenty-year development cycle in a creative project will always result in a failed project, unless the parameters are well defined at the start. Nominal margin of error (which is a bit of a confusing term, what is nominal about it?) on a twenty year project should be no more than 20% of the planned time, which puts 2025 as a really very late project. But KSP 2 is not a 20 year project, it is a two-year project that has become a 4-year project.
