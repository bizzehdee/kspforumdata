Some ideas, mostly questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u0022Habitats?\u0022\u003C/b\u003E\u00A0In the trailer, we can see several examples of parts that would be unnecessary in regular KSP- namely, the domes at the end and the centrifuges. In the case of the latter, this doesn\u0027t just appear on bases, but on ships as well.\u00A0I don\u0027t think these are purely aesthetic, especially since there are a few stacked up in the back of the orbital station/drydock thing in the pre-alpha footage... wouldn\u0027t it make more sense just to use the regular modules (there are a few other ones on that particular station) if the centrifuge didn\u0027t do anything? My\u00A0first thought is that maybe these were important for some Kerbal comfort level that would be important for the \u0022unlocking\u0022 of population growth or something, but that doesn\u0027t explain the centrifuge\u0027s use on ships. Also, since\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etechnically\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the centrifuge isn\u0027t a new part, it would make less sense to show it off so much if it didn\u0027t do anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... how does that work? Is it part of a larger, more comprehensive life support system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELife support?\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0We don\u0027t really have any evidence at all that life support will or will not be in the game in some form. But that doesn\u0027t mean anything- we\u0027ve seen the colonies, but we don\u0027t know what each module is or what each tank holds. There could easily be life support stuff in there. It would make sense IMO with the colonization focus to add some difficulty to keeping Kerbals alive for extended periods of time since, well, that\u0027s what you\u0027d have to do when setting up a colony. Yes, you also have to mess around with gathering resources and adding new modules, so it\u0027s still not straightforward either way, but still, this would be a nice challenge to consider when building colonies. I also think it would help interstellar travel- as the developers themselves have said, they don\u0027t want the game mechanics to be easily taken advantage of by just time warping a bunch. Wouldn\u0027t the same apply to interstellar travel and such? If there isn\u0027t some kind of pressure to shorten journey times, many of these new technologies become useless with time warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, on the other side, life support could be seen as too much. If you forget about a colony that isn\u0027t self-sufficient and go off on a nice long mission, then it sure would suck to come back and find everyone dead. And you don\u0027t want KSP to be too difficult. I mean, the game is about failing, yes, but failing in such an anticlimactic way after a stupid amount of work wouldn\u0027t feel quite as fun. Failures are supposed to happen, but they shouldn\u0027t really be that show-stopping. They need to be easy to recover from. Rocket blew up? Launch another one! Probe doesn\u0027t have solar panels? Revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E! Colony you worked endless hours on just died off because you forgot to add another life support module when the population expanded and then used timewarp? Well..\u00A0 guess you have to start over. Especially since some of these will be far removed from Kerbin and are seeded from other colonies, it might not be as simple as bringing a ton\u00A0of Kerbals with you to repopulate the base (along with a fix to the problem, of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other, other side again, maybe life support is implemented in such a way that it only becomes a problem later in the game. After all, the vessels we\u0027ve seen using only KSP1 parts don\u0027t seem to have life support equipment, perhaps because the resources for a Mun trip are built into some of the capsules or simple enough to be hidden in a service bay (or perhaps because there\u0027s no life support... could work both ways). Maybe only\u00A0when you start going on deep space missions and travel times get longer does life support become a bigger concern. Then the difficulty goes up\u00A0when you have to make colonies since now you have to make more life support resources and not just store them, while conversely new propulsion systems shorten travel times. It would make\u00A0a nice difficulty curve, a nice progression. and maybe failure isn\u0027t as punishing as it sounds. Maybe Kerbals don\u0027t die from lack of life support, just go unconscious, like in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E life support.

Especially since some of these will be far removed from Kerbin and are seeded from other colonies, it might not be as simple as bringing a ton\u00A0of Kerbals with you to repopulate the base (along with a fix to the problem, of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell all the equipment will still be there just need to clean out the dead kerbals, so no major loss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut seriously there should be a colony planner it should tell you how many kerbals it can support with the equipment you have and should warn you when you haven\u0027t brought enough before you leave the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo Lets go through a hypothetical scenario:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to make a colony on the Mun so I\u00A0build a craft that can set up water extraction for a colony. I\u00A0send 3\u00A0kerbals a pilot, scientist and engineer. They have 100 days of food, water and air (the planner told me this). So on their\u00A0way to the mun they are not sustainable so I\u00A0should keep an eye on them or I set up a warning that will tell me when they have 15\u00A0days of life support left that should give me plenty of time to send a rescue mission. Once on the Mun they set up the water extractor and start splitting the water for H2 and O2 this setup can supply 10 kerbals with water and air (this was told on the modules in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and it tells me that now to). So know I\u00A0don\u0027t have to worry about water or\u00A0air for them but i do need to worry about food so I\u00A0set up a warning to tell me when the have 20 days of food left giving me plenty of time to send a food supply. Now I decide I want to stop worrying about the Mun colony so I\u00A0send a mission to install farms. The planner shows me that it will produce 12 kerbals worth of\u00A0 food,\u00A01 kerbals worth of oxygen (because that photosynthesis thing) and\u00A0will use 2 kerbals worth of water. once installed the colony is self sufficient it has 12 kerbals worth of food production, 11 days of oxygen production\u00A0(1\u002B 10) and 8 Kerbals\u00A0of water production (10-2). So now I\u00A0can leave it and if I allow the kerbals to do there baby making, they will only make 5 babies since\u00A0the colony can only support 8 because of the water. So now I have successfully set up a Mun colony that produces H2 Fuel that I\u00A0can use to refuel Future\u00A0missions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConstruction is a whole other topic that i won\u0027t go into here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Loskene","CreatedById":141778,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-25T02:32:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223658981\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187634\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566694786\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022163669\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022captinjoehenry\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, captinjoehenry said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly I would prefer it if the game came without life support built in.\u00A0 Or at least there really needs to be an option to disable it.\u00A0 As while it is a neat feature but part of the charm of KSP in my opinion is how simplified it is.\u00A0 Which lets you get away with all sorts of fun and silly things like command chair only spacecraft.\u00A0 And I feel people should be free to use that game play style if they want to instead of needing to add in living space and life support parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoooo naw I\u0027m just playing I get you dude. I like to think of it as an extra challenge when there\u0027s little else to do, since it tests all aspects of your building and planning skills, but for beginners or people just looking to play sandbox there\u0027s no point to it, so it should be toggleable and probably off by default.

When you actually need a liveable volume for your kerbals to survive in without going crazy on potentially indefinite voyages, you\u0027re forced to build big.

Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E-type facility on another world.\u00A0 But we wouldn\u0027t (and\u00A0shouldn\u0027t) have to micromanage the details of running the mines and factories, trucking resources around, and worrying about life support.\u00A0 All the Kerbals in the colony population are doing those jobs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the ultimate goal of the colony is to become a functioning spaceport, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E on another world.\u00A0 Build and launch ships, hire playable recruits, accept contracts, track asteroids, be a DSN link, etc.\u00A0 This will only happen when the colony has sufficient population and supporting industrial base.\u00A0 To get to this point, first you have to plunk down some starter modules.\u00A0 This is the seed population, what they need to support themselves, and some space to grow into.\u00A0 Once the population increases, you add some more modules to grow their industrial base and provide room for more population growth.\u00A0 Then finally, you add a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, launchpad, astronaut

also expect you\u0027ll have to put the modules on or near sufficient deposits of various resources.\u00A0 Thus, a lot of planning and prospecting will have to happen first, and then the major colonial expeditions to bring in the modules.\u00A0 But because all the details of\u00A0 how the colonists spend their time are abstracted, you don\u0027t have to keep checking in but can go off
