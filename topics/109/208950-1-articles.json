You might do that once in KSP1 but that quickly teaches you that there\u0027s no value to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe started to get closer to that kind of aspect towards the end of KSP1s development, but it wasn\u0027t really \u0022game play\u0022. All the other science experiments were still instantaneous. The only really interesting science project I remember from KSP1 was one where you had to drop seismometers to support triangulation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next thing people think of is photography (well, \u0022pictures\u0022). The famous reflected-in-visor picture, landing site pictures, etc. People get most excited about pictures of Mars when there\u0027s the \u0022landing site\u0022 oval on them. In KSP1 that gets wrapped up with biome discovery, and again it\u0027s instantaneous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there\u0027s the aspect of discovery and innovation. The KSP1 knowledge trees felt, from the offset, like procurement not discovery. There\u0027s a total lack of causality between what I do as a player and what my scientists uncover back home, the research tree was also terribly tuned - sometimes you struggled for weeks to get one absolutely critical node, and other times a single flight unlocked you so many nodes that you miss out on critical additions because you just never got around to trying them. A huge chunk of player retention and playability probably went over many players\u0027 heads because of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven the success of KSP1 there is clearly a decent sized audience that just wants to see their designs land on other planets, but with KSP2s emphasis on base building, there REALLY needs to be reason to want to have a base. I\u0027ve recently been trying to force myself to build a mun base in KSP1 and ... it\u0027s hard overcoming the obstacles given that once it\u0027s built, my next step will be to leave it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is that I am going to suggest some feature flag ideas that I think would create a richer, more engaging, deeper experience for people who aren\u0027t already hardcore KSP1 devotees following IP loyalty rather than things I think should be mandatory play requirements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1- Science areas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of a single science currency, a split science research system that tempers different knowledge areas and allows different science instruments the opportunity to serve multiple roles in producing science units. Trivially: Orbital Mechanics, Physics, Chemistry; or you could split it into more complex categories like \u0022materials science\u0022, \u0022super conductivity\u0022, etc, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking point: Taking pictures of different surfaces at different resolutions might contribute to guidance systems and landing systems; Sampling atmospheres might contribute to flight controls and surfaces...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2- Science activities:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if you reduce it to what an away team might do with their \u0022tricoders\u0022 in the most mundane episode, there\u0027s purpose and input required. In KSP1 you can click EVA, right-click, left-click \u0022surface sample\u0022 and hit b in under 3 seconds. Instead, try to _reward_ the player\u0027s success in arriving by _making use_ of their interest in being there. Create run-times for experiments, create interference between experiments, maybe use error bars that diminish with science/skill/research, create non-terminal failure scenarios that tie back into research \u0026amp; discover. E.g: flight instruments that are subject to initially undocumented shielding-related failure that leads into upgrade research, a science instrument that turns out not to work when exposed to sunlight on the Mun leading to housing upgrades, telescopes that lead into cooling upgrades, etc, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChoose a smallish lexicon of \u0027experimentation\u0027 actions - try turning it off and on again, try running in sunlight vs dark, try doing it at a different altitude or a different velocity or in a different atmosphere, try moving it 100ft from another instrument, etc. Even if science still worked KSP1 instantaneous style, this would give the instruments infinitely more \u0022hands-on\u0022 time value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking point: what can you take away from this instrument to become a carrot for interacting with it more directly a handful of times without making it so annoying I\u0027ll never bother?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3- Science mysteries (anomalies):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen we send a probe to mars, we are incredibly focused in the instruments placed on it for their operability but more importantly to the area they are going to and the science they will conduct. Some of our recent landers have very high-res cameras not for the photo ops - although that helps with funding - but for things like inspecting how the rover interacts with the soil/terrain or looking at the results of geological/mineral instruments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP1 when you build a probe for Juno you just shove all the available science instruments you can on it and ship it, since the restrictions on instruments tend to be very coarse grained: atmosphere or not, daylight or not. You don\u0027t have to worry about temperatures, radiation, non-boolean levels of light, magnetic field, etc. And there\u0027s no overlap for you to lean in to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking point: can we _excite/reward_ the player for losing signal with the first probe to arrive at Juno due to previously undetected conditions that introduce additional mechanics/gameplay?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking point: instrument specialization vs mass -- a probe with 100 generic instruments producing as much/less science than the same probe with a good combo of 3 more specialized instruments (see also science areas).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4- Risk:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP1 \u0022story\u0022 mode, flying and crashing becomes not-an-option, and there\u0027s no soft middle-ground for testing things you build in story mode making it very easy to get bankrupted with no real way to recover, unless you\u0027re willing to keep fast forwarding until you get a small enough mission you can fly with enough payback to get you flying again - although that can take actual real time days (or not flying, just fast forwarding, checking missions, saving \u0026amp; reloading).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, there\u0027s no payback from flying and crashing in KSP1. When Jeb slams into the ground because the wings came off, there is only what you learn directly about the flight, which is no help if you won\u0027t have the money to fly again without reloading the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis leads to people _not_ enjoying the most fun part of ksp simply because it\u0027s stick followed by stick, so as soon as those wings come off, esc -\u0026gt; revert.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think reputation was never fully realized in KSP1, it should be a sort of backup currency that can be leveraged to produce money at the cost of having to do \u0022photo op\u0022 missions. Get kerbals to test-fly some shonky variant of a new engine for someone; get some 3d pictures of Duna to showcase Kony\u0027s new K-Ray KvK Player (hmm, these pictures are great, but we really need them to be more blue than red, the K-Ray player has a risk of fire if more than 90% of the pixels are red instead of blue...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking point: failure sure be rewarding enough that most of the time players will risk failure-with-a-cookie vs failsafe-without-a-cookie, but sometimes there needs to be a choice/alternative: I shouldn\u0027t be unable to move on to duna because I have not yet returned people from the surface of eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-12T21:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to start by saying that the play modes from KSP1 will be scrapped and replaced with a different progression system.

We haven\u0027t seen a deep dive yet on this from Intercept but I have high hopes.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224154243\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208950\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221657660123\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153177\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kfsone\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, kfsone said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking point: instrument specialization vs mass -- a probe with 100 generic instruments producing as much/less science than the same probe with a good combo of 3 more specialized instruments (see also science areas).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis brings up another important point--experiments should be more specialized. If anything I would argue there are already too many experiments and they are applicable in way, way too many places. As you point out instead of designing a purpose-built drop probe that analyzes a planets air column and gives the player important information about aerocapture they just stick every experiment available onto every probe and manually run them every time they pass into a new biome. This can be solved not by adding more things in but by stripping things out--eliminate any experiment that doesn\u0027t provide flight data and make all collection automatic so players can focus on flying the probe to where it needs to be. Instead of putting a probe in a polar orbit and hitting run, or hitting run and waiting an arbitrary period, give the probe a scanning FOV and max range and let it scan as it orbits the way SCANsat does. Reward players for the total percentage of the surface scanned and let them figure it out the optimal orbit to do that. Instead of just clicking \u0022take sample\u0022 integrate special ground scatter and anomalies in smaller regions and require samples to be physically returned so the process is about getting somewhere specific and back or designing a mobile lab that can traverse the surface. Again the key is that creatively solving spatial and engineering puzzles is fun and repetitive clicking and waiting is not fun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d also add that it looks like KSP2 is really tying to get a huge number of players at least to the point where they could build their first interstellar vessel. That means getting players to establish colonies and stations on multiple planets, exploiting resources and exploring enough to tech all the way up to interstellar rated engines--in a game that at present most players never even land on the Mun. Yes, the tutorials are part of that, but the other part needs to be \u003Cem\u003Epacing\u003C/em\u003E--stripping away any time-sink that distracts from that process of building colonies and bigger badder vessels. That is to say any task that isn\u0027t leading to or involved with landing on new planets, establishing colonies, or harvesting resources should probably be cut from the game. I\u0027d personally cut every contract type except world firsts and establishing colonies. I\u0027d cut Kerbal skill leveling at the individual level and make those passive rewards across your campaign. I\u0027d cut reputation entirely. You might even be able to cut money entirely and just focus on raw resources alone (there have been many debates on this). Now, there could be exceptions--tourism could be a first-step to teaching players about automated supply routes. Satellites might be necessary to sniff out resources. Planets could have special anomalies and unique ground scatter that made them more interesting, but even those are really there to teach players how to land precisely and build and drive rovers, which prepares them for resource harvesting and delivering colony modules down the line. If the task isn\u0027t advancing the progression toward building colonies and going interstellar it shouldn\u0027t exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-13T15:39:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2022 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-13T17:16:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe challenge is to make things not too grindy.

Now, there could be exceptions--tourism could be a first-step to teaching players about automated supply routes. Satellites might be necessary to sniff out resources. Planets could have special anomalies and unique ground scatter that made them more interesting, but even those are really there to teach players how to land precisely and build and drive rovers, which prepares them for resource harvesting and delivering colony modules down the line.

Whats nice about the biome system is you get rewarded pretty much any time you go somewhere new, even on a body you\u0027ve already visited. The problem is that biomes are all worth the same which means no place is particularly special or worth directing your attention to, and there are so many biomes players can very easily farm away and complete the tech tree without ever leaving the Kerbin system making for a very repetitive, short-lived game. The solution to the first problem is relatively easy--give less reward for landing any old place and more reward for visiting specific scientific anomalies so players have to work a bit and learn to land and scout with rovers to get the best payouts. The second problem is a little harder, but to me comes down to making experiments more specific in their use, and potentially reducing the number of biomes or creating a system where science mines-out more quickly as you explore a given planet or moon. For instance Minmus could have 3 total biomes--Flats, Highlands, Poles--plus 3 unique anomaly mini-biomes not more than a km across--a Crystal Cave, a Meteor Core, and an outcrop of Glass Spires. If you were clever you could gather everything you needed from Minmus in just 3 or 4 missions, but within 6 and after finding all 3 anomalies you\u0027d need to move on. This would save both on endless repetitive biome-hopping gameplay and make the game much easier to balance, because you could very easily add up all the possible rewards from Kerbin, Minmus, and the Mun and scale that to ensure players would have to move on to Duna, Moho, Eve, and Dres to progress to the next tier. Having big beautiful anomalies an integral part of the game would also encourage players to learn new landing and navigation skills and give a nice visual reward in addition to science for finding something unique.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-20T05:14:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2022 05:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
