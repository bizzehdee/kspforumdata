I will just use Kerbin to represent what a ~10x increase in the number of anomalies would look like (from currently 20 to 200). The white question marks are existing anomalies in KSP1. The red question marks would be hypothetical new anomalies. We could fly or drive from one interesting place to another and we would have months worth of content to explore. The same could be done for the Mun - increase the number of interesting spots to visit from 8 to 80 (there are surely enough craters) and other celestial bodies. All that\u0027s needed to make the planets dense for exploration is creativity and a lot of work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ksp-kerbin-hypotetical-anomalies-map.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002295.42\u0022 height=\u0022597\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/gzRK7zn/ksp-kerbin-hypotetical-anomalies-map.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-21T21:58:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2023 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Vl3d\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-04T02:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOmg no.

The longest flight on kerbin I ever did with a plane was from woomerang to the edge of the north ice cap. And even at x4 speed the whole way that was by far more flying than I ever wanted to repeat. The longest rover drive I ever did was from near tylo\u0027s equator to the ridge of a big crater just to the south for a Jool 5 mission, and that took hours upon hours and that was at x4 too, with several autosaves and loads for rolling and crashing trying to drive at full warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E launches get into space just around that little peninsula ditectly east of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E across the sea, a tiny fraction of the way around kerbin, maybe less than 1/10, and those flights to orbit are long and boring enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking if KSP2 wants us to drive long distances, it might need a fast travel system. Like maybe an airplane autopilot, or a click and go here function for rovers and ships (spending some fuel and just warping them to the destination,\u00A0 only making you drive if theres a cliff or some other obstacle).

But I don\u0027t want to spend hours driving or flying. Because there was very little challenge or skill for driving or sailing in KSP it was more just a test of patience. With the only hard part of flying being landing, which isn\u0027t much better, having to endure a long boring flight, to risk everything on a possible crash at the end and need to redo it. It might be hard to balance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless driving in KSP2 is as interesting as Snowrunner, I don\u0027t want to have to drive for hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-04T03:00:33Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2023 03:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by SolarAdmiral\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-04T04:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know, some of those \u0022?\u0022 would be good places for Intercept to add cites at a later date.

So instead build some jet thing to parachute a rover down, exchange 3 hours of driving for maybe 1 hour of flying and 1 hour of driving. And this was a tiny distance, a small fraction of the size of the planet. And now add in the idea you\u0027ll be doing this again and again to go in dozens of directions on dozens of planets. It would take tens to hundreds of hours to visit all those spots you marked on kerbin. Multiply by 15 for all the bodies in just the kerbol system. And again by 3 or 4 or 5 for all the systems we will get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d still argue that\u0027s more than enough to bore most players. If most players won\u0027t bother going to the sites, then the devs don\u0027t have a reason to devote much time to making them. We\u0027ll wind up with nothing more interesting than the pyramids from ksp1, just in more locations. Just a bunch of static model easter eggs for only the most dedicated completionists look at once and forget. All that gives us is a whole bunch of places it isn\u0027t worth bothering to go to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll I\u0027m saying is if the game wants us to cover larger distances like this, they should look into adding some system to let us cross the wide expanses of nothing faster, to get to the challenging bits, to get to the interesting bits. If they can reliably say lots of players will go to the sites of interest, now they could devote more time into making them unique and interesting. Maybe giving us more to do at them. Now we have a whole bunch of sites lots of players will go to, more interesting things to see and do at them, and not a whole lot of time wasted getting to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll I\u0027m asking the game to do is respect the player\u0027s time. Not frivolously waste it. KSP2 is already on a great track, aiming to reduce the time spent waiting for long burns being able to warp while burning. It would be silly to improve the gameplay experience in space so much with that while leaving the experience on planets to be still just as boring and tedious as driving an open field for hours or flying level for hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sp1f","CreatedById":213244,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-04T21:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/107350-solaradmiral/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022107350\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/107350-solaradmiral/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SolarAdmiral\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I understand your point correctly, you seem to be saying that KSP2 should not have large numbers of anomalies because exploring them is not your cup of tea.

I, for one, enjoy long rover journeys. And I enjoy them more when there are points of interest all over the planet or moon that I can treat as waypoints. Even so, if there were like 80 anomalies on a given body, I would probably never get around to exploring them all, and that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s great if there\u2019s always more stuff out there to find. It adds replay value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor my 2 cents, I am in favor of drastically increasing the number and variety of anomalies.

What I don\u0027t like is hours long travel with no difficulty. What I don\u0027t like is getting only a slightly interesting item to look at for all that effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, if they want to quickly plop down a bunch of copy paste pyramids and monoliths around kerbin, I don\u0027t mind. But that doesn\u0027t interest me in driving or flying for hours to go see them. If that\u0027s what they do with the game that\u0027s fine, but I\u0027d just ignore it and I suspect that most people would ignore it too. What started the discussion was the map shared in the first post of this thread. Look at all those points and tell me how long it would take to visit even a handful of them. And almost all of that time would be spent driving over grassy fields or flying level with no challenge. You could set the game to play itself and walk away, as I did this morning for three hours to cross only a tiny distance of the map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m advocating for, is if there\u0027s going to be sites of interest for exploring, make them worthwhile and challenging rather than just a waste of time and test of patience like ksp1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIf there are going to be lots of anomalies, I\u0027d prefer them to be widely varied, each made interesting or challenging to get to.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this would however mean a lot of dev time put into them. So, to justify that time and resource devoted to developing them, they need to be something lots of players will partake in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a look at some good exploration games. Subnautica, Outer Wilds, Snowrunner even. Love those games. But there\u0027s a challenge to apply that kind of exploring to ksp. Ksps planets are huge, so much larger than those games little maps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my suggestion. What if the sites of interest were hand made by the devs. Each one having something neat to see. And each one with a bit of a challenge to get to. Something similar to those games listed above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere could be a tight underwater canyon to maneuver a submarine through. There could be a narrow rocky pass to drive a rover through. There could be a narrow ledge to land a plane on. There could be a snaky winding switchback up a mountainside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the key is, to limit the amount of the players time wasted getting to those challenges and points of interest. Which is why I suggest a means of fast traveling over the wide open land where you\u0027d only be watching as you hold down the w key. Or watching a plane fly level needing no adjustment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen we could have interesting things to do and see. Something with more challenge than just waiting to get there. And by making it not take hours many more players could go do it, justifying the extra time and effort that would be required making these areas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be interesting to me. To me there\u0027s a difference between exploring and getting a plane in the air and flying it level on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E for hours. Exploring is venturing though the caverns of Ember Twin as they fill with sand. Exploring is diving your Cyclops down into the dark void and maneuvering around pillars of rock or tight passages. Exploring is getting a truck stuck in the swamp or trying to squeeze a twinsteer through some trees. I don\u0027t really consider flying a plane level for hours, something that could be achieved by an autopilot, all that much exploration. KSP1 did have some good \u0022exploring\u0022 content, but that was in space with the rockets, getting to and returning from all the planets and moons. I\u0027d love there to be exploration and lots of sites to go visit in KSP2 to match that feeling of exploration in space between the planets with some interesting and challenging exploration on the planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just don\u0027t agree that what KSP1 had on kerbin was really \u0022exploring\u0022. All it was was taking off a plane and flying it straight for a while, sometimes a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s only so much time in the day between work and chores and everything else. If you can set aside a few hours a night to play a game, why not make those hours count. Rather than requiring nothing more than the player flying straight and level for all those few precious free hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
