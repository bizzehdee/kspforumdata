Here are a few hypotheticals; how would you deal with these? These problems are exacerbated with larger time differences, but they still exist with small time differences.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayer A has a station in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E in year 100, that has been around for a while and people have had the chance to see it. Currently, the last interaction was in year 100. Where does player B, who is in year 101, see that station? Do they see it, or does it disappear once player B warps past the point where Player A is?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, Player A then uses a tug to move that station into GKO. For a few minutes, that station is not able to be interacted with, but ignoring that, where does Player B see the station, from their vantage point in the future? Does it jump to the GKO orbit, adjusted for the time difference? Or was it hidden all along, so there\u0027s no harm? To be clear, hiding the station poses a problem, which is that the player that is the farthest ahead in time is effectively alone and the only way to leave that state is to wait for other players to warp ahead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, Player B has resource routes feeding their colony that pass through Player A\u0027s base. None have triggered since year 100, but now the station is in a different spot. When the next window happens, does the route just break? Or if it doesn\u0027t, what does Player B see?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourth, Player A is sending the tug over to the station. The same route system is set up but is more frequent, so the last supply mission passing through was after Player A\u0027s time. Player A cannot access their station due to interaction rules so there is no risk of it changing orbit, but now they cannot dock their tug. How would this be resolved, simply making Player A warp to Player B\u0027s time? This becomes a big problem when players set up supply routes between colonies, as entire sections of critical infrastructure could get blocked off when someone goes into the future.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, assuming that Player B in the future can see the new position of player A\u0027s station (as it is in the future), what happens when player A launches a new supply run feeding the station from the Mun? At the start, player A\u0027s trajectory is suborbital, so from player B\u0027s perspective it has already crashed into the ground and disappeared. But once in LMO, player A leaves the mission for a moment to deal with an aerobrake somewhere else. Does player B see the new craft in its orbit? What are the rules for how long something needs to be present for it to project into the future?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are great. And from the outset let me say I personally like leapfrog because it makes the most sense to me, but you\u0027re absolutely right that you and I are just intuiting here and in practice the issues with cyclic may be way overblown and the issues with leapfrog might be more punishing than I think.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Player B sees the station where it would be if left alone for 1 year both before and after Player A warps. If there\u0027s no change to the station it stays as is, circling happily for both players.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Player B would see the station\u0027s orbit change at the same rate Player A see\u0027s that change, because the game is basically assuming that at any second Player A could cut the engines and leave it exactly where it is. Once Player A completes the maneuver Player B sees the station in GKO, positioned as if 1 year had passed, and ready to be interacted with.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3)\u00A0This is tricky without knowing a bit more about how supply routes work. Let\u0027s say for argument\u0027s sake they\u0027re based on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E costs with some built-in tolerance. If the station was moved outside of the route\u0027s tolerance then yes Player B would receive a notification that the route was broken. In this particular case though the route would probably not break as it takes less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to get to GKO from a Munar colony than to get to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) This is a good one. This might be greedy, but I think the best solution is a kind of Schrodinger\u0027s supply route. The routes are assumed to be happening in the background but they don\u0027t themselves trigger updates. If Player A visits the station in Year 100 day 100 they could dock and would see the resources accurate for 100 days of supply deliveries. I think you\u0027re right though that if Player B makes changes to a colony on that same supply route it would trigger updates along the chain. So if Player B goes into the future they won\u0027t necessarily update \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E, but if they change something at a colony hub it would update anything that colony was connected to and other players would need to catch up with those endpoints.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n5a) Player B would see 1 year of accumulated resources from that new route. If they then docked and added or withdrew those resources Player A would need to catch up as normal.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n5b) Consistent with Q2 the game basically presumes that the current orbit at any moment continues indefinitely. While Player A\u0027s vessel is sub-orbital its not visible to Player B because its assumed crashed. Once its in orbit--any stable orbit--it remains there visible to both players. This could create some funny results for things like transfers viewed from the far future, because you would temporarily see the transfering vessel as it would travel without the capture burn even if it resulted in an escape trajectory.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224200024\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221668726682\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not have many servers ran by players where some are safe and others let you grief?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot just that but sandbox servers, progression servers, servers with different difficulty settings and mod suites, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-18T02:49:55Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2022 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-18T02:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224200071\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210666\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221668734991\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022211990\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zaffre\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Zaffre said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad to know that competitive \u003Cem\u003Eand \u003C/em\u003Ecooperative modes are coming.

And this happens in just one game update. Within a short time, the orbital period is now 0.1% longer, so the craft has made one orbit less one year in the future.

This might be greedy, but I think the best solution is a kind of Schrodinger\u0027s supply route. The routes are assumed to be happening in the background but they don\u0027t themselves trigger updates. If Player A visits the station in Year 100 day 100 they could dock and would see the resources accurate for 100 days of supply deliveries. I think you\u0027re right though that if Player B makes changes to a colony on that same supply route it would trigger updates along the chain. So if Player B goes into the future they won\u0027t necessarily update \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E, but if they change something at a colony hub it would update anything that colony was connected to and other players would need to catch up with those endpoints.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis makes sense. The problem I think I have with it, that required the previous scenario to be answered is what if Player A breaks Player B\u0027s supply routes in between? If Player A can interact with the station even though supply routes have passed through it, and player A decides to deorbit it for whatever reason, does Player B lose those materials, or do we suddenly have a duplication problem? Assume that Player B didn\u0027t interact with anything but those supply routes were needed to make other routes run, breaking those routes could cause dozens of hours of re-done gameplay as Player B has to go back in time, re-connect the route, and then re-do everything that they did since the break, using resources that they used to have.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224200083\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221668738358\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/17/2022 at 9:25 PM, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5b) Consistent with Q2 the game basically presumes that the current orbit at any moment continues indefinitely. While Player A\u0027s vessel is sub-orbital its not visible to Player B because its assumed crashed. Once its in orbit--any stable orbit--it remains there visible to both players.

As they raise the apoapsis in one game update, their orbital period gets just 0.01% longer, so they have only made 999.9 orbits, which means that the new position is 30 degrees behind the one that was previously displayed. And this happens in just one game update. Within a short time, the orbital period is now 0.1% longer, so the craft has made one orbit less one year in the future. It continues spinning backwards along its orbit very, very fast until the burn stops and everything stabilizes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight, and this is also a question of how supply routes should be visualized. I was wondering if the route would end up in the old station position or the new one, which I guess doesn\u0027t have to do much with how the time system works.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis makes sense. The problem I think I have with it, that required the previous scenario to be answered is what if Player A breaks Player B\u0027s supply routes in between? If Player A can interact with the station even though supply routes have passed through it, and player A decides to deorbit it for whatever reason, does Player B lose those materials, or do we suddenly have a duplication problem? Assume that Player B didn\u0027t interact with anything but those supply routes were needed to make other routes run, breaking those routes could cause dozens of hours of re-done gameplay as Player B has to go back in time, re-connect the route, and then re-do everything that they did since the break, using resources that they used to have.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, this is a concern. The thing that I got from this is that the leapfrog system also has its own fair share of visual nonsense, from ships going crazy in their orbits to transfers behaving very weirdly. As someone closes in on the desired periapsis for their transfer, the player in the future would see a more and more aggressive slingshot, so the ship would appear to be speeding really close to the star or on a trajectory away from the star.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, we are both intuiting, and the issues we have brought up with both systems show that probably, neither of us have a good understanding of whether issues are better or worse than we think. This sort of thing can really only be resolved with some work put into implementing the solutions so we can have a concrete example to refer to instead of trying to explain it using words, and also play testing to see what comes up more often, and what ends up being ignorable or annoying. I\u0027d be fine with ships going wild on their trajectories, the cyclic model has some of that with transferring ships, but I\u0027m not too sure about the interactivity restrictions. It could be that I don\u0027t find any problems with it (which I\u0027d be very happy about), but we\u0027ll have to see when the first mods or official implementations of multiplayer come out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still say leapfrog or encounter.
