Say, you\u0027re handed a block of data containing orbital elements of the craft via an API block. If that\u0027s an object passed by reference, which tends to be the default in C#, and that block is part of the more general craft object, you can work out where in memory the data for the craft is and construct an object reference for use in the mod. That would involve some unsafe calls and maybe even some native code, but it shouldn\u0027t be too difficult to do. So if this is an obstacle, I\u0027m sure people will write libraries that give you broader access.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, when you access things in an underhanded way like this, there are limitations. A version change can break compatibility, and some under-the-hood streaming could result in segfaults or other errors. So you\u0027d have to take extra care with these kinds of mods, but it\u0027s better than not having this data available at all, IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully, there\u0027s just a good API to get you anything that\u0027s currently loaded at all, though. That would be way more convenient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
