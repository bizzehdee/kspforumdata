I probably shouldn\u2019t have to explain how transitioning the entire planetary terrain system to voxels would add several years of dedicated development, so I\u2019ll just say that the easiest option is likely to involve a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of work to make procedural terrain create workable cave walls.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith technical concerns aside, I\u2019d love for oceans (sub-surface or not) to have parts that interact with them. Especially on lifeless worlds, however much interesting stuff there is to find on the surface, there is just as much to find in the oceans. Adding more environments diversifies mission profiles, and oceans can bring about new craft architectures, which just puts more \u201Cbuild and fly\u201D into \u201Cbuild and fly.\u201D My personal preference is to go deep, adding in sonar scanners, air tanks and pressure-capable hulls for ships and submarines, as well as underwater-specific modules like geothermal power (which would be very effective in underground oceans), pressure locks (for transferring kerbals to/from the surface) and underwater-specific \u201Claunch pads.\u201D Adding the whole pressure mechanic would probably be too much work for that gameplay as it would have to be set-and-forget, but who knows what directions are taken for updates and DLCs. Overall, I think a \u201Cbuoyancy update\u201D encompassing anything floating in a fluid would be a good candidate for adding new mechanics down the line.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-13T18:57:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, other games with height maps may have 1 single height vertex depressed to make a hole, and then a 3d object fills the hole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe could make have a cave system/lavatube network object to fill a steep terrain depression\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-13T19:31:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224208471\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211030\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221670946242\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223854\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tstein\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, tstein said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the same as an empty dark rock floating in space....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gameplay is getting to the rock.
