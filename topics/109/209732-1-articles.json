One of these circles might be Char, and one (actually 2) might include both Rask and Rusk (it would make sense that these are in a young system. That would leave one more planet a little further away than Gurdamma and one last one that just appears past multiple debris belts. This last one may be Glumo, but it\u0027s possible Glumo is even further out.
