It\u2019s entirely possible that most, if not all, of the KSP2 team has also left, and the additional hiring at PD is mostly for scaling up the team. \u00A0I\u2019m also assuming that not all of Star Theory was working on KSP, it\u2019s possible they had other projects under way or waiting in the wings, and simply couldn\u2019t commit to long term development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, they are currently still saying that the game is set to come out in FY 2021, so basically any time before April 2021, which is still more or less what our window was before this all came about. \u00A0Of course, things could still be pushed back, but I just don\u2019t think they\u2019d be simultaneously publishing videos about the game and studio update if they hadn\u2019t been planning this for at least some time. \u00A0Also, now that KSP2 is 100% in house at Private Division, this could\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Epotentially\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0increase the chances of it being at the Pax East booth. \u00A0I just think the timing of this release is very convenient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, if they had been planning to transition this back into PD for a while, that would provide a pretty decent explanation for the sudden comm silence after the E3 announcement. \u00A0Again, totally my own theory, nothing substantial supporting this, but I could see it turning out as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPD contracts Star Theory to do conceptual work, maybe originally envisioning it as a KSP remaster with a few bells and whistles;\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStar Theory builds out a pre-alpha prototype, starts building out more advanced features\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPD/ST announce KSP2 at E3\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFan/public response greater than anticipated, or at least exceeding a certain threshold where PD decides it can invest more in KSP2 project.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStar Theory (again, very small and independent developer) is not able to scale up to requirements or not willing to commit long term, transitions KSP2 team over to PD, goes into comm silence as restructuring begins\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-21T07:44:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2020 07:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Teek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Incarnation of Chaos","CreatedById":197414,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-21T07:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223744648\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191804\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221582270526\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180102\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mcwaffles2003\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, mcwaffles2003 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that were the case then how did they have demos before the transition?
