Those of us who did overcome may not feel that\u00A0the hurdle was that bad\u00A0but I do know some who never managed to climb that mountain far enough to see the view from the top and it\u0027s a real shame. So without further stalling, what can we think of that would help smooth out the giant cliff into a gentler hill this time? We\u0027re told there will be better tutorials but that remains to be seen and may not cover enough \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E may not appeal to impatient players who just want to get to the fun stuff quickly - humans are not perfect learning machines\u00A0and not always\u00A0willing to sit in a virtual school just to \u003Cem\u003Estart\u003C/em\u003E playing a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nKey bindings: Ensure they are accessible through an options menu while in flight, KSP1 is terribad in this regard as the player must leave the entire\u00A0playing experience\u00A0and go back out to the main menu just to see which button did \u0022that one thing\u0022 they needed. Even if the keys can\u0027t be edited while in flight they should at minimum be possible to view.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPop up tips on a new playthrough: Should be possible to set to multiple levels of \u0022helpfulness\u0022. Pretty sure most of us recall how to use the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to build a rocket so\u00A0we don\u0027t need to be told this on each new playthrough - however there may be some more advanced tips not all of us are familiar with even after we get a couple\u00A0of interplanetary voyages\u00A0under our belt. Having a helpful kerbal linger in the corner of the screen blurting out a little speech bubble at times when you seem lost (\u0022Having trouble with staging?\u0022 if you leave a parachute and an engine on the same stage in the editor for more than 15 seconds) so you can click it to get more info \u003Cu\u003Eif you choose to\u003C/u\u003E might be one way to go about this, of course you should at any time be able to just say \u0022Nah I got this.\u0022 to make the kerbal go away completely but there should also\u00A0be an option to\u00A0reactivate from the menu - maybe together with switches to turn on/off subsets of tips depending on our individual knowledge profiles.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn game knowledge base: Having at least a collection of helpful information in game is pretty standard stuff, what many games don\u0027t do however is get the player to the right page quickly. If you open the menu while in flight and click the knowledge base it would be very helpful for it to display shortcuts to everything that might be relevant to what you were doing 2 seconds ago, such as steering a rocket and\u00A0orbits and docking and stuff. Of course it should always have shortcut #1 be to the complete list of topics.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions are welcome, I\u0027ll add yours to the list if it seems like a good idea. (moderators please feel free to edit the list\u00A0as well if I\u0027m absent, my health is very unpredictable)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould like to add that one of the reasons I object to KSP2 having any early access phase is that it has a multitude of pitfalls that are very dangerous for games that are in any way advanced. Most notably it eases the players into new features as they are added and turns them into all-knowing super beings that\u00A0don\u0027t crave tutorials or further information, then when the average joe buys the game on 1.0 day he sits there completely confounded by how any human could have transcended mortality and climbed the intergalactic learning curve right in front of him. I may have exaggerated marginally\u00A0for effect but you probably get it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-22T02:41:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInclude Scott Manley and Danny2462 videos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe former to learn how to play the game properly, the latter to learn that explosions are a fun part of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-22T06:19:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about a godsdamn farkin\u0027 manual that explains things, and the expectation that players have the ability and inclination to read it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr is that just too much to expect these days?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-22T07:42:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA tutorial section that has separate video demonstrations of different maneuvers being performed with simple breakdowns of why the maneuvers are performed as they are.
