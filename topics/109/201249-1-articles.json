Colonizing the mun will be relatively easy compared to colonizing Ovin. I imagine that the process will also slightly differ based on how far you are along the tech tree. Your first colonies will start with sending a bunch of modules with your spacecraft launching from kerbin and landing them separately, but when you are much more progressed i imagine you can pack that on one massive colony ship and send everything in one go, making it easier\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meecrob","CreatedById":104543,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-26T18:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223945231\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201249\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221616772406\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206057\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PlutoISaPlanet\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, PlutoISaPlanet said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main reason I want to ask this question is because if they are easy to establish, the game itself could become much more easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith release this far out, I doubt the devs have done gameplay balancing yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerminator K-100","CreatedById":204357,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-29T14:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven that we only have the most basic of info about KSP2 we have no idea how hard or easy it will be.
