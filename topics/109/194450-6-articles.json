If they\u0027re so incapable of completing the project, why hire them again? This is the part of what happened I don\u0027t really think makes sense unless you think of it like this... Clearly the problem happened with the negotiations in the contract and the only reason T2 would have to fire them from that is if Star Theory demanded \u0022too much\u0022 in the eyes of T2. So we can say all day that Star Theory may have been the bad guys for demanding more from T2 for this project, but who\u0027s to say T2 weren\u0027t undercutting them from the beginning?\u00A0Both parties KNEW this game would be of high demand. The only difference here is that T2 also knew that this game was Star Theory\u0027s dream project. That\u0027d be a perfect reason to cut them loose and then turn around and offer them jobs again under their own demands full well knowing they couldn\u0027t really refuse. Regardless of who was doing what or why, we don\u0027t actually know the details of the contract and we probably never will.

That would have had to be done through re-negotiation of the existing contract as the original contract was still in force at that time. Take Two canceled the contract in February, well in advance of the due date of the product. (pushed out to no sooner than April 1st or as late as March of 2021) and way in advance of the re-negotiated fall release. These are established facts.

We never had an exact release date, and we don\u0027t know when ST was supposed to be finished vs when the product was supposed to be released (though that delay should be short). The contract was cancelled in Feb, which left only march of the original FY.

ST was hired to make the game, not publish it.

One could imagine that after the dev team started to jump ship to T2 after the messages in Dec, by Feb T2 could declare that ST no longer had the capacity to deliver on the contract, and voided it because half ST\u0027s team got poached (by T2 itself).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey had enough money to pay all their employees two months severance and several more months of company-paid health insurance.\u00A0If Take Two violated their contract, which I have established above was still in effect through the fall, for the cost of two months severance for ONE employee they could have retained a litigation attorney, who might very well have offered to sue for nothing but a percentage of the judgement and no up-front fee. Lawyers do this all the time and any lawyers offered to take this kind of case would jump at the chance; it\u0027s a cake-walk.

After all, if KSP 2 comes out over a year late and \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E has bugs or not everything that was promised, all their good will goes up in smoke... and the tens-of-millions they poured into it were wasted money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI base all this on a thumbnail estimate of 3 years development (2019-2021) x 30 employees x $105k average salary \u002B benefits* = $10 million in raw development costs, plus additional costs of creating the new Intercept Games, (despite what some people think, creating a company isn\u0027t as simple as declaring it so... it actually costs \u003Cem\u003Emoney\u003C/em\u003E to start a new business, even before you write the first paycheck) extra costs from Star Theory, etc. (you can bet Star Theory was turning a profit and paying their owner\u0027s salaries... not just operating at break-even for the dev team for the last two years)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven a $60 sale price... of which a good chunk of which will pay for the service providing it for DL like Steam, (they want \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E cut) advertising, etc... with an estimated profit of $30 a copy, (100% markup is being \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E generous) they have to sell a third-of-a-million copies just to break even... \u003Cem\u003Ein theory\u003C/em\u003E... but we\u0027re not done. Given that stockholders expect a ROI of 3-8% annual, (growth of 17% over three years compounded quarterly) and then subtracting Uncle Sam\u0027s cut, (capital gains taxes) that equates to well over half million sales of KSP 2 before they even \u003Cem\u003Estart\u003C/em\u003E to see a \u003Cem\u003Epenny\u003C/em\u003E of actual profit... but not \u003Cem\u003Equite \u003C/em\u003Eyet.
