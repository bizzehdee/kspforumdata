But all of KSP1\u0027s API\u0027s are gone, and the Unity version is more recent. So unless Intercept already had a decent amount of API code written, or the individuals were already familiar with using C#/C\u002B\u002B then it\u0027s really not something you couldn\u0027t find somewhere else. Modeling? DX11 changes what texture layers are required, and their individual complexity in some places. Now there are mods that use these type of textures and models in KSP, so i guess you might headhunt the 5 people who develop for them (I\u0027m exaggerating for effect, but still).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo at the end of the day, the total cost of training you\u0027d save is basically none. Potentially it might actually cost more to train someone who\u0027s had the bulk of their experience modding KSP1 than just a normal Software Developer straight out of College, due to KSP1 modder hires potentially having to unlearn so much while also dealing with significant gaps in their own understanding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou exaggerate the differences. If they were making mods for KSP, they can work on pretty much any Unity title with minimal training in some capacity or another, be it code, design, or art as appropriate to their skill set.\u00A0But so can anyone who was trained in Unity development in general, and yes, you need people with broader experience to lead them as well. So I\u0027m with you on your overall point, but you\u0027re being a bit too dramatic on the details. Things like differences in Unity and DirectX version aren\u0027t going to make an impact here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also agree with you that if they have skills to jump from KSP mods to working on KSP2, they have plenty of opportunities in game development in general, and there is no guarantee they\u0027d prefer to work on KSP2 over anything else they can be a part of.

The deadline has to exist either way. It\u0027s part of a contract between developer and publisher, and while everyone understands that some flexibility is necessary, it\u0027s also a universal truth that developers will never finish a game if there isn\u0027t a deadline. Not because we don\u0027t work hard, but because we come up with more things to add faster than we can add them.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThat said, the deadline need not be public. It\u0027s just a contract. But publishers have their own responsibilities, primarily to shareholders (or investors, if privately owned). Part of that responsibility is forecasts, and you can\u0027t have a forecast without a release schedule. The further out the planned release, the more vague you can be about it. But once you have a specific date, it\u0027s hard to get away with going back to vague without upsetting the stock prices.

If the publishers didn\u0027t have to release information about upcoming games to appeal to shareholders, I don\u0027t think we\u0027d see nearly as many early announcements. You can sort of see it with some companies, like Valve and pre-Activision Blizzard, where we\u0027d often just get a hint that they\u0027re working on something with, \u0022When it\u0027s done,\u0022 as the public release date. There would still\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be an internal deadline, but it need not be public if you aren\u0027t playing the corporate game.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EP.S. Complete speculation, but I suspect that part of the reason why KSP2 was announced originally on a very aggressive schedule is probably because Star Theory was angling to get bought by Take Two. It\u0027s very hard for me to even guess at this point if that schedule was ever realistic, but once there was an official release date, Private Division was sort of trapped and had to give specific date, even if the confidence in it was low. I could easily be off the mark on this, but I\u0027ve seen that sort of thing happen before.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-08T04:08:49Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2020 04:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seikaa","CreatedById":202204,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-08T04:56:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it\u0027s better than releasing a half-finished game with full price and keep player suffering from weird bugs and other things I\u00A0suppose.
