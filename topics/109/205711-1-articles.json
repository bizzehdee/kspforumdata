So a system with 8GB of system RAM and 8GB of VRAM on, say, RX 6600 XT should be very close to what you get on PS5.

Gen 9 consoles run 8/0/16 (P/E/T) core config, and 12600K is a 6/4/16. A game optimized for a gen 9 console will have workload spread across 14 performance threads of the 7 cores that are usually available to the game. So on 12600K, that means at least two threads ending up on efficiency cores, which can royally screw up frame timing if they aren\u0027t scheduled properly. And scheduler that can properly distribute work between P and E cores is a Windows 11 feature. So some games that are well-optimized and still push PS5 processor to the limit can struggle on 12600K under Windows 10 simply due to scheduling issues. This might get addressed with a future Windows 10 patch, or maybe 12xxx owners will just have to accept the awful UI of Windows 11.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, KSP2 is a Unity title, so I highly doubt the core load is going to be anything remotely that even. So long as your main and physics end up on P cores, which it really should even with W10, I think you\u0027ll be fine even if some game threads end up on E cores. In which case W10 or W11 shouldn\u0027t make a difference, and 12600K will do just fine either way. So it\u0027s probably a moot point anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, if 12600K can\u0027t run KSP2 well, then neither can the consoles.

This is why I specifically call out volumetrics, like clouds and such, and procedural vegetation. Vegetation placement, for example, looks a lot like technique used by Horizon Zero Dawn, in which case, it\u0027s a GPU placement based on multiple additional density maps that have to be in VRAM. And any sort of volume rendering techniques take up a lot of memory. And this is on top of the planet surfaces, which will require LoDs for absolutely everything. And I wonder if Intercept will end up using virtual textures to optimize that, which will eat up even more VRAM. I haven\u0027t seen anything to absolutely confirm the latte, mind, but it would be a good idea, and it is something recent versions of Unity support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat might allow KSP2 to run on a lot less VRAM is if some of these features can be disabled or allowed to run at much lower resolution. E.g., the shadow map cascades look way higher resolution in KSP2 than KSP, but also, it is something you can, at least in theory, tune to the capabilities of a particular graphics cards, and you\u0027ll simply have slightly worse-looking shadows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224058511\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205711\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221637677986\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209758\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022asap1\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, asap1 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngetting it to run on ps4 and xb1 will be impressive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI honestly don\u0027t think that\u0027s happening anymore.

So I\u0027m comfortable calling 11th gen i7 as adequate for sure. Not supporting 11th gen i5 will hurt the sales, certainly, but given how important consoles sales are likely to be, I can imagine a scenario where they go for a higher minimum if they simply have no resources to make more optimizations and don\u0027t want to cut features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be clear, the above is unlikely, and KSP2 will\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eprobably\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be fine on 11th gen i5. Maybe it will get a little more laggy than PS5/XBSX on larger ships and colonies.

But 9th to 11th gen, at least, it\u0027s all been way more gradual. So it\u0027s very hard to say where the cutoff will be. In fact, even after we see min-spec, it will probably be hard to translate it to older CPUs. Ditto laptops - there are just way too many variables between core counts and boost performance to say what will be critical for KSP2. All I can be certain about is that KSP2, like KSP before it, will be one of these games where your CPU matters way more than your GPU, and that\u0027s likely to leave a lot of setups that can handle most modern games adequately well in the dust, unfortunately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-27T16:22:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoy I\u0027m glad I left my i7-9700k at stock clocks and water cooling (custom loop not AIO), and that I have a beefy power supply, because that means I have plenty of overhead to be able to overclock should I have the need to do so to get adequate performance out of my now seemingly relatively old CPU.

Unless you go used, 9900KF is still likely to set you back nearly $400, while a 12600KF is under $300. Granted, LGA 1700 mobos start at about $200 right now, but by the time KSP2 comes out, you\u0027ll have better priced options, and will probably be able to go with 12600KF for a comparable price to 9900KF. And 12600KF beats the pants off 9900KF in every category that matters. If you are forced to upgrade, I think you\u0027re better off going for newer hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, you might have other constraints in your setup, and/or access to various deals, so that all depends. I might also be off on my prediction for price dynamics in the future. Most importantly, if you\u0027ll be deciding on an upgrade after KSP2 is already out, hopefully, you\u0027ll be able to get some benchmarks on how it performs on different processors and factor that into your consideration. So wait-and-see is probably best approach here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-27T17:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah to be honest I\u0027m already leaning away from the i9-9900k route.
