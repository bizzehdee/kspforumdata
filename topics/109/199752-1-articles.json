For example, while I love the idea of Konstruction that 1.11 added, it also brought forth the issue of managing what items kerbals were bringing along as cargo and their exact weight (such as parachutes). While this isn\u0027t such a big deal really, to newer players it might be overwhelming to think about. The best solution in my opinion? Parachutes for kerbals\u00A0if nothing else should be mandatory. Yes I\u00A0realize you might have a mun base and the kerbals will never use it there, but on the off chance you\u0027re screaming through some other celestial body\u0027s\u00A0atmosphere\u00A0with your ship quickly falling apart, and desperately want your kerbal to survive, a parachute might just be your last and best option.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-22T03:25:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had a 6-kerbal crew have to bail out of a the remains of a spaceplane that suffered a catastrophic engine explosion while climbing through 6000m, so I\u0027m all for keeping the parachutes.\u00A0\u00A0 And hoping someone will make a part failure mod for KSP2, cause it sure keeps things interesting....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-22T06:23:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs\u00A0a (potentially vital)\u00A0 piece of equipment, then yes they should absolutely be an available option IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut\u00A0 I think it should always be an option to choose whether or not you take them .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caleb Kerman","CreatedById":209594,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-23T20:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would love to see them bring back EVA parachutes in KSP2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-23T22:44:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223913021\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199752\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221611296594\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022130621\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pandaman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/21/2021 at 10:23 PM, pandaman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut\u00A0 I think it should always be an option to choose whether or not you take them .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027d be nice to have some quick defaults for a specific craft, because having to go through and manually edit each member of the crew is a bit of a drag.
