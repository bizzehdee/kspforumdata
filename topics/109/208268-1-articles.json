Or even better, make a poll that needs some personal identification like a phone number for a verification code (without them storing it obv, but to avoid bots) and asking the community what they think about the feature in it\u0027s current implementation. If they\u0027re making the game to serve the community that is most likely to enjoy it, what downside would there be to asking them what they should change to make the most people happy? A poll for feature implementation could be very easily seen as just development and subject to change (because possibly changing it is the whole point of the poll) and would be hard to twist into a promise and fact that people would get angry doesn\u0027t actually happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeta tests would give them great data on all sorts of different system specs, play styles and a much larger team of bug finders.

They definitely wouldn\u0027t have to, proven by the success of games that don\u0027t do that. But if you look at the snapshots they do on Minecraft, it gives the community so much time to give feedback and bug reports, and the updates come out brilliantly and at a \u003Cstrong\u003Every \u003C/strong\u003Eacceptable amount of bug free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Answering this with the assumption you\u0027re talking about the mention of Battlefield 2042, so do correct me if I\u0027m wrong). Bare with me since I know Minecraft is another mention of a multiplayer game. I 100% get that all games would need differing feedback and testing - and the reason BF2042 did that is to test servers and player interactions like you said. I think finding bugs and feedback of gameplay loops would still require the same sort of testing though (giving out temporary stripped down copies, or full copies for testing), just maybe not directed towards multiplayer. It\u0027s more the practice of the testing that I\u0027m looking at in the BF2042 example, rather than the specifics, which is why I mention Minecraft above. I don\u0027t mean anything specific about it, just that they have people test for months and months, and as far as I know, always have had a great reaction to updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-21T08:07:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2022 08:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Derpiesaurus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChange is where the strike-through is under the third quote.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-21T08:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224135449\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208268\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653119615\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022221478\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Derpiesaurus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, Derpiesaurus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t think of any time they asked (just bad memory.. or I haven\u0027t seen it), but it\u0027s pretty cool to know they have asked for feedback already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast time it was about the idea of procedural solar panels, before that, I think it was something about exhaust plumes.

They aren\u2019t bad at identifying problems, but they also aren\u2019t necessarily good at coming up with solutions. \u00A0To ask them to design the game is to ask for a bunch of discombobulated features that don\u2019t necessarily work together. This is generally why \u201Cdesign by committee\u201D doesn\u2019t produce good results. One \u00A0example is the mission builder from Making History. Folks were never very happy with the generative contracts from KSP1, but if you were on this board around 2016-2017 you would have heard a lot of players asking to be able to define all their own mission parameters rather than rely on random ones. Hence the mission builder was born. It wasn\u2019t a crazy idea, but sadly it never really caught on and mostly flopped. People thought they wanted to define their own missions but thats because they felt frustrated by arbitrary contracts and kinda just preferred sandbox. But the solution was not to give them what they thought they wanted and leave all the constraints to players. The solution was to carefully build a set of backbone missions that aren\u2019t arbitrary and give progression a more defined structure.

Different developer, different set of morals, ideals, values, and even probably a whole different business case.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSame can be said for the \u0022developer\u0022 of KSP 1, since this was literally their first try at developing anything even remotely resembling a video game (and to say that they were successful is quite an understatement, practically nobody\u0027s \u0022literally I\u0027ve never done this before but let\u0027s make a video game\u0022 type attempt at something goes on to become not only so financially lucrative that Squad itself pivoted into the games development industry, but that Squad went on to be acquired by a large video game publisher, and now there\u0027s a sequel coming out (maybe not by Squad, but they\u0027re still assisting in a few ways or so I remember, tho the details are hazy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 1 was a marvelous success story, even tho the state KSP 1 is in right now is still quite frankly a buggy, un-optimized mess.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: To be perfectly honest, I don\u0027t think KSP 1 ever hit the milestones that would qualify it as a \u0022finished game\u0022. If you need evidence for that, just look at the state of Career mode. What exactly is it supposed to be, nobody knows. What it\u0027s not is a good representation of how a space agency actually conducts itself. What it is is an experience that very much forces you to play the way it wants you to play, which is completely contrary to the status of KSP 1 as a \u0022mostly sandbox game\u0022. Nobody that I know likes running even 20 tourism missions to pay for their Jool-V mission, yet you\u0027ll have to run MORE than that many missions you \u0022aren\u0027t really interested in\u0022 in order to get enough funding to do what you \u0022Really Want To Do\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEND EDIT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s probably not a small part of the reason that KSP 2 exists. Sure it shares a game engine, but it\u0027s a pretty clean slate all things considered, and it\u0027s being done by people who actually have made a few video games in the past, meaning that it\u0027s almost certain to not have the same kind of issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes, when you\u0027re coding something, to fix an issue (or number of issues) you have to re-write like 90% of the code you had originally.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI believe such is the case with KSP 1 and KSP 2. The issues with KSP 1 run so deep that it is probably significantly less effort to simply start over from scratch, and that takes time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m quite confident that KSP 2 will be SIGNIFICANTLY better in most if not all aspects, not least of which is performance.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf the price we pay for that is time, so be it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI turned 34, 2 days ago. Over the years, I\u0027ve learned that there\u0027s a time for patience, and a time for \u0022action first, thinking later\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMost of the time being hasty leads to a reduction in the positive experiences you encounter. The only time this is not valid is in life-and-death situations. And just so we\u0027re all clear, when exactly KSP 2 releases, and the state which it releases in, is most certainly not a life-or-death situation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeck KSP 2 could be cancelled tomorrow and I\u0027d find a way to keep on living.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess what I\u0027m trying to say is that game development is very much \u0022a time for patience\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP 2 will be done when it is done, no matter how many hardships we have to endure, and one of the primary reasons it will be good is that it was not rushed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember the story of \u0022the tortoise and the hare\u0022. Who won that race in the end? That\u0027s right, the turtle won it. Slow and steady is the way to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides, with the current news of the release being in \u0022early 2023\u0022, combining that with the previous best estimate of when the game would be released, which was \u0022FY2022\u0022, guess what? This latest announcement on the release date is in fact not a delay at all, because \u0022FY2022\u0022 runs until something like April 2023 in actuality, which is quite literally still \u0022early 2023\u0022 (financial years are weird in that way). With that in mind, I find it hard to relate to people who continue to call this new information that the game is releasing in early 2023 \u0022a delay\u0022 in any way. My own analysis of it using just two pieces of information leads me to the opposite conclusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I wouldn\u0027t call the PR campaign of KSP 2 \u0022disgusting\u0022 either.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo things happened that were unable to be foreseen.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Covid-19 happened, which delayed pretty much every planned activity, the world over, not just KSP 2.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. The game development studio responsible for developing KSP 2 was subject to a hostile takeover and employee poaching by a newly-formed subset of Take-Two Interactive, which FURTHER put delays in place.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow given those two things happened to a different video game, do you think that other video game would have a good PR campaign? I certainly don\u0027t.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat being said, I think KSP 2 will be the better for that 2nd event, as the scope of what exactly KSP 2 \u0022is\u0022 was widely increased into something that is actually deserving of the title of being a successor to KSP 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo I think that \u0022only true believers remain on the forum\u0022? No. I do not. I think that people that don\u0027t believe in KSP 2 are active, just not on the KSP 2 Discussion sub-forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess I\u0027m saying \u0022Don\u0027t post your own opinions as fact unless you have concrete data (with sources that you\u0027re willing to share) that supports it\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI could say \u0022cows can fly, that\u0027s a fact\u0022 until I\u0027m blue in the face, but anyone with half a brain and the knowledge of what a cow is could be fully correct when saying that I\u0027m wrong in that statement of supposed fact.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow if I said \u0022it is my opinion that cows can fly\u0022, people could still prove me wrong, but by stating it\u0027s my opinion and not \u0022the facts\u0022, I would not be guilty of misrepresenting the facts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime

tradeoffs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may be instructive to review the history of open-versus-closed betas with KSP 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce upon a time, when KSP had a major release coming out, there used to be a thing called \u0022Experimentals\u0022 where basically anyone who wanted to could sign up for it to get an advance peek at the upcoming release, with the opportunity to submit bugs, feedback, etc.\u00A0 An open beta, basically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was that way for a while, and then eventually they shifted to doing a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eclosed\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E beta.\u00A0 Instead of having it open to the general public, they limited it to a relatively small number of people (regular players doing it as volunteers, not paid staff).\u00A0 Once they shifted to that pattern, they stayed that way for the remainder of KSP\u0027s lifecycle.\u00A0 The small, closed beta was entirely private, with members not allowed to share what they saw with the public.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, it\u0027s worth asking the question:\u00A0 why would the company do something like that?\u00A0 Obviously, they thought it would be \u0022better\u0022 for some reason, but why might that be?\u00A0 (Especially why would they think that\u0027s better when they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ealready had the experience\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of large open betas?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter all, with the open beta, they\u0027d get \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efar more users\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E providing feedback and trying all sorts of things and finding bugs and so forth, so that must be better, right?\u00A0 Why would they prefer something much smaller?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell... it turns out that \u0022more\u0022 does not necessarily equal \u0022better\u0022.\u00A0 Here are a few of the benefits you can get with a closed beta

The only good way to report actionable feedback (either a bug report, or a suggestion) is to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efile a bug in a bug database\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 And the bug has to be couched in terms that are actually useful to the devs-- for example, if there\u0027s a bug in the program, then the report needs to state a clear and succinct \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Erepro case\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E for how to reproduce the bug.\u00A0 Most people don\u0027t know how to do this.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIf you have a closed beta, you can pick and choose whom to let in, and so you have a population of reasonably-trained people giving you feedback, who can be counted on to be diligent about checking for duplicates before filing, and whose goodwill is assured.\u00A0 As a developer, it\u0027s much more useful to have 200 good, actionable bugs than to have 10,000 bug reports \u0026amp; miscellaneous feedback, of which 90%\u002B are either unactionable or duplicates of each other.\u00A0 Having the huge numbers of bugs not only doesn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehelp\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, it actually

beta.\u00A0 Knowing that they have confidentiality means that the devs can be much more open in talking about what\u0027s going on, what their problems are, their concerns about various matters, etc.\u00A0 They can be more free to experiment with ideas that might not pan out and end up needing to be axed or substantially modified.\u00A0 Whereas if it were all out in the open, this is just all sorts of PR disaster just waiting to happen, even if the devs do nothing \u0022wrong\u0022.\u00A0 People are funny creatures-- if you show them something they tend to think \u0022yes!\u00A0 that\u0027s mine!\u00A0 I\u0027m gonna have that!\u0022 and if you then decide not to do it after all, they view this as if you \u0022took it away from them\u0022 and can be vocally angry about it in ways that are unhelpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a closed beta, it\u0027s easier to manage the message, and the general public doesn\u0027t get their hands on it until it\u0027s relatively polished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also the case that with confidentiality, this gives the company various PR options, for example they can choose to do a big \u0022ta dah!\u0022 unveiling when they actually release.\u00A0 Sometimes that can have value, and it\u0027s nice for the company to have the option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFlexibility \u0026amp; practicality:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a closed beta, the devs can set things up however is convenient for \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethem\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (which is what they need), without needing to worry too much about \u0022would this arrangement leave anybody out\u0022-- because they can pick and choose who\u0027s in the beta.\u00A0 That can greatly simplify things.\u00A0 For example, back when KSP was still doing Experimentals (open beta), there was one release where they announced that they were going to have this open beta, but \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eonly people who had KSP via \u003Cstrong\u003ESteam\u003C/strong\u003E would be able to participate\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 There were perfectly good, simple, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etechnical\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E reasons for this:\u00A0 at the time, Steam had good support to meet their technical needs (in terms of releasing builds, having the necessary infrastructure for distribution, etc.)\u00A0 The problem is... the general public viewed this as \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Evile discrimination\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Lots of people were super eager to get their hands on the early version... and then became \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eabsolutely enraged\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E when they were told that they couldn\u0027t.\u00A0 (Especially people who bought the game through the KSP store, because they felt they were being \u0022more loyal and helpful\u0022 by doing so.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHoly mackerel, the KSP forums were a firestorm for a while.\u00A0 It was pretty much a PR nightmare.\u00A0 There was basically no way to tell people \u0022you haven\u0027t lost anything and this isn\u0027t personal\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint is:\u00A0 if you have something open to everyone, then the collective community is going to decide that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eyou have to support and allow everyone to do everything\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, which isn\u0027t necessarily what the devs need or want to support when they\u0027re busy working their way through the development process.\u00A0 With a closed beta, the devs can simply do whatever is technically easiest and most efficient, and not have to worry about managing the social dynamics of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Anyway.\u00A0 Those are a few of the reasons why a company might choose, for example, a closed beta over an open one.\u00A0 It\u0027s worth noting that the folks who made KSP \u003Cstrong\u003Eactually tried the open beta for several releases\u003C/strong\u003E, so they had a pretty good chance to see the advantages and disadvantages of it-- and then, they \u003Cstrong\u003Eswitched to closed beta\u003C/strong\u003E and never switched back.\u00A0 I\u0027m not a Squad employee and am therefore not privy to their internal deliberations, but I think those observable facts right there make a pretty strong case that having experienced both options in detail, they decided that on the whole, the closed beta worked better for them than the open one did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all ancient history at this point, of course.\u00A0 You weren\u0027t asking about original KSP; you were asking about KSP 2.\u00A0 Well... again, I have no idea what their plans are for KSP 2-- I don\u0027t know any more about it than you do.\u00A0 And of course, not every company (or even every game from the same company) is always going to do things the same way all the time; KSP 2 has a somewhat different context than KSP did, so the same factors wouldn\u0027t necessarily apply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, that said:\u00A0 it totally makes sense to me that they wouldn\u0027t do an open beta.\u00A0 They \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etried\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E an open beta with original KSP for several releases, and eventually gave up on it and never looked back.\u00A0 So, if it worked for KSP, it\u0027s at least plausible that it would work for KSP 2 as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-23T19:34:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding beta testing, I fully agree with what \u003Ca

I personally am extremely interested in this specific knowledge, not because I myself would like to be a tester (I am capable of it, and have assisted with finding and fixing bugs in a few KSP 1 mods in the past, but like was mentioned it\u0027s rather tedious work), rather as an indicator of how complete the general process of developing the game is, or at least how close to actually releasing it the developers think it is (things happen, sometimes you think you\u0027re 90% complete and uncover an issue that means you have to re-write half your code, I\u0027ve been there with some of the small programs I\u0027ve written for other games that have programmable elements in them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, IMO the best thing to do along with that announcement that they\u0027re doing some form of whole-game alpha or beta testing would be to include a link to some sort of online form or survey or even \u0022test\u0022 i suppose would be the most proper term for it, that would-be participants in said testing could fill out in order to opt-in for the chance to become a tester (with someone at Intercept sorting thru those applications until they think they have enough of them to continue, obviously).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125662\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Snark\u003C/a\u003E did say that the participants in the beta testing are carefully selected, and I fully agree with that, but my thinking is that the form (which serious would-be testers should probably treat more like a job application) should help make the job of sorting out who the developers think would actually make a good tester at least somewhat easier, at least in theory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-23T19:35:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2022 07:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Derpiesaurus","CreatedById":221478,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-23T20:39:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125662\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Snark\u003C/a\u003EVery well written! I absolutely agree now that it would be easier to deal with, and are likely to receive better feedback from a carefully selected group of people. However I\u0027m still not sure anything can beat a whole crowd for finding bugs (maybe not reporting them though), which in my experience tends to be what remains when a game launches. There aren\u0027t usually any deep technical problems with the vision of the game, or the general function of things. It\u0027s usually just small bugs that are found through rigorous testing. So I think some type of open.. something, would be useful, but yeah the way I explained one of the possibilities, it wouldn\u0027t be very viable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still think though, after all the answers here, that polling the community on things for KSP2 would be a good idea.

It could be a good gauge of how long the general community is willing to wait and be satisfied with things like that. Though I\u0027m open to being corrected about that too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does appear that Intercept has already been pretty open when they want community feedback, as said by someone who commented here. So with the issues that occur with open betas in mind, they pretty much are already quite close to the ideas I had in the original post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComing back to the example of the Minecraft snapshots that I used in a reply.. I reckon something like this is exactly what all games should do. I originally said it may be worth trying to be this open before the game is launched, but then everyone would hoard to the test game and scramble the bug reports and feedback like you said. I now realise that the only reason this seems to work, is that Minecraft\u0027s core playerbase seems to be kids, that are less likely to be up to date with snapshots, or even care about them. These snapshots are also specifically updates, not a new game, so there\u0027s less hype there as well. So the end result is that the users that are testing the snapshots, are usually adults, that have a good amount of knowledge on Minecraft and usually are \u0022savvy\u0022 enough to file good reports. I think KSP 2 should employ a testing method like this, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eafter\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003Ethey release the game, as it truly seems to be a great method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo all in all, pretty happy with what they\u0027re doing, development wise, and I very much expect there will be some sort of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Non-Disclosure Agreement\u0022\u003ENDA\u003C/abbr\u003E covered closed beta regardless, so my only hope now is that they do something like snapshots as I think it could be great, but I imagine they\u0027ll have a good method anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ryaja","CreatedById":221431,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-23T20:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey do not want to say they are planning a feature, change or decide not to do it, and then get eaten alive by some of the \u0022fans\u0022. remember the last delay forum post? ya that\u0027s why\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-23T23:33:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2022 11:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Ryaja\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-23T23:09:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224136408\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208268\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653334459\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, SciMan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing too detailed, just something like \u0022we\u0027re focusing on asset creation\u0022 if they\u0027re doing stuff like modelling and texturing, or \u0022we\u0027re coding (named) game mechanics (or sub-systems that enable game mechanics) and testing how they play with other existing ones\u0022,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223403ca78afd99f1b0a1979abb7daabe7d1cb2334\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002242.08\u0022 height=\u0022202\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 src=\u0022https://64.media.tumblr.com/8e70b36d2bdd1d305e0718e08b515afc/b75945eb265cc92d-3a/s500x750/3403ca78afd99f1b0a1979abb7daabe7d1cb2334.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey do have different people doing different things at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless, beta testing before release when not everything has been revealed (like, if there are some things to discover or unveil like in eg.
