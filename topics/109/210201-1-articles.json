I ask this in good heart, especially being one of those players myself because in the original game, I was able to create kerbals, but I couldn\u0027t create one to be like me. They had to be either male or female, but personally, it hurt because it made me feel that people like me won\u0027t get to one day explore the universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Keep in mind, Sally Ride, the first American \u0022woman\u0022 and third \u0022woman\u0022 in space, did not personally follow the gender binary, she was in fact an important part of the LGBTQIA\u002B community after she admitted her secret on her deathbed. I bring this up, not to be political in any way, I believe politics should stay out of space as to preserve a better future for the younger space explorers and to ensure that it is a welcoming environment for explorers of all backgrounds. I\u0027ve been playing KSP since I was little in fact, since before I understood I was a non-binary person. Which is why it\u0027s so important to understand that space isn\u0027t just about discovering what is out there to explore, but also discovering what is inside of your wonderful and kind brains to understand yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 This is why\u00A0I ask the devs to give me and many other players some representation, as we are all explorers.

This would also be great for multiplayer, because then every single beautiful person here will be able to greatly express themselves as well as have a little bit of them exploring a far of universe with near limitless bounties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSincerely,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBigStar Aerospace\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote - I ask that each one of you be understanding and unprejudiced, the KSP community is meant to be unpolitical and accepting.
