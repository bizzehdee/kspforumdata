While having a solid core gameplay loop is important for a game, its side features, mini games, details, and other \u201Cdistractions\u201D are what oftentimes give games their character and make them interesting for long periods of time. There\u2019s a reason why many combat or shooter games have puzzle segments or diversions that are don\u2019t need to be there for good progression: they give a break from the main gameplay, introducing variety into the player\u2019s experience and making the core gameplay loop more enjoyable as a result.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP, these exist to an extent, and in varying quality. There are two main loops you do in KSP: building a craft and flying it. Building is majority placing, rotating and transforming parts, using PAWs and other lists to set up those parts properly, and making sure that a variety of constraints are met. Flying, depending on the mission, will be predominantly conducted in the map view making sure that the course set is correctly and then executing it correctly, or in the flight mode, keeping a rover upright, a plane in the air, or a rocket pointing retrograde. There is lots of clicking around in PAWs for larger missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese two styles can keep players like me sustained for a while, but the added breaks really keep me from burning out due to gameplay alone. Kerbal EVAs are a cool little moment to relax during a challenging trip (if I don\u2019t have reassembly to do) and reflect on the experience. It also breaks missions into chunks instead of a marathon maneuver node fiddling session. Satellite mapping, both Stock and Scansat, is a nice break where I can sit back and watch data appear, and occasionally mark anomalies with waypoints. After a mission is done, I don\u2019t just go immediately back to building, either: there are science points to distribute, policies, building upgrades, and craft costs to choose from, and asteroids to mark for capture. These little distractions are actually the perfect remedy from burning out on an otherwise pretty focused game, and as long as they are short, they complement rather than detract from the main gameplay.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key point here is that you don\u2019t want to oversaturate the game with these; checking up on a colony every once in a while can be fine, but when you have 30 of them it starts seriously cutting into your time, which is why colonies shouldn\u2019t require maintenance on the player\u2019s part.

Even upgrading colonies from to time should still be a design challenge very similar to that of designing a vessel. Those other strategic tasks should only exist if they serve core gameplay, if they create real, quantifiable incentives that affect a players access to technology, resources, personnel, and change the way a player plans and carries out missions. A museum would be neat. But does it actually affect gameplay? No. What is happening in a planetarium? Are we just zooming around looking at things? Can\u0027t we just use the tracking station to do that? Something like Scansat is an excellent example of a \u0027minigame\u0027 that has very direct and obvious implications for vessel design and orbital maneuvering. So are some tasks on EVA, because they have to do with how you move in space and how vessels are designed to make manual access to the surface and critical systems possible. Im most interested in resource gathering and processing dynamics because that could generate whole swaths of unique vessel designs to carry out the prospecting, harvesting, and processing chain. But do we need some kind of variant of Fallout Terminal hacking to get science to work? No. Do we want players spending 20% of their time scrolling through crew rosters and assigning tasks?

We are on the same page that large amounts of time on these side tasks is detrimental (trying to transfer fuel anywhere is the epitome of that), and that scrolling through menus is not exactly the engaging diversion that we are hoping for. We are also on the same page that these things need to tie into the rest of the game in some way - both to incentivize players to do them and to make them more meaningful. Science progression is already tied into the main game so one example of how the side-gameplay of implementing new technology could be made engaging without becoming time consuming is to have an expanded Kerbilopedia (which has a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E building dedicated to it) detailing the results of your experiments and once you make certain discoveries, new parts are unlocked.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m personally in favor of a multi-resource science system instead of a discovery based one, but you can see how side-gameplay can be well designed and integrated into the game while not involving building or flying.

Yes, those buildings add a little to the experience but my \u0022museum\u0022 will be on the planet surfaces, where I see past/old expeditions, the first base structures etc. I don\u0027t need and don\u0027t want to do that in a menu/building on kerbin. It might be need for things like the first probe to flyby/orbit something, but is it cool enough that I\u0027d want dev time used up for it? Nah, not really.
