For example, have kerbals get certified for classes of\u00A0ships that have\u00A0been built,\u00A0test flown, and approved for automated flight in order to be that kind of ships pilot. Or go even further and make new kerbals blank slates and have a promotion tree system that incorporates the roles of pilot, scientist, engineer, or whatever new classifications we might desire. Then we could have generalist kerbals capable of flying small ships doing science on their own and making minor repairs or have specialists that work as a team for larger ships\u00A0with far more capabilities at the cost of requiring specialists and the in-ship infrastructure to sustain those kerbals aboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Single stage to ocean","CreatedById":210256,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-03T03:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, in career mode, it will automate it by renting, \u0022supercomputer time\u0022 which might cost 10,000 funds per 10,000 m/s burn, but automates the burn and also, gives you maneuver\u00A0nodes even at mission control level 1 for an extra fee of 3,000 funds per minute you spend messing around with manoeuvres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-03T04:36:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there are better ways to automate away busywork.

Rather than cash in a mystery goo sample from orbit to suddenly get a more powerful jet engine the player should for instance fly a jet plane for at least a consecutive minute at low and high altitudes and then return the plane to examine the flight data in detail. Likewise you could \u0022teach\u0022 the kerbals and probes to fly by gathering tons of flight data to gradually expand their options, and rather than level up each kerbal your flight data is included in their training programs so they learn most of it before showing up as usable crew in the first place. (Old pilots who missed out on this education can go home for a quick crash course to learn a few new tricks.) The balance of this could be tied to game difficulty, for a normal playthrough you can unlock smarter probes and more useful pilots by just doing a small number of simpler flights with minimal guidance requirements but for harder modes you will need to fly a number of difficult specific routes successfully and at least deposit an intact \u0022black box\u0022 on return home. This way nobody gets to just \u0022not ever learn to fly\u0022 but those who would rather focus on the joy of building ships and seeing them in their majestic glory as they traverse the cosmos don\u0027t need to get told they have to stay in the pilot seat themselves, \u003Cem\u003Ewe all get to enjoy the game our individual ways\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-03T14:48:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223934907\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200739\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221614782234\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022172225\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rejected Spawn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, Rejected Spawn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that opening statement out of the way, I\u0027m intensely opposed to \u0022if it exists it\u0027s gonna make someone have an easy time with it\u00A0so it shouldn\u0027t exist\u0022 arguments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019s not the argument though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe argument is, \u201Cif it exists, lots of people aren\u2019t going to learn to fly manually and will thereby miss out on one of the most important and enjoyable aspects of the game, so it shouldn\u2019t be stock.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs other have said no doubt \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E will be one of the first major mods for KSP2, and if someone wants to install it without ever having played it before, I\u2019m not going to stop them.
