That way, sound coming from a spacecraft would be normal to the human ear on the surface of Kerbin, but would muffle out with altitude (depending on the atmosphere\u2019s thickness), would be muted in vaccum and change in properties depending on the atmosphere\u2019s composition on other planets. This would create several interestingly\u00A0different sound environments, with each planet having its own sound properties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, do you think that sound is an\u00A0important thing\u00A0in the gameplay or that it is a waste of time for the developers ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlywheelsGroove","CreatedById":212172,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-29T16:11:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that this is going to go into the category of \u0022game feel\u0022 rather than realism. I know that if I released a giant torchship from the gantries, towed it away from the station, and lit the\u00A0engine, I would expect to hear it rumbling away under my rocket.
