The\u00A0other way other than highlighting is an option on the part to make \u0027active\u0027. Not sure how you could do this other than maybe\u00A0in the cfg file for each individual part of the model it would be listed as\u00A0maybe through a \u0027modulepart\u0027 flag as a name, then the name of the part in\u00A0question within the model would display a button like function (like\u00A0lights on / off) with \u0027movement active\u0027 or similar, or user can configure the name in the config to suit their model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust an idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-27T08:13:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2019 08:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Radar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded menu option over highlight option.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
