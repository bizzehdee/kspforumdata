This question may has been asked before. I saw informations that KSP2 is creating by completle new team. Im not sure is it true. If it is im afraid that KSP 2 will do not have that big focus on physics in this game wich was amazing. Im also afraid that game will be more like family and kids friendly to make it be easier to sold more copies :(\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-16T20:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224155458\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209005\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221658001907\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222163\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cezary59S\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, Cezary59S said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi There.

And yes it\u0027s more family friendly, but in a way so basic concepts of spaceflight should be easier to grasp for anyone - yet the whole physics remain mostly unchanged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-16T22:24:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 was started by a new team but then they brought over most of the KSP team from Squad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-16T22:39:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, started by a new team but with the original team\u0027s assistance, and now most of the original team has been picked up and are working on KSP2. So far it looks like all of the original physics from the base game are there, plus new things like interstellar travel, axial tilt, lots of new near-future engine technology all based on real physics, etc. They are hoping to get lots of new players involved, but so far it looks like they\u0027re tackling that with better tutorials and flight tools rather than dumbing the game down. With extensions like colonies and interstellar it seems like they\u0027re trying to make the learning curve easier early on but keep it sloping up far past the scope of the original game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GuessingEveryDay","CreatedById":203507,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-16T22:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget that they added \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83952-nertea/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002283952\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83952-nertea/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nertea\u003C/a\u003E, creator of ReStock and the NearFuture Technologies\u0027 mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
