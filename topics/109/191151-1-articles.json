Gravity profile, atmosphere profile, color, and continent shape. Being real here the stock planets arent all that amazing, sure we have things like the mohole that add funny character to them but overall the greatest part about them, to me, is getting to them. As far as exploring them the lack of scenery in general is pretty intense which could be fixed up a bit with some random scatter of rocks/trees. But overall so long as the planets arent exactly alike with just a shifted hue I think somewhat random generation wouldnt be that bad. Simple rules like if it has water then craters should be minimal , If its tidally locked craters should be more prevalent on the side facing outward, and other simple rules that determine the topography of each planet in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel if these exist and there are artist planets sprinkled in it would be similar to any painting or bouquet where you have the generic background that makes the truly unique and nuanced worlds really shine. We can go in depth about all the mechanics of planets formation and what not, but over a real galaxy with trillions of planets, the vast majority of them will most likely be very similar to one another among a small set of categories (gas giants, rocky planets, super earths, etc) which is perfectly suited for a random noise generator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust make sure the artist made planets are predominately in nearby star systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
