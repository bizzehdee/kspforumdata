The only way to 100% solve the time warp paradox is if everyone timewarps at the same speed at the same time (already implemented) - another way that isn\u0027t as elegant but makes the game more playable is\u00A0for example warping only your ship while keeping others at their own timewarp (also already implemented). IIRC there are more options, but it\u0027s been a while since I messed with multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CocoDaPuf","CreatedById":120188,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-20T18:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223653839\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566260286\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022141778\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Loskene\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/19/2019 at 8:18 PM, Loskene said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027ll have to be some sort of server control or vote system for timewarp but I don\u0027t know how you\u0027ll do rolling back time to revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.
