Celestial bodies isn\u0027t dealt with by this case, but I was essentially thinking that for most of the game, players will be using Hohmann transfers and a ship attempting to rendezvous with another ship on a Hohmann Transfer would have to wait until that transfer window due to delta-V costs, and that would un-mess-up the positioning of the other ship. Then, because the player is at the transfer window, it is as if they had launched their craft at roughly the same time and one player can time warp their ship up to the transferring ship without breaking the game. Essentially, the other craft doesn\u0027t have to warp because it is as if the two ships had launched at the same time. And if someone wants to rendezvous with a craft outside of the transfer window, at that point they have a torch drive and it wouldn\u0027t matter if the other ship time warped or not because it would be caught up to anyways. So for non-stable orbits (which involve multiple SOIs) the other craft doesn\u0027t have to warp to keep the balance of the game. There should be a button that says \u0022Warp to the transfer window that the other player is using\u0022 though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-03-05T17:44:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2022 05:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by t_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyFall2489","CreatedById":216984,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-05T17:48:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLife Support is another topic.
