So the contractual protection of S.T ends in December. Then, given about 3 mnts of pay as per your comment, stretched out over not the full staff as some left for Intercept, Star Theory ran dry their funds and closed on March 4th (which is roughly consistent with these three months of pay), sending their employees home \u0022with a months pay and 2 months health insurance\u0022, as per the Bloomberg Article. In this case, the answer to the question \u0022why would you fire a studio months before a deadline\u0022 would need no explanation, they could per the contract, and negotiations/relations broke down, so they did. \u003Cem\u003EIn this scenario, you could reasonably have the moral qualm as to why TT is able to so quickly fire a studio in the contract in the first place, given what the result would be\u00A0in general\u00A0for the studio and its people if T2 were to do that.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a less extreme case, TT had to wait until some milestone deadline somewhere in between December and march. This means that S.T could have survived a little longer, and was more protected from willynilly mood changes at TT. \u003Cem\u003EThen a question for TT becomes: why do you have milestones that could end the contract built into said contract, which are months before a deadline to deliver the final product? Why would TT want the ability to go\u00A0like: \u0022well ehh, everything has been going good so far, but you missed the last milestone, and so you are fired for a game people expect next month\u0022.\u003C/em\u003E It doesn\u0027t make sense to me to put this in a contract. But hey, I\u0027ve got no business experience, but as for moral qualms, you could take issue with this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other extreme, S.T was protected against TTs attempts to break the contract until it expired, which is probably somewhere in March but at least in the spring before March 21, when T2 fiscal year ended. Given the savings we\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eexpect\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Estar theory to have at that point, there must have been a lot of foresight into the hopelessness of the future for S.T to shutter on March 4. This could be the case as well, since the coronavirus pandemic cancelled the conference central to their survival strategy (conventions don\u0027t happen every month), and made publishers more privy in general (making backdoor pitches harder).

Even if you aren\u0027t implicated, start looking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, there\u0027s a bit of a difference between \u0022Didn\u0027t deliver what\u0027s promised on time,\u0022 and \u0022Expectations expanded\u0022. It sounds like negotiations weren\u0027t just for extra time, but for larger scope of the game delivered at a later date, to which T2 were amicable, all based on reception of the teaser and consequent information in 2019. If the game was to be released in spring 2020, by early fall, the team should have been polishing and fixing bugs. If instead, they were working on new features based on T2 verbal assurances that they\u0027ll get more time, then by the time formal negotiations started in late fall, early winter, there was no way to ship the game in spring 2020, and that wouldn\u0027t be ST fault. They were working towards later release date in good faith. Nonetheless, it would be sufficient to give T2 grounds for contract termination at this point, because the existing contract did technically specify an infeasible date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe don\u0027t know if that\u0027s what actually happened. In general, deadline extensions are a tricky business. Both sides have to work in good faith, or at least one will get screwed. If ST continued to work towards spring 2020 release despite talks with T2 about extending deadline, a lot of that final polish work would have to be re-done. The game would take even longer to release, and it would cost more money to make, which would have to be reflected in new contract. If ST starts working towards new release date immediately, then they are technically in breach of contract until new contract is signed, giving T2 a lot of leverage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, it\u0027s also possible that spring 2020 was never a realistic date, and that the game was heading for a delay even under original scope. That would give T2 a lot more reason to be upset. But it still doesn\u0027t explain why Take Two was happy to just hire back majority of these people, including creative director, to continue working on the project. If you have a studio that slips deadlines and negotiates in bad faith, it\u0027s never just one or two people at the head of the studio. It\u0027s always a team effort of at least several senior people in the studio. Primarily, because good managers simply won\u0027t work for awful ones. So the fact that T2 hired a huge chunk of leadership suggests things couldn\u0027t have been all that bad with the delay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNaturally, all of this is still speculation. It\u0027s hard to say exactly what sort of promises were made behind closed doors, and what sort of mistakes people made based on partial information rather than due to malice or negligence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Numberyellow","CreatedById":172745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-07T16:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223798660\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194406\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591510517\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022122674\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Starman4308 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort version: insufficient data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong version: I\u0027ve found most of the flak leveled at Take Two laughable, with this being the first real concern.

I\u0027ll take it back as a wild accusation itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what I know, from the article with all the cruft cut out:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nStar Theory failed to meet at least 2 deadlines. This could be the fault of either party or no party. But it\u0027s a fact. Twice the release date has been pushed so at least twice, a deadline was not met.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe three main creative leads of the project left immediately when offered a new job. Maybe they were scared of losing their job. Maybe they only cared if they could work on KSP2 and not who for. Maybe they hated their old bosses. Maybe maybe maybe. I don\u0027t care why because I don\u0027t know why and I can\u0027t know why. They left immediately. I got this from the article and see no reason to not believe it as a fact.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n1/3 of the programmers followed them immediately. Over 1/2 did eventually. This I also got from the article.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion the rest of the fallout is immaterial. COVID19 hit. Star Theory couldn\u0027t remain solvent. Same thing happened to the taco place down the street and I\u0027ve spent a lot more money there in the past than I have on Take Two games. I\u0027m also a lot more upset about it but that\u0027s not really the point of this post. The point is it happens. Companies fail especially when hit with multiple instances of bad news.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an example of something that may have happened. Maybe the two business leads of Star Theory were bad at their job. They were overworking the programmers and making unmeetable deadlines and propping up the company with metaphorical sticks and canvas, hoping to sell to Take Two, make a bunch of unearned money, then cut and run. But Take Two didn\u0027t like the terms, so negotiated long enough for the ruse to become obvious when the second deadline (which the programmers were furiously trying to meet in spite of it being impossible) passed unmet. At this point, the contract became void and Take Two could release themselves from it. So they had two choices: Drop Star Theory like a hot potato and star over, or head hunt Star Theory\u0027s best resource - the actual people who did the actual work - and continue making the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d be interested in facts that don\u0027t back this scenario up. Note I\u0027m not calling this scenario a theory, or a hypothesis, or even a possibility. I\u0027m using it as an example of one of hundreds of scenarios someone could come up with that reasonably fit the real, actual data we have. Data that is so scant that no one can really come up with anything that fits it that they can say with any assurance is the truth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Numberyellow","CreatedById":172745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-07T19:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223798923\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194406\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591558191\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Superfluous J\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, Superfluous J said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings and stuff\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, this is all entirely reasonable.
