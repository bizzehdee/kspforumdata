I\u0027m new here on the forums. I don\u0027t know if this has been mentioned before, or talked about, but I would really appreciate being able to float around a spaceship in kerbal POV in order to set experiments and control the inner ship, etc. I don\u0027t know what will go into making such a feature, or if it\u0027s too late. I would be really interested in a response of how feasible this is and if it is a good idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Dressian Exploder","CreatedById":191542,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-20T07:23:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a pretty cool idea. Of course for the time being there\u0027s the FreeIVA mod, but it\u0027s a little under-developed and doesn\u0027t have all the functionality you mentioned. \u002B1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-20T11:49:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be really nice to see expanded IVA functionality. I hope that they\u0027ll have support for both cockpit instrumentation and walking/floating\u00A0around inside them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
