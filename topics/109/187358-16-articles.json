(For the record, I think it\u0027s decidedly beautiful. But I digress.) Anyway, of the now front-and center timewarp bar we can see that the little selector is centered on the fourth nock out of eight, which is indicated to be 100x normal speed. If each additional nock is\u00A0 assumed to be an order of magnitude, that means that the maximum timewarp factor is now one million times normal speed, ten times the maximum value in the original game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat does that mean? Well, it depends on how gameplay is going to be designed. I\u0027m really doing Fermi ballparks here, so for the sake of simplicity let\u0027s say that flying from Kerbol to some reference star is intended to take on the order of ten minutes. Note that could be five minutes, it could be forty. Just ballpark order of magnitude, ten. So, what does ten minutes at a million times speed get you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n19.03 Earth years, AKA 65.19 Kerbin years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we\u0027re expected to make interstellar transits that take more than one year and less than a hundred, which in this reference example is 20 years. In terms of multiplayer lag times this means we should expect to have to catch up by decades at times, provided the game ends up being designed that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0If the reference star is five light years away, basic naive newtonian math would have you at\u00A0an average speed of about 0.26c, and given a brachistochrone of half acceleration and half deceleration you actually would hit 0.52c at the halfway point. Lorentz factor makes this math up to 17% off from true at that point, but whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccruing 156\u00A0million meters per second in ten years using this math corresponds to a constant acceleration of 0.5 m*s^-2, aka\u00A00.05 G. What can that tell us about the implications of ships and engines in the game, then?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor one, this on the surface is a ludicrously powerful drive if it\u0027s pushing any real tonnage to that reference star. In fact I\u0027d be inclined to name it the endgame torch drive, simply because of the fact it would enable\u00A0you to reach half the speed of light. If KSP 2\u0027s \u0022reality-inspired\u0022 engines acted anything like they would in real life, and I assume they would, then somewhere I have made a wrong assumption. The Daedalus drive was only ever designed to reach single digit percents of c, and drives like project Orion provide so much acceleration and comparatively similar\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E that interstellar flights conducted using them would probably look more like an impulsive transfer. Reaching half the speed of light is quite simply not something that actually happens, and in fact it makes me want to believe that those multi-G \u0022Expanse flight\u0022 crazy brachistochrones will be entirely confined to interplanetary missions in KSP 2. You\u0027re either burning hard and coasting for years or you\u0027re pulling milli-G acceleration if you\u0027re going to another star.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027m forced to conclude something from my analysis is amiss. It could be that\u00A0this screen has either an un-upgraded timewarp bar, or that its last setting is NOT merely a million times normal speed. Alternatively it\u00A0is possible interstellar distances have been shrunken as the Kerbolar system was in the name of gameplay consideration. The only alternative to either of these options is that the game contains ships capable of exceeding 10% of c, and I refuse to believe that\u0027s the case. End conclusion, either wait times will be on the order of centuries at least or else the stars are gonna be really close together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRamble over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hTeXe8t.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022568\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/hTeXe8t.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-06T13:07:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2021 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Wubslin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-06T14:54:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223921093\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221612616654\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209472\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wubslin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Wubslin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk guys, with all the talk...\u00A0 \u00A0 ...\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003ERamble over.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like to think the new and improved timewarp won\u0027t be entirely stepped but will allow you to smoothly increase the passage of time - I\u0027d rather this over KSP 1\u0027s sometimes jarring steps which can lead to accidentally flinging past things because you decided to make the journey a bit quicker.\u00A0 Side note, the output on the right hand side of the bar looks like it can be typed in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wubslin","CreatedById":209472,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-06T15:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223921135\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221612623282\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n48 minutes ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like to think the new and improved timewarp won\u0027t be entirely stepped but will allow you to smoothly increase the passage of time - I\u0027d rather this over KSP 1\u0027s sometimes jarring steps which can lead to accidentally flinging past things because you decided to make the journey a bit quicker.\u00A0 Side note, the output on the right hand side of the bar looks like it can be typed in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the seven segment dealio is just a stylistic thing.

It\u0027s important to note at this point that although Bob\u0027s KSP 2 game is very new, it isn\u0027t brand new. The day before, Bob had created the game and sat idle in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (thus using \u003Cem\u003Eno in-game time\u003C/em\u003E) while Jeb had joined and immediately \u0022launched\u0022 a rocket. Jeb sat on the pad and timewarped to \u003Cem\u003Et=0d 3h 0m\u003C/em\u003E for no reason in particular, and then logged off.

He\u0027s about to come up on the \u003Cem\u003Ethree day\u003C/em\u003E mark of Kerbin\u0027s calendar from the game being created. Jeb, now parked in low orbit of the starter planet, decides he wants to rendezvous with Bob\u0027s ship and dock with it or smash into it or something. Importantly, he wants to interact with Bob\u0027s ship. Jeb hits the timewarp button and exits right at the point he needs to be in order to start an injection burn.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E6. Ten minutes of game uptime (NOW): \u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EWith Jeb joined into the game, a fundamental characteristic of KSP 2 multiplayer has now kicked in. When both friends stopped playing yesterday, Jeb\u0027s rocket sitting out on the pad accumulating mission time and doing nothing was considered the \u0022Most Current Present\u0022. Because Bob was fiddling around in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, his game\u0027s clock had never advanced past t=0. Today however, Bob fired up the game and by himself managed to overtake Jeb as the player with the most advanced timeline - the MCP. At the instantaneous moment described by this diagram I\u0027ve drawn, Jeb is only at \u003Cem\u003Et=2d 0h 0m\u003C/em\u003E while Bob is already at \u003Cem\u003Et=3d 0h 0m\u003C/em\u003E. For Jeb starting his injection burn, there is no corporeal player he could conceivably interact with at that moment. Were his ship magicical and had the ability to teleport instantly to the pink moon, his game time would still be only at \u003Cem\u003Et=2d 0h 0m.\u003C/em\u003E At that point in the game\u0027s time, Bob had already inserted into his current orbit. Since time paradoxes can\u0027t be a thing that happens (nor can \u0022Back to the Future\u0022 style retroactive screw-overs), were Jeb to go out there he would see a ghosted image of Bob\u0027s ship in orbit as it was back when Bob\u0027s present was at \u003Cem\u003Et=2d 0m 0s. \u003C/em\u003EThe ghost would not have collision, although it would perfectly mimic whatever Bob was doing at that time.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EThe future: \u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EAs the gameplay in this situation would have it, Jeb doesn\u0027t need a magical ship to see Bob\u0027s ghosted image. As he completes his injection burn and eventually inserts into orbit around the moon, he would if he wanted to have the option to get right up next to Bob\u0027s ghosted ship in order to expedite their rendezvous.

The diagram is centered around a single planet with two moons, with a purple moon in a circular orbit close to the planet and a pink moon in a circular orbit further away from the planet. The diagram is a snapshot in real life time, representing an instantaneous moment exactly 10 minutes after the host player (Bob) has fired up an instance of KSP 2 multiplayer using a game he had created yesterday. To better understand the chart, I\u0027ve labeled six points (circled) which represent in true chronological order what has happened so far in gameplay for today.

His path, in dark green, represents the lazy orbital period around said moon.

Eight minutes of game uptime: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003ESeveral seconds after exiting timewarp and still in orbit of the pink moon, Bob\u0027s friend Jeb logs on and decides to join on Bob\u0027s game. It\u0027s important to note at this point that although Bob\u0027s KSP 2 game is very new, it isn\u0027t brand new. The day before, Bob had created the game and sat idle in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (thus using \u003Cem\u003Eno in-game time\u003C/em\u003E) while Jeb had joined and immediately \u0022launched\u0022 a rocket. Jeb sat on the pad and timewarped to \u003Cem\u003Et=0d 3h 0m\u003C/em\u003E for no reason in particular, and then logged off. The game thus recorded that Jeb was at \u003Cem\u003Et=0d 3h 0m\u003C/em\u003E when he stopped playing.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E Fast forward to today, namely \u003Cstrong\u003Et=8 minutes\u003C/strong\u003E of the server being up, Jeb has joined back in on Bob\u0027s game and finally hit spacebar to launch that rocket which had been sitting on the pad for so long. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EThis event is labeled as the blue X on the origin planet.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Nine minutes of game uptime: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003EBob is still loitering in orbit of pink moon. He\u0027s on his phone or something, and disengaged with the game at the moment. He\u0027s about to come up on the \u003Cem\u003Ethree day\u003C/em\u003E mark of Kerbin\u0027s calendar from the game being created. Jeb, now parked in low orbit of the starter planet, decides he wants to rendezvous with Bob\u0027s ship and dock with it or smash into it or something. Importantly, he wants to interact with Bob\u0027s ship. Jeb hits the timewarp button and exits right at the point he needs to be in order to start an injection burn.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E6. Ten minutes of game uptime (NOW): \u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EWith Jeb joined into the game, a fundamental characteristic of KSP 2 multiplayer has now kicked in. When both friends stopped playing yesterday, Jeb\u0027s rocket sitting out on the pad accumulating mission time and doing nothing was considered the \u0022Most Current Present\u0022. Because Bob was fiddling around in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, his game\u0027s clock had never advanced past t=0. Today however, Bob fired up the game and by himself managed to overtake Jeb as the player with the most advanced timeline - the MCP. At the instantaneous moment described by this diagram I\u0027ve drawn, Jeb is only at \u003Cem\u003Et=2d 0h 0m\u003C/em\u003E while Bob is already at \u003Cem\u003Et=3d 0h 0m\u003C/em\u003E. For Jeb starting his injection burn, there is no corporeal player he could conceivably interact with at that moment. Were his ship magicical and had the ability to teleport instantly to the pink moon, his game time would still be only at \u003Cem\u003Et=2d 0h 0m.\u003C/em\u003E At that point in the game\u0027s time, Bob had already inserted into his current orbit. Since time paradoxes can\u0027t be a thing that happens (nor can \u0022Back to the Future\u0022 style retroactive screw-overs), were Jeb to go out there he would see a ghosted image of Bob\u0027s ship in orbit as it was back when Bob\u0027s present was at \u003Cem\u003Et=2d 0m 0s. \u003C/em\u003EThe ghost would not have collision, although it would perfectly mimic whatever Bob was doing at that time.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EThe future: \u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EAs the gameplay in this situation would have it, Jeb doesn\u0027t need a magical ship to see Bob\u0027s ghosted image. As he completes his injection burn and eventually inserts into orbit around the moon, he would if he wanted to have the option to get right up next to Bob\u0027s ghosted ship in order to expedite their rendezvous. He doesn\u0027t do this however, and instead decides to finally get his game clock synchronized with Bob\u0027s. Jeb right clicks on Bob\u0027s ship, and selects the \u0022warp to player\u0027s present\u0022 button.
