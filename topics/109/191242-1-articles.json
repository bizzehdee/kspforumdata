At some point, it does not makes sense to still speak of traveling. The ship have probably reach its cruise speed a generation ago and won\u0027t start breaking before another generation. In the meantime, people are just living their life inside what could probably be considered a permanent habitat. If you stretch the travel length a bit more, it makes no sense at all to even have a destination. The generation you live in, won\u0027t be the one reaching the planet, is not the one who left the planet, have been raised by a generation of people who also didn\u0027t left the planet and you\u0027ll raise another generation of people who won\u0027t reach a planet either, and since space is big and empty, you\u0027ll probably won\u0027t see another planetary body before long.

You can probably harvest some stuff, but I would not count on it.

Even with real time news, you\u0027ll have to filter. If you have ten year lags (and it keeps rising), I do not know at which point people eventually give up on keeping tabs about what\u0027s happening home. They\u0027ll have enough stuff to keep track of around them, anything that\u0027s not a major event will probably be see as futile. And outdated: it happened ten years ago, if they publish a reaction, they\u0027ll get it twenty years after the event. A little bit like if we would receive next year a message saying \u0022Sorry for your losses on this 9/11 day\u0022.

I mean, even if we can reach 0.2c, going to Alpha Centaurii is still at least twenty years. So you want to be as self sustainable as possible (and I know, nothing really is). So going there and back is fourty years. At best (not counting looking for stars and first try at colonization, which might take a decade before abandoning it), roughly two generation. If you pack everything from the start, it\u0027s going to be a tough start. Refueling it means going faster than the mother ship, and we\u0027re already at 0.2c (which already seems way below our tech level), why not, but then you\u0027re energy budget is sky rocketing (well, a bit like your ship anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, as I see it, a ship which have for destination another star system, must be either fully-automated (we\u0027re not sending people there), or an as autonomous of an habitat as possible.

Seeing how we\u0027ve already had multiple\u00A0unrelated techs proving the conversion of heat directly to electricity is possible I\u0027d bet quite a bit we\u0027ll have some\u00A0relatively potent stuff by the time that fusion reactor becomes more of an everyday thing.

First of all; some kind of non solid shield around the ship would be 100% essential for survival, we could get wiped out before even making it past the moon if we didn\u0027t have that since space does have tiny debris all over the place and the debris by itself is moving at deadly speeds. Let\u0027s look at what kinds of speeds we\u0027re talking about for the ship then. The speed of light with a bit of rounding is 300.000.000m/s. The speed of sound in our thick atmosphere is about 343m/s. When we fire a rifle bullet that travels at the speed of sound, that thing gets pretty gosh darn far and is\u00A0still rather\u00A0deadly. Increasing the speed of the bullet means it\u0027s going to break apart - higher speeds make it break apart more, but it will keep posing a major threat for a very long distance no matter what. Reach a high enough speed and\u00A0the bullet essentially vaporizes in a microsecond but the individual atoms (or even ions) will still be travelling a very substantial distance and rip apart anything in their path as well as create a massive shockwave and releasing immense heat. Taking the speed up to just 1% of the speed of light, this bullet is going to be so deadly it\u0027s not even funny. That\u0027s in our thick atmosphere. How dense and big\u00A0would the\u00A0cloud of gas or plasma have to be to shield our precious ship from the impact of something like that? Don\u0027t ask me, I\u0027m not interested enough to do the math properly to be honest, however using any ballpark estimate we probably all conclude that it would have to be impossibly huge, way beyond what seems to be within the realm of what we can build any decade soon. Interstellar space isn\u0027t empty, there will be pebbles far bigger than a meek bullet out there and we\u0027re more than a little likely to hit one dead on. My take on this is that we just won\u0027t be going anywhere all that fast. On a related sidenote, everyone keeps asking why the aliens that should be out there haven\u0027t come over to play... yeah, they probably like being alive and won\u0027t be going interstellar unless they have to for survival reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m in agreement that planets solve a number of issues but don\u0027t forget that they also come with other issues instead. Any planet that has an atmosphere is most likely a toxic wasteland, any that doesn\u0027t have one is not going to provide\u00A0much better shielding against radiation and space debris than if you were on a space station, it just limits how many directions you can get hit from. Sitting on a planet means that if there is an asteroid heading for it you have no choice but to drop everything and evacuate, a space station however is both a smaller target and can just get out of the way if need be. Now if we presume we find a planet like earth, it doesn\u0027t have terrible atmosphere and it has all the good stuff we liked about this ball of dirt, it may also have life on it... Does that mean we\u0027re better off or worse off? Probably worse off. If any complex life has evolved in a similar fashion to\u00A0earth life there\u0027s a high probability some of this life will be bacterial, viral, parasitic or severely toxic - in an alien fashion\u00A0that our bodies have never evolved to handle. There are tribes of humans on earth that can\u0027t be contacted because they\u0027d likely die from exposure to\u00A0the bacterial and viral evolution that\u0027s been going on in the rest of the worlds population, their immune system is just outdated by hundreds of generations... imagine your immune system being many times worse off than that. Our best planetary bet is to claim a guaranteed dead world, terraform it over a huge span of time and then hope we can stay there without any issues. Compared to that I think a colossal space station where hundreds of millions of us live in comfort and safety sounds like a much better idea. Keep in mind that the station might as well be as big as we can possibly make it, if we have the waste heat problem covered the upper size limit skyrockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding non frozen cryostasis, there are loads of things in our blood other than oxygen carriers and immune cells, this video by Kurzgesagt covers a bit of the complexity involved: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/BSypUV6QUNw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/BSypUV6QUNw\u003C/a\u003E (good channel, usually almost completely objective, does inject opinion in some topics though so take those with a bucket of salt) Moving further from regular cells we are also home to a huge amount of bacteria that are essential to our health, if we modify our bodies and become an unsuitable home for them, there is substantial risk it will greatly affect our health. If you take an interest here\u0027s a rather amusing Joe Scott video on the topic: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/iytAHXo2_V8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/iytAHXo2_V8\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Anyway I\u0027d say cryostasis (as a broad term including just \u0022chilling out\u0022) is way too dangerous to get into any decade soon, there are far too many factors that we know far too little about to safely mess with. I\u0027d strongly prefer simply staying awake playing tetris for a thousand years instead of taking a potentially deadly powernap on the way over to the nearest star. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-31T11:10:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2020 11:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Rejected Spawn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDun goof\u0026#039;d the quotingthingading.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
