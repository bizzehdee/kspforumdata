I just thought that since basically everyone from star theory moved to the new development studio, that it wouldn\u2019t matter. But I\u2019ve been reading a lot of comments from when this initially happened, and it seems that a lot of people are confident that the game will be ruined completely. What do you guys think? Im still confident It\u0027ll be great!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Defenestrator47","CreatedById":145983,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-04T03:19:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInitially it sounded sleezy as hell, and I left a post in super angery mode.\u00A0 More information came out, in part from Shadowzone, who makes some wonderful youtube vids about KSP1, including ship builds and news.\u00A0 It appears, from what is known (not all, from outside) that Star Theory overpromised and then were under-delivering on KSP2.\u00A0 The owners then made a bid to have Take Two acquired the studio.\u00A0 Take Two instead took back the property from them, spun up its own studio (Intercept) and sent backchannel offers to the staff at Star Theory to join Intercept and stay with the project.\u00A0 In large part, it seems that the people on the project accepted this offer, and Star Theory was left largely depopulated, with no income stream and few employees left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not the cleanest of transactions, but the workers, whom I was most concerned about, have kept their jobs under a new studio.\u00A0 I don\u0027t really give a single care for the owner class.\u00A0 And the game itself looks extremely promising from what\u0027s been shown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-04T06:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOld news and it shows the ugly side of running a business.

Not much else to say about that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re lucky that the principle personnel decided to continue with the project with a new studio. Typically that situation would be a death knell for a project or freeze production for years before development would start again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re lucky that the development team are such passionate fans of KSP to continue and do it right by the fans.
