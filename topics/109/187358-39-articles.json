How absurd would it be for me to say: here, process this 100 TB of information right now. Similarly, that\u0027s not what I\u0027m advocating when I say KSP should be a MMOG. I\u0027m talking about accessibility and persistency of user generated data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-20T14:17:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2022 02:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Vl3d\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-20T14:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224120101\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221650463115\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n36 minutes ago, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you\u0027re actually saying is that you don\u0027t want UI clutter in map view and invasive interactions in multiplayer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats part of it, but it\u0027s more than that. Sure space is huge, but the equatorial orbit of Kerbin at 80-100km isn\u0027t actually that big. When Im docking to a station I don\u0027t want to see dozens of other vessels and spent stages and other people\u0027s stations hurtling around. Id also strongly prefer that things like resource values and science hotspots were not evenly distributed on planets, meaning there would some locations that were better to land and mine than others, even producing relatively small optimum locations for this or that resource that encouraged precise landings and clever transport strategies. I don\u0027t want to pull up to a primo fueling location or unique surface feature on Minmus and find it incomprehensibly cluttered with hundreds of other player bases all clipped through each other. I certainly wouldn\u0027t want the game optimized to make planet surfaces deliberately generic and unvaried so everyone spreads out evenly.\u00A0Again, this is just a personal preference. If multiplayer worked that way I\u0027d likely avoid it entirely.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-20T14:35:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2022 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
