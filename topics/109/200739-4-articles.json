I\u0027d like to just quickly comment on these three factors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: The vision of KSP 2 is actually the less \u0022knowable\u0022 factor to us at this point, given that the devs need to avoid spoilers and making promises that possibly don\u0027t pan out I think we\u0027ll have to largely set this aside for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: The development cost is hard to estimate but you seem to assume that they work on a system where they have absolutely no room for anything that isn\u0027t critical to just getting the core running, I don\u0027t think this is the case since they were able to extend the deadline by a massive leap and seem to have enough personnel to get a lot of less critical features implemented. This is just my impression though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3: The community reception is what really has the power to largely override both of the two factors if it\u0027s substantial enough. These days a game isn\u0027t something that sells 90% of its total in a single week and then gets played for a month and forgotten, we mostly live in a connected world where a platform like Steam manages to keep games selling for ages and the opinions of existing players greatly influence the long term sales through reviews and other feedback. If we step away from the automation for a moment and just take a general feature that would cost time and money to develop, the question is just how much of an impact it has on the long term sales and the happiness of players. If it costs 50k\u00A0currency\u00A0to implement and makes up for it with\u00A0100k currency\u00A0in additional sales then it\u0027s likely a good idea to make the investment. Going back to the case at hand, KSP2 isn\u0027t KSP 2.0, it\u0027s an entirely different beast and your argument that convenience for casual/lazy/incompetent players is too expensive to add would result in the effect that they just aren\u0027t going to play the game rather than suddenly stop wanting to be casual, or somehow develop skills they literally can\u0027t. You\u0027re cutting out a section of the potential audience. Even worse you\u0027re not factoring in that long term a game keeps selling more the more its players enjoy messing around in it, because if your Steam friend Bob is popping up a notification that he keeps playing the same game 5 days every week then of course you\u0027ll wonder what\u0027s so good about it, this is how an important number of sales are made after the initial rush. An important aspect to this is to keep players from getting tired of the game because it\u0027s the same old thing, now in KSP we\u0027ve seen that a select portion keeps doing Apollo reimaginations\u00A0to death but for most players the game is more engaging the more they can do with it and the less it gets in the way of any one thing they enjoy about it, I have a very hard time imagining that anyone would complain if KSP2 makes sure players experience and understand flight before letting them automate flight but it would go a tremendously long way when it comes to ensuring that players don\u0027t get sick of having to manually fly things when they just want a craft to go to some specific location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/180102-mcwaffles2003/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022180102\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/180102-mcwaffles2003/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@mcwaffles2003\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0already mentioned this, KSP2\u00A0will be far more drawn out across very big stages and I think it\u0027s very foolish to cut the game off from those who mostly just want to enjoy the last stage of large scale management. Not sure how well known the X series of games is here, the overlap with KSP is very slight and mostly just that both are space games, but I\u0027d like to just mention that in the latest one (X4 Foundations) there is a huge array of play styles being enabled without compromising one another. Want to get in the pilot seat and go blast some pirates? Sure, knock yourself out endlessly! Want to be a peaceful trader? No problem, buy low and sell high on the ever fluctuating markets!

I NEVER want to be selfish, but I believe this feature would be a waist of development time, and would not really change much. The game is confirmed to have mission preplanning so piloting you rocket will probably be very easy (don\u0027t quote me on that \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E manuever nodes are also obviously in the game. I just do not understand why a full autopilot should be in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-05T22:45:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223936170\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200739\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221614926616\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167629\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brikoleur\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Brikoleur said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, there really are people who want to make flying optional\u00A0in a game that\u2019s about flying because MY FREEDOM TO PLAY AS I WANT.

I\u0027ve been using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E from .21. Without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E I would have quit playing. I would have never gotten to find out how fun and rewarding KSP could be. Nor I would have found out how beautiful the Kerbol system could be. You see, using a keyboard and mouse to play flight and driving sims is a serious handicap for me. I need to use a joystick, hotas, or a gamepad\u00A0since very fine control is needed along with very course controls.\u00A0Since KSP\u0027s controller support was terrible, I had no choice. (I hope that KSP2 controller support is much better.) My problem is that I have a hard time locating the proper key to\u00A0hit, at the right time nor do I have an instinctual feeling when to let go of the key. (This is something I\u0027ve never have been able to overcome in my 30 years of PC gaming.) So something like a simple bank turn or keeping the maneuver marker on the pro/retrograde marker is a serious chore for me. That\u0027s no fun. With \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E and other autopilots I\u0027ve found, I can still enjoy playing KSP.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
