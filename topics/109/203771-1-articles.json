A gimme\u00A0would be something similar to the Alpha Centauri star system with a binary star pair (Alpha Centauri AB) and a red\u00A0dwarf (Proxima Centauri) orbiting their barycenter.

Ever tried to hold your hand near a hot electric stove? Where it starts to burn your hand without any contact and not from hot air, but directly with infrared radiation? That\u0027s what you\u0027d be dealing with. If it\u0027s hot enough to incandesce, the equilibrium temperature is going to be close to 1,000K. Hotter than surface of Venus. Now, while you are approaching it, and out of influence of atmosphere, there are ways to mitigate that. A thin foil shield, reflective on side facing the star and black on the side facing the craft, can give you about a 100x advantage on energy flow, and temperature ratio is fourth root of that, so we\u0027re talking a little over 300K, which is just a bit above comfortable room temperature, so that\u0027s perfectly fine. But you\u0027re not going to be able to maintain this arrangement going into the atmosphere. And because brown dwarves are large, you can\u0027t just go in for a quick dip. A glancing trajectory getting you into the atmosphere has you in atmosphere for a relatively long time. So now you have entry heat in addition to incandescent heat from bellow and very little in terms of where you can dump excess heat. You can probably get great data for a short while, but I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s a one way trip for any probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow much of that would get implemented into the game is hard to say.
