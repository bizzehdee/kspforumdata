There are times when small focus groups are invited when decisions need to be made, but especially for smaller games, it\u0027s usually just internal testing. (Early access scenarios notwithstanding.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeta tests are more common, but even then, for KSP2, I don\u0027t think there will be a public beta test unless it\u0027s a pre-order bonus. In which case, you\u0027d be getting it two-four months before release, so it\u0027s not really worth it. Might as well just wait for the full release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealistically, your best bet for getting to play the game early is if Intercept will have a booth at a game show event. E3 is a possibility. Gamescom and PAX Prime are also good options if the game is targeting late fall or early winter release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
