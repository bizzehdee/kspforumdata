However, deciding where these ice chunks should be is a much more complicated task.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayers will be able to create a huge amount of different craft, with parts angled in different ways, occasionally clipping or interacting in weird ways. Generating ice on these craft will be a big challenge - and then running the colliders so the ice doesn\u0027t just pass through them will be a lot on the CPU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, say you want ice on any surface that is a fuel tank or connected to a fuel tank and is less vertical than 60 degrees. Nose cones on side tanks, if they are separated by one or more parts, will not have ice even though they should be cold due to them being clipped into the main tanks. Parts that are inside the craft and surfaces that are clipped together will generate ice, even though they shouldn\u0027t. This system could work pretty well for most cases, but will fail in a big way on craft that are not designed in anticipated ways.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, colliders are a problem. If you want fidelity, you need a good number of ice chunks - some of which will probably be inside the craft due to clipping, fairings, or other bays. These are a lot of objects to track the paths of, and with many situations, the colliders will mess up and produce immersion-breaking results. Even with a lot of effort put into resolving these issues, the final effect will probably look janky a bit too often for comfort.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor modding, I guess if someone wanted to do something, it isn\u0027t impossible to create a system like this, but the effort to polish it to levels that would be good for official KSP 2 content is probably too high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeekzeek22","CreatedById":223169,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-06T15:06:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could imagine a 2D animation that is simply wrapped around the diameter of your rocket about 1m off.

If memory serves me right, the initial plan was to include everything you see in the cinematic trailer as a feature in the base game.. launch / ship visual effects included.
