Like in the movie interstellar.(not as big ofc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn other thought was if there will\u00A0be oceans just\u00A0made out of water or maybe there will be some lakes (or oceans) made out of other liquids. Titan is so far away from the sun that the conditions for hydrocarbon lakes, made out of methane and ethane in liquid form\u00A0are met.\u00A0I doubt these\u00A0will be a features in ksp2\u00A0but still would be cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are your thoughts on this?
