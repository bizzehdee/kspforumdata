We\u0027ve had a bunch of conversations about whether money needs to be in the game at all, (I lean no). It\u0027s a funny thing though because way at the back of development is resource extraction and processing,... so... what happens before that? Are all parts free? Are they free on Kerbin anyway? It seems like there needs to be a fully integrated economy of science research, resource extraction, population management at colonies, etc. for any one part to make sense? Like can we really give coherent feedback on science and progression without knowing the ultimate output--ie colony tech?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact that nothing about career/money is listed on the roadmap makes me more confident in money being a no. The thing Im curious about regarding science is if the whole \u0022resources unlocking new vehicle architecture\u0022 thing is still the case, will this not need resource extraction for the unlocking part? Will you just need to collect a sample from the area with that resource (and will it need to be returned? Will there be a reduction in the cost of research for these things if the sample is returned?). Balance is definitely going to be an issue with some of the features missing, however theyll probably make a few stopgap changes to get a better picture of things, colonies will likely be involved in the science progression for example, however before then theyll probably just increase the base modifier for generating science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-10-21T22:05:29Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2022 10:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Strawberry\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stephensmat","CreatedById":200752,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-21T23:23:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll admit, Early Access is not what I wanted.
