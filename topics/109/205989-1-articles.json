IMO 5 kN is much more reasonable and likely to be achievable in the real world.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: Put another way, assuming you don\u0027t think KSP 1 \u0022Monopropellant\u0022 also covers hypergolic fuel mixtures, the O-10 Puff engine has too much thrust for a monopropellant engine, but if the same engine had only 5 kN of thrust (and 1/4 the mass to keep the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E the same), it would be much more reasonable, because what happens when a spacecraft needs a lot of thrust out of just monopropellant in real life is that you see clusters of smaller thrusters being used, instead of one large one. However, if you assume it DOES cover hypergolic propellant mixtures, the O-10 Puff is right in the sweet-spot of small-to-medium scale hypergolic rocket engines such as used as the apogee kick motor of geostationary satellites and small upper stages of rockets such as Fregat and Briz-M.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(edit ends)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNaturally, these limits of Monopropellant technology limit both maximum thrust and maximum specific impulse to relatively low levels, whereas Hypergolic thrusters of similar thrust levels have no such issues, start reliably many many times just like Monopropellant engines if they don\u0027t have turbomachinery (some are capable of thousands of ignitions or more between needing to be inspected, let alone serviced or replaced), and offer growth options towards generally higher specific impulse and thrust (for example, the main engines of both the US Titan II \u0022ICBM-turned-satellite launcher\u0022 and the Soviet/Russian UR-500 Proton \u0022we built a mega ICBM but now we don\u0027t need it so we\u0027ll use it to launch big things into space\u0022 both use hypergolic fuels in their first and 2nd stages, which are both quite high thrust and far outside the realm of anything Monopropellant can do feasibly)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean the only way I can think of to make a Monopropellant rocket engine that scales well to high thrust levels is to switch away from using solid catalyst beds and instead use liquid solutions of catalytic agents, at which point you\u0027ve essentially made a hypergolic rocket engine with extra steps and worse performance because part of your propellants (the catalyst solution) doesn\u0027t provide any energy to the reaction. I mean there might be a way to arrange things so that the reaction is energetic enough that it self-sustains, in which case you would be able to drastically reduce the amount of catalytic solution you carry on the rocket, but at that point you\u0027re still leaving performance on the table compared to what you\u0027re almost doing, which is \u0022RP-1\u002B LOX with TEA-TEB igniter fluid used to start it\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, if you\u0027re going to use a liquid propellant rocket, other than very very specific situations there\u0027s very little reason to not use some form of 2-component fuel combination.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot even \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters are immune to this.

The reason is that the Shuttle Orbiter is BIG and quite MASSIVE, and because of that it needs the extra performance margin that hypergolic attitude control thrusters (and OMS engines) have over monopropellant ones. As a secondary matter, because they needed the OMS engines, they were already forced to have both components of hypergolic propellants on board, so the matter of making everything use the same propellants (instead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E only using Hydrazine but the OMS using Hydrazine \u002B N2O4) simplified the plumbing on that already massively complicated vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Dragon (and therefore Dragon 2 as well), the reasoning was basically down to the secondary concern on the Shuttle (it makes the plumbing simpler).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey already had the SuperDraco thrusters using hypergolic fuels, so the question of what to use for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E was simple to answer because if the attitude control thrusters can use the same fuel combination that the SuperDraco ascent abort system thrusters use, then you don\u0027t have to carry around two sets of fuel tanks to make both work, instead you can simply make one (slightly larger) set of fuel tanks that will cover the needs of both systems in the worst-case scenario, plus a safety margin. Doesn\u0027t hurt that originally they also planned to use the SuperDraco thrusters to propulsively land the Dragon capsule if they didn\u0027t need to use them during an abort (which would help speed up turn-around time because they wouldn\u0027t have to re-pack the parachutes, something that takes a long time when you have to record and review every step of it to make sure it was done right so that you are absolutely sure that they\u0027ll work right when they have to work).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK so long story short, I don\u0027t see Monoprop being particularly valuable except around low gravity worlds, as I don\u0027t expect them to be making any larger engines that run on the stuff and the specific impulse is just horrible anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhenever possible, I try to use the Vernor \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, because it reduces the number of different resources I have to carry around on the vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t be against the idea of re-naming Monopropellant to a single \u0022Hypergolics\u0022 resource, and additionally I hope that we see \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters that run on all of the new (and old) fuel mixtures that rely on a chemical (not nuclear) reaction to produce thrust.

They would obviously require Uranium or Plutonium, some form of high explosives (probably doable if you can make decouplers and stack separators), and some electronics to handle safing and arming, fusing, and the timing of all the detonators to make the thing actually go off with a significant nuclear yield and not just make an expanding cloud of plutonium atoms and whatever is left over of the fusing and trigger explosives (probably doable if you can make probe cores). After all, we\u0027re talking about nuclear explosives here, while a dud wouldn\u0027t be a GOOD thing by any means, it\u0027s much preferable to the alternative of the pulse unit going off when you don\u0027t want it to go off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more advanced \u0022Make it actually useful for doing things\u0022 type of Orion Drive is the Thermonuclear Fusion Orion drive. The drive itself is mostly similar to the Pure Fission Orion drive, but as you might guess, this uses pulse units that get most of their energy from Fusion, the fuel for which is Lithium Deuteride, and the trigger for which is a fission nuclear device similar to the pulse unit for the Pure Fission type Orion drive. The interesting thing here is that you can in fact make a \u0022directional\u0022 thermonuclear device, which means that you can make a Thermonuclear Orion drive pretty efficient since with a well engineered pulse unit you can direct roughly 80% of the energy of the pulse unit in a direction where it will impact the pusher plate. If you want to look it up, this is called a \u0022Casaba Howitzer\u0022 for some reason, but I\u0027m pretty sure most of the \u0022here\u0027s the math we did\u0022 kind of results for it are still highly classified, since we are talking about nuclear explosives after all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe drive itself would therefore have similar construction requirements to the Pure Fission Orion drive, but the pulse units are again where it gets interesting.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the sake of simplicity, we may as well say that all fusion fuel is the same. So it could be that the drive needs hydrogen isotopes, it could need Deuterium and He3, or it could need Lithium Deuteride, but the differences aren\u0027t really that large in the grand scheme of things because given enough research you could feasibly make any of the fusion drives use any of these combinations of fusion fuels. Granted, they already have the best fuel for the particular drive picked out, but the distinction isn\u0027t that relevant unless you\u0027re a nuclear physicist and not a rocket scientist.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo the pulse units would need all the things that the Pure Fission Orion pulse units need, and then a large quantity of the \u0022Fusion Fuel\u0022 resource, whatever they decide to\u00A0 call it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is my belief that Orion drives of all types are not suitable for interstellar travel. They have a lot of thrust, but for a drive using nuclear physics to create thrust the specific impulse is not that great, especially if you use the Pure Fission Orion drive. Of course, that doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re useless, in fact they\u0027re great (nearly ideal, the only downside is the difficulty of sourcing the pulse units) for interplanetary travel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh and one thing I forgot to mention, Orion drives actually work BETTER inside an atmosphere, because that means they have more reaction mass available to heat up and project at the pusher plate (the atmosphere itself that is between the pusher plate and the pulse unit will contribute to thrust, so in a way Orion drives are one of the few kinds of drives that have increasing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E as atmospheric density increases).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor interstellar travel, you need to step up to at least a Pure Fusion pulse drive, such as the Daedalus drive that we see in the very 1st KSP 2 trailer that was released.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven then, you have to be specific about which kind of pure fusion drive you are talking about. A magnetic confinement fusion drive that injects plain old Hydrogen into the exhaust to boost thrust won\u0027t work, the specific impulse is not high enough. Again, great for interplanetary travel tho, and a good bit easier to get the fuel for it than for an Orion drive (but the Orion drive can move more payload at a time because it has much higher thrust).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChemical propellants are really all about the CHON group of chemicals. Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen. Same stuff that life as we know it is mostly made of.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHypergolics and Monopropellant need a source of some Nitrogen containing ice, liquid, gas, or mineral (because Hydrazine is H4N2, UDMH is C2H8N2, and the oxidizer for both of them is N2O4, so really there\u0027s quite a lot of nitrogen involved unless you\u0027re saying Monopropellant is in fact hydrogen peroxide in which case all you would need is Water ice).\u003Cbr\u003E\nHydrolox just needs Water ice (melt and electrolyze water to get H2 and O2 and then liquefy those gases to get LOX and LH2).\u003Cbr\u003E\nMethalox needs CO2 and Water (or some other source of Hydrogen, but Water makes the Sabatier reaction\u0027s equations and the equations of methalox rocket fuel balance out nicely).\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerolox needs, well, pretty much it needs a planet that has crude oil and therefore likely abundant carbon-based plant life on it for millions of years. Alternatively with much more energy input you could create a synthetic longer-chain hydrocarbon from Methane feed-stock that acts like Kerosene/RP-1 as far as a rocket engine is concerned but is likely not quite the same when chemically analyzed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the way I see it, if you want an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E converter, you\u0027re going to have to source it from either Dres (lots of easily accessible Platinum-group metals needed for catalysts and that sort of thing) or Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you need a whole lot of metals for general building purposes, you\u0027re going to need to go to Moho (Mercury-like planet so small but highly metal-rich near the surface), or again maybe Dres or Ike or even Gilly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince they now said Minmus is glassy, if you want ceramics you\u0027re gonna want to go to Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFusion fuels, you go to either a gas giant or a planet with a water ocean (IRL it\u0027s projected that there\u0027s enough deuterium in Earth\u0027s oceans to provide our energy needs for a couple thousand years (even factoring in growth in energy needs as time advances), but there\u0027s millions of times more in Jupiter\u0027s atmosphere, and Jupiter has Helium-3 and probably a little bit of Tritium as well).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as Uranium and Plutonium and things like that, the Mun would be a good place to look, if you can\u0027t find enough on Kerbin. But really, that stuff should be around on any rocky planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-28T00:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why I hate / love KSP.
