Well as a field mechanic for a rental company I will get a call to goto a jobsite, lets say a welding machine for an example. Ill pull up at the jobsite. Put on the ol\u0027 hard hat open the door get out and walk up to the equipment and begin to look it over. Ill check the basics. oil, engine coolant, belts, fuel level, and just give it a overall look over looking for anything obvious such as fluids on the ground, melted wires, etc....anything that will indicate a equipment failure. Now keep in mind I\u0027ve only been at this machine maybe 2 mins and here comes the customer walking up....\u0022 So what did you find wrong with it?\u0022 \u0022I got a crew on the clock that needs this machine how long is it going to take to fix it?\u0022 At this point im thinking to myself \u0022Is this guy for real? I literally just pulled up to the machine haven\u0027t even diagnosed it to know what\u0027s wrong with it and this guy expects me to predict the future!\u0022 So I proceed to explain to the customer I cant answer his question because I just got here and haven\u0027t had a chance to diagnose the problem. I don\u0027t know if any parts will need to be ordered or if its something simple I can repair quickly...again I don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong with it yet! The customer depending on his mood may make a comment like \u0022Well, I thought you were a mechanic? If you cant fix it perhaps we just need to get another machine out here!\u0022 Keep in mind we are at about the 5-10 min mark since I pulled up most of that time was spent answering stupid questions that could of been spent actually trying to diagnose the equipment in order to get answers to those previous questions. So with all that being said lets apply this same scenario to KSP2 and multiplayer where the devs are the mechanic and we are the customer. So we ask the devs questions about multiplayer such as will it do x,y,z? Or will it have x,y,z? We get no answers on anything and I think I know why. For one they are still working on it and trying to diagnose issues. Until those issues are worked out or diagnosed with a solution the question is not answerable. In short THEY dont even know.\u00A0 And hell if i was a betting man i\u0027m sure the thought is or was in the past considered if multiplayer is even doable at all.\u00A0 But I think we have some other issues as well. The devs (mechanic) is not communicating that with us (customer) leaving us guessing. Why? Just be honest and state the facts and situation. Its not that hard or complicated unless YOU made it that way at which point you better double-down and put that fire out or the problems are going to start stacking up.\u00A0 So did the devs bite off more than they can chew by announcing the multiplayer feature before the netcode was even devised? Thats like the mechanic telling the customer \u0022 ill have it fixed in a jiffy!\u0022 before he even knows whats wrong with it. He would in essence be BS\u0027ing the customer correct?\u00A0 So now 3 hours have gone by (3 years for KSP2) and the customer, who is now angry realizing the mechanic BS\u0027d him, wants to know what\u0027s the holdup. You told me it would be fixed in a \u0022jiffy\u0022.........well?\u00A0 Then the mechanic just ignores him. How do you think that scenario ends? So this is where we are at now with KSP2 and multiplayer. No communication. Customer left guessing. Time delays. And we are still no closer to getting that machine running and dependable. Would a simple screenshot have gone a long way to appease the customer? \u0022This is what I found wrong. This is what I need to do to get you up and running. And this is the approx time it will take to make that happen\u0022 Why is this concept so hard? A screenshot takes a whole....what? 30 secs to take it and shoot email off to the community manager or just post it yourself?\u00A0 For a mechanic to tell the customer \u0022 It will be ready when its ready!\u0022\u00A0 Is the same as the devs telling us \u0022KSP2 will have multiplayer\u0022 3\u002B years prior and now with yet another delay.\u00A0 The word \u0022transparency \u0022 its a term or mantra we seem to use alot these days. So.....where is it? Or do we just use it when it\u0027s convenient?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour post has a great analogy that explains a lot of dev and customer behavior!

Customers want to know what model of chip, what software on it, what peripheral systems will be on it. However, back in the engineers\u2019 lab, they are testing the voltages between sections of the chip and rebuilding it to see exactly where the problems lie. No promises can be made, because despite having a chip (multiplayer) the engineers (devs) still need to make alterations and don\u2019t know if they will have to add more components or remove some, or disconnect and reconfigure some lines, etc. So if the boss promises a wifi-capable chip to the consumers and it turns out that wifi capability is causing lots of big problems and has to be removed later, the customers will be angry. So, the devs can have a working system but can\u2019t show it off (which people will interpret as showing features that will be in the game) because they never know what they will have to remove down the line.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redneck","CreatedById":2030,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-26T15:34:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224137737\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653568661\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ll start with this, before moving onto a reply:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwe\u2019ve had this discussion for about 30 pages on this thread, and unless the current line of discussion naturally makes it\u2019s way there, let\u2019s not turn it that way.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour post has a great analogy that explains a lot of dev and customer behavior!

But i will answer your question.... The kind of multiplayer i want is ANY that i can share with a group of people. I would love most of all to be able share the same craft with a person or persons. A launch,the trip to orbit, on orbit coop because if we are going interstellar its going to take a group of people to construct something in orbit to achieve this. Some of these interstellar engine bells are 16m in Diameter. Just the engine alone. I prefer a coop of players working towards same goal to build that bad boy.

Designing for a single player only experience versus a co-op capable experience is significantly different. People still seem to think multiplayer is some sort of bolt-on mechanic afterthought that is now causing problems because things were designed for a single player experience. This isn\u0027t true and multiplayer, along with modding, have been core design considerations since they originally announced KSP2 and the original KSP2 Steam page was published. You don\u0027t do more than two years of design work on core systems and then start thinking about how multiplayer might work within those systems. If you set out to make a single player and/or multiplayer experience you\u0027ll design those core systems with those design considerations from the start. In regards to the scope or \u0022type\u0022 of multiplayer, I think the changes to the Steam store page should point to what the expectation is. When it originally was published it was listed as \u0022Multi-player\u0022. It was later changed to the more specific \u0022Online Co-op\u0022. As such I don\u0027t expect there will be competitive elements to the multiplayer, such as the space race example. However, given they are also designing with the modding community in mind this type of space race multiplayer will likely be able to be done by the modding community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224138579\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653743162\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/28/2022 at 9:06 AM, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd having some kind of blueprint system to set module parameters and coordinate the players building subassemblies separately and then joining them as a whole craft.

In the videos where they\u0027ve briefly shown building in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E one of the things that was shown is how you can simultaneously work on different subassemblies in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E rather than everything having to be joined to the \u0022root\u0022 object like in KSP. This should be an obvious example of how they\u0027ve been designing systems with co-op in mind. This example works equally well if I\u0027m solo building some communication satellite subassemblies along with a rocket to put them into orbit, or if I\u0027m doing the same thing with a friend. I also think the other aspects you\u0027re talking about (e.g. taking on different roles) \u0022during a mission\u0022 will make sense for either solo or co-op play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure exactly what you\u0027re meaning by a subassemblies marketplace, however, I think you\u0027re suggesting like players publishing different craft to an online repository that other players can download the craft and load it in their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (e.g. a passive / asynchronous multiplayer).\u00A0It seemed like you could individually save the different subassemblies which is sort of a blueprint so this seems feasible to be able to publish your saved craft to somewhere like with Steam Workshop or similar. Regardless of this type of online repository of craft designs, I definitely expect that players will be able to bring their own saved designs into a co-op session. As such this would essentially mean one could design various subassemblies solo, save them, and then join into a co-op session with a friend and they would each be able to load in their various subassemblies to adjoin them to a launch vehicle they are building together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pss88","CreatedById":30630,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-30T07:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224139207\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653888022\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022221428\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PopinFRESH\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, PopinFRESH said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was later changed to the more specific \u0022Online Co-op\u0022.

As I noted in my previous reply there are some glimpses they\u0027ve shown of interfaces which seem fairly logical they are designed in a way to be able to be co-op. Based on how they\u0027ve redesigned the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E from what we\u0027ve seen of it, that seems like it would function with multiple people snapping parts onto a craft in a co-op session such as two people working on two different subassemblies at the same time. Based on Nates previous interview with Scott Manley at their early glimpse in 2019 they originally described \u00224 launch pads\u0022 and \u0022two runways\u0022 at the new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E which would sound like accounting for different players to take control of different craft (rather than multiple players crewing the same craft).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are the two main aspects of co-op that I think are reasonable in my opinion. Cooperatively building and designing craft (akin to \u0022collaborative editing\u0022 with multiple people editing the same document simultaneously) and multiple players simultaneously launching different missions to accomplish cooperative goals.

With that type of system already in place it does seem to be more probable that Take Two could force their hand, even though they\u0027ve clearly stated there will not be micro transactions, rather than doing something else like continued development of new DLC which would have a higher cost to deliver than \u0022buy fake currency pack\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224139409\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653936553\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah the kind of trading I anticipate is ad hoc arrangements between players to trade resources or share supply routes.\u00A0 None of that really needs to be formalized in a market.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t expect any type of trading be it via a marketplace or ad hoc. Any type of trading means there is some type of shared persistence among players, and secondly I don\u0027t think their goal is to add in that depth of resource management. I believe this will likely become more clear once they do a feature video to show off and talk about how colonies will work in a bit more depth. Hopefully we will get such a video around September and will have a better idea about how resources will work in that context which should help infer how resources might work more broadly, thus how that may or mayn\u0027t tie into multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asap1","CreatedById":209758,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-16T04:21:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbased on what I have seen in this thread and my personal opinion here\u0027s how I think multiplayer will pan out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis type of multiplayer would be highly cooperative and would require coordination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. multiple players fulfilling positions on an individual craft or group of crafts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. separated players managing vehicles and colonies and other stuff at separate rates of time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na resinc system will be implemented where all players can press a button(everybody has to press it to resinc) to resinc time once everything they need to do is done in their reference frame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na single unsinced reference frame is essentially a singleplayer mode even in multiplayer till sinc occurs except with other players stuff in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou can dock with other players stuff in the past and when a resinc occurs that craft will remain docked(note in case of players in the future they will be prohibited from changing that structure till resinc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhen a resinc has been decided apon the players decide on a reference frame to sinc to usually the one farthest in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nplayers cooperating in the management of a vehicle or group of vehicles/colony will be treated as a single reference frame where one of those players has the ability to warp time but all others will be dragged along with that select player through time if they choose to warp(at resinc reference frame decision this will treated as a single reference frame)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na resinc consists of all craft being moved ahead in time(except for ones in the chosen reference frame) and their positions updated if they are in motion accordingly(so let\u0027s say the chosen reference frame is 10 months from your frame any satellites would move ahead by a certain distance depending apon their velocity). this means if you have an intercept for a craft coming up get that out of the way first otherwise you might miss intercept. you don\u0027t necessarily have to land the craft all you have to do is get it into orbit around your target planet or docked with your target craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntell me what you think about this idea\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyFall2489","CreatedById":216984,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-07T16:33:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s step back a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, what will multiplayer give us? What do we want from it? I think there are 2 things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Live cross-player interaction.

The cons are that when one person wants to time warp, everyone has to time warp, and if a slow computer lags behind there can be issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. No time warp. Self explanatory, as are the problems. Plus, KSP slows down in game time when the computer lags too much and must be re-synced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Subspace warp. This is what is used by many multiplayer mods. Good in many cases, but to avoid time paradoxes there are some limits on who can interact with what. Already figured out and easy to implement compared to other solutions. Also, if you leave the server, and someone else warps a thousand years into the future and all your kerbals run out of life support, that\u0027s bad. (assuming there is life support. If not, the modding community of KSP is great.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.

Messes up physics sometimes, but offline players can be moving at 1x real time, so hopefully no kerbals starve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. My own idea - encounters. Effectively, you can link your world to another player\u0027s world, entering a combined world with some of the vessels from each of the old worlds appearing in it. Which ones appear, player\u0027s choice. Max limit of maybe 50 per player. Effectively, player 1 can select a refueling station, player 2 can select a ship low on fuel, and have those 2 ships be in 1 mini world consisting of one \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and a single shared time. If either player exits the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, the encounter is over. Players can end the encounter manually, too. When the encounter ends, all ships in the encounter universe are put back in the old universe, with the pre-encounter ships deleted and time jumped forward by the amount of time that passed in the encounter. Doesn\u0027t break physics, you are in control of your own time so there is no accidental starvation, but someone may figure out how to duplicate ships using this. But if Squad let there be kraken drives and the community decided not to use them for the record setting missions, I think the same can be true with encounter based multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few other things about encounter multiplayer:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. might be hard to get too many players into an encounter at once, probably a max of 5-10 players before the single time drawbacks really come into play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. maybe, in science/career games, require players in an encounter to have a similar amount of progress? might be hard to define though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Good because it means no special server world is really required, players can let people join their otherwise single player worlds. Also, a minimal amount of stuff must be synchronized, keeping things clean and not computer roasting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nResync will be an issue with all of these, as not everyone has a NASA supercomputer. I have a MacBook Pro.
