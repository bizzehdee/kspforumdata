That would let you build any ideas like the above into a series of custom scripts for whatever minigames you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking these an integral part of a game would also allow sharing scripts like that via workshop and then you wouldn\u0027t need to make sure everyone has particular mod installed before joining in. It can all be automatically shared from the server.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
