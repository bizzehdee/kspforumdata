Verisimilitude is all well and good, and largely desirable, but not if it just makes things miserable. This, to my estimation, points strongly in the direction of any life support system being something that is not going to be aggressively punitive, especially to the tune of killing crews and destroying missions; if I had to guess, I would suspect it will definitely be there, but probably not excessively complicated, with a small number of factors to plan around. I could also conceivably see it being something that is fairly minimal for active flights, but much more robust for colonies (in the sense of more resources/moving pieces to manage, still not in the punitive sense). It is much harder for a colony to get lost in the shuffle or forgotten than some small, barely manned exploration mission you sent out years and years ago, and you are never going to have nearly as many colonies as in flight missions (for most people I would guess), so the game auto-stopping to bring your attention over to fix something, would be much less obtrusive overall. Plus the colony system looks like it will be fairly extensive, so it would be a reasonable way to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, even if it stays relatively basic, I do hope there ends up being a really robust framework for it behind the scenes, in such a way that makes it easy for modders who want more hardcore stuff, or just to tweak it/build it out more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: also, looking at the roadmap again, even if not mentioned explicitly, Life support could easily be there as an unmentioned subsection of almost any of those, especially exploration and colonies. They aren\u0027t going to spell out every single thing they are going to put in, especially with early access still months away, this is just a rough guide for us to get a feel for the overall shape of things\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit 2: also, from the faq on the ksp website: \u0022The core pillar of KSP2 is building and flying cool rockets. While we have additional features planned like colonies, interstellar travel, and multiplayer, we first want to hear back from players about the core fundamental experience\u0022. There are also multiple mentions of stuff like, \u0027not yet revealed features\u0027, \u0027not wanting to spoil everything yet\u0027, \u0027more to come\u0027... So there is 100% still plenty they aren\u0027t showing/telling us yet, whether incidentally, on purpose, or because it\u0027s not to that point yet. So something not being mentioned yet, especially a less major system that isn\u0027t part of the core gameplay loop, should not really be a cause for panic. I don\u0027t think it would be something they would be telling us about yet, regardless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus, life support is a system that is perfect for early access: it is something where the line between fun and compelling and miserable and unfun, is \u003Cem\u003Eextremely \u003C/em\u003Efine. It would be extremely logical to introduce it fairly early (probably in the colonies or science part of the roadmap) in a fairly basic form, and then iterate on it a bunch throughout early access, in small steps, but lots of them, to get it to a good, and fun, place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-28T08:13:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2022 08:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by GigFiz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAddendum\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-02T20:25:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve personally not ever been that worried about colony life support.

I quite liked your ideas, and they definitely match up well with what I am hoping for. And now that we know that they are making science the primary \u0027currency\u0027, there is at least a chance that the system \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eend up looking like what we are wanting.

As we all know, the current one is...pretty boring and superfluous, and doesn\u0027t really feel connected to the rest of the game for the most part. But in a system where science and progression are linked that way, missions could operate more as a way to point you in helpful directions, and maybe give you some bonus tasks and rewards to do while you are at it...or something like that, but the point is that it seems like an opportune setup for making missions feel actually tied to the rest of the game, rather than tacked on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the moment,\u00A0 it seems unclear what we are going to get for missions, though I feel like they did at one point acknowledge the benefit of that sort of element of structured gameplay, and that it appeals to plenty of people (I am one of them). Hopefully, whatever they end up doing, there is at least a more robust framework for missions in such a way that mission packs become an actual interesting avenue for modding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: Good point about that being able to make those penalties feel meaningful.

Another key is building in a buffer like built-in snacks for all crew modules or a grace-period so players don\u0027t have to worry about it until they start building stations and thinking about crewed interplanetary missions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-05T18:26:03Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2023 06:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-05T19:02:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224228070\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210405\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221675610158\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022141823\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Truebadour\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Truebadour said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion, forcing punitive life support on players is just not a good way to do things. I\u0027ve said it before, but for me the only option to integrate a form of life support is to have passive bonuses associated with it. Make it a positive gameplay element, not the final nail in the coffin that ends a new player\u0027s mission to the Mun because they forgot one part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have any issue with the idea of having non-lethal life support, but the way to go is having them hibernate and become uncontrollable if LS is missing. The solution is very simple - look at the probe control system. If you don\u0027t have EC or signal, you lose control. You can have limited control, but there are significant penalties associated with it (like not being able to manually control attitude and throttle level) but you can still salvage the mission if you pretend actions are pre-programmed. I don\u0027t like the idea of having passive positive bonuses for adding LS. The whole point of LS is for the player to feel that sending a probe is easier and safer and that sending a kerbal has better rewards but is more complex and dangerous. Basically if you send a kerbal without LS, you can\u0027t use him and you have to rescue him. It\u0027s punitive in the sense that it limits your end goals and requires you to think more and test more. It seems like the best solution to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMay I remind you that all kerbals die if you forget one part - the heat shield. Let\u0027s not sacrifice gameplay immersion just to be PC. And let\u0027s have the option for lethality in the difficulty settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-05T19:02:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2023 07:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Vl3d\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
