Completely free of crunch and other developer-hostile practises. They responded and they said yes. Then this happened:\u00A0KSP2 is no longer being developed by Star Theory, and the way it ended up no longer being developed by Star Theory was, regardless of why it happened, Unethical As All Hell. \u003Cstrong\u003EAs someone who\u0027s both interested in video games and as someone who works as a\u00A0game developer I\u0027m not sure I can ethically speaking purchase this game anymore. \u003C/strong\u003EI\u0027m sure that, as a community stuffed full of developers, modders, computer scientists, artists\u00A0and content creators that there are many of you that will share that sentiment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore the transfer over to the new studio, the delays and the fact that the KSP2 license was pulled from Star Theory over them refusing to agree to Take 2 Interactive\u0027s terms for a buyout all makes me nervous that the game will not be developed as promised: with an ethical degree of respect for the health and mental wellbeing of its developers, free of exploitative mechanics such as micropayments, mod friendly, unhindered by dangerous \u0022anti-piracy\u0022 spyware,\u00A0and available free of exclusivity\u00A0on all major digital storefronts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo as a community I would like to ask for you help. As KSP2\u0027s main audience together I think we have the influence to ensure KSP2 is held to an ethical standard that will not be compromised by Take 2 Interactive\u0027s corporate decision making. I know it\u0027s a big ask, I\u0027m sure we\u0027ve\u00A0all been excited for the promise that is KSP2, but if we all agree to stand together as one to hold Take 2 to a set of ethical standards, I believe we can ensure that KSP2 is developed in a way that is healthy for the developers and released in the state it was promised to be in to the community.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow is a statement I have written.

expensive, step\u00A0of offering every one of the current dev team a job, with relocation allowances etc. presumably to maintain as much knowledge\u00A0and\u00A0experience as possible\u00A0(this would

Also, your local noble owned you, but generally wouldn\u0027t kick you out and replace you if he thought you were underperforming\u00A0(it could happen to tenant farmers later in history, though), and certainly wouldn\u0027t constantly threaten you with it.\u00A0This is what we\u0027re asking T2 not to do to its\u00A0devs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot 500 years ago.
