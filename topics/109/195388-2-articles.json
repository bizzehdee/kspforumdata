When I refer to construction time, I\u0027m not referring to the awful mobile-inspired countdown timers where you have to watch the timer tick down until your rocket is ready. I\u0027m referring to it as something where you see you have a launch window a year out. You have multiple missions you would like to send, but not enough time to build all of them so you need to be smart about your use of that time. You design your vehicles and payloads (while the game is paused) and while designing the game tells you how long it will take to construct so you adjust your design accordingly. When you\u0027re done designing, you click \u0022warp to completion\u0022 and poof, it\u0027s done. But that feature wasn\u0027t skippable because it utilized the in-game time resource, and all the planets/craft/etc continued to operate in the background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI disagree that construction time should be restricted to mods. KSP has long advertised itself as a space program tycoon, and without time management elements the game is sorely lacking on this front.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of skippable features being a waste of time to implement, I disagree. Different people like different aspects of the game. Since we have sandbox, career is 100% pointless and skippable if you\u0027re just wanting to launch rockets, but it\u0027s still there and a lot of players want it because it provides a challenge and sense of progression that sandbox simply doesn\u0027t. You also seem to still be assuming that players will be FORCED to use this system. To be honest, I would consider this to be a faulty assumption. All the new difficulty systems in KSP1 (reentry heating, comm networks, etc) have been OPTIONAL, the devs have NOT forced any new features on players and are very aware that there\u0027s a significant chunk of the playerbase that doesn\u0027t care about the management/planning side of the game and just wants to build and launch rockets (which is perfectly fine, different people play the same game for different reasons).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-07T16:16:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI boot up the game and my vessel takes 5 in-game days to build! \u0022What does this add to the gameplay?\u0022, I ask.\u00A0Nothing at all, just a timer I\u0027ll come to despise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-07T16:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question to all of you is: are you thinking that this construction timer will affect the crafts launching at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E too?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-07T16:46:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223816534\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195388\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221594138595\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI boot up the game and my vessel takes 5 in-game days to build! \u0022What does this add to the gameplay?\u0022, I ask.\u00A0Nothing at all, just a timer I\u0027ll come to despise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo spacecraft should just teleport to their maneuver nodes instead of having to timewarp to them?

The added gameplay is time management to improve the space program management side of the game (time management is a staple of management games). This isn\u0027t a timer intended to waste your time like so many bad mobile games have. This is intended to make game time a valuable resource when building rockets. When you design your rocket, the game calculates how long it will take to build based on your manufacturing capability. Then when you want to launch, you click build and have the option to either auto timewarp to when it\u0027s ready or start construction so you can go manage other craft.

If KSP2 is going to move away from being a tycoon/management game and focus on just being a rocket building and flying simulator then you may be right that this system is overly complex and doesn\u0027t really add anything.
