Anyone who\u0027s spent time playing career mode knows there are a certain number of repetitive tasks that bog down play over long periods, some of which we\u0027ve heard solutions for (automated milkruns, orbital construction, BAE), and others we\u0027ve not, (science grind, kerbal skills). I dug into an old save of mine that was pretty well developed to use as an example of what things could look like with lots of bases and outposts, tankers, freighters, deep space exploration, etc. I\u0027ve shown below what things look like after about 4 years game time, after the first crew return from Duna. Importantly the save includes the Near Future mods and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS but no extraplanetary launchpads or MKS, so everything is being shipped from Kerbin.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think there are a few lessons here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) The game needs streamlining. This save probably took 3 years IRL to build and the first crewed mission to Jool is a year and half in-game from arrival. I think automated milkruns and orbital construction will help enormously with that, as a lot of time was spent on repeat refuel runs from Minmus, sending up dozens of modules for manual assembly of big interplanetary vessels. Etc. I\u0027d also personally eliminate leveling kerbals individually. Upgrade them collectively by some other means. The other thing that really bogs you down is manually moving data around and processing it in labs. We\u0027ve talked a bit about science grind in other threads but I think a lot of it just needs to happen automatically.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Its worth considering the long periods between transfer windows and in-transit travel compared to how quickly you can do things in KSOI. While I think time needs to be considered for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and (hopefully) LS, players also need to be allowed and encouraged to time warp for weeks at a time to space things out comfortably. A lot of good ideas around construction, research, and science processing time have been proposed for this, but I think it\u0027s worth keeping things simple to avoid wasting players time fussing with lots of little timers. This is broadly why Im in favor of one big hopper for processing raw data into usable science as a delay on new tech instead of research and vessel construction time.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Over time you also begin to see rhythms emerge between transfer windows. Moho and Minmus (no inclination burn) windows are frequent, Eeloo and Jool are about once a year, Eve and Duna are longer. You\u0027ll often have several concurrent waves of deliveries on their way to Jool before the first one ever gets there. Eve and Duna also have return windows pretty close to the from-Kerbin window, so it makes sense to have 2 reusable freighters each hauling equipment both ways. Since the broad idea in KSP2 will be to build ever-growing colonies it will be worth balancing the rate of construction in-situ vs these long waits and transfers so everything feels like its growing believably and naturally, and factoring the time it will take to explore with probes, then with Kerbals, then set up shop over several years in-game.\u00A0 Especially if we\u0027re encouraging players to build colonies capable of supporting interstellar vessels understanding these long timescales and how they interact will be really important.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0027s the save for reference.

Moreover, upgrades to offworld VABs could include perks like faster construction time. I agree with the point that people have made that missions shouldn\u0027t be grindy and repetitive. The way career works currently in KSP 1 is that you send like 10 missions to the Mun in a row, back to back, to get science from every biome, and spend 40-50 hours grinding in the Kerbin system over the course of a couple weeks in game in order to launch one mission to Duna that takes 10% of the time you spent visiting the Mun. KSP 2 should increase the in-game time it takes to reach a high technology level, but make it so that at most, you\u0027re not spending more than 10-15 hours in the Kerbin system before launching interplanetary missions. One of the main reasons career in KSP 1 sucks so much is that\u00A0 I spend the majority of your time grinding boring missions on Mun and Minmus, and most of the time, I burn out shortly after my first interplanetary missions.

I\u0027ve visited every body in the game, but only in sandbox, because career is just mind-numbingly repetitive. KSP 2 should fix this issue, so that players can have a sense of the work it takes to get a space program beyond its home planet without forcing them to put in 50 hours grinding just to reach their 4th celestial body in a game that might include dozens of planets and moons.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-28T21:26:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConstruction time isn\u0027t going to solve it, it\u0027s a matter of yet another time skip.

So you\u0027ll be stuck with old ships until you create a supply line to haul required materials. Problem with KSP1 is that science is just another currency. You can get to Rapier engine without touching most of the tech tree. But the tech tree here isn\u0027t very... progressive. I don\u0027t know why seismograph is more expensive than pressure meter. If the progression works in a way where I have to discover all elements needed for a tech first, that\u0027s better.

My feeling was of course players will \u0027abuse\u0027 resource collection as much as they can, so the key is to modulate resource collection rates to stretch out in-game time to something reasonable. I still think collection rates are important and there are clever ways to control them (more later*), but in the end the tech upgrades are what everyone is after. Some players might smurf a huge Methalox capacity out of low-level tech, which is fine I suppose, but what most players care about is getting that next new fancy engine or reactor. We talked about this in some of the science threads but I really think that means tech needs to be gated based on exploring more and more challenging planets, so you cant just grind around in KSOI, you need to go to Gilly or Moho to upgrade to He3, or to Jool\u0027s moons to get MH tech. You also don\u0027t want this to be so 1:1 that players need to go to specific places in a specific order, so there should be flexibility too. Its a tall bill but I think it\u0027s achievable in a relatively simple way like locking some tech branches until players had explored one of some class of planet, like inner planets or icey planets or planets with atmospheres, etc. I think this should carry to colony-tech too, so bigger \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E upgrades and fancier hab modules also require interplanetary exploration.

At one point I estimated that it should take about 60 missions to go interstellar. If we\u0027re roughly blocking that out based on the current windows and a more realistic start you could have your first probes to Duna arriving around the beginning of year 2, crewed landing in year 4, colony getting started in year 6. If we\u0027re including Jool it would be longer--first probes arriving in year 6, colony starting year 9. You could of course speed that up with less efficient transfers, but this would be a comfortable baseline. I think in the first year you might have 10 missions or more getting started and sending out your first interplanetary probes, but that the pace would slow as you had more automated and longer transfers to warp through. On average though thats what, 6 missions per year till interstellar? 70 days between launches on average? Given that launches would be happening from off-world colonies as well as Kerbin I think resource collection could be really quite slow or constrained by some other means without pinching a reasonable launch rate.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224070269\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206126\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221640726800\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConstruction time isn\u0027t going to solve it, it\u0027s a matter of yet another time skip.

Theres also nothing preventing players from taking it easy and playing out sequential missions. In any case those levers will exist and the question is where to set them.

Thats what very fast research and resource extraction rates incentivize. \u00A0Its one of the principle problems with KSP1\u2019s pacing, and its why its so important to be thoughtful about where to set those levers.

(Please notice that I\u0027m not referring anything to KSP1 science and tech tree. They were garbage and shouldn\u0027t be assumed anything like them will be used in KSP2.) So the early pacing will be busy with smaller, less grandiose designs than the latter missions. That way you can spend time doing something productive until the first transfer windows appear, and you don\u0027t feel like you\u0027re wasting time. You also have to remember, the size of the rocket you build will be limited to the physical size of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, which in turn, limits the launch mass.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, why limit the amount of science, resources you can get in the early game? It seems you don\u0027t want the player to have the necessary resources available to immediately take advantage of the first available transfer window. Most veteran KSP players do understand you will have to wait sometimes. The impatient players know when and how to brute force the natural timing of the Kerbol system. So why force these players to wait longer than they have to? Why remove the sandbox design and play style from KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get any type of progression system will limit the design options. But the progression system shouldn\u0027t get in the way of the play style in a sandbox game. If the player wants to play fast and loose; so be it, let them play fast and loose. The same goes with the player that wants to play a slow and conservative approach. Both play styles are equally valid ways to play a sandbox style of game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-08T20:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess my feeling is KSP became more of a sandbox game because of some of stock career\u0027s deficiencies.

But just as examples I think there are ways to produce better incentives and reduce a lot of repetition. After all, it\u0027s not a bad thing that players would want to go back to Minmus a few times to study it, its that right now each one of those missions is essentially identical--land wherever and click around the same half a dozen parts. Instead players could drop a probe for the first landing, then send an orbital scanner, then a Kerbal to take a surface sample or study a surface feature, then track an anomaly and hunt it down in a rover. You probably also want to hold back some of the experiments for those later missions so players are incentivized to travel further out to Duna or Moho, so they can fill in with anomaly hunting later during long interplanetary transits. None of this needs to be or should be proscriptive--players should have all the freedom in the world to do things in the order that they like, but at any given point the best rewards should come from doing something the player has not done before.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother way to reduce grind is to make science take time, because as laid out above it speeds up game clock and increases the number of transfer windows per minutes-played. Some of this could be in the experiments themselves--experiments that pay out over time or SCANsat style orbital scans. I\u0027d also like to see the functioning of Science labs ironed out though as right now between manually shifting data around and transmitting they just take too much fuss. I do like the idea that surface samples aught to be returned somewhere to count but just docking with a station or vessel with a lab should do it. If it were me I\u0027d have all experiment results automatically upload with a proper connection and go into one big pool of \u0022Data\u0022. Processing Data into Science would take time, but could be sped up by upgrading the R\u002BD facility or increasing the number and quality of off-world labs. That way you wouldn\u0027t have to fuss about manually moving data around, it would just happen, and it would be up to you to time-warp ahead till you could spend Science on fancy new parts or just brute force it with lower tech.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe also talked a bit about the conundrum around money and resources at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E a few months back.

Science should be set and forget. You could require an active communication constellation before you can start science collection off Kerbin. But the big thing is you shouldn\u0027t be getting much collectable science from Kerbin. Kerbin is your homeworld, you should know it already. Most activities on Kerbin should be testing and researching. You shouldn\u0027t be directly involved unless you actually want to do it. Off Kerbin, yes, you will have to visit the different biomes, but all you have to do is drop a science package and be done with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way to hide the grind is keep the player busy so they don\u0027t realize that the grind is happening. Contracts or assigned missions in the early game can help mask the grind. They can be used to teach and provide an example to how you should undertake the next steps. The big thing with contracts and missions are that they can\u0027t be too long or too short. After a certain point, they fall into the background and behave more like trackers for different boom events.
