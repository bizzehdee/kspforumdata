Just got out of a meeting with 8 other content creators at Star Theory. Here are the notes I took. Disclaimer: Phrasing my own. Allow a margin of interpretation error just in case.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nModding: A major priority of development. Tools are being developed right now using Lua but the language isn\u0027t necessarily final. PQS\u002B has a ton of hooks for custom tools.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNO DRM on single player KSP. Can\u0027t comment on DRM for multi-player - still working on how account auth flows will work.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe entire simulation core has been rewritten. Multithreading has been addressed but I won\u0027t get into it because people define it differently. Way fewer bottlenecks, much more optimized is the idea.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is no plan to introduce premium currencies, loot boxes, other \u0022freemium\u0022 sort of stuff. The plan is to stick to KSP1\u0027s content release style.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNote on the trailer: Everything in that trailer is an in game asset. The engine shown at the beginning around the mun is metallic hydrogen and a bridge tech between the KSP1 and KSP2 technologies.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbin\u0027s overall geography is the same. Other planets have had facelifts to give additional geographic history. The kerbin system has the same bodies. The game engine now allows for axial tilts.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOverall design philosophy behind terrain: \u0022No two landing sites should feel the same.\u0022 Also - moonlight shadows. Small but cool.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow many new systems: \u0022Multiple.\u0022 Sorry guys, I tried\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can now create rockets in individual sections and piece them together. Yay QOL! There is also blueprint style build mode that makes placing and aligning parts easier. The \u003Cabbr style=\u0022border-bottom-style:none;border-bottom-width:medium;text-decoration:underline;\u0022 title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E is overall much much larger.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBinary. Planets. At least possible with modding, we didn\u0027t see any official systems other than kerbin, but the potential was demoed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn ease of access: Relax, this is still Kerbal, it hasn\u0027t been dumbed down at all. Seriously, it is in great hands. The UI and new user experience is totally redone. Tutorials are fully guided and even animated, sort of in a Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide style. It looked cool.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe new Maneuever element on the HUD is a 3D representation of your ships orientation in regards to prograde, normal, etc. Useful.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nColonies: You can build anywhere you can land. You don\u0027t need flat ground. Colonies are built, not grown, and will need resources supplied in order to build Colony buildings and any rockets/vehicles you build at them.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nColony population does not grow over time. Colonists are brought in manually. Colonists also - ahem - multiply when you accomplish something and give them a reason to celebrate. Bottom line is you can\u0027t fast forward to grow population.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nColonies are meant to be springboards for deeper exploration. Orbital Colonies are great places to build interstellar rockets and move past the Kerbol system.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPC optimization comes first in development. Consoles need additional attention to make them feel native and not like a port, but that is important to them. Console players, you are a priority and you\u0027ll get love. They know the problems with KSP1 console.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMuch higher part counts are going to be available but they can\u0027t give numbers at this stage of development.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbals experience force! You can see it in their portraits and cockpit view. They even black out. And scream and flail in terror. They\u0027re much more animated and expressive, and have emotes you can use as well.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlanet rings have big rocks. Felt a bit like Elite, was pretty cool.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBottom line-- Going in I was afraid that like so many sequels it would be \u0022streamlined\u0022 by stripping away elements. It\u0027s absolutely not the case. This is Kerbal. Breathe easy. We were on the same page with all questions and concerns (and our group had a lot). They got this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlso: SO MANY THANKS to @KerbalSpaceP for putting this together. Man, it was so cool. Absolutely a treat.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOoh, addendum-- explosions will be different in space or in atmo, whether tanks are full or empty. To quote: \u0022Every explosion should be a special snowflake.\u0022 I KNOW RIGHT\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\nMatt PAX West (Hi Seattle!)\u200F\u00A0@badnewsbaron\u00A028m28 minutes ago\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/badnewsbaron\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://twitter.com/badnewsbaron\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks again to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69263-nomrbond/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002269263\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69263-nomrbond/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@NoMrBond\u003C/a\u003E.

It seems that they finally got to a point where they have something to show, and wanted our input to help them prioritize what to do for the release. \u00A0It was obvious from their expressions that a lot of what we were asking was about stuff they had planned, either for the initial release or future updates, and the \u201Cno comment\u201D was because they didn\u0027t want to commit to anything
