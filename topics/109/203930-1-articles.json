There\u0027s been several studies on this, but I\u0027m a lazy bugger so take my words with a grain of salt here:Skeumorphic designs were adopted in the past because it is a lot easier to quickly navigate a program/website where there is intuitive UI designs drawing your attention. It doesn\u0027t matter that it\u0027s considered old design, which frankly most people here probably LIKE over the new things anyways, regardless of benefit. Regardless, something that looks like a rectangle won\u0027t draw your attention like something that looks like a proper button. Someone once compared a skeuomorphic reskin of an existing website(I believe it was Facebook), and found that navigation, on average when tested with about 50 people, was 66% faster with the skeuomorphic reskin. Keep in mind that the layout was \u003Cstrong\u003EIDENTICAL\u003C/strong\u003E, which means the only difference between the two was that one was using the standard CSS and image set, and one was using a modified CSS and image set which did skeuomorphism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, the reason why I\u0027m concerned personally about it is that skeuomorphic designs are a lot easier to gleam information off of, and are much quicker to navigate, both exceptionally crucial when doing a fair more complex operation like landing a spacecraft.

Minimalism has also become more and more the norm, especially for non-interactive elements. Often simple UI interactive elements have 1 primary action, and all other secondary actions stuffed away somewhere (usually a \u0022three dot menu\u0022). With even things like \u0022gestures\u0022 taking over distinct UI elements, for example you probably swipe left/right to start moving an item into the trash on some apps like email apps on mobile.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP can follow a similar suite and push most actions to the keyboard, and keep the UI as minimal as possible, as you have to learn about what it all means regardless of what design your using. Hence, using a minimal/digital UI allows developers to shove more information into your eyeballs while keeping the view clean from overstuff-ness, while also supporting consoles, with limited and different controls schemes. Just think, KSP 1 never had a giant button anywhere for \u0022staging\u0022 even though that is arguable the single most important action in the game when flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a totally new player needs to understand what a prograde is, what its icon looks like, then it wont matter much what the design is.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS. I study UI/UX. You might not like the UI/UX right now, but you will get used to it and look back and find KSP 1 had a \u0022worse experience\u0022. That\u0027s usually how design works, unless there is a massive oversight in UX, and UX wise KSP 2 more or less looks functionally exactly the same.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background:rgba(220,220,220,.5) url(\u0026quot;//forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/applications/core/interface/ckeditor/ckeditor/plugins/widget/images/handle.png\u0026quot;);\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt feels as if though my points were totally overlooked. In any case, when I first left the house earlier, I was planning scathing comments, and explaining how just because you study UI/UX does not mean your points are instantly valid, but I have since calmed down. I\u0027m going to agree to disagree, and move on, because frankly, this is a stupid argument to take, and our definitions of skeuomorphism appear to be divergent, making any meaningful conversation exceedingly difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlutoISaPlanet","CreatedById":206057,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-23T01:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224008211\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203930\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221627002528\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201212\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KawaiiLucy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n30 minutes ago, KawaiiLucy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d love to see more of actual gameplay features, ie if anything/what is happenning or changing from ksp1 in terms of career or science gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully during the buildup to launch ( which I hope begins later\u00A0 this year or early 2022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TLTay","CreatedById":184633,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-23T05:50:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully not something like Kerbal skin texture again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
