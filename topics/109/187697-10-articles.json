You could launch it on some upgraded versions of Saturn V (it was even the right diameter, about 10 meters).

You could launch it on some upgraded versions of Saturn V (it was even the right diameter, about 10 meters). We could have had MW-class space-based nuclear reactors during late Apollo era, if people running the space program\u00A0really wanted to.

Propulsion is not what is stopping us from getting to Mars. Your right about the shuttle and the iss was also far to expensive. Saturn capable booster could have build a long term space station for a fraction of the cost assuming you could get enough launches to keep the costs down. Sls will be a failure to because after all it will never be used. It will probably be cheaper to launch a 100 ton payload over 3 expendable FH missions and assemble them in orbit than using an Sls once. I don\u0027t know the expendable FH leo launch mass.

The reactor produces 70MW of thermal power, out of which 30MW is used. This gives 43% efficiency, which is pretty\u00A0good.\u00A0Efficiency\u00A0for Brayton cycle is given by 1-(T1/T2). T2\u00A0is the input temperature (what the reactor makes), T1\u00A0is the output temperature (what goes into radiators).\u00A0So, with 43% efficiency, the ratio output/input ratio is 0.57. According to Wikipedia, the temperature in the primary coolant loop is supposed to be 500 degrees Celsius. For the equation we need to convert to Kelvin, so 773K. Multiplying that by temperature ratio, we get 440K, or 163 degrees Celsius. This is hotter than the ISS cooling loop, and that\u0027s great... because radiator\u00A0power is A*s*T\u003Cstrong\u003E^4\u003C/strong\u003E. A is area, s is Stefan-Boltzmann constant (about 5.7*10^-8) and T is temperature. To reject 40MW at 440K, you would need 18700 square meters of radiators, assuming perfect black body radiators (in reality, you\u0027d need\u00A0more, depending on what you make them out of). ISS radiators are about 3 kilograms per square meter, if we only consider exposed panels. That gives about 56 tons of radiators. The total mass of the reactor\u002Bcooling therefore\u00A0works out to 76 tons. You could launch this, plus the actual VASIMR,\u00A0the turbine (the 20T figure doesn\u0027t include it) several tons of structure, spacecraft systems and propellant,\u00A0on Block 2 version\u00A0of the\u00A0SLS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMath saves the day again. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0Note, this is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E an optimal reactor design for space use.

These alloying experiments still show the need for \u0026gt;100 GPa to keep it stable (and not much more to form it).

This article claims that Hyperion/Gen4 designed a mini-reactor (for terrestrial use) that weighs 20T, produces 30MW electric and 70MW thermal:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2008/10/power-to-overall-weight-ratio-aspect-of.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.nextbigfuture.com/2008/10/power-to-overall-weight-ratio-aspect-of.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis seems credible enough for estimations, so let\u0027s go with that. The reactor produces 70MW of thermal power, out of which 30MW is used. This gives 43% efficiency, which is pretty\u00A0good.\u00A0Efficiency\u00A0for Brayton cycle is given by 1-(T1/T2). T2\u00A0is the input temperature (what the reactor makes), T1\u00A0is the output temperature (what goes into radiators).\u00A0So, with 43% efficiency, the ratio output/input ratio is 0.57. According to Wikipedia, the temperature in the primary coolant loop is supposed to be 500 degrees Celsius. For the equation we need to convert to Kelvin, so 773K. Multiplying that by temperature ratio, we get 440K, or 163 degrees Celsius. This is hotter than the ISS cooling loop, and that\u0027s great... because radiator\u00A0power is A*s*T\u003Cstrong\u003E^4\u003C/strong\u003E. A is area, s is Stefan-Boltzmann constant (about 5.7*10^-8) and T is temperature. To reject 40MW at 440K, you would need 18700 square meters of radiators, assuming perfect black body radiators (in reality, you\u0027d need\u00A0more, depending on what you make them out of). ISS radiators are about 3 kilograms per square meter, if we only consider exposed panels. That gives about 56 tons of radiators. The total mass of the reactor\u002Bcooling therefore\u00A0works out to 76 tons. You could launch this, plus the actual VASIMR,\u00A0the turbine (the 20T figure doesn\u0027t include it) several tons of structure, spacecraft systems and propellant,\u00A0on Block 2 version\u00A0of the\u00A0SLS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMath saves the day again. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0Note, this is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E an optimal reactor design for space use. A truly space-optimized reactor would run \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E hot, to take advantage of temperature being to fourth power in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, and could sacrifice some thermal efficiency in order to increase its output temperature, and decrease radiator mass.
