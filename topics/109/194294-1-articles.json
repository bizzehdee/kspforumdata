What would be interesting would be a series of hundreds of randomly generated science experiments that could be assigned on missions and use supplies to do things that are more realistic, like experiments on animals or with plants, or physical tests of components in\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eappropriate\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0situations, not like the \u0022tEsT lAnDiNg gEaR oN aN eScApE tRaJeCtOrY oF mInMuS\u0022, which makes no sense given the context. Considering the fact that the devs have an opportunity to not only overhaul game mechanics, but the actual core loop of play, more interesting science could alleviate the boredom\u00A0caused by landing on a planet and not having anything to do there. The game could have another layer of depth that goes beyond just landing and managing fuel, but could be partially automated by well-designed UI and planners, that would also pair well with\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EKerbalism-\u003C/em\u003Estyle life-support or a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E tool. This could compliment a realistic IVA system, so that one could actually use the ship interiors. This was just an idea I thought of a couple of hours ago, I\u0027m curious to know your thoughts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-30T19:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat did you think of Breaking Ground?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"betaking","CreatedById":58281,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-30T22:17:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor some reason I\u0027m imagining a few ways this could work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\neither with a cross-section view where you\u0027re able to control individual kerbals as they move around an interior space (which could get complicated depending on how interiors are implemented/what changes are made to interiors) , and basically being able to trigger individual experiments setup in a station/pressure-vessel interior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOR as some kind of framework for minigames that might either involve a separate window interface or take place within an IVA-seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-31T10:34:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry but any chance I get I like to bring this up...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022180102\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1993371189\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/192475-a-re-purposing-of-science/\u0026amp;tab=comments\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3757777\u0026amp;embedComment=3757777\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-3757777\u0022 style=\u0022height:295px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally want the concept of filling out an in game wiki to come to fruition.
