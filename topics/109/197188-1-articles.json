Maybe multi-player could be a narrative where you create a country and play other Kerbal countries in space races, but I feel that a narrative will ruin the effect of singleplayer KSP2. KSP and KSP2 are space simulators, not a game like Halo, where you have a storyline, or Mario, where you have an end goal.
