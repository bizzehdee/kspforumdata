I can think of a few other games that have this, so it wouldn\u0027t be revolutionary or anything, but never the less cool. Considering how beautiful the graphics are seeming to be, it would be awesome if you could then pair that with awesome camera angles, and make your own little movies if you want. A lot of older game clips from 2019 are labeled as \u0022pre alpha \u003Cstrong\u003Egame play\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022, and those clips also feature a lot of spinning, panning, zooming camera angles. This is probably just a dev tool or something, but it may also be a feature.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlutoISaPlanet","CreatedById":206057,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-14T14:32:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like that... but what I realy want is a screenshot mode.
