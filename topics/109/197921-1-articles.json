Bigger poles are not necessarily more interesting, I was just defending the idea that some really big bases could be made.

It would make the interstellar ships quicker to design and piece together. If Intercept keeps with the scale of parts shown in the trailer, the small spherical tanks are ~40m in diameter, the large ones are ~120m in diameter. Basically think FFT sized parts as stock. (I\u0027ve said it before, a lot of the super sized parts shown in the trailer looks to be from an older version of Roverdude\u0027s FFT mod.)
