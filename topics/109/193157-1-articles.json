I\u0027ve also seen a lot of arguing about how complicated colonies should be, and even if they\u0027re simple I still think this would be a good idea, is it adds a lot of gameplay and frees up a lot of time for more impressive missions, or heck, even so it is a standard feature, and there aren\u0027t several overlapping mods with this feature.
