I don\u0027t think a petition is a bad idea. A little preemptive as of right now? Sure, maybe. We do have only a small amount of one sided information.

For the time we talked, we shared our love of the original game, and it was amazing to see his undisputed dedication to KSP2 and making it right for the community. Based on my interaction with him, he clearly cares about the game alot. Which is why i believe, like others have said, that if Nate made that jump to Intercept \u0022immediately\u0022 as the article says, it must have been for a very good reason and it must have been for the good of KSP2, not to hinder it or sell it out for a large salary. its clea that this is an amazing passion project for many of the developers, and i actually concier it comforting that T2 wentht through the effort to hire the people that ACTUALLY care about the game. after all, they could have just hired an entirely new team without all the trouble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand why this situation is upseting, but I believe, even if we dont know specifically, that this action may have been necessary for the salvation and continuing development of the KSP2 that the community wants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know Nate Simpson. I\u0027ve seen exactly two videos with him speaking about the development of KSP2. I willing to accept that he\u0027s a passionate fan of Kerbal Space Program and did what he thought was best for the game\u0027s development. I am not insinuating that he is a greedy person, nor that he or anyone else who joined Take-Two Interactive\u0027s new development team are bad actors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHowever\u003C/em\u003E, all of us discussing this topic here on this forum I would also consider passionate fans of KSP who want whats best for the game\u0027s development. And yet \u003Cem\u003Ewe \u003C/em\u003Eseem to have considerably different thresholds for what constitutes acceptable business practices in this situation. Nate obviously has more in depth first-hand knowledge of what went down, but I doubt that he and I, or a large number of other passionate fans of KSP would all agree to do the same thing under the same circumstances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd obviously not - because several team members at Star Theory chose not to move to Take-Two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-04T02:23:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2020 02:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keithv708","CreatedById":204273,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-04T02:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember we still have Kerbal space program to play\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Numberyellow","CreatedById":172745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-04T02:21:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223796683\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194406\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591237095\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204273\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Keithv708\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, Keithv708 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember we still have Kerbal space program to play\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight up until Take-Two finds some scummy way to take it away from us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
