While we\u0027re in Kerbol system (or any system with a star behind our backs) our ships are always in the sunlight, with the exception when they\u0027re on the night side of a celestial body. So we can see them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow as we\u0027re going to leave the solar system, the light from the star would slowly fade away, until the ship is in complete darkness. There\u0027s no ambient light in space, the few photons from stars far far away won\u0027t do much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that we\u0027re probably not going to do too much with the ship while it\u0027s travelling to another star, but if we do there are only two options. Mount a ton of illuminators on the hull, or operate in the dark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-18T07:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a very good point.\u00A0\u00A0 But I think this is one of those things that is perfectly acceptable to sacrifice some realism for gameplay.\u00A0\u00A0 Perhaps an option to enable realistic lighting, or have a minimum illumination setting.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaf","CreatedById":64587,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-18T22:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImho variable (automatic) camera exposure is the key.

I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve ever been in the middle of absolute nowhere, with zero light pollution, on a clear moonless night. It\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edark\u003C/em\u003E, but it\u0027s not pitch black. Once your eyes adjust properly, you can see environment around you and even pick up hints of color. Everything is very muted, and shapes do blend together, but they\u0027re there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking at the stuff we got to see in previews, I\u0027m pretty sure KSP2 is being rendered with HDR in mind. That means you can adjust exposure, simulating eye adjustment to light levels, and even filter colors based on light intensity, giving everything that muted look. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s how Intercept will chose to handle it, but it\u0027s certainly an option, and would make the game quite playable far from the Sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, it will certainly be a good incentive to place some additional lights around your interstellar ships to illuminate anything you might need to interact with during the voyage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
