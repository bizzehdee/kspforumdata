But what is clear right now is the fact that Kerbin will be much less relevant in the mid and late game. What I mean is that as soon as you\u0027re able to, you should be constructing everything off world.

So no selling anything at Kerbin until otherwise updated. (It\u0027s a good possibly you may need to ship stuff to Kerbin, but they never said it.) They are getting rid of the play modes in KSP1 (except sandbox) and replacing it with their own progression system. Again, they never detailed how this progression system will work. Only the broad strokes; there will be contracts and science will be necessary, there will be no fail state do to currency or failed missions; but outside of that, it\u0027s all up in the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crenelatedcheese","CreatedById":209272,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-07T20:52:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nseeing everything else the devs have done, I\u0027m hopeful they will make a great progression system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-07T23:54:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223905321\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199402\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221610052775\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209272\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crenelatedcheese\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, crenelatedcheese said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nseeing everything else the devs have done, I\u0027m hopeful they will make a great progression system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou and everyone else.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-08T13:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223905321\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199402\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221610052775\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209272\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crenelatedcheese\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, crenelatedcheese said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nseeing everything else the devs have done, I\u0027m hopeful they will make a great progression system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly it doesn\u0027t take much to make something better than current KSP career and science modes, I would gladly pay for a DLC that replaces KSP1 stock career with something actually playable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
