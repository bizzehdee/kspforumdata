Most if not all of them are probably at Gamescon, or off doing other business, like talking with NASA scientists or talking with Squad. I feel like come next week we might be getting hints dropped on the forum.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, they might also be waiting for the KSP 2 section of the forums to get up and running. I read somewhere that KSP 2 would be getting it\u0027s very own section come an upgrade to the forums.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHonestly, both options are highly plausible.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen do you guys think information will start dropping?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
