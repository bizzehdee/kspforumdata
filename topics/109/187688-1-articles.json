Additionally, science would become a gradual process more akin to the breaking ground research stations in addition to making R\u0026amp;D a better organized but gradual and automatic process. \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nKSP\u2019s career mode is one of my biggest pet peeves in the game. It feels incredibly grindy and more like a chore than anything. It discourages exploratory progress and takes a lot of choice out of the player\u2019s hand with unrealistic, overly specific and repetitive goals. Career mode should have fairly vague goals allowing the player to figure out how to accomplish them on their own and give them a lot of room to just have fun and experiment. Career mode should focus on exploration and milestone-based progress rather than \u201Cdo x to collect $y so you can do it all over again until you have enough $ to launch a probe to Eeloo\u201D Overall the goal of this proposal is to give a better sense of progression and gradual realistic progress, and to make the goal of the game exploration not funding, which it seems career mode perhaps unintentionally does now. Career mode should make you feel great about your accomplishments and lay out your goals clearly so that progress can be driven by the player\u2019s curiosity rather than by repetitive contracts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EHere\u2019s my proposal for Career Mode 2: Electric Boogaloo:\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-Contracts are still around, but they would likely not be the primary focus of career mode as they are now. They would be like an easy and reliable instant source of cash and reputation points to be put toward other projects. They would not be exploration- or colony-based. That is reserved for exploration programs (see below)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-Contract deadlines would actually mean something. You won\u2019t get paid for failed contracts, but you also won\u2019t really lose much reputation either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-They would be fairly simple and also realistic. Launch/construct a space hotel to low kerbin orbit, launch a geostationary satellite constellation, polar satellites, orbital tourism flights, etc. Nothing too crazy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-More contracts become available as you progress through different programs. Once you\u2019ve sufficiently advanced progress on the Mun program, you could be given tourism contracts there and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-Some contracts would exist to test experimental parts. You get no money for them and would have to eat the mission cost but they can lower the bar of the respective tier of research to which that object belongs, effectively letting you use it earlier than you would be able to naturally.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EScience\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-Science ticks up automatically, but slowly. Science experiments would increase the speed at which this rate ticks but there would not be instant dumps of science like there are now except perhaps impact data, returned surface samples or rocks, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-Rather than a bunch of nodes with arbitrary groups of parts inside them, R\u0026amp;D would be a slow and constant progression you\u2019d use to work towards greater tech to help you with more advanced and distant missions. You would select a science path, and let it go while you send your missions away. Over time, new parts from the selected category will be \u201Cdeveloped\u201D as higher and higher tiers within the subcategory become unlocked which then become available to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-The parts in each category would be decided by function and would consist of several main categories in which subcategories can be selected i.e. \u201Cengine systems\u201D could be a subcategory of \u201Cpropulsion\u201D, as would \u201Cfuel containment\u201D. This subcategory system is more for making it not a messy web of stuff to look at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-Science data would be collected more over time than it is currently. Rather than opening the door of the materials bay and instantly transmitting 600 science from orbit of some distant planet, you\u2019d collect more science up until a limit over time, with the longer the module is active and collecting science determining just how much you can squeeze out of it. Certain modules take more time to process than others, but might yield more science. While the module is active, your science tickrate would be increased. The new breaking ground surface modules are great examples of how science really ought to work although I could do without the constant notifications at the top of the screen (lol)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-This is an idea I have that I think might overcomplicate, but perhaps part tiers which are researched at say 75% could be used but might fail, with the rate of failure decreasing until 0 at 100. This could be tuned based on difficulty I suppose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPrograms\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nPrograms will be the bread and butter of career mode. Rather than just getting random \u201Cexplore jool\u201D contracts, you\u2019d be able to progress through different programs of exploration, similar to Apollo or Venera etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-Each program contains missions. These missions would start simple i.e. \u201Center the sphere of influence of Jool\u201D and eventually progress to \u201Cbuild a colony around Jool\u201D and \u201Cconstruct and launch a spacecraft from the Jool colony to another body\u201D or whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-Missions would be arranged in tiers based on your reputation. A mission to do a manned flyby of Jool for example might be equivalent in tier to a Mun station or something. Balance-wise this would of course really have to be hashed out so the tiers align with difficulty well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-Missions would be given a specific budget. Exceeding this budget is fine if you have extra money in the bank from other missions or contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-Missions have specific, kind of short deadlines, meaning you shouldn\u2019t bite off more than you can chew or risk losing a lot of reputation and kovernment funding for your other missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-Successful missions reward some instant science, but this science value\u00A0diminishes rather quickly giving you a reason for pushing towards better and better projects quickly rather than letting science slowly tick up from your deployed experiments until it\u2019s easy. It does not force you to hurry to certain programs, however, as the science reward is not game-changing but just a bonus for quick work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n-You don\u2019t have to do all the missions in order. If you have the reputation you can skip missions or even skip entire programs. Maybe you hate Minmus and want to get straight to Duna. That\u2019s totally fine!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther Stuff\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Astronauts level up over time by doing their respective jobs. Pilots level up by actively piloting ships, Scientists level up by performing science or working in labs, engineers level up by repairing, replacing, or attaching new parts to ships or stations. (I do hope we get a base game Kerbal Attachment System analog, it honestly is basically a base game mod to me as-is and would give engineers something to do.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat do you guys think? Any good? I wonder how feasible it is to implement such a system at this point in development or whether this is even worth writing only a year out from release. Or even if the devs are listening. Maybe a modder is at least!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T09:43:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s what we get from Strategia at this moment, but yes, the idea is good\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut let\u0027s not be NASA, and don\u0027t create a program, pour billions into it and then cancel the whole thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
