How are communications in KSP 2 going to be handled? Then I had another thought. Time delay. Will there be that in KSP 2?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo be honest, I would be fine with time delay since it is a real life problem, but only if it was done in a way that it didn\u0027t take years for interstellar messages to make the journey.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt takes anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes iirc for any message to get from Earth to Mars. And that\u0027s a one way trip.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSignal delay in KSP won\u0027t be that bad obviously. 1/10th scale means 1/10th the way time, so 1 to 10 minutes from Kerbin to Duna or somewhere in that area.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy main concern, interstellar communications. Science is still a thing. Now, it could be that colonies add to science instantly, but until a colony is made, all info would need to be sent back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E on Kerbin. So that could take literal months to years in game time. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe time delay isn\u0027t the only problem. Signal strength and the length of travel. A light year or two is a long time.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, are they going to add light based communications?\u00A0 And by that I mean laser light.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother possibility, though highly unlikely to be put in game, subspace communication. Subspace is science fiction, yes, but I\u0027m not talking about the concept of another dimension, but more just the FTL communications. FTL communications would be a great help if time delay is added into the game.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nObviously it would ramp up with difficulty:\u003Cbr\u003E\nEasy - Instant messages\u003Cbr\u003E\nNormal - Slight delay\u003Cbr\u003E\nHard - Medium delay\u003Cbr\u003E\nVery hard - realistic delay\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust my thoughts on the matter, what do you guys think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-10T06:22:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2019 06:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by GoldForest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mousambi","CreatedById":200191,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-10T07:27:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea of time delay in general to get immersion.

transmission.\u00A0 Whatever the speed of light, the delay between transmitting and receiving the points is so small as to be inconsequential, even with OPM installed.\u00A0 ALL that signal delay does is turn probe cores into model airplane RC sets, nothing but a receiver and some servos.\u00A0 No autonomy at all, no brains.\u00A0 Like WW2-vintage optically guided weapons.\u00A0 If the probe is too far from Kerbin to be flown hands-on by somebody with a joystick at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, then players\u00A0have to write programs so the probe can fly itself, because the only way to implement signal delay is to make direct hands-on control (like you have without signal delay) be so far behind events as to be useless.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrue, this is how it works in real life.\u00A0 Teams of folks highly skilled in several separate Dark Arts spend years writing complex programs for distant space probes or even boosters that never even reach orbit.\u00A0 But putting this into the game means an individual player has to master all these Dark Arts alone.\u00A0 That is, knowing the proper orbital mechanics equations to use for the job, knowing enough about programming in general to convert these equations into self-correcting flight control algorithms, and knowing enough about the specific language in use to do so in that language.\u00A0 And then have the time to do this and repeatedly debug the software, just to get the rocket to function as desired.\u00A0 All of which is in addition to just building the rocket itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, some folks groove on this, which is why kOS exists and why RT has the option to include signal delay.\u00A0 But for the few folks who both can and WANT to do this, the signal delay option isn\u0027t even necessary to have because they\u0027d write the same programs with or without it, just because that\u0027s what they enjoy doing.\u00A0 For everybody else, this is sheer torture getting in the way of their fun, which is just flying rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, the unmodded game provides an easy solution.\u00A0 You can control probes in real time no matter their distance because you, the human, are pretending to be the AI of a highly autonomous robot.\u00A0 Thus, you can ASSUME there\u0027s however much signal delay you want and it doesn\u0027t matter, because your probes are modern, autonomous vehicles capable of flying themselves (because the highly skilled, multi-talented\u00A0team behind the scenes at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E built them that way), as opposed to ancient, dumb, WW2-vintage tech you should be embarrassed to send even to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Then you don\u0027t have to write all the code to do this, and don\u0027t need to feel ashamed by this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo really, when you boil it all down, having signal delay does nothing good for anybody.\u00A0 Those who like writing control algorithms will do so whether there\u0027s actually delay or not, while those who don\u0027t enjoy coding (or lack sufficient training even to attempt it) will be forced into it anyway\u00A0if signal delay exists.\u00A0 And as mentioned, it has no impact on Science!

transmission pretty much kills the idea of building a cohesive space empire or even making an interstellar trip within a reasonable amount of gametime.\u00A0 Thus, it\u0027s best not to have it at all.\u00A0 This leaves players free to enjoy the game however they want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-13T20:51:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223671744\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188128\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221568406669\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, Geschosskopf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSignal delay and automation are totally separate things.\u00A0 One has no effect on the other.\u00A0 For instance, in KSP1, you can install either \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E or RT, you don\u0027t need both at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are separated in the same sense that driving a racecar and having good eyesight are totally separate things.
