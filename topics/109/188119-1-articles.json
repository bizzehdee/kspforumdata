I\u0027d appreciate having to design around life support, accurate fuel types (eg. \u0027liquid hydrogen\u0027 instead of \u0027liquid fuel\u0027), realistic resource trees (eg. methane out of carbon dioxide and water / plastic out of methane), an\u00A0upscaled Kerbol system etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also realize that KSP1 is plenty hard enough for the average player and that throwing all these extra features is liable to make the game too daunting to a first time player. Ideally I\u0027d like to see hardcore players\u00A0given a truly hardcore experience to opt into as part of the native game without overwhelming the new ones. I\u0027d hope that KSP2 is being designed around a depth of customization options that won\u0027t alienate either player base, and also provide a ladder for the casual players to become hardcore rocket scientists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust my thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-10T11:04:42Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2019 11:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by afafsa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
