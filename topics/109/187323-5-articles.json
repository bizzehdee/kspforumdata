They\u0027re not unheard-of, but the gaming public is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Evicious\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and has a really long memory, so when they do happen the uproar is enormous and lasts years. No publisher or studio wants to get into that situation.\u00A0Most games by far however have reasonably accurate pre-release advertising, including trailers and feature lists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, when this does happen it\u0027s very, very rarely a matter of straight-up lying -- at least early in the process: when things start to go pear-shaped, this can change. In fact I can\u0027t think of a single occasion of this being the case. Instead, especially in the age of Kickstarter, it\u0027s a matter of having over-ambitious goals and then discovering just how over-ambitious when it\u0027s time to implement them. This is also the case with stuff like graphical downgrades. Almost invariably there was an honest intention to deliver what was promised, it just turned out too hard or too expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, gamers are incredibly good at self-delusion and self-hype. If something is as much as hinted at somewhere, they jump to the conclusion that it has been promised, and if it doesn\u0027t make it in, many take it as a personal betrayal -- multiplayer in KSP1 is a prominent example close to home. It was never promised, but never ruled out, and a significant contingent of KSP fans assumed as a matter of course that it was being worked on and would arrive one of these days, and got bitter when it didn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, basically, any cynicism along the lines of \u0022KSP2 is just KSP1 re-skinned\u0022 -- which would mean that Star Theory aren\u0027t just being over-ambitious, but are flat out lying when they\u0027re saying they\u0027ve done a close to complete rewrite of the game, with barely any KSP1 code left -- is really foolish. If KSP2 turns out to be a disappointment -- which it very well might -- it\u0027s far, far more likely that this is for the usual reasons: overreach, being too open about planned features that might be dropped, and discovering that some promised feature was much harder to implement than anticipated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoldForest","CreatedById":77770,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-29T09:16:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223678917\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187323\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221569744774\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197414\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Incarnation of Chaos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Incarnation of Chaos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou haven\u0027t really looked into the games industry have you?
