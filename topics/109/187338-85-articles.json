Money was invested in the game and the franchise, the publisher wants to make a profit, the game is not ready, the developer is sure that he will not be able to finish his career by February.

It\u0027s generally just best to rip that bandaid off quickly as then people tend to move on quicker. Not to mention, they really havent made that much promises (the depth of colonies hasnt been stated much and could easily just be made into glorified fuel depots, until today we havent had confirmation of a star system outside of Deb Deb, etc), and considering the fact that small groups of modders have gotten similar things out in ksp1 in less time (albeit at an understandably lower quality then what would be expected for an AAA game), it would definitely be possible for them to scramble together something with unpolished functional multiplayer to where people vote on timewarp, another star system with underdeveloped planets, and a few new rocket engines that are mostly just number changes (though this would of course be lower quality then what\u0027s fully expected of an AAA game). This still definitely wouldnt leave people happy, but you could make it not a complete cashgrab and itd be far more disappointing then it is upsetting. Delays have a very understandable diminishing effect on hype because the fact that we are here shows that we care about this game, however that\u0027s very much known, and the fact that theyre not rushing to release it is to me is evidence against greed being a primary motivator here as developing games is expensive, so if you\u0027re going for short term profit as your goal, then youre going to want to rush it out of the door.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TLTay","CreatedById":184633,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-22T02:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the far end of the roadmap on Steam (it is vertical there instead of horizontal on the forum page) there is a\u00A0 pixelated title.
