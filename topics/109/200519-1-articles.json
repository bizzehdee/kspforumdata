PS5 is a bit underclocked at 3.5GHz, while XBSX goes to 3.6GHz with SMT according to specs.

It\u0027s exceptionally bad at utilizing threads both at loading time and runtime. You are clearly not I/O bound on loading. I\u0027m in the same boat, running KSP from an M.2 Samsung EVO, and it barely makes a dent over loading from HDD. I don\u0027t know for certain what it\u0027s actually doing, but it seems to be doing some CPU-intensive work while loading assets, it\u0027s all loaded upfront, and (nearly?) all the processing seems to happen on a single thread. Situation doesn\u0027t improve greatly when the game is running, as older versions of Unity KSP was based on aren\u0027t great at multithreading to begin with, and KSP hasn\u0027t really done anything to improve on that. So again, most of the workload tends to be on the main thread. Which, when you have a CPU with 20\u002B logical cores, just isn\u0027t a great use of hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like KSP2 should be in a better spot for all that. Newer versions of Unity do make better use of threads and also provide you with a job system that lets you push a lot of additional work out to threads. Given that gen 9 consoles are going to be running with 16 logical cores, I can\u0027t imagine Intercept getting away with not optimizing the game for multithreading this time around. Might still not be great at using all 24 logical cores of 5900X, but 2/3 utilization would be a good start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods will still be mods, though. Crashes will still happen and if there are memory leaks, a mod will eventually eat through any amount of RAM you\u0027re likely to throw at it. That said, impact on loading times can be greatly reduced. And with better performance, faster loading, cleaner API, and more features in core games, there are fewer reasons for modders to do anything unconventional, which should improve overall stability for a lot of mods. Hopefully. All in all, KSP2 should be a better experience if Intercept makes reasonable choices along the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-21T15:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a strong suspicion that it may be optimized for the new Consoles - because money.\u00A0 \u00A0(Would also be a reason behind the last - minute shake up and delay in release)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeaning that any relatively good PC should be fine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrFancyPL","CreatedById":94843,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-21T16:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy speculation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinimal:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n64bit system (Win, possibly Mac and Linux)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAMD Ryzen 1600 or Intel\u00A0Core i5 9400\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8GB\u00A0RAM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNvidia GTX 1060 or AMD RX 570 (must be compatibile with directX 12, i think there also will be options to use dX11 instead, but not lower)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20-30\u00A0GB of disk space\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBroadband internet connection (multiplayer)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecommended:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n64bit system (Win, possibly Mac and Linux)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAMD Ryzen 3500x/3600 or Intel analogue\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16 GB\u00A0of RAM (scaled accordingly for higher res textures)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNvidia GTX 1660ti or AMD\u00A0rx 5500xt\u00A0(must be compatibile with directX 12, i think there also will be options to use dX11 instead, but not lower)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20-30GB for the base game, 15-30 for possible DLC\u0027s (don\u0027t know how many will be made)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBroadband internet connection (multiplayer)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRaytracing, or very large resolutions, like 4k:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n64bit system (Win, possibly Mac and Linux)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny CPU with matching performance of the recommended specs CPU\u0027s, or higher\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16GB RAM (I have a feeling, that this number will be higher, but, I\u0027m not sure, so I am writing recommended specs instead)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRaytracing cards for optimal performance ( some older cards also have Raytracing capabilities added via drivers, but they are not taken into account)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisk space as above\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInternet Connection as above\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do y\u0027all think ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kernel Kraken","CreatedById":181383,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-21T18:18:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve already started buying parts for my first PC build, and I used KSP 2 as my excuse.

For planetside, combination of sky map and screen space (SSR) will cover pretty much every case where you\u0027ll see something reflected in the shiny.

Maybe the performance difference from a 3570k makes it worthwhile but you need to wait for rocket Lake at least or wait for the 12th gen. I wanted to upgrade 1 year ago to the 2000series gpu. I forgot the name unfortunately but someone on these forums told me to wait for the 3000 series. Best advice ever. I have no idea how they knew the 3000 series would have that much umpf.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo bad I didn\u0027t do a more detailed benchmark and post the results.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dave1904","CreatedById":153882,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-22T02:11:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223929913\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200519\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221613908716\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022185480\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022alphaprior\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, alphaprior said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built a new system in November. AMD Ryzen 5900x, 32GB RAM G.Skill 3600Mhz,\u00A0 512 Samsung 980 Pro. And I kept my older Nvidia 970 because the new graphic cards are extremely expensive and not worth to spend a fortune especially if you don\u0027t play killing games that use\u00A0advanced graphics like raytracing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSystem is blazing fast. When I boot up it takes seconds. When it comes to KSP things are not so good because of the mods. It takes more than a minute to load and takes about 17GB RAM probably more sometimes. It crashes often and even Chrome in the background freezes because system is out of memory. Sometimes things go so bad I have to restart because system freezes entirelly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best system you can buy won\u0027t\u00A0 give you a perfect experience. Of course you can skip mods or use very few.\u003Cbr\u003E\nApparently KSP2 will have many things that we have with mods today so we will need less mods for sometime anyway....\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo\u00A0mods factor will be most important and RAM the more you have the better,\u00A032GB is absolutelly minimum in this kind of games that load so many stuff also a fast SSD\u00A0helps with paging file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have 130 mods and the game almost never crashes. When it does its compatiblity problems and not memory related. I just upgraded from 16 to 32 and it had 0 impact. I think for you it\u0027s specific mods causing issues and not the amount.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
