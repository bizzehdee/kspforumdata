No one wants to play KSP with communication delay, but at the same time, it would be nice to introduce it since KSP 2 wants to teach kids, and even adults, about space travel. And communication is a key part of that. So, I think they will implement a two-pronged system.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Probe control: Sending commands to a probe and waiting for it to react to them would be no fun, so probe control will remain instant.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Transmissions: They will implement delay for this, mainly in the terms of science transmission. If you\u0027re far from Kerbin, you will beam the science report to Kerbin, but you won\u0027t receive science or data from it until it reaches Kerbin. So, like Kerbin to Duna, let\u0027s say the journey for a transmission is 5 to 20 minutes (Like IRL Earth and Mars). You will have to wait for the science report to reach Kerbin from Duna. Of course, this is barring any colony. With colonies, you will just beam the transmission to the colony or Kerbin, whichever happens to be faster/closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, there will be difficulty sliders to change this. Don\u0027t want to wait? Bam, instant transmission. Want more difficulty? Turn on line of sight transmission, like in KSP 1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB) Everything is instant, just like KSP 1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI imagine that they will do it the route of A, just to teach since they want KSP 2 to be a teaching game as well as a simulation game. Of course, I imagine if they don\u0027t, someone will come up with a mod to introduce communication delay.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-27T04:43:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think educational games goes like the training montage of Kung Fu Panda, when Devs concentrate on making a good educational game, they always fail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only good educational games are accidentally so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m all in favour of transmission delay for data (not control!) but only if it\u0027s part of a gameplay system or gameplay loop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealism for the sake of realism or educational content will onlyake the game worse at being a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-28T19:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed, that\u0027s the same problem Life Support has.

And that\u0027s if you have the rule that \u0022presence of a crew removes signal delay entirely, and probe cores can have sequences of commands uploaded to them to allow for them to complete things despite the signal delay\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s basically how Remotetech (of it\u0027s various versions) worked, it\u0027s how you have to play \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-1, and to be honest it\u0027s not that bad.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut it requires something else to be coded, and that kinda kills the whole idea. It requires the includsion of a full-featured autopilot, similar to (and likely superior to) MechJeb.
