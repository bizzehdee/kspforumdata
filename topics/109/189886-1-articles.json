Life support should also be added. Maybe I am wrong about this but sometimes talking to other gamers I get the feeling\u00A0most casuals do not even get to the mun or even kerbal orbit so adding deeper more difficult things like life support and possibly even kerbal life spans would not really make much difference when it comes to accessibility. For all I care the life spans could be 100 years but time pressure\u00A0needs to be added. Maybe a hardcore career mode would solve that problem.

You can get 1 years worth of life support on you ship with minimal mass. Your only limitation is that you are afraid it will make things to hard but it won\u0027t. I makes you missions far more interesting because planing missions to outer planets is something that should require planing. Besides that these options would be easy to toggle. I do not care if they add it anyway because mods will make my perfect KSP like they always have. We all have a different vision on what is best.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
