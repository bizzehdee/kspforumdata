I think that\u00A0DLC is mostly a\u00A0side effect of the shift in software development practices over the last 20 years, and the flexibility provided by (mostly) everyone being connected to the internet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the shift to agile software development trickling down to everyone, the idea is that you prioritize features that offer the most value to your customers, and you release early and often to receive feedback and constantly re-prioritize the next features. In the long run, this provides more value to the customer (and by extension, more money for you) than fronting the entire cost of development, but releasing features that it turns out nobody likes.\u00A0This is partly why we see so many \u0022early access\u0022 games these days.\u00A0The cutoff for when to release the game is a decision that companies are making based on a number of different factors; and of course, in general, these people are all trying to make money. So they\u0027re trying to strike a balance between what gamers are willing to pay for, versus how much profit they will make, and how long they can pay to continue developing the game. Of course, they have to pay the development team to continue working on the game. People are expensive. Releasing DLC can be seen as an infusion of cash to keep developing the game for longer. I personally think gamers would be much more upset if companies\u00A0released games, fixed a few bugs, then stopped doing anything to them and moved on to the next project.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis being said, I have my limits as well.

They sound good enough in theory but in reality generate almost no money for anyone ever, barring some extreme cases - which this wouldn\u0027t be for sure. Something else that actually works instead is to sell a small thing at a very inflated price, many game companies sell stuff like old concept art and other halfway-behind-the-scenes things in small packages that don\u0027t really do anything to the game itself, these things are essentially like donations that grant the donor a small token of appreciation in return. However I doubt that Star Theory would get anything out of that because there is a major common factor among games companies that do this kind of thing; most don\u0027t sit under the thumb of a publisher that will simply take most of the profit. I\u0027m not averse to buying extras when most of\u00A0the money goes\u00A0directly\u00A0to the developers.

Publishers are not always automatically evil, they can provide massive initial funding for studios and let them make a 10 times as good and profitable game, it\u0027s just that they take a giant chunk of the profits from sales and we gamers who want to support the devs directly just can\u0027t get most of our money to go where we want. Studios under publishers essentially exchange \u0022high risk, high reward\u0022 for job security, an understandable choice and it\u0027s no surprise studios tend to get absorbed by publishers eventually. Egosoft is the only studio I\u0027ve ever heard of that instead got rid of a publisher and gained the freedom to set their own policies, they pretty much immediately got on much better terms with their community and the fans are\u00A0more devoted\u00A0than ever...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"\u03AD\u0137 \u03BD\u03AF\u013B\u013B\u03AC\u03AF\u03AE","CreatedById":197328,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-19T07:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m on a budget and the base game is already expensive...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-19T13:02:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223728997\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191051\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221579211501\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002232993\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022razark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/16/2020 at 9:51 PM, razark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it should be nothing but DLCs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe content they\u0027ve delivered so far is clearly lacking, and needs a large amount of DLC just to even be playable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re talking about KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBitMore","CreatedById":201924,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-19T13:18:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see any reason why not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I hope they add KSP\u0027s Breaking Ground and Making History stock, they could also be a \u0022Nostalgia DLC\u0022 with them both as a single unified DLC.
