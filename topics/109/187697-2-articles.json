His name is Dr Uri Shumlak from the University of Washington.\nAnd honestly you know, well I take all the blame on my own shoulders if these propulsion systems in any form should not be as 100 percent of the real target. We have done our best to ensure that these machines remain rooted in real science, even if we are only telling a story. Since I\u0027ve never seen a functioning rocket with metallic hydrogen as a propulsion system at this time, of course, I can not guarantee that the same rocket in our game in any future will somehow still have something to do with real existing rockets of this kind ,\nLet\u0027s stay with the metallic hydrogen technology. The point is that the metallic hydrogen actually remains stable at normal room temperature. Such a substance was only produced in the laboratory a few years ago, so this is a brand new technology. But the fact that they have been able to make a little bit of this material is enough for us to use it as a possible fuel for our Kerbal rockets. With such a fuel you could namely develop rockets that can exert twice as much thrust as conventional chemical rockets. Unfortunately, this material burns at 6000 degrees Kelvin, which causes almost any matter to melt immediately. Therefore, a major challenge is to dilute the Mettalic hydrogen so that the temperatures are not quite as high.\nBy the way, some of the vehicles in the trailer, especially at the beginning, the Lunar Lander Module, have exactly that drive, namely a vacuum-certified metal hydrogen propulsion system.\nWell this is just the first advanced technology that you get after the normal liquid fuel rockets so there is really something you can still discover. We will certainly be able to talk more about this at another time.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/ftLT_puDtxo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/ftLT_puDtxo\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-26T20:21:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2019 08:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by nikokespprfan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eyoutube subtitles don\u0026#039;t tend to preserve names; fixed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-26T18:47:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223660271\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187697\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221566835707\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022187694\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xurkitree\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Xurkitree said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe system will work fine for what it is under patched conics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is that there will be too many bodies handle.

At least, we are if the goal is to have an endgame where you are setting up self supporting bases and building ships in another star system on a timescale that isn\u0027t getting into generational ship territory.

Yes, the current signs point to it either not being possible at all, or not being viable with known projected technology. But...it\u0027s also really cool, and something that would be absolutely amazing if it were real because it would be both massively useful, and not an existential crisis. Metallic Hydrogen doesn\u0027t lean so directly to building an actual torch ship, and by extension, doesn\u0027t readily turn into a weapon that can destroy entire planets by running into them. I can see something that probably isn\u0027t possible would be an issue...but I think I have to side with the rule of cool on this one.
