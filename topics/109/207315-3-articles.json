I completely understand the users which would see their next games be released very soon. However this \u0022hype train\u0022 mentality which was appeared during last years for some elements, was caused expecially from the software houses. I can understand that there are some period of the years which are better for sell a new product, but in some cases, some announcements was made too early than the real day of release. Just take GTA series, how many of this series was announces soo early and they was released years later?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor KSP2 however, I think that covid and some management issues correlated with the software house was the real reason for this delay. I think that they really working, but they was very unlucky. covid has ruinded their initial plans, and also some the fact that has forced them to replan their workteam, has caused these delays. And honestly, during past months I saw several interaction from some of them, so, I think that if we will lucky, they will accomplish the 2022 as target for release day\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-21T14:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224104931\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207315\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221647849481\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022212559\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sunnypunny\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, sunnypunny said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup. We lack significant coverage on any single mechanic or feature throughout all these promos, and core features like multiplayer remain a total information blackout. Even in 2019 where the game was supposedly 6 months away from release, at least one or two things should have been pretty well finished and ready to show. All we get are little scraps and previews and pre-alpha footage the whole way - where\u0027s the progress? It\u0027s understandable that people would start asking questions and thinking that the game is dead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis team is clearly indifferent to the community that built KSP, and the focus on tutorials shows that they\u0027re more committed to finding a new market. But any space fan who is interested in this kind of game will already know about and most likely own KSP. In the Gamescon reveal they clearly thought the game was a bigger deal and that more people are enthused about it than really are, it\u0027s a niche product and their attempts to make it otherwise are always going to struggle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m predicting at least one more scandal before release, and if there\u0027s another delay (most likely at this point as quoted above) then another scandal on top. Then there will be the scandal of the release itself, something like SimCity or Cyberpunk where we question why they ported a single player game to multiplayer, see all the bugs and wonder what they\u0027ve been doing all these years. Literally just combine the most popular mods along with some graphical and performance updates and they\u0027d already have a fine sequel, but who knows what we will end up getting based on what we\u0027ve seen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s becoming increasingly difficult to care about this sequel any more - especially when KSP already taught me rocket science and object-oriented programming. That\u0027s more than a game should do and it\u0027s near impossible to top that. If KSP2 ever arrives I\u0027m sure it will be playable after a year or two of patches and content updates, but it\u0027ll definitely continue to be a slow grind as it has been already. It\u0027s possible that modders then jump in and create a realistic RP mod (like GTAV NoPixel) and it has a resurgence on Twitch, but everything good I can imagine it being is still years away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe should\u0027ve been playing this during the lockdown in early access and full of bugs. Perfect time to get a devoted community involved and let the modders start tinkering. This company uses a top-down, secretive approach that\u0027s unsuited for this game, all they care about is the bottom line and that shows in everything they present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe you haven\u0027t been around here much? The folks from intercept have given us more information per month and had more follow-up conversations in dev threads than Squad ever did, and they were pretty great as far as studios go. We know quite a bit about a bunch of important mechanics, including advanced fuel types, new engines, burning while under time warp, new planets, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and flight interfaces, and hints about how colonies and stations will be supplied and constructed. Are you expecting a full walk-through gameplay demo most of a year before release? Because I\u0027ve never seen that happen.

But as skeptical as we all are of \u0027big studios\u0027 so far I think to their credit we\u0027ve seen a pretty fair and open attitude toward fans from the folks at Intercept. Obviously they\u0027re still working on things, obviously they\u0027re keeping some stuff close to the vest until its really ready for prime-time, but from the nitty-gritty explanations in dev-blogs to the shiny objects in the show and tells it sure looks to me like they\u0027ve invested pretty heavily in solving some of the hard-problems that KSP1 couldn\u0027t, not just slapping a cheap skin on the old game for a cash grab. You never know for sure but it sure looks to me like they care enough to get this stuff right and make a great game, which is all that matters.

All the promo footage is years old at this point. Everything is run according to some 5 year old master plan without deviation, and it just feels lifeless. There\u0027s a total lack of meaningful interaction between the studio and the fans. Literally nothing anyone on the outside has said in the last few years has gotten through to them, or if it has we\u0027ll sure never know about it. The biggest question I have is - why the veil of secrecy? Why shut out the original dev so that he only even learnt about a sequel along with the rest of us? There\u0027s been enough shady business going on for 5 years that it would take an essay to cover, and when they create this massive brick wall between the studio and the fans, people are right to be suspicious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome people here act like the fans are unreasonable to want the smallest amount of involvement in the development process - for a sequel to a game that was mostly built by modders, a dream project for people who are obsessed with spaceflight. The promo videos tell us this studio shares the same passion, and maybe they do, but how would we know?

I also understand that a non-negligible amount of hours and effort has to be put into this both by dedicated PR people and by others who could be spending time developing.
