(I know it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Epossible\u003C/em\u003E to build such craft and that examples are out there, but I \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E know from experience that water in KSP doesn\u0027t always... act in ways comparable to water in real life \u2014\u00A0potentially leading to rapid unscheduled disassembly events...) See also: Water landings in KSP are still \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E dangerous\u00A0than landing on good ol\u0027 terra firma.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question is... Will this be adressed at all in KSP 2? A quick search didn\u0027t give me an answer, so could anyone else possibly point me towards anything that may have been mentioned by the dev team regarding a re-work of liquid physics? Will seaplanes, sea-launched vehicles, capsules designed for water landing, and dedicated seagoing craft work better in KSP 2 than they do in the game\u0027s current incarnation?
