And ksp is not simple in any way. Five years sounds much more reasonable, considering the scope. So now from this perspective, I\u0027m surprised they went with 2020 as release date. Sure many things happened along the way, but they shouldn\u0027t affect the schedule that much. I mean, it\u0027s like they were doing nothing since 2019 until today.

Even with stated ambitions for KSP2 it\u0027s not exactly AAA-scale. But they\u0027re also working with a fairly small team on (what I assume is) a modest budget.

Which isn\u0027t necessarily a bad thing, and some great games came out of the team deciding that they can make an even bigger game, but then you either grow the team, slip the schedule, or most realistically, both. The original 2021 goal for Intercept seems like it was in \u0022salvage Star Theory plan\u0022 mode. The new date indicates that they rescoped, re-scheduled, and are now making the Intercept vision of KSP2. And based on some of the recent updates, it looks like a big part of it is that rather than making KSP with a fresh coat of paint on it, they\u0027re now making something that preserves the core of the original, but also feels and looks like a game made in the decade it\u0027s actually released, and not something that belongs on last gen hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dprostock","CreatedById":195079,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-14T01:26:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the concept in which people are hopeful that in two years the promised dates will be met, when they have already had problems at the employer level and at the staff level???\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am amazed when I read that there are people who discuss what they are going to do about something that does not exist, where there is no certainty of compliance with dates or the final delivery of the product.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf at least there was competition to make the proposed schedule believable, because if they do not comply, another will....\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-14T01:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223881150\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197935\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221605317214\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022195079\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dprostock\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, dprostock said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the concept in which people are hopeful that in two years the promised dates will be met, when they have already had problems at the employer level and at the staff level???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve worked in multiple game development studios.

You can invest your entire life time into playing Chess, as many people have, but it doesn\u0027t mean that it will take decades to make a Chess game. I mean, you could spend that long\u00A0if your goal is to write some very clever AI for it, but I can also write a simple Chess client, complete with networked multiplayer, in a couple of hours, and it will have everything that makes Chess a great game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of production, KSP is a very simple game. And I\u0027m not saying it to diminish that game\u00A0- that\u0027s part of brilliance of the original. Things were added over the years to make it \u003Cem\u003Ea bit\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0more complex, but I remember looking through the code of the early-ish version, around 1.0, and the physics was basically just a few lines of\u00A0code for aerodynamics and gravity. Everything else was handled through Unity. Likewise, there were some clever bits to load graphics and collision around the player when you\u0027re on the surface, so that you can handle planet-sized planets without running out of memory, but the rest is Unity doing its thing. Some resource management in flight, a ship editor, some UI, and you basically have your game. Updates expanded on that. We got biomes, mining, asteroids, robotic parts - all coming with a bit more logic and a bit more UI. But there is still a very reasonable amount of work there for a very modest team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current vision for KSP2 is a lot bigger. I agree. But I don\u0027t think it started out that way. I think the original pitch was remake of KSP \u002B interstellar \u002B colonies \u002B visual update. And depending on how you implement colonies, all the extra stuff is basically a big expansion. But then the reveal happened at 2019 E3, and everyone was excited, and I think that\u0027s when the push for larger, more ambitious KSP2 was made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could easily be wrong about that, but a simpler, leaner original vision for KSP2 fits well with the timeline, what we saw at E3, and how the narrative changed in the months following it, as KSP2 became a bigger project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven now, though, KSP2 isn\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0big and complex. Things they are doing with rendering of planet surfaces and sky is pretty typical for modern games. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a good reference here. The general look of ships makes it seem like they embraced PBR, which is industry standard now. Colony building becoming an integral part of gameplay essentially means introduction of economy, but again, it\u0027s hard to come up with modern games that don\u0027t have some form of economy going. Again, KSP2 is kind of doing a lot with little here, going after bigger world-building pieces rather than getting caught in the details. And that\u0027s great, because that is what lets a mid-sized team build a game that\u0027s just as fun and long-lasting as the best of the AAA games. It\u0027s also why I think they are on reasonable schedule now despite increased ambition for the project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dprostock","CreatedById":195079,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-14T11:58:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223881182\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197935\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221605327543\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197414\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Incarnation of Chaos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Incarnation of Chaos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf our options are either KSP2 is vaporware, or KSP2 will release as a flaming pile of garbage filled with bugs 2 years from now then what does saying any of this accomplish?
