It adds so so much to the game. What do I mean? \u00A0Well, I for one cannot stand repeating the exact same flight profile ad infinitum. Refueling or resupplying stations? Building them? Same profile over and over. Real world equivalent: ISS. How many flights were needed to build it? How many launch sites? More than 40 launches from at least 2 launch sites. And how many of these flights did not use autopilot? 0. No space flight does not use autopilot. Artemis was FULLY AUTOMATED. SpaceX? Fully automated.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I was learning to fly missions here in ksp I read and watched as many tutorials as I could. I could launch and land within 2-3 flights on day 1. Rendezvous and docking? Not once. No matter what I read or watched it just did not click. Then I found mechjeb. I tweaked the rocket from a tutorial i watched (and copied) by adding 1 part. Mechjeb. It taught me in 1 SINGLE FLIGHT what watching hundreds of hours of tutorials and reading hundreds of pages of written tutorials could not. Why or rather how? It did it by showing how MY rocket flew. How MY rocket behaved.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe number of times I have been able to have my mind blown by views and moments that are 100% IMPOSSIBLE without autopilot are beyond countless. One moment in particular came when I had mechjeb set up for docking to my station. I decided to let mj handle my rocket and jumped to the station and watched my ship come in out of the shadow into the light of the sun then close into the stations lights and dock. It was beyond beautiful to see. It covered 250 meters to docking without needing my input. Had I been making a cinematic it would have been glorious. Impossible w/out autopilot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutopilot is valuable and not having it is beyond limiting. Just because YOU do not want it or care for it does not mean it should not be included. Best example? Multiplayer. I personally cannot fathom how \u00A0multiplayer is a good thing for a game that is at its core SINGLE PLAYER and personally want nothing to do with it, but others want it so its being added. Given the multiple years (likely the entire existence of ksp) of people debating this and being in 2 camps much the same as multiplayer the latter of which saw victory go to promultiplayer and its obvious inclusion. Given the fact REAL WORLD space programs CANNOT function w/out autopilot or automation not having would be a slap in the face especially (personal opinion here) given the fact multiplayer is a thing and the mod that spawned it was far less polished than mechjeb2.

It adds so so much to the game. What do I mean? \u00A0Well, I for one cannot stand repeating the exact same flight profile ad infinitum. Refueling or resupplying stations? Building them? Same profile over and over. Real world equivalent: ISS. How many flights were needed to build it? How many launch sites? More than 40 launches from at least 2 launch sites. And how many of these flights did not use autopilot? 0. No space flight does not use autopilot. Artemis was FULLY AUTOMATED. SpaceX? Fully automated.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I was learning to fly missions here in ksp I read and watched as many tutorials as I could. I could launch and land within 2-3 flights on day 1. Rendezvous and docking? Not once. No matter what I read or watched it just did not click. Then I found mechjeb. I tweaked the rocket from a tutorial i watched (and copied) by adding 1 part. Mechjeb.

One moment in particular came when I had mechjeb set up for docking to my station. I decided to let mj handle my rocket and jumped to the station and watched my ship come in out of the shadow into the light of the sun then close into the stations lights and dock. It was beyond beautiful to see. It covered 250 meters to docking without needing my input. Had I been making a cinematic it would have been glorious.

Given the multiple years (likely the entire existence of ksp) of people debating this and being in 2 camps much the same as multiplayer the latter of which saw victory go to promultiplayer and its obvious inclusion. Given the fact REAL WORLD space programs CANNOT function w/out autopilot or automation not having would be a slap in the face especially (personal opinion here) given the fact multiplayer is a thing and the mod that spawned it was far less polished than mechjeb2.

The fact ksp2 will have a feature ill never use aint one of em. Being ignored decidedly IS one. Autopilot is beyond useful whether its in single or multiplayer. Its a feature that is objectively adding to core mechanics. Being able to play with another player does nothing to add to game core functionality and i absolutely cannot fathom how my repeated statements that i just dont care (im pulling from this thread and every thread ive ever said it in) if its in. I DO care that they prioritized dev time for it over other things early into development, which makes me fear other key things will or did suffer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey have to prioritize\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esomething,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0they can\u0027t make everyone happy.
