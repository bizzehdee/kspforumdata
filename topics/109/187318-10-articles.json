Such as a science pack which can do additional scientific experiments, or a pack with communications, or a pack for jet fighters with a parachute, etc etc. It\u0027s merely silly that Kerbals can only have a jetpack despite the model it was based off of (the Manned Maneuvering Unit), being only used 3 times- and even if based off of SAFER- that has never been used, merely equipped for safety\u0027s sake.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003ENew \u0027Veteran\u0027 Appearance\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E - Since I suggest Kerbals be able to choose what color suit they can wear, then I suggest \u0027veteran\u0027 Kerbals (Jebediah, Bob, Bill, Val) receive unique red stripes, like the Apollo astronauts wore during Apollos 13 onwards.

Meaning that to have water, it required dips in the planet\u0027s surface to reach 0 altitude. Which made things like waterfalls and practical rivers impossible. So to remedy this, Star Theory can allow water to be at any altitude (as it is in real life) allowing for waterfalls and other interesting features that are impossible in KSP1.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBigger terrain scatters / interactive scatters\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E - I\u0027m struggling to find the exact quote- but as Armstrong put it during his Apollo 11 descent, he had to fly over massive boulders- (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/uploads/LROCiotw/AS17-140-21496HR.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eexample\u003C/a\u003E).

So Star Theory\u0027s claims that KSP1 parts can\u0027t be upgraded into KSP2 makes little sense. If they\u0027re claiming that the balances (engine thrust, fuel contained, etc) is different then that\u0027s a different matter entirely, but not one that can\u0027t be rectified. It just seems odd they\u0027d copy the first game\u0027s parts and still say they\u0027re not compatible. A simple conversion to rebuild KSP1 craft using KSP2 parts even as an external program seems rather straight forward (if it\u0027s X part from a directory list of KSP1 parts, then assign KSP2 from KSP2 part directory, in XYZ coordinate spot).

As currently EVA in KSP1 is basically non-existent. Even in career mode, we\u0027re left with 3 minutes of activities before we\u0027re left with \u0027roving around\u0027,\u00A0 walking aimlessly, etc. In real life- orbital EVAs can take hours. Some of the longest have taken 8 hours. Which is about how long Apollo astronauts spent working on the lunar surface- and both events are set to extremely strict schedules spending nearly every second of every minute in those hours busy working. Of course I don\u0027t expect Star Theory to keep us busy for that long in one spot on one planet/moon, but more than 3 minutes would be great! Activities like gathering rock samples, digging up samples, searching for unique soil spots (something done by Apollo astronauts), taking a photo of a spot, deploying small science packages, etc etc. All of these are activities Apollo astronauts were doing and should be perfect examples if put into a more gameplay style could be fun for the players.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003ELaunch / Flight Commentary\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E - After watching a recent video showing more ingame footage- it\u0027s audible at one point that Kerbals are chattering (launch countdown?). I think including this as an option would be great. KSP1 has Chatterer but it\u0027s never felt truly connected to KSP1, things happen and it\u0027ll continue to talk like normal and is only 1 voice at a time. Plus it\u0027s the same audio tracks for all modes of flight. Whether roving, EVAing in space, flying an aircraft on Kerbin and so on. Unique dialogue to each form of flight would be cool- like preflight announcements shortly after takeoff with aircraft, a countdown for rockets- in flight cabin announcements for aircraft, excited jabbering when a Kerbal completes a task (as mentioned earlier) or gathers science. I also think it\u0027s important to allow multiple Kerbals to speak (at varying volumes so it isn\u0027t a mess). Actual identifiable events would be great so the chatter isn\u0027t just background noise and adds to the process of the game.

Which is great but there are many facets of general rocketry that KSP1 will never be able to achieve due to it\u0027s design flaws. As a result, I would appreciate if Star Theory could continue to expand upon these ideas and continue to promote rockets just like their growth into near future technologies.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENew Rocket Fuels\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E - In real life there are a verity of rocket fuels.

Currently KSP1 only has an analog for Kerolox, Hypergolic fuels (assuming that\u0027s what monoprop is based off of), and solid rocket fuels. To make up for the missing hydrolox option- I suggest adding a cryogenic liquid fuel, with the difficulty option of it becoming liquid fuel when it boils off or boiling off and the resource diminishing entirely. Liquid Oxygen would remain (I always assumed it was lite cryogenic in that the insulation inside kept it cold forever).\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EKetholox\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E - In real life, we are working to develop and utilize metholox fuels which have the same power as kerolox (or at least similar) while having the improved \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E similar to that of hydrolox.

This is perfect for KSP2, especially since one of my friends was wondering why (in the pre-alpha rocket launch footage) the rocket when it twisted and flipped; flipped like a rocket in KSP1 with joints at the connection points of parts instead of in the middle of parts as they realistically would?

As well as actually taking greater advantage of KSP2\u0027s options.

But with procedural parts being a thing (and a popular one at that with a certain group of people), it raises the question of whether or not Star Theory will provide more lego style parts like KSP1 did, allowing players to stretch and warp existing parts procedurally, or both. As this will again, affect what should be suggested and the approach Star Theory is taking to the new game.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWill there be Squad / Star Theory officially hosted multiplayer servers?\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nJust curious. Since a lot of players don\u0027t have the ability to set up their own servers and a public one for players to join and enjoy would be a great middle ground for those who don\u0027t want to make their own.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027ll be all for now. Thank you for coming to my \u003Cs\u003ETED\u003C/s\u003E post. It took a while to make so I hope it\u0027s worth it and I\u0027d like to know what you (and would like to know what the developers) think! Thanks for reading if you actually do read everything.
