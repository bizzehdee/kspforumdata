Im hopeful that just a solid set of tools and tutorials and a forgiving approach to recovery would be enough. Its hard to say though because this board self-selects for players who have probably been at it for many years and thousands of hours and already have about as much practice doing these kinds of difficult maneuvers as anyone can. We may not be the most representational pool of potential players. For that reason Im not wholly against some form of stock autopilot. In fact there are a lot of other applications like longer distance plane and rover treks for which a stock autopilot could be valuable. Maybe there\u0027s a compromise in which its a piloting skill that unlocks after players have already had their hand at landing on a few bodies and put a basic colony together?

The Trajectories mod doesn\u0027t automate anything but is absolutely invaluable for the information it provides. With just the Time-to-Impact and Impact Velocity indicators, you have almost everything you need to perform a close-enough suicide burn anywhere you want.
