It\u0027s just a matter of scaling up to mass production.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd for mass production of antimatter, there\u0027s no location in a given solar system that\u0027s better than a low orbit around the brightest star of that solar system, because the energy needs are SO tremendous that no feasible reactor (or array of reactors that wouldn\u0027t melt your computer) is capable of supplying enough power to result in the ability to create antimatter at a fast enough rate.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAntimatter is NOT an energy SOURCE, nor is is a FUEL. It is an energy STORAGE method, just like the proposed-but-entirely-impractical \u0022Hydrogen Economy\u0022 that bases it\u0027s hydrogen production on electrolysis of seawater (so, where you gonna get all that energy from, huh? That question makes the \u0022hydrogen economy\u0022 proposal fall apart, to my knowledge).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, low orbit around a very bright star. You bet you\u0027re gonna have heat problems.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut what is the machine you dump all that power into anyway? Maybe it\u0027s not an \u0022easy\u0022 answer in the \u0022now I have to build this thing\u0022 way, but it\u0027s an extremely simple concept.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe thing that makes antimatter is a particle accelerator. And it does so at quite low efficiency, which is why you have to dump so much energy into it to get even a tiny (but usable) amount of antimatter out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe energy problem of antimatter is so much of a problem that there\u0027s an entire video game dedicated to it. That game is called Dyson Sphere Program, which is a game similar to Factorio, but set on an interstellar scale. However, because it\u0027s a game, they have sacrificed much realism in the pursuit of good gameplay. In that game, the amount of energy you get out of the fuel for an antimatter power reactor is exactly the same as the amount of energy your dyson sphere produced in order to manufacture antimatter in the first place.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn real life, it is hard to over-state how unfavorable the proportions are.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith particle accelerators that are as efficient as the best we can make IRL, when creating antimatter something like 99.9% of the energy you put into the particle beams is re-emitted as waste heat dumped into the superconducting magnet cooling systems (which then takes even more energy to power the cryo-coolers removing that energy from those superconducting magnet\u0027s cooling baths of cryogenic liquid lightweight gases like liquid helium).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut how big are these particle accelerators going to be, since we\u0027re in orbit and gravity doesn\u0027t have much of an effect? GIGANTIC! You know how CERN\u0027s particle accelerator main ring is around 30km in diameter? The ones that would be in low orbit around the star would probably be on order of 1000 km in diameter. And despite being in the \u0022vacuum\u0022 of space, you\u0027ll still need to have an evacuated beam tube for those particles to pass thru, with another set of either acceleration or steering magnet coils each say 10km of that tube\u0027s length. And now remember that despite being so close to the star, you\u0027re going to need to keep those superconducting magnets cold enough that they remain superconducting. The best \u0022high temperature\u0022 superconductors we have today still need a bath of at least Liquid Nitrogen to become superconductors, and while in Earth Orbit Liquid Nitrogen isn\u0027t that hard to keep liquid (it\u0027s a lot easier than keeping LH2 liquid!), it\u0027s still gonna be plenty hard that close to the star.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the thing that dwarfs the particle accelerator ring itself is gonna be the solar arrays. These are going to be SO MASSIVE that the whole structure will likely be able to support itself against the gravity of the star using just solar wind and solar radiation pressures, or at least it will have to have a guidance system on it that actively compensates for the effects of those forces, because those forces will be massive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut hey if you want a ready large supply of Antimatter, that\u0027s what you have to do to get it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow as far as how to use it, you\u0027d probably have 2 or 3 kinds of drives that use Antimatter:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Solid core Antimatter engine, useful for landers and surface-to-orbit uses:\u003Cbr\u003E\nRuns on Antimatter for fuel (energy source) and Hydrogen (or practically any other liquid resource, with varying specific impulse and thrust depending on which one) as reaction mass, with the antimatter beam being aimed at say a solid block of Tungsten in the \u0022reaction chamber\u0022 of the engine. This is basically an antimatter-thermal engine. Antimatter reacts with matter, that makes more matter get hot, that hot matter heats the reaction mass, the reaction mass is exhausted out a rocket nozzle. Pretty simple to make, pretty simple to control.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is a propulsion system that is most similar to chemical rockets or the best solid-core fission nuclear thermal rockets. Specific impulse is good enough to get you anywhere in the solar system, but it\u0027s gonna take a nice long series of gravity assists and/or a potentialy-even-longer direct Hohmann transfer to get you there. No brachistrchone trajectories here, you\u0027re stuck on the \u0022slow boat\u0022, and normal orbital dynamics still very much dictates just exactly where you can go. However, extremely high thrusts are possible with this system, so it\u0027s ideal for getting things into orbit from the surface, or landing back on the surface from orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Plasma-core Antimatter engine, useful for travel within a solar system. Just like the Solid core one, it takes Antimatter for fuel (energy source), and Hydrogen (or any other liquid resource) as reaction mass. However, in this design there is no intervening block of Tungsten or other high-melting-point material. Instead, the antimatter beam is allowed to directly react with the reaction mass, and the flow of antimatter (and therefore power output) is increased to the point that the reaction mass in the reaction chamber is heated to Plasma temperatures. Magnetic fields are used to create both the reaction chamber and the exhaust nozzle (similar to how the KSP devs have made their Metallic Hydrogen engines work, but with real physics behind it instead of whatever that Metallic Hydrogen stuff is supposed to be). This too is basically a thermal rocket, however because the temperatures are now \u0022plasma hot\u0022 rather than \u0022glowing block of Tungsten\u0022 hot, the specific impulse and thrust are much higher for the same reaction mass flow rate.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs far as \u0022torch drives\u0022 go, this is very much one of those.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile you \u0022could\u0022 use this for a surface-to-orbit or a landing engine, the problem is that you\u0027d glass the launch/landing site with your exhaust, and potentially destroy your own ship with the energy and debris reflected from and kicked up from the surface, therefore there would likely be quite a lot of people getting very upset at you if you did this, potentially including yourself (and I mean \u0022Glass\u0022 as in Halo or WH40K type \u0022glassing\u0022 of planets, \u0022Exterminatus\u0022 style).\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat it\u0027s meant for is use between the planets, and you can for sure do brachistrchone trajectories, in fact with a drive with this much performance you can pretty much ignore the rules of orbital dynamics, since you have so much thrust and specific impulse available.\u003Cbr\u003E\nExpect high thrust, high specific impulse, and long burn times without burning thru your entire propellant tank, but not high enough specific impulse to go truly interstellar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Beam-core Antimatter engine, useful for travel between the stars. Also known as a \u0022pion rocket\u0022 or potentially \u0022mass-energy conversion drive\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf we only get ONE antimatter drive in KSP 2, expect it to be this one.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is the engine you want to use to go to other stars. This engine is also the first antimatter engine that can be classified as \u0022low thrust\u0022, but only in relation to the other two engines. Of interstellar drives, this is probably the one with the highest power output (and therefore highest thrust and specific impulse). After all, if you don\u0027t consider the efficiencies of actually MAKING the dang antimatter, then antimatter drives are pretty dang efficient. The only reason they output so much waste heat is that 0.5% of 1 Terawatt is still a LOT of heat to get rid of in the vacuum of space\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis drive reacts equal parts Hydrogen and Anti-Hydrogen, directed at each other as a pair of colliding low-energy particle beams that intersect directly inside a stupendously large magnetic nozzle (it needs to be large, because the direct product of the reaction of hydrogen and anti-hydrogen is a bunch of Pions and Gamma rays, both of which are extremely hard to direct with a magnetic field. However, pions are short-lived, only traveling a few 10\u0027s or 100\u0027s of meters before they decay into charged particles which can \u0022easily\u0022 be directed with a magnetic field).\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, as for specific impulse, this drive can\u0027t be beat. It\u0027s literally the highest possible specific impulse for any engine that isn\u0027t just a photon rocket (which would have an exhaust velocity of the speed of light, and since matter can\u0027t travel at the speed of light the antimatter drive\u0027s specific impulse will be lower, but not by much).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThrust, not so much. Because of the waste heat problems of most antimatter drives, but especially a Beam-Core antimatter drive, what power you CAN use is directed mostly at accelerating small quantities of matter to nearly the speed of light, which is what you need when going interstellar, but not useful for travel inside a solar system, and you can just forget about trying to launch or land with it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, if you DO accidentally direct the exhaust at the surface of a planet or moon, BAD THINGS HAPPEN. This thing is basically a laser-beam of highly deadly radiation, since guess what hydrogen nuclei traveling at near the speed of light are? They\u0027re cosmic rays. And since they\u0027re going so fast, it\u0027s really hard to shield against this kind of radiation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLead won\u0027t save you this time. Neither will tungsten. Best bet is to be on the other side of the planet, that\u0027s pretty much what it takes. As for what happens on the near-side, it depends on just how close the beam-core antimatter drive is when the exhaust hits the planet, but the least that would happen is the creation of a glowing crater along with the stripping-away of the atmosphere within the area of the exhaust beam (and \u0022beam\u0022 is the right word here, \u0022plume\u0022 assumes that it has sufficient time to spread out a lot, which is not what happens with the exhaust of a beam-core antimatter drive).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo when \u0022playing\u0022 with any interstellar-capable drive system, be responsible, and remember the Kzinti Lesson:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Any spacecraft drive system sufficiently powerful to be interesting is also sufficiently powerful to be easily converted to use as a weapon\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT (again):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I suppose for the sake of completeness, you would likely have a very powerful antimatter power reactor, which allows you to have supply missions supply power to places that don\u0027t have a ready supply of sunlight, fusion fuels, or fissile isotopes (like space stations for example). Antimatter being what it is, this would have to be the most energy-dense \u0022power matter\u0022 type resource in the game (as in joules out per kilogram in), with the antimatter reactors always being smaller and lighter and creating less radiation (aside from Gamma, which can be shielded with a player-supplied Tungsten shadow shield) than any other kind of power reactor for the same power output.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-10T20:36:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2022 08:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAccidentally posted part-way thru composing my post.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-10T20:44:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor \u0022non-end-game\u0022 uses of Antimatter, you could also have the various antimatter-initiated pulse drives, which are like miniature Orion drives that don\u0027t actually need to carry anything that by itself can be used as a nuclear weapon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe principle is that antimatter triggers a Fission detonation, Fusion detonation, or to reduce the amount of antimatter (or increase drive power) even further, a three-stage approach, with a small amount of antimatter triggering a more conventional thermonuclear device (fission-triggered-fusion, with potentially another fission stage on top, like the Tsar Bomb device but minus the high explosives).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll three options are well explored over on the Atomic Rockets website, and despite doing those engines from memory, I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s where I got my info from.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, for the PRODUCTION of antimatter, I pulled my info from the Encyclopedia Galactica, specifically \u003Ca href=\u0022https://orionsarm.com/eg-article/45f0c79d13c29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETHIS page\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
