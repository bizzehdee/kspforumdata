Now, inside the cockpit, I don\u0027t want for players to select the decoration inside ( they can also turn off the decoration), I would like the decoration to be randomized, maybe a book there, or a air freshener. I don\u0027t wont it to be super noticeable, but if you look for it, you can find it. For exterior decoration, first the paint jobs ( probably already going to happen ), second I would like to see small spray painted prefabs ( a kerbal or a rocket or something). Then, I\u0027d like text which would be set to the name of the mission.. Please give your ideas on this subject.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"starcaptain","CreatedById":166799,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-04T18:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen it comes to the cosmetic appearance of things like vessels and bases, I think we\u0027re in store for more of the \u003Ci\u003E\u0022making it up as you go from existing standardized parts\u0022\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0than\u00A0 it will be having some kind of custom shape and color editors.
