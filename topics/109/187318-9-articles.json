The \u0022Breaking Ground\u0022 expansion did something similar, but I would like anomalies to receive the same attention ground based collection receives. Potentially going so far as to include contracts offering large sums of currency to find various anomalies or tourist contracts where you take them to visit pre-discovered ones. I think this would add depth of gameplay to singleplayer as well as another facet to multiplayer space races, with the science and financial gain going to the first player to find the \u0022moon arch\u0022 sorta\u0027 thing. Mods have somewhat attempted these things in the past, but nothing beats having an aspect of the game integrated into it by the developers and a promise to keep it maintained and updated.
