And I agree that yes it would definitely be bad if it behaved as you describe it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot so. All you\u0027d have to do is manually tune f( d, r ) to get the behaviour you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso not true. You can simulate the gravity field as accurately as you want with the improved suggested method a = g( d ) \u002B f( d, r ) (where g = gravitational acceleration exerted by a point mass at the Lagrange point and f( d, r ) is a fudge factor computed from distance\u00A0and orbital angle.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems a lot like adding epicycles on to the geocentric model to make it fit observations, instead of going with a heliocentric model, but in the end you\u0027re getting the same thing. It also ends up being more complicated trying to keep patching over the old model, than to accept the new model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut more importantly, now if you have gravity that varies with angle, not just distance, you can no longer use a conic approximation, the on-rails physics calculations are now shot. The whole point of the SOIs in KSP as it currently is, is to use patched conics, but you can\u0027t use patched conics in this scenario, as conic sections wont work when the net force of gravity (gravity \u002B your fudge force) varies with orbital angle. It should work when physics are active and its calculating gravitational force, velocity, etc, but now because you wanted to avoid n-body physics, you\u0027ve thrown conic approximations out the window, and we can\u0027t put ships on rails. It won\u0027t be as bad as full physics being active, as we can treat the craft as a single part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I think I may see an area we can maybe converge on. I don\u0027t see a need for N-body physics. 3 body physics should be enough: 2 celestial bodies and a craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d be happy ignoring the gravity of the Sun, Moho, Eve, Duna, Jool, Minmus, etc, and just computing the effects of Kerbin and Mun within a certain radius of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen ignore all planets except Kerbin within a certain radius range around Kerbol to have Sun-Kerbin Lagrange points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3-body instead of N-body is fine as long as we don\u0027t have some weird Trinary systems (3 bodies of signicant mass).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe could use an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E system to define which bodies are relevant, and keep it limited to a 3-body system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we put planets on rails, lagrange points won\u0027t work for celestial bodies (you can put bodies at close to L3, 4, and 5 and have it work, but they won\u0027t really be at those points, just close by), and bodies like that could be interesting (like trojan asteroid clusters around L4-L5 of Sun-Jool).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe could put major planets on rails, and some minor moons and asteroids get a simplified 3-body system using defined SOIs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-22T09:54:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2019 09:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efixed a few mistakes to improve clarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-22T09:31:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood points -- and yeah, a 3-body simulation would likely be the best compromise solution.

For example, every mission would necessarily cost funds. What happens if you do a multi-year timewarp on an interstellar mission? Without also automated income, you\u0027ll quickly run out and your space program will die.
