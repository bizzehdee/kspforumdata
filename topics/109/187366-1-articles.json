You can re-create parts that look mostly correct,\u00A0 by \u003Cstrong\u003Ereducing a part to 66% size,\u003C/strong\u003E and slotting it into one of the sizes, .0625m, 1.25m 2.5m, etc. The same should be true for performance, take the engines real-world performance and reduce it by a certain amount to find the \u0022kerbalized\u0022 performance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 As a further illustration, consider the F-1 engine, it is 3.7M in diameter and 1,522,000 LB thrust {SL},\u00A0\u00A0to make it kerbal scale reduce it size to ~66%. So 2.442M\u00A0 which can rounded to 2.5M.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EThrust-wise\u00A0the engines in KSP should be\u00A0\u00A0approx\u00A0 20%\u003C/strong\u003E of the real word counterpart.
