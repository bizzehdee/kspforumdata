You start building a craft, put a scientist on the crew, launch, open map, select target (incase you come back to a save later), try to launch but don\u0027t quite make it. Recover/revert. Tweak craft. Launch. Open map, select target, ... launch ... select target ... launch ... select target ... orbit! Wait, why is there no scientist? Oh, I changed a part and it filled the slot with an engineer?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis would be a trivial piece of UI with a lot of modder potential. For main gameplay it just needs to know a project name (\u0022Kerpollo\u0022, \u0022Kermini\u0022, etc), perhaps a primary body and/or some kind of mission type (flight, science, construction, etc) that can help check one or more specific type of crew are aboard when you fly. Modders might extend this to let you choose specific goals/missions to complete or whatever, let you add project patches...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut somewhere in the UI you\u0027d have a way of saying \u0022hey, this is the Project I\u0027m working on\u0022 and the game could do things like set your target based on the current project. Help you group vehicles/launches together (on the map, only show me Project Kemini vehicles, e.g).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-12T18:46:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a \u0022mission planner\u0022 being added to the game already.
