That alignment indicator mod is incredibly useful and yet so incredibly simple, it amazes me that it isn\u0027t baked into the game in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- A deeper, more meaningful tech tree that requires more than just grabbing \u0027science\u0027 and buying new stuff with it in the R\u0026amp;D Department- put specific goals in place like flying a crewed mission to the Mun and back, launch a craft into interstellar space, create a space station around Kerbin\u00A0etc. and create a more conventional path to space that puts uncrewed probes and satellites before crewed missions rather than flying crewed rockets literally from day 1. I\u0027d also like to see more things to do with planes and more of an emphasis on spaceplanes as satellite launch vehicles, plus micro/cube sats:\u00A0think of the little school-Kerbals\u0027 faces when they see the little cube sat they built in engineering class floating above Kerbin (and the boost to your reputation for giving it a piggy-back ride during your latest 100 ton orbital launch);\u00A0either that, or scatter a thousand of them in the upper atmosphere and then sit back and watch the show!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- More commercial options to run your space project commercially- get contracts to launch pre-built payloads into specific options, develop commercial rockets and run a business to get more money and greater prestige which in turn could boost the exploration side of things (and maybe some tech tree nodes could require a specific number of successful contracts/launches to complete or something like launch/return/relaunch the same ship a la Space-X). Do deals with the various suppliers to get their parts at a discount by limiting your use of a rival\u0027s products- this would require some partially redundant parts so there was enough overlap to be viable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Other space agencies operating at the same time. Kerbin needs a space race, and there\u0027s nothing like a bit of competition to drive innovation and push the boundaries! Other agencies could compete with you for commercial contracts, race you to achieve specific milestones first or even team up to launch joint or complementary missions like the ISS or US-European missions. Baikerbanur, Woomerang and Dessert Launch Site could become the HQ for rival space programmes, new sites could be created in places where there isn\u0027t much happening on Kerbin and you could have the embarrassing situation of landing your cutting-edge reusable booster on a rival\u0027s base instead of yours and they\u0027d steal the designs! This would also work as an introduction to multiplayer games, could easily be disabled if you don\u0027t want them and combined with the more commercial side of things above would give you something to fill the time as your rover flies for 300 days to Duna or you wait for Jool to be in the right place to do a transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- More science! I don\u0027t just mean more things to staple on the side of a ship- more deployed science modules (breaking ground has a total of 4 different experiments, and you can only use 3 at a time because one needs an atmosphere and another needs no atmosphere), long-term activities for crewed missions, anomalous sensor readings to investigate and so on plus some real life experiments such as the Hayabusa-2 comet sampler and hypothetical future missions such as a submarine for exo-oceans, whether on the surface or buried beneath it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Backstory and plot! There\u0027s no information on how KSP came into being and virtually nothing about Kerbal society in general except the little snippets you find in missions and the agency summaries within them. There\u0027s also plenty of stuff to talk about- where did those monoliths/that Arctic UFO/the pyramids and stone face on Duna come from? What made that huge crater on Kerbin? Why does Eve have oceans when it\u0027s over 400 Kelvin on its surface, and so many craters when it has such a thick atmosphere? Having some kind of story running through the game would also produce more events that could be required for research nodes on the tech tree, a better grounding for rival space agencies and suppliers plus\u00A0a greater role for the characters in the game, whether that\u0027s the astronauts themselves or the rest of the team e.g. Gene or Wehrner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- An expanded set of stock parts. Shiny new super-tech aside, there are still plenty of gaps in the parts catalogue of KSP that various mods have tried to fill out, and which KSP 2 would benefit from filling as standard: the 0.625m parts category is almost empty with just one stackable engine and one fuel tank (and a handful of little plane parts but I\u0027m mostly talking rockets here), even with the addition of the new Mite and Shrimp boosters, and very few other parts that actually fit into that footprint (I think the QBE is the only probe core that a 0.625m heat shield actually covers completely); there are a lot of missing parts in the 1.875m size bracket too including a probe core(!), battery, reaction wheel, parachute and a short rocket engine like the Terrier that can be used for landers. There\u0027s one nuclear engine, one ion thruster and only one set of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters which are too big for small satellites and too small to control big spacecraft/stations without using lots of them and bumping the part count really high. There\u0027s a sizeable opening for a set of space station parts- habitations, experiment modules/labs, life support modules and size adapters and/or a larger hub module. I\u0027d also like to see Mk2 plane holds actually able to carry a 1.25m payload with some parts stuck on the outside without those parts sticking through the aircraft\u0027s skin and getting stuck when the doors open, and likewise a Mk3 cargo hold that you can a) load stuff in the ramp more easily and b) actually launch 2.5m parts without the same problems the Mk2 stuff has, plus a Mk1 cargo hold for small payloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Performance and visuals. After putting together a large mission containing five probes bristling with science parts all attached to a single big craft that was purely for propulsion (admittedly with a few parts from mods) I started what was supposed to be a 1 hour burn, had breakfast, did some household chores, went shopping, had lunch and came back nearly 5 hours later and it still hadn\u0027t finished, but was now\u00A0noticeably off course and would miss the target planet completely. First of all, the game was running super-slowly with 1 second of game time lasting 4-5 seconds of real time even though my PC can cope with pretty much every game I\u0027ve thrown at it on maximum graphics settings. I\u0027ve seen the same thing on space stations and large spaceships so either some mods have really poor optimisation, or else the game itself isn\u0027t using the available hardware efficiently. The second problem was that the result of the maneuver didn\u0027t match what it said it would do, possibly due to using an efficient but low thrust engine. Since KSP 2 promises interstellar travel, this issue could become exponentially worse if using more conventional parts (like the Dawn ion thruster) to go interstellar. Making the maneuver editor take your craft\u0027s size and thrust into consideration in more ways than just the time taken to do a specific maneuver would hopefully improve accuracy for long-distance travel, and adding the ability to do time warps while maneuvering, or switch vessels and continue the burn, would be a huge time saver.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve also tried a variety of visual enhancement mods as the stock graphics look underwhelming especially in orbit/map view, will noticeably sharpen up as I fly over or switch back from map view and in some cases will create strange squares where shadows/sea/surface of Jool won\u0027t render correctly/at all, and the new graphics in v1.8 made the game crash every other time I switched to a vessel on the Mun or Minmus but looked really nice when it didn\u0027t.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWithout the need to maintain any backwards compatibility to existing players with older or less capable devices and with the option of pushing the required specs up to take advantage of modern hardware, KSP 2 could look so much better straight out of the box with clouds, weather, high-definition terrain and features and much more. If the trailer and demo videos were anything to go by, things look promising in this area!\u003Cbr\u003E\nA related point is the appearance of parts in the game, specifically the variants of those parts- or lack of them! I want to see a fully custom paint system for most parts or at the very least an expanded set of stock paints based on real rockets that aren\u0027t from NASA in the 1950s/60s- there are plenty to choose from! The stock parts often don\u0027t match each other properly (1.875m parts are really bad for this, they look completely different despite using the same hex codes for their colours) and many parts (3.75m tanks, oscar-b and the little orange fuel tanks etc) are lacking in variation. A fully custom paint scheme would make your spacecraft distinctive, would tie in to the commercial stuff above as a kind of branding (which would also make ship-sharing on the forums/steam better to look at) and to me would be a valuable addition to the game. Some of the gameplay demo videos and the images on the KSP2 steam page have brightly coloured fuel tanks, but I\u0027m not sure if that was just to show what type of fuel was in them e.g. some kind of nuclear fuel, maybe?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally- it\u0027s better to release later with all the features fully working and tested as much as they feasibly can before releasing additional features at a later date than to release it early or rush everything into version 1.0 and end up with a really buggy and glitchy game that lets everyone down, followed by a series of hasty patches or removing certain features that didn\u0027t work. I\u0027ll wait a few more months for a more polished product (but if you\u0027re looking for a beta tester, I\u00A0have some experience doing that and I actually do software testing as a job\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-23T22:28:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA proper day/night skybox transition is high on my list.

The improvement that it gives is IMO only really noticeable in mostly still scenes with specific lighting situations. The current tech works well enough for \u0022suspension of disbelief\u0022 purposes. I plan on getting an RTX 2070 within the next few months, so I\u0027ll have a card that supports it, however if KSP 2 has ray tracing but turning it on kills the frame rate even on a card that supports it, I\u0027ll turn it off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, there are many other performance benefits to be had that don\u0027t even need a switch to DX12. Two that come to mind are \u0022don\u0027t hold the graphics textures in system RAM after you sent them to the graphics card\u0022, and \u0022Only send textures to the graphics card when they are needed\u0022. Both of those are pretty much standard practice in video game design, and for good reason. The first one is just an oversight in the coding of the original KSP, and fixing it will massively reduce RAM usage. The second one is called \u0022load on demand\u0022 and it can introduce some small amount of stutter, but I doubt it would be much more than we currently get when a craft loads in to physics range (unless the craft has modded parts that use giant textures for some reason. That would cause significant stutter, but that\u0027s a problem with the parts, not the game).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Polnoch","CreatedById":153066,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-30T02:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223711286\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187318\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221575045511\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, SciMan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, ray tracing isn\u0027t magic.
