Setting up the ability to create even basic rockets on a distant planet should be a challenge in itself, and a fun new part of gameplay (especially multiplayer). People spend hundreds of hours in a game with block graphics building factories, why not\u00A0in KSP? I understand that the core competency of KSP is building ships, I get that. But KSP2 can be more without ruining the core Kerbal experience (especially since the core experience has been core for about a decade).This means making things a bit more involved. No more magic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E the size of a van to produce unlimited fuel for operations. \u00A0 Once a colony with appropriate construction facilities reaches a certain point, it can build craft to a much lower tech level (maybe unique designs optimized for construction in spartan locations)\u00A0than would be capable on Kerbin. This will keep the level of challenge and interest up as Kerbals expand through the star systems. Exploring new planets with a ufo-grade supership isn\u0027t challenging and cheapens the experience.

Really think a feature like this would keep science relevant through to the endgame regardless of TT completion. It would\u00A0be useful in navigating new planets.\u00A0It would set up an intelligent, realistic, and fun approach to discovering new bodies. Finally, it would feel like actual science as opposed to just feeling like a quest line for getting new parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously there should also be a reworking in science point rewards in regard to how far out one has gone from their home system. Perhaps a per planet/celestial body exponential decay in science points received. Make it so in general experiments yield less science and for instance, lets say there are 1000 total science points to be rewarded from Kerbin if every experiment is completed. How about after 40% or so completion the player ends up having 80% or so of all the science points and the next lie 30% or something gets you another 10% of the total available points etc...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would make it so grinding out all the science experiments on a body doesn\u0027t yield a player a ridiculously teched out civ but most of the points are accumulated quickly and the player is incentivized to expand further for more science. This is a very rough idea but I think I\u0027ve said enough on it for people to get the jist of what I\u0027m saying. Science for fun would still be incentivised via wanting to fill out the in game database for those who enjoy a rewarding full completion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223783318\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022193765\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221589130729\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184633\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TLTay\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, TLTay said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETech Tree:\u003C/strong\u003E A civilization-wide level of technological attainment.

That or\u00A0this would probably just lead to players save scumming experiment results. Also removing the weight/bulk of experiments would then undercut the difficulty of the missions themselves. After the initial learning curve of learning basic rocket science/orbital mechanics the object is to create better rocket. Mid-late game the learning curve is about getting the same payload further or a larger payload the same distance. So removing the payload aspect kind of kills that dynamic and I cant see people being happy with the idea of weightless perfectly convenient (as if non-existent) experiments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223783318\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022193765\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221589130729\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184633\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TLTay\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, TLTay said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnowledge of planets must be earned.
