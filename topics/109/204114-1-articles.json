There is a ton of redundancy in the part lineup between the stock parts and MH. Intercept has said they will be removing the redundancy of parts when porting the KSP1 parts to KSP2. It would make sense to take the better of the redundant parts and port them. So we can possibly see some of the MH parts in KSP2, but not all of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-30T17:34:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be nice, but I\u0027m also optimistic that\u00A0 what they will end up giving us will cover all the functional bases and also make everything we\u0027ve had so far look like it was found lying by the side of the road.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
