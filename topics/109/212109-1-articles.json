One thing that has always made me smile is the way that the game\u0027s developers have named the Kerbals after famous astronauts and scientists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there is one name that I feel is missing from the game - \u0022Kerbalist Kerman\u0022. This name is a play on words, referring to the fact that many Kerbal Space Program players have a tendency to crash their rockets, and the resulting ballistic trajectory that their Kerbals experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that \u0022Kerbalist Kerman\u0022 would be a great addition to the game, and would fit perfectly with the game\u0027s style and sense of humor. As a fan of the game, I would like to request that the developers consider adding this name to the upcoming release of Kerbal Space Program 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am confident that many other players would also appreciate this addition to the game. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to seeing \u0022Kerbalist Kerman\u0022 in Kerbal Space Program 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
