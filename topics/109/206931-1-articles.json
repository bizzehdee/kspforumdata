I agree that by dint of trying sooner or later you succeed in the intent, but personally I think that while docking to a vessel in orbit is a difficult concept to learn, but that then becomes easy once you understand the mechanism. landing more or less precisely in one point is equally difficult to learn, but equally difficult to master, as there are many variables that can make landing go wrong, because it depends on external factors, which are not there in orbit, because in fact, the tracking of an orbit does not undergo variations because there are no external forces, in the atmosphere there are external forces (such as friction in ksp 1 and in 2 probably there will also be other atmospheric conditions) that affect the trajectory\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-17T14:01:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm generally in agreement that really good trajectories and some recovery mechanic gets players close enough for horseshoes early and they can refine over time.
