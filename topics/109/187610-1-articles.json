We still haven\u0027t heard of it before last week, so it is probably safe to say that none of our suggestions will be heeded for the final game. At least, not in a way where we can ask the devs to significantly change direction. That said, there are plenty of reasons to work our collective hivemind into imagining what alternative game systems would look like, to detail them, to find what the problems would be, and how useful the idea\u0027s are when implemented. The goal of this thread is to go into detail about game systems that could have been different in KSP 2. As for the plenty of reasons of why this execrise could be useful; any future development of any ksp game in any capacity could have the benefit of having the players already figured out how the game could/needs to be improved in a detailed way. It becomes easier to implement something if it has a vision,\u00A0 it becomes easier to implement something that has its kinks worked out, and it becomes easier to implement something that has community support behind it. And maybe, just maybe, good ideas can move the current devs to make changes before the release..... (who knows)\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n_______\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter having read the KSP masterpost, I\u0027m convinced that player focus gameplay systems will be essential in KSP2. Why is difficult to explain, and multiple aspects of of the announced game come into play here. So let me summarise the thoughts I\u0027ve seen on those aspects, and how they tie into player focus. This is to explain my opinion, and aviod starting this discussion from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EInterstellar travel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with interstellar travel is that it takes a long time without FTL, but no-one wants FTL because it is scientifically unrealistic. Three nuances: 1) bases become stepping stones that reduce travel time. 2) the speed of light can be different in the KSP universe, as can the scale of the interstellar distances and 3) sci-fy engines can be more powerful, and get up to higher speeds than might be theoretically possible in real life. Currently many KSP-missions go like this: launch, spend time executing the mission, start over. The result is spending lots of ingame time on interstellar travel. Some in the masterthread noticed this already in interplanetary travel, and I think this will be worse when you go amongst the stars. A logical way to go around this is to be able to set a craft on an interstellar trajectory, put up a manouvre node, and let it be while you operate the rest of your space program. At some point, it will be time to switch back to your interstellar craft and finish the mission. \u003Cstrong\u003EHowever to do this practically, you need ways to keep track of all of it, in a way that doesn\u0027t make your head scream.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELife support and Bases\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother aspect comes with bases. Basically it comes down to the question of \u0022how much do I need to do in order to sustain it\u0022. I personally think it\u0027s easy to both go overboard and go underboard with this. A game that simulates the difficulties of space flight cannot neglect something like life support, but many players would correctly moan about micromanagement if you need to keep babysitting every colony constantly. \u003Cstrong\u003ESo ideally, you\u0027d like to be able to bring a colony in a stable state, at which point you can divert your attention. \u003C/strong\u003EIn connection to this, certain bases might require getting materials from other places. Supply ships from home, or resource gathering missions from base. \u003Cstrong\u003EBut then again, you don\u0027t want to keep flying these missions. again, attention. \u003C/strong\u003EMaybe the solution is to fly the mission once, and set up that the game does this automatically for the future, but that is just an initial idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this are the main reasons why I think KSP needs systems to, well, actually manage your space program. But then again, most of us probably wouldn\u0027t want it to become a space program tycoon game. So tere are questions to be answered: what is the proper simplicty of the system? of it\u0027s UI? does this need to be worked into certain game modes, and do we have progression into the tools we have at our disposal. Are there other systems needed in this regard, and how would they work.
