Determinism issue are denoted with a star :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*in order to have an accurate prediction, all the mechanics involved have to be deterministic.

Under patched conics, you mostly only need to know the position upon changing SOIs, which should be manageable (mostly because you still need to be careful about precision and determinism in the way you reconstruct the trajectory from a single point). But if you want anything more than patched conics, problems start arising... And KSP2 has already promised binary stars and planets, so they might do away with patched conics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo explain with an example, let\u0027s look at 2 potential paradoxes that can arise with asynchronous multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst example, two players, A and B, want to grab the same asteroid. A makes a quick and dirty maneuver, time warp and grab the asteroid. B plan an interception which should occur sooner than A\u0027s. What happen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnswer : A \u0022wins\u0022, B cannot interact with the asteroid. As soon as A coordinates the meteorites time with his own, B sees it as a history ghost. If he was already targeting it, he gets a message.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorkaround? This is not really an issue with the system itself, as players are supposed to be cooperating, but limitations on who is able to change the time of neutral object can help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond example : two players, A and B, doing unrelated missions. 10 years in the future, A grabs fuel at a station depot to go to Eve. 1 year in the future, B tries to get fuel from the same station depot. What happens?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnswer, B cannot access the station 1 year in the future as the station\u0027s time is 10 years after A interacts with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorkaround? This example shows the limit of this model : commonplaces (stations and colonies) cannot easily be shared, and the order in which players interact with them heavily influences what is possible to do. B is rightfully frustrated because he could have taken the fuel from the station and refuel it before A even needs it. As it happens, there is a workaround for this particular example, but it requires not only cooperation, but also that the players know what they are doing (and even then, they are limited):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of docking directly to the station, A can detach a tanker from the station in the present, and dock with it 10 years in the future. In turn, B can send a new tanker to the station in the present (right after A interacted with it) and use it 1 year later. It is not entirely perfect as B might have wanted to first take fuel then send a tanker, but at this point, it is a matter of cooperation : A should have refueled the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyFall2489","CreatedById":216984,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-01T00:26:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor sure, I think single player should be a valid option, and the implementation or removal of multiplayer features should not affect single player as well.

Both of these could be solved though (add a special case for rendezvous and for transfers, the warped trajectory will un-warp itself as you approach the transfer window, or just don\u2019t show the trajectory until you are at the transfer window) and the game would be a lot more fun, seeing all player actions in real time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyFall2489","CreatedById":216984,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-05T16:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/213541-t_v/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022213541\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/213541-t_v/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@t_v\u003C/a\u003E, How exactly would you ad a special case?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does seem like a great idea, but the implementation will be a nightmare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-05T17:13:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, I\u0027ll start by saying that if I can find a mediocre solution in a short time, the devs can find a good solution over the development process.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main problems with rendezvousing under the current system are\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) rendezvousing is reduced to matching orbits with the other craft and then time warping until you reach it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) rendezvousing in the normal way (when the other craft is not yours, I think time warping should warp all of your craft forwards, not just the one you are controlling) is impossible because the other craft will not warp to the rendezvous point when you warp there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy really bad solution is to have a ghost version of the other craft warp (you would have to set it as a target to get it to warp maybe? Or not, because then there are loopholes) and you would plan and execute the rendezvous normally, but when you got within range of the other craft, your craft will pop into the place where the other craft is. This only applies for rendezvousing when you are in the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and both orbiting. If you both launch a Mun mission and warp to the Mun, the rendezvous rules only apply when both players have a stable orbit around the Mun. The experience would be like regular rendezvousing and the only unfortunate difference would be that visually, your craft jumps from one point in its orbit to another, so if you are rendezvousing on the night side and the craft is on the day side it would look bad.
