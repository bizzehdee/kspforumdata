You seem to think that just by adding LS it\u0027s going to be automagically cooler and more fun and more challenging, rather than just more tedious or more trivial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI.e. you haven\u0027t thought this through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that if not done correctly, this could very easily end up being tedious. Which is why I gave the suggestions about using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and future-tech advanced closed loop systems to find a reasonably realistic way to incorporate life support without a constant need for supply missions once you have the appropriate technical foundation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s an interesting way to define trivial. Doesn\u0027t everything on a rocket boil down to mass in one way or another? From my perspective, the whole EC system is a life support analog for probes and science that follows this progression (early game you only have the dinky battery in the probe/capsule which greatly limits your range more than anything else, later you get batteries (and fuel cells if the tech tree wasn\u0027t such a mess) but not solar panels so you need to add a bunch of extra mass for longer duration missions, then you get solar panels (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E) and finally the infinite energy RTGs). I don\u0027t see players complaining about being bound by this system despite literally not being able to turn it off without cheats, and becoming fairly trivial once solar panels show up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutomation would be interesting (for more than just life support), but I agree with your assessment that it would necessitate the need to add whole new frameworks and systems to the game to support it that might take too much dev time and focus away from other aspects of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main game design challenge I see here is balance. Mods have already shown multiple ways this can be done from a technical standpoint, and unless there\u0027s something wonky going on with KSP2 I don\u0027t see the programming implementation being the main challenge for life support (outside of automation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve spent plenty of time thinking this through, and based on the way I play the game and having played with life support mods I find that it adds an interesting design challenge for manned missions where I need to consider the mission duration and make sure I\u0027ve got enough supplies, or a plan to resupply en route. Just to be clear, I agree that it\u0027s also fun to play the game without life support if I\u0027m just messing around or have a specific building challenge in mind where I don\u0027t want to deal with life support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe case for having life support being implemented as an official feature (like the comms network was) vs just relying on mods largely comes down to game balance. Right now manned missions are not well balanced vs probes, and a life support system could serve as a very good balance for this, not to mention how much better an official feature integrates with the rest of the game over mods. Like I\u0027ve said before, I\u0027ve always thought that the dev\u0027s reluctance to add life support even as a difficulty option to be a strange, glaring omission, especially given they put the effort into implementing an official comms network feature which only added more difficulty and complexity to the game and necessitated a lot more planning for probe missions (with manned missions being largely unaffected, further exacerbating the balance issue between probes vs manned).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately, it sounds like we need to agree to disagree. You\u0027ve stated your assumptions (which if I\u0027m understanding correctly are that there\u0027s no good way to implement life support that would be worthwhile, and you keep seeming to assume that everyone will be forced to use it and haven\u0027t acknowledged that it could be a toggleable difficulty option for players who don\u0027t care for it), and my assumptions are that if implemented well (following the logic from my suggestions to have tech available to refill life support without a lifeline back to Kerbin), it would add interesting and fun new challenges to manned missions, make the game more realistic given how big of an issue life support continues to be for RL long-duration missions, and serve as a good gameplay balance to the currently \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
