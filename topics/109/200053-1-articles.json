I doubt it\u0027d be super fun managing Kerbal\u0027s radiation exposure when ship parts already block radiation, sewage removal just sounds like a tedious thing to do once and forget about it, and handling trash sounds like a boring chore. If the automated supply missions are a thing, I see no reason why automated sewage treatment (in a special part for sewage treatment, of course) shouldn\u0027t be done automatically, same thing with trash management.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe others sound much more fun. Playing with radioactive waste sounds like a great source of content for those YouTubers who like to torture their videogames. Sending rovers to measure water levels to make sure the planet is habitable sounds interesting and a good reason to have probe cores. I would love a progression with the power systems, from wind to geothermal. Imagine hydroelectric turbine parts that have to be deep underwater to work! A special greenhouse dome for hydroponics or algae or just a generic \u0022snacks\u0022 resource would be a good looking part to keep on your base\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is how complicated you want to make it. I feel like there should just be a few main resources: Water, Oxygen, Snacks, and Material. All do what they sound like- water is consumed and used for irrigation, oxygen is used to breath, snacks are snacked on, and material are used for in-colony VABs because I doubt you would need to deal with Kerbin-side part contractors shipping parts to space. Greenhouses on the higher end of the tech tree could produce oxygen as well as snacks, and water recyclers would be a late-game option so you don\u0027t have to spend material on ice-mining rovers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the topic of nuclear waste: I think it should be a very late-game problem that most players won\u0027t have to deal with. Nuclear reactors last years with a small amount of fuel, and produce massive amounts of power. Advanced designs also produce very little waste. Full-blown reactors would be able to power your entire colony while producing little waste and not having any serious downsides other than having to dump waste material into a crater somewhere. They would need to be balanced, like needing a large amount of water and a backup generator to run or risk going offline, because otherwise it would take the entire challenge of energy generation out of building and managing a colony.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the subject of energy generation... how do we feel about long-distance energy transfer with heating lasers and things? Imagine a tidally locked planet close to it\u0027s star. Once you\u0027ve set up solar farms there, you could fire high-powered lasers at a colony on another planet as a form of energy generation. That would also facilitate structures like Dyson swarms and other fun megaprojects.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor water gettin\u0027 and storage, I feel like you could use normal drills used for getting material. If you drill in an area with ice, it sends ice into your ore tanks that can be sent back to your colony and melted to be filtered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s just my two cents, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: Keep it simple with just a few resources, and keep automation high so it doesn\u0027t become a chore simulator instead of a space exploration game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-03T21:07:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2021 09:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Kernel Kraken\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpelling errors, punctuation.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-03T22:10:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m on the side of **not** wanting to manage my colonies basic needs.
