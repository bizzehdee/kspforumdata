Microsoft actually has a Smart Delivery program that lets you publish your game for XBox One and Series X as a single SKU. It\u0027s basically counted as a single game on your XBox account, and it will download appropriate version for the correct system. We\u0027re yet to see if Sony has anything similar planned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is going to be far less change in hardware between generations this time around. We still get substantial performance upgrades, but the core architecture stays the same. The shift from Cell/Xenon to Jaguar during last generation meant backwards compatibility was hard to achieve and even ports had to be rebuilt to fit new consoles. This isn\u0027t the case this time around. All four consoles in both generations from both Sony and Microsoft are built on AMD x64 technology. So the amount of work necessary to make games cross-generation is comparatively small.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is made further true in KSP2 case, because it is built on top of Unity engine. Almost all of the platform specifics are going to be handled by Unity. Odds are, the PS4/XB1 version of KSP2 will just build for PS5/SX if you simply select that build target in Unity when exporting the game. Naturally, to take full advantage of new capabilities, some additions will need to be made. Primarily in UI, social/match-making features for multiplayer, and graphics. At a minimum, you\u0027ll probably want higher resolution textures for next gen. But the team might want to also adjust things like LoD settings, vegetation and rock densities on planets, and other little improvements to the look of the game. This kind of work isn\u0027t exactly free, but it can be handled by a small group of devs, as it doesn\u0027t actually involve remaking content.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
