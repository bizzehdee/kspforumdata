Its interesting they\u2019re holding resources back till a later update because I imagine the biggest limitation will be raw materials. When colonies are first introduced we\u2019ll be able to go hog wild. What interests me most at the moment is the kit of parts. We\u2019ve seen several very old renderings and the composition of the parts doesn\u2019t seem altogether congruous, from the collection of pill-shaped hab modules and domes to the stacks of variably shaped building-mass pieces. I quite like the more modular look that we saw in the trailer and some renderings, but the blocky stuff looks a little like the facade of a hospital? I\u2019ll be very interested to see how the aesthetics of that have improved over the last couple years. Out of the gate Id love to be able to control how its fenestrated, to right click on exterior wall panels and swap out for solid panels or windows or other variants. \u00A0And while I would like to engineer these larger masses it kind of begs the question: is this habitation space?

We\u2019ve seen these grids of piers holding everything up but are there limits to how tall they can be as components? Are they procedural? Can you lay them out in a custom way or is it always on-grid? Are there other truss members we can use and how do they attach? Can I make a huge dome and then build things inside of it? Another thing that would be cool would be exterior gangways and ladders with safety cages so you could build bridges and climb around them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-06T15:19:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2022 03:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoldForest","CreatedById":77770,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-06T15:04:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224196100\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210473\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221667746275\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223516\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wheehaw Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, Wheehaw Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019ll depend on what you can use the colonies for. \u00A0I\u2019m really looking forward to interstellar. \u00A0I expect my first play through is going to be all about quickly getting the tech and the infrastructure so that I can launch to the new systems, and once I get there, building the infrastructure so that I can give them a nice comfy thorough exploring.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI expect I\u2019ll spend more time building more and larger bases in the new systems than I will in the Kerbol system. \u00A0I\u2019ve got 3K hours plus into Kerbol. \u00A0The new horizons are calling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Then again, the M\u00FCn, Duna, and Laythe really deserve more colonization than KSP1 permits and with the new graphics the colonies are likely to be very easy on the eyes indeed\u2026)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be much easier to launch an interstellar mission from around Jool/Laythe anyway, considering that Daedalus will probably use H2 or H3 as fuel.

They have said there\u0027s going to be basic statics and physics on these things which means if you go really tall and spindly it\u0027s probably going to get some weird wobbly behavior. Having the ability to use cable stays like a radio tower would open up a lot more design space than purely compressive systems.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe building above is called the Blur Building by Diller \u002B Scofidio for the 2002 world expo in switzerland. They mounted thousands of high pressure nozzles on it to create a big cloud around it floating over the lake. Its bonkers. I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll be able to do anything like that, but the structure is a great demonstration of how useful cables could be. I think they could be attached the same way struts are in KSP1?
