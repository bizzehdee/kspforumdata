In my version of multiplayer, the way these processing crises are avoided is quite simple. A players vessels are not present in your game until your games are \u0022merged\u0022. Until then, maybe you just see colonys, but you can\u0027t interact with them. This is difficult to explain, but this is the way I see it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadmeat24","CreatedById":173932,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-26T00:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want to say I have solved the problem with time warp, because I am sure my idea has some flaws. But I have spent a lot of time thinking about it and would love to have them pointed out because I have reached the point where I can\u0027t see them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea is that in multiplayer when performing a mission you would do it in a sort of \u0022pre-planning\u0022 mode. Almost like the game within the game. This would allow any warping/reverting wanted, as it is not actually taking place in the \u0022real world\u0022 until you tell the game that you are done with the mission.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have the mission planned out and executed in the simulation world. The pilot or computer would perform it in the real world automatically. We already know some form of automated flight is coming with automated colony supply runs so I imagine this would not be too difficult to implement. From there you can warp ahead if all the players agree, work on another mission, whatever you want. It doesn\u0027t cause an issue as the missions are first executed in the simulation where you can stop warping for maneuvers, and in the real world the maneuvers are automated and can be warped through.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne problem I have already solved would be for instance if two people are trying to send a rocket to a station around Jool and\u00A0 person A gets the mission done quicker, arriving say 14 days before. When person B did the simulation, the dock was not occupied, however that has changed. The way to avoid this is to implement some sort of alert if at any point in the mission, including in the future portion of the flight,\u00A0 a craft not present during the simulation version is in close proximity. It would then give the option to resimulate the problematic portion of the flight with the new craft simulated and change things, OR it would continue to move forward as if nothing had changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf player B chose the option to change things, in this case the end of the flight, player B could put the craft into a parking orbit in order to wait for player A to plan a mission to leave. If player B knew that player A was going to leave a couple days after arrival, he could select the option to continue anyways. Player A would leave after 2 days and the dock would be open prior to the already planned arrival of player B\u0027s craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis method allows people to play out their missions still, and makes it so that nobody has to wait on anybody else in order to do another mission. It also allows for time warp as long as everybody is ok with warping for a bit. It\u0027s not perfect, as waiting may occasionally be necessary. But at least the waiting isn\u0027t blocking you from doing other things to avoid timeline paradox problems or being warped into the moon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel this is a good compromise between the \u0022everyone can do what they want\u0022 dmp method which CAN result in paradoxes (you cannot convince me it doesn\u0027t as I have used dmp before), and the \u0022lowest voted time warp\u0022 method which would result in unproductive waiting periods while one person does a moon landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen the time warp issue become heated at times so again I am looking for CONSTRUCTIVE criticism of my idea. I think both of the \u0022mainstream\u0022 ideas have their flaws so don\u0027t come in here saying \u0022way A is best, way B does not work\u0022 please just point out problems with my idea, \u0022way C\u0022 if you wish, that I can solve.

Essentially, in flight gear, you can control your flow of time with no impact on anyone else, so if you speed up 2x then your plane flies twice as fast but you will be passing by planes flying at normal speed. This has the advantage that at any given time, if a player has done something all other players can see that thing an interact with it. You can also set up infrastructure much faster in game time as you don\u2019t have to warp to a point where your friend has set up a supply route to build your next mission, you can simply start building your next mission even though your friend took 2000 in game years to set up that route.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(the craft that would be affected by your warp would be the craft that have your kerbals in them, when offline players crafts would be frozen in a parking orbit and when a craft has kerbals of multiple players in them and both players are online, the craft unfreezes and warps at the lowest warp between the two players)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problems I found with that were immediate. First, the less completely game breaking ones: you can warp ahead to rendezvous with a craft that is not warping, sort of negating proper rendezvous, unless that craft is yours. Second you can \u201Crace\u201D to the moon and win by just being more aggressive with time warp. Next, the game breaking bugs: how would positioning even work? If a craft heads off to duna and warps to reach to, for them duna has moved considerably for them but not for you, otherwise nobody would ever be able to execute transfers. Where does that ship display in the system? Where it is relative to kerbin, duna, the star, or something else? This quickly becomes more complicated the more scenarios you think about and it becomes a game of cat and mouse to try to reach a ship that is skittering unpredictably across the system. Although, once your friend is in an orbit of duna, their ship should behave normally and show around duna, although duna is still at the transfer window for you. This sort of thing is fine for causal players who just want to mess around but breaks reality so badly (but look ma, no causality issues!) that most people would not be able to accept it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-11T22:15:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing to consider in multiplayer is who controls what. I hope that it is not just whoever built the craft/colony controls it and others cannot control or influence it. My personal preference would be a system where each player controls a group of kerbals and can control whatever craft those kerbals have access to. So, to control a craft you would need a Kerbal in a command pod and not just a passenger module, and to reap science you could share a lab with one other player. That way, you could edit maneuver nodes while the other player executes them or do the flying while the other player(s) manage the ship. In colonies, you could chose how many kerbals of each player\u0027s type to produce whenever more population is created, and cooperatively manage colonies. In probes, you could share control of the probe by selecting the player as a controller in flight. However, you could also lock colonies, vessels, and probes to only be controllable by you, so that you can keep your infrastructure safe from hijackers rendezvousing with your stuff and taking it over.

Holiday event or not. In fact, making a holiday event is ALSO something that will be ignored by a section of your users.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis might not be a bad thing on a game where you have something like 100k simultaneous users (like a big MMO or something like Destiny 2). I would bet a large sum of money that KSP 2 will not have that kind of popularity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor that reason, IMO those kind of things should not be developed until well after the game has launched, and the developers have been able to gauge if the community would appreciate (or tolerate) such things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still think that multiplayer for KSP 2 should focus on \u0022small groups\u0022 of 2-8 players at a time maximum, playing what\u0027s essentially \u0022co-op\u0022, with no such thing as a separate \u0022co-op save\u0022 and \u0022single player save\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I mean by that is that you should absolutely be able to do something like take your existing single player save, and invite a friend into it. You should ALSO be able to take an existing co-op save, and run it with just one person (without losing the ability to pilot ANY of the vessels, no matter who \u0022owns\u0022 them when playing co-op, if that\u0027s even a thing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be totally drop-in and drop-out as seamlessly as possible (I guess it\u0027s fine if it needs to re-load the scene).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere should NOT BE ANY \u0022ownership\u0022 of vessels, that results in \u0022I can\u0027t control this because I don\u0027t own it\u0022. That\u0027s the simplest way to make it so you can make meaningful use of stations set up by other players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as controlling destructive behaviour, there should be an easy to use kick/ban system, and players should NOT be able to join freely just because you have your session \u0022open\u0022 or whatever. It should be invite-only.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea that someone can just join your server, mess everything up, and then leave, even if they are a friend you know, in fact that makes this MORE likely, that is one of the things that scares me away from multiplayer sandboxes. So reliable admin tools are a must-have if I\u0027m personally going to play. We shouldn\u0027t HAVE to depend on mods to do that, but we SHOULD have the possibility of modding that kind of thing (with the notable exception of not being able to mod your game so that it ignores kick and/or ban commands).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-23T20:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224081247\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221642967100\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, SciMan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be totally drop-in and drop-out as seamlessly as possible (I guess it\u0027s fine if it needs to re-load the scene).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere should NOT BE ANY \u0022ownership\u0022 of vessels, that results in \u0022I can\u0027t control this because I don\u0027t own it\u0022.
