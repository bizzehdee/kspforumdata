I\u0027m sure if I knew the exact search term, if it already exists, I could find it. So forgive me if this has been answered, but I really want to know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=-=-=-=\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTOPIC QUESTION:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love that KSP got missions, but I\u0027ve always disliked having to go to the mission control and picking up Milestone missions (and I\u0027m not the only one). [I\u0027m still not sure why it\u0027s still that way.]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t count how many times I\u0027ve accidentally gone over a milestone I knew was there, but forgot to take it, and then I feel my whole run/game is ruined. (Like just this weekend, playing in a Hardcore mode, my brain was on auto-pilot, and I went into orbit, instead of just escaping the atmosphere, and I missed the milestone.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew players might collect data without ever getting the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExperienced players might not know some milestone missions exist and jump right over them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see this as a bit of a problem\u00A0 in a few ways. New players should be rewarded with the milestones in career mode. And experienced players like me, like to keep track and just see them all, like a list of accomplishments. It\u0027s nice to be able to look back at a save and see the various missions I\u0027ve done, and see that progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd to find out after playing the game for months or years that I missed some that I could have taken... it\u0027s hard to explain why that\u0027s stressful, maybe I\u0027m just a completionism or perfectionist, but it actually kinda is stressful. A little bit of that FOMO, except the missing-out already happened. It\u0027s like paying buying a game on Steam to only find out later it was free on Humble Bundle or Epic, or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really wish the Dev\u0027s would change it so that Milestone Missions were automatic and didn\u0027t take up slots in the Mission Control, for KSP1. Will KSP2 be different or work like KSP1 where I have to OCD check the Mission Control all the time so I don\u0027t miss any?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-25T14:18:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223978489\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202664\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221621948642\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119064\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sasuga\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n57 minutes ago, Sasuga said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill KSP2 be different or work like KSP1 where I have to OCD check the Mission Control all the time so I don\u0027t miss any?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s fair to say right now nothing in the game progression will be the same as KSP1.

You don\u0027t actually have to take any contracts to fund your program, you can just go out and complete World Firsts and those rewards will flow in regardless. This is usually how I play career, tacking on the procedural contracts only when they happen to align with something I already plan to do. You\u0027re exactly right to point out though that because they don\u0027t appear in Mission Control there is no way for the player to know that, or to get advances, or to know what the rewards will be ahead of time so they can budget missions appropriately. Its all the more confusing because there are milestone contracts that begin and then break as soon as you do something out of order leaving you feeling stranded with a heap of directionless generative contracts.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom all the rumblings we\u0027ve heard it sounds as though this entire system is being reworked for KSP2 into something they\u0027ve called \u0022Adventure Mode\u0022, which has been described as being more like science mode than career mode. We don\u0027t know much else about it. We don\u0027t even know yet if money will be a factor let alone contracts, the pros and cons of which have\u00A0been widely discussed on the forum. Its also worth pointing out that KSP1\u0027s science system isn\u0027t widely loved, so we\u0027re all hoping for some rework there too.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSurely there will be rewards for going to new places and doing specified tasks, and there will likely be some related mechanism to unlock parts that flows from that. Im of two minds on money being critical to that. On the one hand there are some interesting possible gameplay tradeoffs created by parts costing money, but later as you\u0027ve started colonizing and you\u0027re producing parts exclusively from mined resources is money still important? And if\u00A0money ceases to be important halfway through the progression is it worth introducing to begin with? There are also other ways besides individual part costs to encourage players to build more efficiently--things like tighter size and weight restrictions early on that must be unlocked through exploration. We\u0027ll probably have to wait and see what Intercept has in mind for all this. Though I certainly agree with you that the UI related to these main exploration missions needs to be much, much clearer to the player so they know what the goals are.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-25T21:55:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2021 09:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DVQuill","CreatedById":193797,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-25T18:12:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m assuming you mean the first few missions a person can get from mission control where you need to launch your first ship, escape the atmosphere or conduct your first science experiment, rather than the world first achievements/milestones that are added automatically. The way I see it, these missions are akin to the very first missions flown on Earth, where technology and limitations were\u00A0being tested for the very first time. Given that we know Kerbal technology always works, I see these missions as a way to RP those first (major) leaps towards reliable space flight. I like them personally.
