Mostly though I think the tidbits we will be provided will correlate to the upcoming first chapter and as EA is in function we will see updates on progress/changes based from the community over the current segment as it is being improved with previews to the new segment as the at time current segment is coming to a close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stephensan","CreatedById":222320,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-28T04:54:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224192002\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210320\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666929046\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161238\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Anth12\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n53 minutes ago, Anth12 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that we know that Early Access is coming up it feels a bit limiting on what will be shown before release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I want/need the debug menu for testing KSP2.
