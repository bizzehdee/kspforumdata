My preferred solution would be a fuel farm/resource warehouse that would be stocked over time with raw resources that you would use to build parts just like you would later at colonies. It could also be upgraded to produce materials faster and more exotic fuels with larger storage caps.

For instance if population growth is driven by \u0027boom events\u0027 in Adventure mode then removing that underlying mechanic may mean you can\u0027t grow your populations in Sandbox, which means you\u0027d also have to remove any impact your population had on resource collection rates. Some players may want the ability to collect resources anyway and just have big empty bases, and others may not want all parts to be free with no resource cost so they can just make crazy things without going through the rigmarole of harvesting and processing at all. So even if there is a listed \u0027Sandbox mode\u0027 it\u0027s not exactly clear what would be in or out besides a fully unlocked tech tree.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not add and remove Kerbals using the traditional methods of transfers, ship them in or out.

At a colonial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, you would be required to mine resources to manufacture parts- just as you still need to fuel/refuel in sandbox in KSP1- but there wouldn\u0027t be any need to climb a tech tree, for example as long as you gather the required resources you could manufacture a NERV immediately without having to progress through any tech tree (assuming of course you have built the necessary manufacturing facilities).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same works if in situ resources are required for producing colony segments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see environment affecting what can be built being particularly ground breaking from KSP1 sandbox.

In this case, I would see the mining of resources to build rocket parts for assembly in that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to be treated like fuel- just another physical constraint, not a progression mechanic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo KSP1 style sandbox is still possible in KSP2. The only difference would be that solar systems would start automatically discovered and you would not need to find them. The other, of course, being no currencies or tech trees of any kind. All parts would be unlocked. In the orbital and Kerbin VABs, there would be unlimited access to these parts (assuming you don\u0027t need to mine resources on Kerbin itself to manufacture parts). At a colonial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, you would be required to mine resources to manufacture parts- just as you still need to fuel/refuel in sandbox in KSP1- but there wouldn\u0027t be any need to climb a tech tree, for example as long as you gather the required resources you could manufacture a NERV immediately without having to progress through any tech tree (assuming of course you have built the necessary manufacturing facilities).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same works if in situ resources are required for producing colony segments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see environment affecting what can be built being particularly ground breaking from KSP1 sandbox. This would also be treated like a fuel- you just can\u0027t build X type of building somewhere in the incorrect environment in the same way you can\u0027t send a spacecraft lacking in delta v to whichever place you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe difference is the presence of a tech tree. Even if it wasn\u0027t just arbitrary points being rewarded, many (including myself) just don\u0027t want to deal with a tech tree. We want to be able to build what we want when we want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis of course assumes some form of points are still accrued to unlock different levels of the tech tree. On the other hand, utilizing colonies for progression could be \u003Cem\u003Eeven more\u003C/em\u003E restrictive in gameplay, because not only am I forced to do things to unlock a certain part, but I am now specifically forced to build a colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe entire tech tree itself could be regarded as arbitrary. Why do I have to wait so many levels to build an Orion drive when these things were proposed for construction and launch to happen in the 70s and 80s?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn example of how a grind can be annoying is in War Thunder. That game uses arbitrary points (research points) to unlock new aircraft. But even if the game was reworked to do something tangible like capturing objectives or hitting a certain target to unlock new things, people would still hate the grind.
