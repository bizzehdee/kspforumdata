Will KSP 2 be made so that updates come to PC and consoles at the same time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-06T22:33:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not want to \u00A0disappoint you but most likely no. Most of the updates come to PC first because the developers code new updates for PC. However they don\u2019t translate that programming into console. They hire some other company to transfer the programming and updates from PC based to Console based. Unless Take-Two Interactive and Intercept Games have methods of transferring PC programming to Console programming quicker so that the console versions will up to date for most of the time, the console version will be behind the PC version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother alternative is that they could update both PC and Console at the same time. Like after they finish transferring the update to PC and Console. However this would make update processes mush more so lower and they will be many issues as more bug reports might stagger and these issues wouldn\u2019t be resolved until much later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd also console have there own bugs the developers need to deal and also PC. Both are different places to play games, meaning console will have bugs repeated to only console, and PC\u00A0will have bugs repeated to PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish that this would happen because I am a PlayStation4 player but leaning the truth kinda sucks. I am very sorry about this news. I hope with Kerbal Space Program 2 that console and PC would be synced. That would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd also I think KSP2 will still release on PS4 and Xbox One.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfernoSD","CreatedById":208873,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-06T23:10:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect it will be, or nearly so.\u00A0Hiring an outside\u00A0company to port your game to other platforms is a bandaid solution to the problem of designing your game for only one platform to begin with. KSP2, under Take Two\u0027s brand,\u00A0has every reason to target all platforms from the beginning. I don\u0027t work in the business, but I imagine it becomes quite expensive and difficult to maintain multiple unique versions of a game under separate development teams with different release schedules and update histories and so on. It\u0027s almost certainly better to have Intercept handle all platforms\u00A0themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-06T23:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u2019t think so because Intercept games is almost brand new.

You can easily catch up additional platforms to your leading one after the fact and then release in lockstep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason a lot of companies don\u0027t do this is because consoles and iOS require certification for any update. With iOS, there is some content you can push live, but if you update your game\u0027s code, you basically have to certify it just like you would with consoles. That requires some lead times before the updates are released, which can make QA a bit more of a challenge. And then, what happens if one of the versions fails cert? Do you delay everything? Or just the platform that failed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast, PC release is a \u0022free\u0022 opportunity to test the game. If there\u0027s a serious problem, you can release a patch within hours of discovering it. And because of similarity in hardware, most serious bugs are going to manifest across platforms. So if you catch all the bugs on PC release, you can have a much smoother release on consoles. But if you\u0027re doing that, consoles aren\u0027t even going into cert until well after the PC version of the patch released, and so you end up with significant difference in release windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"runner78","CreatedById":168980,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-08T11:05:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223922182\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200134\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221612780439\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 minutes ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if that\u0027s strictly a requirement, especially with Unity.
