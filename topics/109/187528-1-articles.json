Now for the same tier of CPU, you can have a Ryzen 5 3600X with 6 cores and 12 threads (I have one of its predecessors, the 1600). It would be nice to see KSP2 be more effectively multithreaded as KSP1 does not deal particularly well with large structures and it can grind to a halt on even the most powerful computers because it\u0027s only capable of running on a couple of cores and bogs down a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-22T22:06:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ll have to wait and see.
