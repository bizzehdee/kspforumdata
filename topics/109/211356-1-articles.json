In a few updates it may be worth my time but not now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-09T18:55:58Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2023 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-09T18:55:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I will probably continue to play KSP while I play KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI base this on my play habits:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI own CIV III, IV, V, and VI.
