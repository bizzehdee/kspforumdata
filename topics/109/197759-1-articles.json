Can we use colony parts with vessel parts? Will there be an inside to colonies one day? (please be yes). What special tasks and and set ups can we do and acquire in a\u00A0 colony? What will the kerbal have to do manually? What can you do with the colony? Would it be wise to add a sort of control system to the colony similar to how you control ships, or will it just be like a new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E? If this has it\u0027s seperate active channel then I\u0027m sorry for this. This sounds like a very interesting topic that would be cool if the community shares their thoughts and if devs peeked in although probably with little information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-28T07:33:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re already discussing exactly that here:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022180102\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9090208090\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/197619-space-colonies/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:171px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
