Modern CPUs do double precision math just as well as single precision on the FPU. Yet games are entirely done in 32 bits. What gives? Well, nobody does math on FPU. I mean, some math is done on FPU, but almost none of the game animation, physics, AI, or FX run on the FPU, because we don\u0027t really work with scalar numbers. Almost everything we are interested in is either a 3-dimensional or a 4-dimensional vector. That\u0027s why modern CPUs have SIMD - Single Instruction Multiple Data.\u00A0That comes in as either SSE or AVX\u00A0instruction sets supported both by Intel and AMD processors. These were initially developed for encryption and encoding, but game developers jumped on them as soon as they became commonplace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SSE instructions pack 128 bits of data into a single register. That can be either 4 single precision or 2 double precision floating numbers. (Also, all kinds of levels of precision of packed integers, but we don\u0027t care about these as much.) SSE instructions are basically perfect for doing animation and physics in 3D. There\u0027s a dot product instruction built into the SSE4.1 that lets you do 3 and 4 dimensional dot products, and the square root operation on SSE registers runs about 10 times faster than computing it on FPU. It can also do 4 square roots at once! There are also handy shuffle operations that can be combined with component-wise add/multiply operations to do very fast cross products and even quaternion operations. Rotation using quaternions with a good SIMD algorithm can run in about 20 CPU cycles.\u00A0So all good stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there is AVX. AVX2 has support for floating point math with 256 bit registers. That means you can do math on 4 double precision numbers at once. And that should have been a major win for games, as it might sound like it lets you just port all of your SSE single precision code to AVX and run it in double precision. Except\u00A0a few crucial operations are conspicuously absent. The problem is that an AVX register is just a pair of SSE registers, and crossing data between them just does not work well. That means no 3-dimensional dot product, no vector cross products, no quaternion math. This means that in practice, doing double precision math is several times slower than doing single precision math even on the most recent CPUs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, while PCs have considerable overhead in terms of computational capability, the above is a death sentence to double-precision math on consoles. Modern consoles have underpowered CPUs. Next gen is a great improvement in absolute terms, but does no\u00A0better in relative terms. It\u0027s still a machine with very beefy graphics and just an Ok CPU. Which means that majority of games that have a lot of skeletal animation, physics, or heavy AI load are going to be running right under the wire on CPU budget. And that means that using double precision math for physics is just not an option. Absolutely all of the physics on every modern game engine will run using SSE instructions. That means 4D single precision math is what the game has to be built around. And so when we need additional precision, we start building scene hierarchies, shifting origin of the simulation to be close to where the action is happening.
