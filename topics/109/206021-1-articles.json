The primary limitation is that you shouldn\u0027t be able to enter a custom diameter, because that makes the logic that checks for a smooth aerodynamic transition between parts much more complex, and it could also make the player confused by \u0022too many choices\u0022, a thing that already occasionally happens to me personally with all the mods I have installed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause of this, I think it might be the case that we\u0027ll have LESS \u0022parts\u0022 to choose from in the editor, but those fewer parts will cover more options, leading to an overall better experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSemi-procedural cylindrical parts is a good thing, you\u0027d select a diameter from a list, select a length from a list (or enter a custom one if it\u0027s within the range of lengths covered by the list), select what fuel combination, \u0022Battery\u0022, or just \u0022structural\u0022, there\u0027s your cylindrical part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we have parts dedicated to being the \u0022spine\u0022 of a gigantic ship assembled in orbit, those should be semi-procedural too, pick a diameter, pick a length (or enter one), but the difference between these and the regular cylindrical parts is that the limits on length would be something on the order of a full kilometer (having just one part that long is REALLY IMPORTANT when you\u0027re building a gigantic ship in orbit, as otherwise with so many joints in the stack you\u0027re bound to get a wobbly vessel unless the parts are literally non-physically attached to each other aka parented to each other instead of being connected via joints).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSemi-procedural diameter adapters would be good too (select top diameter from list, select bottom diameter from list, select or type in a length (within a sane range), select fuel combination, battery, or structural, done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFully procedural wings would be needed, and I\u0027m pretty sure they\u0027re coming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSRBs should also be procedural, because right now we have way too many of them. There would be several preset configurations available that match up with the existing KSP1 SRBs, but if you wanted something \u0022in-between\u0022 you could still choose from a list of diameters, enter a custom length, choose if it can gimbal or not, and finally choose if the engine bell is optimized for vacuum, sea level, or very high atmospheric pressures like Eve (or any similar Venus-like planets planets in KSP 2 that are in other solar systems).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngines might have to stay the way they are in KSP 1, however there should be an option for \u0022clustering plates\u0022 where you stick a number of engines on it and it (for the sake of making the math easier) will turn both the plate and all the engines on it into something the game considers as \u0022just one part\u0022 as far as both physics and the resource consumption logic are concerned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso since we\u0027re going to be building gigantic vessels in orbit, it would be real nice if we had some feature like the old UbioZor Part Welding mod (such code could be used in part to implement the functionality of the clustering plates I mentioned above, but there might be more code needed to make it work besides that). Even if it only works on certain kinds of parts, that would be a massive improvement to the overall structural rigidity of the vessels we make in KSP 2.

There\u0027s no point in having a bunch of tanks of the same length and diameter, with their only difference in what\u0027s inside.

Additionally, I think that parts selection customization like that would have to come with mods, as making it properly customizable would be out of scope for the base game. Therefore, intercept actually does have to think of what can appease everyone, because it will impact everyone, at least for a short time.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here\u2019s me adding to the problem by simply stating my preference with equally feeble backing. First, I think that it is important to note that the difference between the different tabs in the inventory list and a pop-up menu is functionally nothing, so probably keep the tabs, because I don\u2019t want to navigate many pop-up menus whenever I select a new part. Ideally, there is a healthy balance between the time it takes to find a new part in the list and the time it takes to place more parts (and no, I\u2019m not counting mod\u002Bclick to copy, what if you need a similar part, then you have to go through the whole process again)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo that end, I\u2019ll split parts up into several identifiers: function, size, fuel type, tech level, resource types required, mass. A small list of potential categories to split parts up into. First, function is separated into different tabs, as we have already seen, and then size is split up. I agree with this decision sort of, because I would like an easy to access system. But there\u2019s a few changes. One last organizational method that has been overlooked so far is the \u201Cvariant\u201D selection of KSP 1. This has the benefit of offering multiple types of the same engine or command pod and you do not have to go through another selection process when you want to fat another of the same part, because it saves which variant you want, and you can use it next time. Currently the system only makes cosmetic changes to engines and a structural change to the mk. 2 pod, but we see that functionality can be changed using variants. On a side note, I wish that mods would use this system more often, as I don\u2019t want to have to set the fuel mix to methalox for every differently sized fuel tank on my ship and then deal with copy pasting the middle of a stack.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, so the final system would work like this: parts would be split up by function (ideally could be sorted other ways in a KSP 1-like advanced option) and then by overall size tiers (so from 0.625m to 15m) in those drop-down menus so that you could keep a certain size tiers visible. Have an alternative to split by fuel type if you want to work with lots of parts of different sizes. Next, if split up by size, each fuel type will have 1 tank and 1 radial tank option, which you can select a variant for 4 different lengths (like KSP 1). Now, when you need to select a part, you only have to look at 14 total parts at a time within a size tier or fuel type, much much lower than KSP 1, and it only takes one click to bring a part from the list to the editor. Additionally, you have one-click access to 13 other \u201Crelevant\u201D parts, whereas if you wanted to make previous systems one click (by saving the part) you would have to change the part every time you wanted a similar part. Lastly, within one click you can access all the other functions which is 13 total types, which means 182 \u201Crelevant\u201D parts ready to deploy in one click while still being easy to find (only 14 on screen simultaneously), which is a bit better than 65 relevant parts having to be fully customized , a generous five per category.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, remember that how parts are selected has nothing to do with how many parts are in the game, so it really is just a matter of preference and how many clicks you are willing to go through to get your parts.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I\u2019m taking fuel tanks as being representative of other categories because, aside from utility, it has the most options for different parts especially with all the fuels, and so using fuel tanks as a proxy for other categories is a good way to get a worst-case estimate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-12-23T19:12:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2021 07:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by t_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-23T23:15:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nId still like to know who Pat is.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-24T02:28:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPostman, who else?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-24T02:57:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224068822\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206021\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221640312929\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n26 minutes ago, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPostman, who else?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had to google and it turns out Im not British enough for that adorable reference.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
