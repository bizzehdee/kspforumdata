We can then order things from needs to wants and consider the cost benefit of different methods from a practicality standpoint. Im not a programmer but I can guess a bit between whats hard, what\u2019s really hard, and whats basically impossible. There\u2019s also the level of onus and management placed on the player to consider.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me the only thing that\u2019s absolutely necessary for the game to function is that landed parts are recoverable for some portion of their value. Everything else is a bonus.

Ideally this would feed into a proof of concept launch that would produce values that could be applied to subassemblies in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0For the sake of testing this could be pretty simple: what was the max altitude of subassembly x, and what was the recovery value. This could even be tested in isolation the way SpaceX did by launching and recovering falcon 9s before strapping them together. And you could apply whatever wacky idea you wanted for this so long as the subassembly was recovered, it could just show up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thereafter with a marker: \u201CRecoverable for 90% if separated on Kerbin below 50km.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as we get later into wants 5-7 things get a bit more complicated. Maybe there are reasons why stock automation would be included anyway, but even that has levels between maintaining angle to horizon and hovering to full-on Autoland. If you want the game to take the wheel and pilot vessels to a destination you\u2019re in all the way. Its not just a recording, because its not like your separation altitude and velocity are going to exactly match. And then there\u2019s the player management factor\u2014specifying land locations manually for each detached stage and hoping they survive the journey. And to be honest, if the point here is to just incentivize recoverable stages do you really need to model every instance and worry about them all the way to a (hopefully successful) automated recovery?

Then that recovery data (rated staging altitude \u002B recovery value) are just applied to that subassembly whenever you launch from that location in the future. Validating supply runs would be more complicated than that, because they could be one way, round trip, or include 3 or more stops. I would think the logic is the same.
