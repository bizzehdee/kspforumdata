It would probably be better to buy it then to make sure you are getting a more complete, optimized, and bug-free game if you care about that. Here\u0027s a question: If the developers changed the price, would that change your decision? I ask that because people have very different criteria for whether they will purchase the EA, and\u00A0people who, for example, are very confident that the game will continue development until completion and will be fun in the early access state, see this as a discount on their future expectations of the game, or just getting a fun game at a reasonable price.

I don\u0027t need or want some tween sounding brat rocket-splaing to me.\u00A0 Even if I didn\u0027t have 10 years of KSP under my belt, and this was my first foray into rocket building that tutorial would be a huge turn-off. What ever happened to adult people explaining\u00A0 thing in adult ways?\u00A0 \u00A0 Why not get someone like Scott Manley to do the tutorial? What were they thinking? Do they even know their audience?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, I\u0027ve mentioned this before but it bears repeating. Why are they charging full price for an unfinished game?

The voice isn\u0027t condescending at all imo. As for adults explaining in adult ways, you do realize that tons of kids play KSP as well, right? Having a more kid friendly voice is best for the tutorials. Yes, they do know their audience, and they also know the audience they are targeting. That being both adults \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAND kids\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E. If you don\u0027t like the tutorials, don\u0027t watch/listen to them. That simple. You\u0027re making a big deal out of something so little.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, I agree with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/209738-intellicom/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022209738\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/209738-intellicom/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@intelliCom\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and I think it is worth the $50 bucks they are charging. If they were literally just making KSP 1 but better, no colonies, no interstellar, etc, I would still be happy paying the $50 bucks for EA, because the game will be $60 or $70 at launch. That\u0027s a $10 to $20 discount, and that\u0027s not even including tax, which would add another $5 to $20 bucks. Why would I be happy paying a premium for EA? Because KSP 2 is a better game than KSP 1, even with none of the promised features. It\u0027s no longer a shoe box held together by duct tape and rubber bands. It\u0027s an actual game instead of some hobby project that some amateur started. There are actual professionals behind KSP 2. That alone merits a premium price, imo.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus, with KSP 2 being professionally made, that means that we get a lot more in terms of modding. Better modding alone is to be worth $50. Because now modders don\u0027t have to implement work arounds or hacks. They can literally go ham on KSP 2 without holding back.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, a theory as to why the price is so high is because Take Two wants their money, and they want it now. It is rumored that they are threatening to pull the plug on the project unless it launches and starts making money. Now, this is only a theory/rumor, so don\u0027t take it as fact. But if this were true, what would you want? KSP 2 to charge $30 bucks for EA and then have its plug pulled because Take Two didn\u0027t like the low price, or... would you rather pay a premium now, and receive a better product that will live on for years to come?

KSP 1, KSP 2, Orbiter, Space Engine, Simple rockets 1, Simple rockets 2, reentry, mercury go for flight, and maybe one or two others. So, in total, about 8 games. 8 games. That\u0027s a far cry from other genres. There are millions of FPS, millions of racing sims, millions of flight sims, millions of city builder games, cooking, factory management, tycoon management, so and on forth. Every genre is over saturated with games, except one genre. Spaceflight sims.
