Now, admittedly this is a very old image and we have seen much cooler looking reactors and fuel processors since then, so I\u0027m personally hoping quite a bit of work has been put into this system and that it will continue to be refined before colonies are added to the game.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst the good. The system looks relatively easy to implement, copying over landing strip tiles for instance (those need more thickness btw) and having support piers automatically plant underneath. Those piers should really have footings (more on that later) but otherwise a pretty doable implementation. And while the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and colony hub (maybe?) look like they\u0027re plucked out of a different universe I do like that we\u0027ll be able to play with larger masses and won\u0027t be in a purely modular design world. From an aesthetic standpoint I hope the procedural masses allow more visual definition--larger windows, no windows, alternate textures--rather than looking so generic.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow some room for improvement. Again obviously this is early but what Im not seeing is how this behaves as an efficient machine, just the way design works for most other aspects of KSP. Aside from structural elements and connector tubes all of the major modules and design elements should have a gameplay function--increasing habitation space, production output, power, whathaveyou. We\u0027re not seeing production infrastructure, neither fuel processing or materials for rocket and colony parts. There are a couple of domes there for aesthetics but Im not seeing greenhouses capable of supporting the population that would live here. More importantly what is the purpose of the larger massing blocks? Are they living space? Working space? Purely aesthetic? I\u0027ll say out of the gate I hope it\u0027s not the latter. Even if we do have a lot of creative freedom over how these enclosed spaces are shaped I hope there\u0027s some simple gameplay element that increases max population caps and/or production based on overall size.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext let\u0027s talk about materials and the kit of parts. The concept of a kit of parts is an important idea in architecture and has obvious tie-ins to a parts-based game architecture like KSP. Right now we\u0027re seeing a few different procedural truss systems some with footings and some without, just a couple of the more modular parts from other renderings of inflatable habitation, and this fairly uniform hab-space massing system. I would love to see a few additions to this kit that would add more depth to structural and architectural design for colonies.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWeb trusses\u003C/strong\u003E - Web trusses are especially important in ground-based colony design where the loads are mostly vertical (while wind-loads and uplift would be cool, I doubt they\u0027re in scope.) This could open a lot of cool design space for bridges, cantilevers, and anything that\u0027s doing long spans between support piers. This could be a cool design mechanic depending how much these structures cost in terms of materials. Just as we learned there were tradeoffs between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E there would be optimums for distance between piers and truss depth--ideally procedural with the ability to fine-tune.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECable stays/ Tie-rods\u003C/strong\u003E - This would open a whole world of design opportunity especially for spires and tensegrity structures that use much less material for the same load. This could be an incredible tool for orbital station design where the compression loads are very minimal and what you\u0027re really trying to achieve is maximum stability with minimum mass. Im particularly thinking about harmonic wobble resonance when you dock a 1kt interstellar vessel to a station without any tensile reinforcement.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EConcrete piers, footings, and structural shafts\u003C/strong\u003E - Concrete is a great material for planetary surfaces. There are a few different options from more familiar water-based carbon silicate based cements to liquid sulfur options. For the purposes of the game I think we could simplify the ingredients to base materials like \u0022volatiles\u0022 and \u0022regolith\u0022. We\u0027ve all probably seen the funky 3d printed concrete domes made by robots in mars colony animations but this is not particularly realistic. Concrete requires specific conditions for curing and more importantly rebar or other tensile reinforcement to be stable. Formwork is also at a premium, so precast units produced in conditioned space are much more likely. For the game that\u0027s a good thing, as you could have simple set of procedural or modular concrete forms from footings, piers, or hollow shafts with built in egress to support larger buildings.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll told I think you could boil ingredients for colonies down to just a few ingredients: Metals, Plastics, Regolith, and volatiles like water or 02 if we\u0027re considering LS. There could be some cool evolution as your production increased from harvesting mostly fuels, perhaps converting them to inflatable habs mostly made from plastics, into more metallic structures and later more robust buildings made mostly from excess regolith agregate from larger scale mining operations. You might also see concrete storage casks for some materials, especially the more radioactive ones.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThoughts?

Nate has mentioned that these things will react to gravity and will fall down if you build something that\u0027s unrealistically spindly. That implies a certain amount of under-the-hood load calculation and deflection just like we would see if you made a rocket that was unrealistically long and skinny. The reason I bring up things like alternatives to box trusses, cable stays, and concrete is they could make this endeavor much easier to manage. Concrete for example has basically zero deflection, so anything that was anchored to it would behave as if it was anchored to the ground. Because its tensile strength is slow low however there would be limits to how tall you could go without other forms of lateral reinforcement.\u00A0 Same with orbital stations. We already know that we\u0027re going to be able to build orbital construction platforms that might be half a km long. Having the ability increase the stability of huge metal structures with cable ties between compressive members would make this task much easier for players to deal with.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-12T02:20:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224207979\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211018\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221670810765\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this intro Im not even really delving into complex resource flows or population management or any of that, I\u0027m just talking about structure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was too.

I\u0027m more interested in how colonies behave as machines--just like vessels do--with inputs and outputs and basic efficiencies that can be optimized.

It\u0027s not something I\u0027ve seen in any game as a side mechanic, that I can recall, and the points that have been made about micromanagement are considerable. On the one hand, I see potential to turn this into a full-on colony management game, where the rockets are just there to supply the colonies, but on the other side they could just be empty entities that you plop down for the sole purpose of launching rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is also straying heavily into theoretical territory, considering we\u0027ve barely made our first few orbital structures as humans. KSP has always been grounded in technologies that either already exist or have been developed and tested. We don\u0027t know what kinds of structures are sustainable in alien environments, but I would suspect that, given risks such as radiation exposure and meteor impacts, such structures in reality would not be made above ground.

Most if not all of what we\u0027ve seen has been either conceptualized or is being researched right now. Colonies on other planets are one of them. There are projects out in the desert right now that are looking into how humans would deal with the martian environment. They are all above ground structures. The only underground structures I\u0027ve seen for Mars is technically a above ground structure that is simply buried or has a hill built on top it. This is the SpaceX 3D Martian ground printer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for protection from radiation and asteroids. The radiation can easily be dealt with by making the walls out of lead or filling them with water. Asteroids/meteorites can be dealt with by tracking systems designed to detect a meteor shower and for people to get to a hardened bunker, possibly underground. It\u0027s not too farfetched to have an above ground colony. In fact, above ground colonies would be the way to go for anything over 100 people. Digging out enough space for a colony in the 1000s is just not economically sound.

Its true its unusual to have a mini-city builder as a side mechanic, and I know Nate has agreed that they want KSP to have colonies relatively low-maintenance, serving the rocketry rather than the other way around. There are some advantages here though. Most city builders are designed to run in a state of constant instability so you always have something to do--more roads, more houses, more production, supplementary infrastructure, etc. You don\u0027t want players to be sitting watching things run smoothly with their hands folded behind their heads. For KSP you want just the opposite, which is actually much easier. After a boom event you\u0027ll get a population boost which will in theory open up more production. You\u0027ll have a chance to add more resource gathering and processing, upgrade power output and storage, etc. But once you get your outputs in the black you really want the thing to be set it and forget it so you can time-warp another mission months or even years without having to go back and constantly tweak things. Even that little period of expansion should be as much as possible about building and engineering and not about endlessly sifting through crew rosters. That to me means just simplifying and streamlining worker management as much as humanly possible.

Maybe it would be nice to right click on a given production facility and increase or decrease the number of workers if you wanted to fine tune, but the positions should be filled automatically rather than manually assigning hundreds of individual kerbals. The same could be true for for habitation. Each hab module has a hab rating and the total combined is your population cap.

Most if not all of what we\u0027ve seen has been either conceptualized or is being researched right now. Colonies on other planets are one of them. There are projects out in the desert right now that are looking into how humans would deal with the martian environment. They are all above ground structures. The only underground structures I\u0027ve seen for Mars is technically a above ground structure that is simply buried or has a hill built on top it.

The radiation can easily be dealt with by making the walls out of lead or filling them with water. Asteroids/meteorites can be dealt with by tracking systems designed to detect a meteor shower and for people to get to a hardened bunker, possibly underground. It\u0027s not too farfetched to have an above ground colony. In fact, above ground colonies would be the way to go for anything over 100 people. Digging out enough space for a colony in the 1000s is just not economically sound.

So far one of the problems with \u201Cmooncreet\u201D is that at least on the samples cured on the ISS tended to have more micro bubbles \u00A0voids and pockets, because on earth the normal settling that does occurs here tends to cause gasses to escape while it cures and settles, creating more stress points in the concretion.

I guess we don\u0027t know to what degree the design of colony systems has progressed (though Im sure with Nertea\u0027s help it could go a long way\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E) but the general description has been that colonies come in two phases--the landing stage and the self-sustaining stage. In the first stage you have self-contained modules that are produced first on Kerbin and assembled on-site. These would be like the inflatable habitation pods we see in the trailer. As things progress and you gain access to in-situ construction there\u0027s probably a hybrid stage where you can produce simple box trusses, solar panels, reactors, or replicate the same kinds of modular pods in an onsite workshop. It sounds like (wisely) this will be pretty straight-forward for players in practice. Once they have access to the BAE interface they\u0027ll be able to add and move and reassemble colony parts just like we do in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom a pure art-design standpoint though I think its worth considering what construction in space or on other planets might actually look like. Ideally you\u0027d prefer not to have actual people doing huge amounts of field-welding or setting up concrete formwork. It\u0027s time consuming and dangerous to work in a suit thats vulnerable to punctures. Robots would certainly help, but I never really took the 3d printing mars concrete pouring robots seriously. Even the best robots require maintenance, and both time and spare parts are incredibly precious resources. You want your machines to be as few and as simple as possible so you\u0027re not spending all your time repairing them or chiseling off all the molten sulfur from hundreds of robots. Both factors would lead to one thing--as much as possible you want to manufacture mass produced, pre-fabricated systems in a pressurized, climate controlled space. That means repeatable structural elements and enclosure systems with build in seals and common mechanical fastening systems. Concrete is great because its so strong and durable and most of its mass is composed of local aggregate rather than metals or plastics which require lots of refinement. Again the best technique would be pre-cast, pretensioned columns, coffers and tubes with forms that get reused without modification over and over.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022glo-tbm-tunnel-boring-machine-01:16-9?wi\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://sika.scene7.com/is/image/sika/glo-tbm-tunnel-boring-machine-01:16-9?wid=1920\u0026amp;hei=1080\u0026amp;fit=crop,1\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow the sort of colony-block system we\u0027ve seen does certainly share some of those qualities but its a little \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E generic looking for me.
