The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E UI shows a \u0022center of\u0022 symbol for radiation, similar to the ones for gravity, lift, and thrust. This suggests that a major source of radiation will be engines and reactors, namely NTRs, NSWRs, Orions, and fusion engines. So I threw together a sketch of how this might be visualized in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E interface:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224AlPM9C.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4AlPM9C.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere we have the ship from one of the show and tells. I believe that\u0027s the mmH vacuum engine, but let\u0027s pretend it\u0027s nuclear for a bit...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe player will have to have some way of seeing how intense the radiation from this engine will be when it\u0027s running, how far the radiation flux reaches, and what other parts the radiation impinges upon. I don\u0027t know how granular the devs want the model to be, but presumably it should represent both how radiation intensity falls off with distance and how it can be blocked by parts. At some maximum range, radiation flux should be too weak to bother calculating and simply drop to zero, like air density at the tops of planetary atmospheres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe obvious way to model this would be to treat radiation as a point light source that illuminates parts and allows them to cast shadows on other parts. The parts have to be somewhat transparent however, to allow for intense radiation to penetrate them. One way to visualize this in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E would be to make this \u0022light\u0022 visible, illuminating the ship with the radiation source so the player can see which parts are irradiated and which are shielded. The effect would look similar to the light of reentry as we see it in KSP1. Another way would be to show the radiation as concentric sphere overlays, although this could be visually confusing. A third way would be to cut to the chase and color code the parts of the ship according to how much radiation each is receiving, much like the temperature overlay in KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf parts can block radiation from reaching others, this opens the door to fun design problems. The player has to make sure the parts that bear the brunt of the radiation are the strongest or simplest, and don\u0027t contain fragile electronics or squishy kerbals. It also presents an opportunity to include \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/radiation.php#id--Radiation_Shielding--Shielding--Shadow_Shield\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eshadow shield\u003C/a\u003E parts specifically designed to block radiation from certain directions, perhaps being procedurally modifiable in diameter or thickness. This potentially creates an additional docking challenge, as players must keep each ship in the radiation shadow of the other to avoid either from being irradiated. Parts\u0027 radiation opacity may also change over time, as in the case of a fuel tank becoming increasingly transparent to particle radiation as it empties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething to consider is the variation in the types of ionizing radiation. Generally radiation comes in either the electromagnetic or particle varieties, with each being more effectively blocked by dense metal plates or lots of low-density stuff (i.e. hydrogen or water tanks) respectively. Most of the radiation the player\u0027s technology will produce will be in the form of neutrons and x-rays, so both are an issue. If it were me, I would handwave a bit and consolidate the two together, modeling them as just \u0022radiation\u0022, and giving each part a single opacity to both for simplicity\u0027s sake.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n___\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis all raises the question of what radiation actually\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to parts or kerbals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the parts front, one thing radiation should do is simply heat parts up. In the case of NTRs this heating is small, but if you consider the detonation point of an Orion drive a \u0022center of radiation\u0022, then any parts not in the shadow of the pusher plate would receive flash after flash of radiation until they are heated to the point of failure, first glowing, then exploding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way radiation may damage parts is by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_embrittlement\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eneutron embrittlement\u003C/a\u003E, where materials are made weaker by exposure to neutron radiation. One way to model this could be to decrease the part\u0027s impact or pressure tolerance gradually the longer it is exposed to a radiation source. The part won\u0027t be destroyed, but it will become easier and easier to break if collided with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThirdly, radiation exposure may cause electronic parts to fail. Random failures are controversial and I tend to think they\u0027re not very fun, but if probe cores or science experiments each had a cutoff \u0022rad hardness\u0022 or level of radiation flux they can handle indefinitely, so long as it\u0027s not exceeded, that would be a good compromise between realism and simplicity for me. A similar \u0022steady-state\u0022 model could also apply to neutron embrittlement, with parts weakening under intense exposure, then returning to normal when no longer irradiated, to save the player the headache of parts being permanently reduced to the durability of balsawood, while still imposing radiation consequences...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the kerbal front, much depends on how the kerbals\u0027 skills and abilities are modeled. I doubt cumulative dose would ever kill a kerbal (although heat surely would), but it could cause them to be less effective at their jobs or drain their XP or something. Not much to say here until the devs reveal more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"starcaptain","CreatedById":166799,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-15T05:26:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the light source method is the most likely method that they\u0027ll do, but I suspect that it won\u0027t be something updated every frame.

I personally like the color coded parts version because thats what you actually care about. Im less crazy about part effects beyond heat, but I think there\u2019s a world in which high radiation could put probe cores into sleep mode until it subsided, and that different cores and habitable modules would have different shielding ratings, maybe tweakable adding weight.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as kerbals go I wrote a long post about combining habitation and LS effects into a ship-wide \u2018happiness\u2019 rating that effects science output and mining efficiency. Radiation could have a negative and lasting effect on that. Maybe happiness should be tracked by individual kerbals to avoid exploits though? Maybe colonies could have medical bays that cure them? Having played some long saves with 100\u002B active kerbals I would actually ditch the XP system. Individual management just consumes too much player time and contributes to grind. New skills should be rewards for increased colony population or something and be applied across your program. \u00A0But maybe high radiation exposure would suppress some of those abilities?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunlitZelkova","CreatedById":206402,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-17T01:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just hope the Soviet and Russian method of putting reactors on a long boom away from the crew module will work\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-18T17:24:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224078144\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206433\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221642383665\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/17/2022 at 2:41 AM, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just hope the Soviet and Russian method of putting reactors on a long boom away from the crew module will work\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas they used reactors on manned crafts?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMost hard sci-fi ships and real concept art using nuclear tend to have the reactor or nuclear engines on an long boom with crew compartment in the front.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-18T18:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t actually let my mod reactors overheat but I do usually attach them radially with a decoupler/sepratron core eject system for RP reasons.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Timmon26","CreatedById":1897,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-18T20:07:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224078144\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206433\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221642383665\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/16/2022 at 8:41 PM, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just hope the Soviet and Russian method of putting reactors on a long boom away from the crew module will work\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean it ought to.
