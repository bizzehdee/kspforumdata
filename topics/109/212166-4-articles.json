Take any series that was originally meant for kids and teens, but that has a significant adult following. Star Wars, superhero movies, whatever. I would contend that any audience member who says they don\u0027t like some aspect of these series for being \u0022too childish\u0022 or whatever are actually just reacting to the reality that they are no longer the target audiences. They don\u0027t like being reminded that the thing that has meant so much to them is no longer explicitly made for them. It\u0027s just another form of gatekeeping. One brought on by, I think, the embarrassment of being an adult fan of something that\u0027s \u0022too childish\u0022. The feeling of, \u0022Well, I like this thing, and I\u0027m a serious adult, but now this thing makes me feel like a child! But I\u0027m a serious adult who likes serious things, so this thing must be wrong; not me!\u0022 I understand that knee-jerk reflex, but I would 1000% argue that that\u0027s a wrongheaded reaction, and that, by trying to view media through the eyes of people who are not like you, you\u0027ll get to find so much more joy in art.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think part of really, truly growing up is understanding that it\u0027s OK for things to not be made for you.

I just feel like having the voice be the way it currently is sort of misses what makes the Kerbals so likable. They aren\u0027t young children- they are definitely silly, curious, reckless, and idiotic in an endearing way, but they aren\u0027t bubbly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like the OG Kerbal animations really capture what makes the Kerbals great protagonists for the game.

The reason why children will like the Kerbals is not because their demeanor is similar to that of characters on a kids TV show, or that the things they do ought to be narrated in the voice that\u0027s currently in the tutorials. It\u0027s because they are enthusiastic, entertaining, and cute, but also stupid in the best way. It\u0027s largely about comedy, not friendliness, or bubbly-ness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t mean to come across like I hate the voice in the tutorials- my opinion isn\u0027t very strong. I acknowledge the Kerbals are themselves like young children in many ways. However, I do think that a neutral observer would acknowledge that the atmosphere/vibe of the new tutorials is qualitatively different than that of, for instance, the old Kerbal shorts. Whether you think it\u0027s a good difference, is a matter of opinion. I will say, as a statement of fact, however, that a lot of my friends (high school) would enjoy these shorts, and even be interested in the game, but would probably be turned off to the game/put-off by the new tutorial narrator, at least slightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust my 2c.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-22T23:55:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sensible take.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me the thing I disagree with is: A Kerbal speaking English.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven that decision was made, I agree with what they did, but one of the things that makes a Kerbal a Kerbal (to me) is that backwards language they speak if they speak at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor that reason, and that reason alone, id have rather seen tutorials delievered in a more deliberately 4th wall breaking manner (IE not trying to make it as though a Kerbal is speaking to you)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then I also sit here and think \u0022Oh god forbid someone would have to READ like in KSP one while Von Kerman grunts at you\u0022 - but then I actually read the terminals in Fallout and the books in Skyrim too... and I doubt future games will continue to have that sort of effort applied to them either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"snkiz","CreatedById":176192,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T00:17:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m, 43, I have two early 20ish and one teen.
