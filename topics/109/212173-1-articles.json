Rambly post incoming. Also, if I say EA, I mean early access, not the despicable company (lol).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just want to preface this post by saying that I adore KSP and intend on buying KSP 2 the moment early access releases. I recently shelled out several thousand dollars for a new top-of-the-line PC specifically so that I could play KSP 2 with the best hardware possible. I have real faith in the KSP 2 dev team, as well- they seem smart, competent, and truly passionate about their game. I also don\u0027t care, in principle, about the game being in a state that many perceive to be \u0022undercooked\u0022... as far as I\u0027m concerned, the earlier I can get my hands on the game, the better, period.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, I\u0027ve been thinking about what I\u0027ve seen so far from the preview footage of KSP 2 and while I\u0027m not in the \u0022We\u0027re being scammed! 5 years and they\u0027ve done nothing! If you buy the game you are a sheep!\u0022 camp that seems to haunt the forums and youtube comment sections, I do think there are some important/revealing shortcomings of the EA release, that bear discussing, and I\u0027m interested to hear the community\u0027s thoughts on this. My central observation/theory is this: KSP 2 EA is being released because they need the cash to continue to fund/justify the project to take-two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a 0% chance that, upon conception of the KSP 2 project, the intention was for the first EA release to not include: re-entry visuals/heating, auto-strut, airbreaks, high-def atmospheric scattering and planetshine, high-def surfaces for bodies like the Mun, better-looking clouds, at least marginally better preformace, etc. Maybe you can take issue with a few items on this list and say that it\u0027s reasonable for these to be left out of the VERY FIRST release, but the lack of re-entry heating is a dead giveaway; it\u0027s such an integral part of the Kerbal experience, there is not a chance they would release even a beta version without this, absent other factors. To me, this signals that the 2/24 release of EA v0.1 was not a calculated, \u0022OK, the game is ready for the first beta release in the current state\u0022, but rather an edict from corporate that, in order to justify further investment into the project, the KSP 2 team would have to prove that the game will in fact sell enough, even in its early access state. This also explains the lofty price tag of $50... well above any other game I\u0027ve ever heard of that\u0027s in this early of a state, except for high-level contributions with things like \u0022your name in the credits\u0022 to an indie studio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother aspect that leads me to suspect this potentially risky state of affairs for KSP 2 is the fact that, other than an influx of cash, the main reason for doing EA is to gather community feedback. The devs are very adamant that they value community feedback and I truly believe them, however, the current state of the game seems to be one in which there are very immediate, obvious areas that need improvement, that you don\u0027t need \u0022community feedback\u0022 to point out to you as a developer- see the list of things I mentioned in the prior paragraph, for just a FEW examples, out of many. To be sure, there are many areas in which community feedback will clearly be immediately useful, especially when it comes to the UI, which is generally pretty good, but definitely still needs some tuning. But I think the \u0022community feedback\u0022 period of this EA release will be relatively short- that is to say, there are not currently many changes/fixes/problems which satisfy BOTH of the conditions: \u0022Not obvious, and therefore need the community to point out problems or give their opinions\u0022, AND, \u0022Currently in the game, so that the community can actually experience them to give feedback.\u0022 To summarize: the game is still in such a young state, that I can\u0027t imagine community feedback on the current build will be incredibly valuable, and certainly what feedback we will provide, would also be provided if they waited and released a later build (i.e. the UI would be the same, and garner the same feedback, if the game were released this August, instead of now), and thus, there is no real point to releasing the game now, for feedback purposes. Therefore, the EA release is being shipped out NOT primarily for the reason of community feedback, but rather because of the cash that will come in. Am I way off-base?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe video which inspired me to write this post is this one:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAoLGHG8Fg4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAoLGHG8Fg4\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0. In it, Billy Winn Jr. interviews Nate Simpson, and one of the other devs (I forgot his name, I\u0027m sorry). In general, I would characterize their affect in the interview as subdued, and somewhat apprehensive. It struck me that they were not proud of the product they were putting out... yet. This came through especially in their answers to the question of whether or not they plan on adding things like ground effects, or weather, into the game. If I recall their answers were very wordy, like they were trying to be careful and handle the topic delicately, and essentially boiled down to, \u0022It depends where it is on the priority list of the playerbase,\u0022 which, to me, is code for, \u0022We currently are not planning on adding those things. If players really, really seem to want them, then these features may be added way down the line, provided the project is still alive at that point, and we have the resources to deliver anything but exactly what we initially promised for the game, or less.\u0022 I may be totally misjudging their demeanor, but it seems like they were timid because they KNOW the current build is not up to their standards, and they care about the game, and really want to do a good job. This point is definitely disputable, but I thought it bore mentioning, even though I think my stance on the current state of the game is substantiated even without this additional evidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know I\u0027ve been pretty critical of the state of the game in this post, but that really isn\u0027t my intention. Rather, it\u0027s the opposite: If KSP 2\u0027s development is at the point where they are willing to release a premature build of the game for $50 in order to continue to fund development, then I\u0027m hoping that as many people buy the game as possible, because I do have faith in the dev team. If I didn\u0027t believe that the devs will do a good job, provided they have the resources, then I wouldn\u0027t feel this way. I\u0027m not trying to tell anybody how to spend their money, and $50 is certainly a lot to pay from what amounts to a promise from a dev team that may or may not be almost out of money, but if you have the money, you like the dev team, and you care about KSP 2, then, IF IM CORRECT, this may be worth considering. It would be a shame, for instance, to write the game off as a \u0022scam/failure\u0022, and not buy it even though you have the money, when money (or the lack thereof) is precisely the thing preventing the game from being incredible. Again, all of this is only valid if my wild speculation is true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the mega-long post, but if I\u0027m right, I think this is an important topic.

I\u0027m currently witnessing a big software project about to launch - it is a mad scramble to get features that were promised all along in for a deadline that was pushed as long as possible, and the software is still not going to be complete. I think that with practically any software project above a certain size, this problem happens where things are missing. Very likely, any \u0022finished\u0022 software is just software that reached its deadline and then spent a few months wrapping up the features in-progress before calling it a day. Software under active development doesn\u0027t do this, and instead will always have unfinished features being worked on, meaning that it will always be unfinished. As a result, the time of release isn\u0027t dictated as much by the completion of the game, but instead by other pressures such as money or, in this case, shareholder promises.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you said, there is no chance that they would leave out re-entry heating if they had any option to develop it in time. And if the developers set their own EA release date based on readiness, they would make sure that such a feature made it in. Development isn\u0027t perfect and features more often than not take vastly more time to develop than anticipated, but at some point along development it is possible to make a reasonably good prediction of when features will be complete, and that point probably hadn\u0027t been reached by the time the release date was set. For example, if you already have a semi-workable heating model and you set the release date, you can kind of know how long it is going to take and use that to inform the deadline. But if you set a deadline and then start working on the heating model to try to fit it in, your best predictions might be off and the feature will be incomplete on release. If it is any consolation for that particular thing, you only have to put up with it for \u0022a very short period\u0022 before a week-one patch probably implements all of the features that were almost done.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne good thing is that even if funding for KSP 2 is cut immediately upon launch (which would be terrible because a lot of people wouldn\u0027t get the features they might have bought the game expecting, don\u0027t get me wrong), the features that are in this intermediary state will likely make it into the game just because a few patches will be released to shore it up before the devs are relocated to other projects.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can\u0027t really say much about how likely T2 is to shut down the project and what amount of sales will mitigate it by how much, and speculations ranged from \u0027they will fund continued development until full release for sure and then very likely further\u0027 up to \u0027there is no chance that we will get even the first roadmap item unless the game sells 1 million copies, and development will absolutely end with 1.0\u0027. I have to say I appreciate that you are taking your observations and presenting your predictions as what they are - predictions, and not the only conclusion that can be reasonably reached. In the past, a lot of both positive and negative speculation was stated as fact, and that created some issue. For my own stance, I am speculating that short of a coordinated boycott, the game will have enough sales to make it further into development and will follow a tenuous path \u00E0 la No Man\u0027s Sky, hopefully making it to 1.0 with enough users to continue development through both updates and DLCs.

As you said, the absence of reentry heating and\u00A0thermal systems at launch gives away the fact that the game isn\u0027t ready for public release yet from a quality standpoint. Even if it\u0027s for \u003Cem\u003E\u0022a brief window at the beginning of Early Access\u0022\u003C/em\u003E, I doubt that Nate Simpson, who sounds legitimately passionate about the project, would qualify this situation as satisfying in regard to both quality standards and customers appreciation. It seems quite rational to assume that T2 gave KSP2 a definitive release window and that Intercept Games had to release a product for us to buy during that time period.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow if I\u0027d have to summarize your concerns about this whole situation, and correct me if I\u0027m wrong, I\u0027d say that you\u0027re worried about the eventuality of T2 stopping financing KSP 2 if the game sales are\u00A0insufficient.\u003Cbr\u003E\nObviously T2 wants returns for their investments and judging by the long development, the expansion of the game\u0027s scope and the priority put on accessibility to get new people aboard, they seem to aim for a lot of sales. It\u0027s reasonable to think that as KSP 2 is bigger in every way possible than KSP 1, the budget of the game should be greater too and therefore so are the targeted sales numbers. Moreover, it\u0027s alarming to think\u00A0that the \u0022novice\u0022 audience is going to be introduced to KSP with this EA, missing core features of KSP 1 and requiring a high-end config to run decently. Although KSP 1 fans are going to buy KSP2, make a good review and support the project no matter what (because we know the potential of the game, and we know that Nate Simpson is going to make everything he can in order to make KSP 2 the best game he could), the new audience in the other hand is likely to discover KSP via this EA and is likely to not want to buy the game or refund it and making a bad review for the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat is, I think, indeed very worrying about the potential success of KSP 2... that\u0027s the way it is, the game is going to release in 62h from the time i\u0027m writing this and is going to be in the state we know.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, it could not be as bad as it sounds, I was watching all the previews from the ESA event and I found interesting that the PC Gamer and IGN reviews, which both journalists were exactly this \u0022novice\u0022 target audience, (having zero knowledge in KSP, orbital mechanics or space rocketry) sounded like they had a ton of fun with the game. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I look back at the time I started playing KSP and how the game could have no planetary bodies except Kerbin and I wouldn\u0027t have noticed. I remember having to watch Scott Manley videos to understand how to play and not understanding a single sentence he was making, since I\u0027m not a native English speaker and space rocketry use a very technical language. With the lack of tutorials and personal knowledge, it took me weeks to consistently reach orbit and months to reach Duna and dock for the first time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway what I want to point out is that, us, KSP 1 fans, set up our expectations very high, rightfully so because since 2019 we were told the game was going to be this ambitious sequel to our beloved KSP 1 adding a ton of features and challenges; but a novice player that is going to try KSP for the first time with KSP 2 EA may very well enjoy the game for the process of learning orbitals and rocketry by trials and errors as much as we did when we started KSP. In fact, features such as interstellar, colonies and resource gathering are targeted for already experienced players and their absence in the 0.1 EA could not impact the experience of a novice player in any way.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut on the matter of KSP 1 fans getting KSP 2 EA Day-one, the game is going to be as unfinished as it seems, but again, \u003Cu\u003ENate Simpson\u003C/u\u003E.\u00A0I think I can speak in the name of all the KSP community by saying that the man really earned our trust and no one here have any doubt that he\u0027s going to do anything he can to deliver the game he promised us back in 2019 and that he will try to push the game as far as possible no doubt.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn conclusion, I would say that on one hand this version 0.1 of the EA is indeed under delivering in many ways for a KSP 1 fan but on the other hand newcomers could very well enjoy this game as it is.\u00A0 As long as the time between the release and the first roadmap updates doesn\u0027t exceed the time that new players would take to start mastering this version of the game, it would keep them engaged. I think if this reasoning is correct, the same could be said about the absence of\u00A0reentry heating and\u00A0thermal systems, yes it\u0027s bad not having it Day-one, but I think the success of the game is going to rely on the speed of the game\u0027s updates more than the actual state of the game at launch. KSP is such a complex game after all... if heating is implemented quick enough, new players could not even realize a core mechanic is missing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP 1 fans are likely to buy the game in early access and are going to support the game no matter what, and the percentage of new players that will buy the game in EA are, in my opinion, going to enjoy the KSP 1 experience in KSP 2 not even aware of what\u0027s missing in the game; and the percentage that will buy it later will have a more fleshed out experience.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo let\u0027s hope heating is implemented quickly enough and that the next roadmap milestone (science) is around the corner.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTldr: EA state is really bad, but it could not impact sales and reviews this much. Vets know the game is in good hands and how the game is going to be great once it will start to take off and new players will need some time to start mastering the game, at which point the game is going to be in a much more complete state, hopefully. And in the meantime they\u0027re going to have fun with learning the basics of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wow thats a lotta words too bad im not readin em - YouTube\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TXPC2HXjrYU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AG4BoACtgaKAgwIABABGH8gNygYMA8=\u0026amp;rs=AOn4CLAyyW4wb565fmXm6aR50tF3FxPS3A\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-22T01:29:06Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2023 01:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Kaerbanogue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eformat, typos \u0026amp; duke\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-22T06:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224236874\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212173\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677027948\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022189143\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kaerbanogue\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Kaerbanogue said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut again, \u003Cu\u003ENate Simpson\u003C/u\u003E.\u00A0I think I can speak in the name of all the KSP community by saying that the man really earned our trust and no one here have any doubt that he\u0027s going to do anything he can\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait, what did he do to earn it?

KSP1 went through something similar and came out fine-ish. Yes, there are issues with KSP1 andf those are largely due to (the lack of ) an architecture that wasn\u0027t designed for what the game eventually did. KSP2 (likely*) won\u0027t suffer from that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s disappointing is that EA was announced \u0022\u003Cem\u003Ebecause we want feedback before adding all features\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 which, I\u0027m sure is true, while omitting the glaring \u0022\u003Cem\u003Eit\u0027s EA because we\u0027re nowhere near where we want to be for launch.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 That omission covers a pretty big part of the negative reactions (lack of xyz, lackluster performance despite chad hardware reqs, etc).

But trust us, we\u0027re going to make it super over the next few years.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 I want that. I\u0027m sure the intention is there.

It probably makes sense to fix those first, but few people are willing to drop a grand or more on a new computer for a game with an uncertain future. Make it work on a wider range, and more people can buy it. \u0022\u003Cem\u003EBut Kerbart, EA is not for everyone!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Yeah, right.

Very likely, any \u0022finished\u0022 software is just software that reached its deadline and then spent a few months wrapping up the features in-progress before calling it a day. Software under active development doesn\u0027t do this, and instead will always have unfinished features being worked on, meaning that it will always be unfinished. As a result, the time of release isn\u0027t dictated as much by the completion of the game, but instead by other pressures such as money or, in this case, shareholder promises... if you already have a semi-workable heating model and you set the release date, you can kind of know how long it is going to take and use that to inform the deadline. But if you set a deadline and then start working on the heating model to try to fit it in, your best predictions might be off and the feature will be incomplete on release. If it is any consolation for that particular thing, you only have to put up with it for \u0022a very short period\u0022 before a week-one patch probably implements all of the features that were almost done.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, this makes sense, and this is my hope for things like the reentry heating- they even mentioned that the pause menu bug w/ the dialog boxes flooding the screen didn\u0027t exist even two days prior to the event. Game development is chaotic, and things can break randomly. I think their immediate priorities should probably be (in addition to all the other general development stuff they\u0027re going to do anyways) reentry heating and autostruts. Rather than optimizing the game before most of the features are in, autostrut is probably the best way to improve performance, which is probably going to be very important for keeping the community on their side, even if it\u0027s not reasonable to expect good performance from a game in this stage of development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224236795\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212173\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677018233\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to say I appreciate that you are taking your observations and presenting your predictions as what they are - predictions, and not the only conclusion that can be reasonably reached... the most important thing is to withhold final judgement until we have something concrete on whether the game will be canceled or not.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!

In an abstract sense, timing doesn\u0027t impact the level of feedback you receive, as long as you are committed to implementing that feedback. They could, in principle, develop the whole game, and call the full release early access, in order to implement community feedback. The only downside would be the time wasted developing and perfecting feature that players would want to change anyway. The decision of when to release the game, therefore, is probably comprised (as far as I can tell) of three factors: getting money sooner, gaining trust/minimizing loss of trust of the community, and time-efficiency. Given that the current release date has arguably performed poorly on the 2nd metric, at least so far, and will likely only yield marginal gains on the 3rd metric, relative to a launch in, say, a few months, assuming their release date is a well-calculated decision, they are largely optimizing for the 1st, \u0022getting money sooner\u0022 metric.

In fact, the more I think about it, the more I look back at the time I started playing KSP and how the game could have no planetary bodies except Kerbin and I wouldn\u0027t have noticed... Anyway what I want to point out is that, us, KSP 1 fans, set up our expectations very high, rightfully so because since 2019 we were told the game was going to be this ambitious sequel to our beloved KSP 1 adding a ton of features and challenges; but a novice player that is going to try KSP for the first time with KSP 2 EA may very well enjoy the game for the process of learning orbitals and rocketry by trials and errors as much as we did when we started KSP. In fact, features such as interstellar, colonies and resource gathering are targeted for already experienced players and their absence in the 0.1 EA could not impact the experience of a novice player in any way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a great point; I hadn\u0027t thought of it that way.

Also, KSP 2\u0027s enhanced on-boarding for new players will probably amplify this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224237406\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212173\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677087333\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278303\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Kerbart said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s disappointing is that EA was announced \u0022\u003Cem\u003Ebecause we want feedback before adding all features\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 which, I\u0027m sure is true, while omitting the glaring \u0022\u003Cem\u003Eit\u0027s EA because we\u0027re nowhere near where we want to be for launch.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 That omission covers a pretty big part of the negative reactions (lack of xyz, lackluster performance despite chad hardware reqs, etc).

I know the pandemic was rough on game development... but shouldn\u0027t the EA be in a more advanced state by now? It isn\u0027t normal for it to take 8 years for a game to be made, combining pre and post-early access.\u0022 It\u0027s unclear why the game has taken so long, and the pandemic is the easy scapegoat but I think a lot of people, myself included, aren\u0027t totally sold on the pandemic being the only villain here. There was also a lot of internal turmoil in the company, and that probably took a toll. The silver lining is that in both the cases of the pandemic, and the internal issues, hopefully that\u0027s all water under the bridge and now, provided adequate funding, etc., development can now proceed more quickly and smoothly.
