Yes, that low!), which is low enough that if the S-IVB stage didn\u0027t quickly (within a few orbits) fire up again to put the Apollo CSM and LEM on a trans-lunar trajectory, it would have encountered so much atmospheric drag at that low orbital altitude that everything that that Saturn-V rocket had launched would reenter within a matter of single-digit days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut that in KSP terms, the first 2 stages of the Saturn-V weren\u0027t even capable of launching the S-IVB, CSM, and LEM into an orbit that\u0027s above the atmosphere. That\u0027s a LOT of mass to put into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe S-N stage was designed to allow the use of what\u0027s essentially the Apollo CSM (with a smaller service module to save mass), along with a new lander and orbital habitat, to explore Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree fully fueled S-N stages would be used to launch a Mars landing mission, with two mounted to the side of the center one. The side ones would be depleted first, to put the craft on a highly eccentric orbit. Then, the center one would fire for a little while, using a fraction of its fuel, which would put the craft fully on the Trans-Martian Hohman transfer orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt Mars, they would have used another (larger) fraction of the fuel in the center S-N stage to put the craft into orbit of Mars. From there, the lander would be used to land on and live on Mars for roughly 200ish days, at which point they would use the lander\u0027s Ascent Vehicle (which was usually 2 stages of hypergolics, or it used one stage of hypergolics with drop tanks) to return to the orbiting habitat, CSM, and S-N stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce docked, they would have transferred over to the main vessel again, discarded the remaining stage of the Ascent Vehicle to reduce mass (after transferring over any remaining consumables), and fired up the S-N stage again, using all the remaining fuel to put the craft on a Trans-Earth Hohman transfer orbit from Mars.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen nearing Earth, the crew would transfer over to the CSM, and use the SM\u0027s engine to put them on a trajectory that intersects the Earth\u0027s atmosphere (the crew habitat and the S-N stage would be left to escape into a heliocentric orbit, which is how they expected to dispose of the S-N stage\u0027s Nerva engine with its now highly radioactive reactor core). Once nearing the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, they would burn the remainder of the SM engine\u0027s fuel to slow down the capsule to a velocity that the heat-shield would be able to tolerate, and then jettison the SM. After that, Earth EDL in the CM proceeds as it does for any Apollo CM landing on Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to replicate that, but it\u0027s impossible with the pitiful thrust and overheating tendancies of the LV-N. The only thing that\u0027s right about the LV-N is its specific impulse (well, the NERVA was actually rated for a specific impulse of 900 seconds, not 800, but I suppose it\u0027s close enough).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, before you say it, just because it\u0027s \u002260\u0027s tech\u0022 doesn\u0027t mean it should have ANY tendency WHATSOEVER to overheat no matter what you do with it. Maybe the V-2 rocket engine wasn\u0027t properly cooled.

That\u0027s right, the third stage of the Saturn V rocket (the stage would have been designated S-N).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo ahead and try to make a Saturn-V replica with a nuclear third stage, while only using ONE LV-N. You\u0027ll need a lot of fuel, maybe 50 tons worth. It\u0027s not workable, because the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is too low.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIRL, the design was workable enough that they were ONE STEP AWAY FROM FLIGHT-READY HARDWARE, and then a few treaties happened and the Apollo program was canceled and we dropped the idea entirely.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLike the SLS core stage, the Saturn V\u0027s 2nd stage (the S-II) was intended to bring the third stage and the payload into \u0022almost an orbit\u0022 which allowed the safe disposal of the large S-II stage via destructive atmospheric reentry, which meant that there was still a need for a small burn from the S-IVB to circularize into an extremely low orbit of IIRC around 120km altitude (that\u0027s it! Yes, that low!), which is low enough that if the S-IVB stage didn\u0027t quickly (within a few orbits) fire up again to put the Apollo CSM and LEM on a trans-lunar trajectory, it would have encountered so much atmospheric drag at that low orbital altitude that everything that that Saturn-V rocket had launched would reenter within a matter of single-digit days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut that in KSP terms, the first 2 stages of the Saturn-V weren\u0027t even capable of launching the S-IVB, CSM, and LEM into an orbit that\u0027s above the atmosphere. That\u0027s a LOT of mass to put into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe S-N stage was designed to allow the use of what\u0027s essentially the Apollo CSM (with a smaller service module to save mass), along with a new lander and orbital habitat, to explore Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree fully fueled S-N stages would be used to launch a Mars landing mission, with two mounted to the side of the center one. The side ones would be depleted first, to put the craft on a highly eccentric orbit. Then, the center one would fire for a little while, using a fraction of its fuel, which would put the craft fully on the Trans-Martian Hohman transfer orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt Mars, they would have used another (larger) fraction of the fuel in the center S-N stage to put the craft into orbit of Mars. From there, the lander would be used to land on and live on Mars for roughly 200ish days, at which point they would use the lander\u0027s Ascent Vehicle (which was usually 2 stages of hypergolics, or it used one stage of hypergolics with drop tanks) to return to the orbiting habitat, CSM, and S-N stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce docked, they would have transferred over to the main vessel again, discarded the remaining stage of the Ascent Vehicle to reduce mass (after transferring over any remaining consumables), and fired up the S-N stage again, using all the remaining fuel to put the craft on a Trans-Earth Hohman transfer orbit from Mars.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen nearing Earth, the crew would transfer over to the CSM, and use the SM\u0027s engine to put them on a trajectory that intersects the Earth\u0027s atmosphere (the crew habitat and the S-N stage would be left to escape into a heliocentric orbit, which is how they expected to dispose of the S-N stage\u0027s Nerva engine with its now highly radioactive reactor core). Once nearing the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, they would burn the remainder of the SM engine\u0027s fuel to slow down the capsule to a velocity that the heat-shield would be able to tolerate, and then jettison the SM. After that, Earth EDL in the CM proceeds as it does for any Apollo CM landing on Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to replicate that, but it\u0027s impossible with the pitiful thrust and overheating tendancies of the LV-N. The only thing that\u0027s right about the LV-N is its specific impulse (well, the NERVA was actually rated for a specific impulse of 900 seconds, not 800, but I suppose it\u0027s close enough).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, before you say it, just because it\u0027s \u002260\u0027s tech\u0022 doesn\u0027t mean it should have ANY tendency WHATSOEVER to overheat no matter what you do with it. Maybe the V-2 rocket engine wasn\u0027t properly cooled.

And the LV-N and Aerospike at least are both at the end of their respective tech trees, meaning that they\u0027re supposed to represent the absolute cutting edge of anything that the engineers can come up with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich brings me to my question that I\u0027ve been asking myself all this time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy should I bother unlocking these high tech engines when the stats just aren\u0027t there to back up the science points I\u0027m putting into them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure enough we don\u0027t need to increase \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of any engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust like the Dawn the Nerv having a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E will work just fine with background and under warp maneuver execution (that they already confirmed 2 years ago) and it will be useful to introduce the player to those concepts in preparation of the interplanetary and interstellar engines having even lower TWRs and weeks or even months long burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same goes for heat management, some of the early game engines needing radiators it\u0027s a useful introduction to heat management being one of the main design concerns for \u0022big ships\u0022 (as stated during the podcast interview).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, KSP1 engine roster is in dire need of a balancing pass, but the LV-N isn\u0027t one of the engines that needs fixing and certainly not in the direction you\u0027re hoping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AtomicTech","CreatedById":210823,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-19T14:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBehold!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thread that doesn\u0027t die!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
