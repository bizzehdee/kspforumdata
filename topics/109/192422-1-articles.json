I\u2019ve watched Episode 1 like 50 times. I was assuming it would be monthly updates since the release window is March 2020- March 2021. I don\u2019t expect the game to release until fall this year at the earliest and it seems from the videos that the game is very far in beta stage and probably just going through heavy polishing. I\u2019m hoping the next video released will be for the base building assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HenryBlatbugIII","CreatedById":159624,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-15T09:28:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only information I know of about that is that during the PAX East preview, they said they were planning to release those videos \u0022every couple of months\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedited to add link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.twitch.tv/videos/559802578?t=03h01m30s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/559802578?t=03h01m30s\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-15T09:37:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2020 09:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by HenryBlatbugIII\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"savagekerbal","CreatedById":199989,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-17T05:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223756887\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192422\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221584264510\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022159624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HenryBlatbugIII\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/15/2020 at 5:28 AM, HenryBlatbugIII said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only information I know of about that is that during the PAX East preview, they said they were planning to release those videos \u0022every couple of months\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedited to add link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.twitch.tv/videos/559802578?t=03h01m30s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/559802578?t=03h01m30s\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery couple of months is disappointing.
