But i decided i really just didn\u0027t have the time or dedication to write, debug and maintain something like this. Also i wasn\u0027t certain if KSP/Unity had a Cloud implementation that would allow for it, and not destroy performance. It would be a cool project though, so it\u0027s still on my mind xD\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to make it into a KSP mod, might be easier and way more efficient to write it as a shader. First of all, it\u0027s a lot cheaper to do the simulation like this on a GPU, which will become super important during warp. Though, for really high warp, you might want to cheat and just select a randomly pre-generated starting point that matches time of the year.\u00A0Second, most of the times you\u0027ll be using the results is for visual effects, so having to do a lookup into some textures for things like cloud density isn\u0027t a big deal if everything is already stored as textures on GPU. Finally, if you do want to hook up something like wind being dependent on weather simulation, you can still do it via a compute shader really efficiently, so that the weather maps don\u0027t ever have to cross the CPU/GPU boundary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor KSP2, things are a bit more complicated because of the multiplayer. Floating point computations are notoriously variable from one GPU to another. GPUs are designed to do math very, very fast, and some sacrifices to precision are made, and not all GPUs take the same shortcuts. So even starting with identical state simulating the same number of steps with the same time step you aren\u0027t guaranteed to get the same results on two different graphics card, and that means conditions might not be identical for two players. And sending the entire texture across the network is going to be costly. So that\u0027s a good reason to run weather simulation on CPU in KSP2. That definitely needs to be written as a C\u002B\u002B plugin and there are a bunch of optimizations that will have to be done, including distributing workload between multiple frames. But the way CPUs do math is way more stable, so long as you avoid certain SIMD instructions, and it\u0027s way easier to synchronize for multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother alternative is to have all the GPU math done in integers. I have experience doing that for some procedural generation, when we needed to make sure things generate the same way for all players, but I\u0027ve never tried that with any sort of simulation. In principle, any floating point math can be replaced with fixed point math. GPUs aren\u0027t as performant with integers, typically, but so long as you can keep orders of magnitude reasonable, you can still do more math on GPU in integers than you can on CPU with floating point. Well, for most typical configurations and target consoles, at any rate. And it\u0027s current gen of consoles where I\u0022m most worried for CPU performance, so that\u0027s probably the benchmark there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223830755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196060\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221596441089\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197414\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Incarnation of Chaos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, Incarnation of Chaos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m more worried about feature creep than anything; KSP2 has been delayed twice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, I wouldn\u0027t recommend starting on something like this NOW if they hadn\u0027t planed on it.

But i was actually considering having a shader as a \u0022Fallback\u0022 mode for situations where performance is bad/needed; though since this is all in atmosphere i really wasn\u0027t thinking about extremely high physics warps. And i was thinking that i might just be able to \u0022Cull\u0022 the simulation elements while above a certain height, not computing anything but just the state pretty much. So not displaying anything but your normal atmosphere/cloud textures beyond a certain height; which could also be just swapping in the shader \u0022Fallback\u0022 mode if that was implmented also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough for performance; i was thinking a hybrid approach may have been needed.

Now if you\u0027re talking about high winds in clear air, then that\u0027s harder...but not impossible still. Anything within a decent proximity to an area of high or low pressure is going to experience higher winds, due to the atmosphere attempting to equalize the difference. (Air rushes out of areas of higher pressure, rushes into lower pressure as a very rough guideline).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this is also a game that has a pretty important element...LAUNCHING ROCKETS INTO SPACEEEEE.
