can\u0027t.\u00A0 But even if it can\u0027t... they can use it as a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMacGuffin\u003C/a\u003E to start from, and take it from there.\u00A0 And they\u0027ve really spent time and effort talking to scientists and such to get a feel for \u0022how would this thing actually look and work, if it were real\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey showed us their metallic-hydrogen model \u0022up close\u0022, and pointed to the various bits of it and what the different parts do, and clearly they had put a lot of homework into it.\u00A0 They weren\u0027t just making stuff up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey also showed us the engine in action... and it had a funky, weird plume.\u00A0 And they anticipated our reaction.\u00A0 \u0022Yeah, it looks weird.\u00A0 But according to the people we talked to, that\u0027s actually how it would work, so that\u0027s what we modeled.\u0022\u00A0 I gotta say, I have a lot of respect for that.\u00A0 I mean, they could have just plunked down some fairly vanilla plume on the thing and be done with it... but they\u0027re actually making an effort to keep it as \u0022real\u0022 as they can.\u00A0 (And no, they weren\u0027t just trying to Hollywood it up.\u00A0 The odd plume for that engine isn\u0027t particularly more \u0022spectacular\u0022 than a normal plume, there\u0027s no eye-candy reason why they had to do it that way.\u00A0 It\u0027s just... different, is all.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you don\u0027t like their choice of using a \u0022magical\u0022 propulsion system like metastable metallic hydrogen, that\u0027s fine-- of course everyone\u0027s entitled to their personal likes and dislikes (more about that in the next

design choices.\u00A0 It\u0027s just that their choices may not be the same as yours, due to having different

speaking to the broader audience here, not specifically you, chaos_forge) and what your priorities are... other folks won\u0027t have all the same ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, I come from a science background and care a lot about scientific accuracy, myself.\u00A0 I\u0027d love it if they could avoid \u0022magic\u0022 technologies.\u00A0 However... I care about \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eplayability\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E even more.\u00A0 For example, they\u0027re going to introduce other solar systems as a feature, and I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elove\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that, because that means lots more worlds to explore and lots more design challenges to figure out.\u00A0 But \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eactual real-life interstellar travel is \u003Cstrong\u003EHARD\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, I mean \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eridiculously\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E hard, to the point that if they stuck with easily-extrapolatable \u0022real\u0022 science, they\u0027d either have to just eliminate interstellar travel as a thing, or else it would have deleterious effects on gameplay.\u00A0 There are excellent gameplay reasons for them to want to enable having multiple solar systems, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to make it so that accessing those solar systems doesn\u0027t require compromises that most players would be unwilling to make (such as taking excessively long to make the journey, or requiring excessively large ships, or other such things).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if they want interstellar travel that\u0027s fun and playable and meshes reasonably with the more \u0022interplanetary\u0022 mechanics of KSP... something\u0027s gotta give.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EThey need a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMacGuffin\u003C/a\u003E if this is going to be playable.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecould\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E have put in wormholes or hyperspace or something like that, i.e. some mechanism that basically teleports you from one solar system to another.\u00A0 Instead, looks like they decided to go with good ol\u0027 Newtonian \u0022accelerate towards the place you want to go, then decelerate to arrive\u0022, and then have made some engine designs that will allow that to happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, for example, KSP has a toy-sized solar system that\u0027s at around 1:10 scale.\u00A0 Squad did that to make it more playable and fun.\u00A0 And that may be \u0022unrealistic\u0022... but at least the really \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eimportant\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E things (principles of orbital mechanics and the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation) are still captured.\u00A0 Oberth effect is still Oberth effect, even when you\u0027re at 1:10 scale.\u00A0 Tsiolkovsky is still Tsiolkovsky, even if the Isp or fuel tank mass ratio is different from IRL.\u00A0 The actual \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enumbers\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E are unrealistic, but the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eprinciples\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (the equations behind everything, the physical laws) are modeled.\u00A0 And the principles are the important thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP\u0027s a toy... but it\u0027s an \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eeducational\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E toy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I think interstellar propulsion technologies are much the same way.\u00A0 If they\u0027re not going to use magical sci-fi hyperspace or wormholes or something... then to make interstellar travel playable and fun, they need something that can supply very high Isp at decent thrust levels.\u00A0 Something has to fill that slot.\u00A0 And as long as they continue to model the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ephysical laws\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E appropriately... I don\u0027t think the actual numbers are the really important thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s sort of like ion drives.\u00A0 KSP ion drives are at least a thousand times more powerful (in terms of thrust) than IRL ones... but they kinda had to do that, because if they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eactually\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E modeled real ones, they\u0027d take so long to work that players would lose patience and almost nobody would use them.\u00A0 So they made a design choice to put in something that has high enough thrust to be playable... but still is much, much less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E than most engines in exchange for a much higher Isp.\u00A0 That way, it helps to educate players about the tradeoff, even if it\u0027s a \u0022toy\u0022 one with numbers that are easier than IRL.\u00A0 \u0022This is the sort of thing you have to think about when you have a whole lot of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E but very tiny thrust\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad didn\u0027t make ion drives 1000x too powerful because they don\u0027t know how ion drives work.\u00A0 They did it because they wanted something \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elike\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E ion drives, and needed to make compromises for playability.\u00A0 And frankly, I think they made a pretty reasonable decision in that regard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think metallic hydrogen is in a similar boat.\u00A0 They needed some futuristic propulsion technologies to bridge the gap for interstellar travel, and they wanted a variety of them, and they\u0027ve chosen to put gameplay first.\u00A0 So the metallic hydrogen is a handy way to do that, among other things that they haven\u0027t shown us yet.\u00A0 Personally, as long as it\u0027s still governed by Isp and needing to make engineering decisions about tradeoffs, I\u0027m fine with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor myself?\u00A0 I like KSP as a tool for teaching \u0022how does space travel basically work\u0022.\u00A0 This XKCD strip
