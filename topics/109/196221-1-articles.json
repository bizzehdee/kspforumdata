I posted some ideas which I thought might be acceptable compromises for all involved. One of these ideas was that the game should include a tech progression editor, a tool used at the creation of a game to decide where, when, and whether the player unlocks certain parts, classes of technology, etc. This is essentially just turning a toggle for X propulsion system into a system for greater personalization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, one could remove all fusion drives, or make Vectors available early in the progression. Tweaks to the progression could push players to build SSTOs or reusable rockets earlier in the game by making other tech unavailable, or increasing cost, or whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pros are that one does not have to use mods to alter the progression, one can easily remove unwanted tech from the game, and also more customization. The con, I believe, is that the community could lose a sense of a common gameplay progression. Although, this doesn\u0027t seem so negative, considering that any misconceptions could be resolved by a simple explanation to another player. \u0022I\u0027m playing with torch drives moved up to mid-game, and Orion drives removed\u0022 or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027ve got the poll for you guys.

The time and effort it would take to create a custom progression system would entirely defeat the balance the developers are so delicately trying to achieve. Regarding your point that a player should be allowed to remove technologies they have no interest in - they can simply ignore any parts they\u0027ve unlocked and don\u0027t plan to use. To those players wishing to shake up and re-balance the game to their liking - this is fine, but I wouldn\u0027t expect nor desire Intercept to take time our of their schedule to accommodate such players. There\u0027s simply bigger and more important features to work on. I fully expect that changes to the progression of KSP 2 will find their way to players through mods - but for now I believe Intercept should work on multiplayer, stability, and colonies as a priority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-10T03:51:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2020 03:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by prestja\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SOXBLOX","CreatedById":204106,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-10T04:38:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223835186\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196221\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221597031389\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022200888\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022prestja\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n43 minutes ago, prestja said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding your point that a player should be allowed to remove technologies they have no interest in - they can simply ignore any parts they\u0027ve unlocked and don\u0027t plan to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I tried telling them that before.

I don\u0027t think Squad did a great job with it, and somebody with an overly complex editor with lots of moving parts isn\u0027t going to do any better, unless the do have experience designing game systems.

It\u0027s... How do I explain game development to a sane person? You\u0027ve ever seen Wallace and Gromit? Now picture game developers making games like Wallace makes his breakfast. Except, with deadlines and requests from marketing. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s environment making the people or people making the environment, but it\u0027s a unique industry. And part of it is huge contrast between \u0022This is how you do X,\u0022 and \u0022These are the specific tools you use for X\u0022. The former is at the foundation of almost all design - it can get pretty dogmatic on how things are done. But then you get to actual implementation, and there are going to be almost as many of these as there are teams working on it. There are some rare exceptions. Pretty much everyone uses Photoshop for 2D assets. Pretty much everyone uses Visual Studio for code. There\u0027s just a handful of 3D editing tools that everyone is using. That sort of thing. But standard editor for a tech tree? Unless you\u0027re working with a specific engine, like Unity or Unreal, we don\u0027t even get a \u0022standard\u0022 way to draw UI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor tech tree specifically, there are additional considerations. If all you had was collection of nodes forming a dependency graph, where each node contains a list of items it unlocks, you can make a generic drag-and drop UI for it. Problem is, you\u0027re unlikely to ever be happy with just moving the tech between nodes. If I make ion engines more accessible, maybe I should make the consume a bit more power to keep things balanced? Or adjust the I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E? How many little corrections do you need to actually make a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebalanced\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0tech tree? All of these adjustments don\u0027t technically have to be accessible from tree editor itself, but they have to be accessible somewhere, and if you plan to distribute the settings, these things will have to be stored together. So a generic solution here doesn\u0027t seem like it\u0027d cut it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut like I outlined above, the issue is greater. There are elements that are far more common in games that don\u0027t have anything remotely like a standard implementation. If you ever make a game, you will never be satisfied with limitations of your tools or your systems. There will always be special cases you want to handle. Some limitations you\u0027ll have to just accept. If you\u0027re working with Unity, you\u0027re not going to get too involved in changing how simulation or rendering work. But then there\u0027s still so much you can do by modifying individual behaviors. Sure, you can probably find a character movement script on the Unity market, but will you be satisfied with what it does for your game? Probably not. And that leads to a culture of reinventing the wheel at every step along the way. We try to be practical as much as possible, but in the end, every game ends up being a Rube Goldberg contraption made up of salvaged components made to do something they were never meant to and a bunch of ad-hoc solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-18T09:40:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223840012\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196221\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221597727423\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118580\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mattinoz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, mattinoz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese sorts of tech trees are in so many games you\u0027d think there would be a standard app and file structure that would work across many many games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57710-k2/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002257710\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57710-k2/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@K^2\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0explained the game development side of why this would not work, I have another side to bring up: game design stagnation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want KSP2 salvaging how the progression work from KSP, let alone a whole bunch of games having the same kind of progression just because \u0022that\u0027s how\u00A0TechTree 2.42 works\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-18T15:16:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223840050\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196221\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221597739997\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe try to be practical as much as possible, but in the end, every game ends up being a Rube Goldberg contraption made up of salvaged components made to do something they were never meant to and a bunch of ad-hoc solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHahahaha... isn\u0027t that true with most software out there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-19T00:38:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223840172\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196221\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221597763801\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113880\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shdwlrd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, shdwlrd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHahahaha... isn\u0027t that true with most software out there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a spectrum.
