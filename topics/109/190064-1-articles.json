They may decide to basically stop at some point like most developers do; or we could get a DLC.\u00A0 But KSP1 and KSP2 are being developed by 2 different teams, so i wouldn\u0027t be shocked if both end up being sold and patched while the other exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2- Star Theory has officially stated that it won\u0027t be possible to port mods, and that no tools will be given to do so. Both are running Unity, so that may ease the transition. However; texture formats and the general structure of animations and models can still change within the same engine. So don\u0027t take the same engine being used to mean you won\u0027t have to start from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the ultimate answer really is that we don\u0027t know; we won\u0027t know until KSP2 is released and is a product we can buy. If Star Theory were feeling EXCEPTIONALLY NICE; then they would provide builds a month or so in advance to modders so they could get their heads around it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut such kindness isn\u0027t to be found in today\u0027s world it seems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
