that KSP2 will allow modding from day one, with a very incomplete game, I have to consider that the modding community will quickly outpace the rate of official development.\u00A0 Modders can build sub-systems, parts, even overhaul the graphics, and there\u0027s every reason to feel that the community, as enthusiastic as it is for a release-ready game, will get to work quickly to make it one.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would posit that modders need to be able to attain \u00223rd Party Contributor\u0022 status.\u00A0 \u00A0Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) does this with their modules.\u00A0 In fact, over half the modules available in the game are made by 3rd-party developers and modders.\u00A0 They all get vetted, of course, and tested, but this effectively doubles the rate of their development, and allows the game to reach a breadth it would never reach otherwise.\u00A0 \u00A0The Early Access version of the game will certainly be bug-fixed, added too, and embellished the way the original was, and I think that add-ons need to have a procedure and policy in place to be tandem to official development, sanctioned and vetted by the dev team, for release in official updates.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe current timeline of 2024 for the 1.0 release and 2025-2026 for the complete game, based on extrapolation of current development speed, could be halved if this approach is encouraged.\u00A0 \u00A0It has worked very well in other games, and indeed is essential to any large-scale game in this modern era of technology.\u00A0 The modules, the coding, are all too complex for any one development team to complete in any timeline that renders them relevant to the platform ability of their age.\u00A0 What was started as a Unity 5 project, under a single development team timeline, would be 3-4 versions of game technology old by the time it was released.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis represents a larger shift in the industry, as well.\u00A0 Many companies are recognizing that it\u0027s not feasible to field a complete game on their own anymore, and this, I believe, is why modding is allowed from the start (along with precedent and tradition in KSP).\u00A0 I think, to officially recognize these contributions as being not just add-ons, but essential core-game developments in their own right, is essential to completing the game.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-26T10:01:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmods often dont have the same

don\u0027t agree, to be honest.\u00A0 DCS is a great example of this.\u00A0 Their modules have to meet certain standards and criteria, and they have policies and procedures for how to implement them, that the 3rd-party contributor must meet.\u00A0 That game is a stellar success, not in spite of those, but because of them.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Freespace Mod community is also a great example of this.\u00A0 For the last two decades, they\u0027ve been modding that old engine, and have done truly impressive work.\u00A0 The Diaspora stand-alone, featuring the Battlestar Galactica universe was, simply put, undersold.\u00A0 That could have been put out by a studio with investors.\u00A0 It was a team of volunteers.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDCS was never a complete game when it was released, it was released in \u0027modules\u0027, similar to KSP\u0027s timeline.\u00A0 It worked because the modules came at a frequency quick enough to keep interest, and the community did not feel like a half-finished game was released and then half-worked on.\u00A0 That\u0027s a huge and difficult impression to maintain.\u00A0 Loss of interest has killed so many titles on launch, and KSP has a very, very real danger of getting some negative feedback on EA release, given the time it\u0027s taken them to get just the bare minimum done for it.\u00A0 If we can help float interest and positive feedback with a vibrant contributor community, officially, and not just random modders, then it will be a massive asset to the development team, and the longstanding of the game.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe modding community is what made KSP 1 have the community and longevity it still enjoys today, and I feel that in order to produce KSP2 in a timeline that meets interest, and to continue that interest, that community needs to be at the table, with the devs, as the development continues.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoldForest","CreatedById":77770,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-26T17:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022
