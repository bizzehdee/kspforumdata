If we were to have something like a neutron star in the game, I think it should simply have a \u0022kill\u0022 radius similar to how the gas giants work. It could probably even be marked as \u0022sea level\u0022 in UI so that you know to stay above it. And anything safe distance away might as well stay on rails just like with every other body in the game, as deviation from classical orbit wouldn\u0027t be high enough to bother with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlike neutron stars, black holes don\u0027t really have an upper limit on mass. At least, not that we know of. And particularly massive black holes can actually have very low tidal forces all the way down to event horizon. You can survive a dive into a supermassive black hole like the one at the center of our galaxy. Well, survive passing the event horizon. Once you\u0027re through, all trajectories lead to singularity, and at some point tidal forces are coming for you anyways. But the point is that you can\u0027t handle supermassive black holes with the same approach as neutron stars for purposes of the game. You\u0027d have to actually model all the nonsense going on if you wanted to be remotely realistic, and that\u0027s a bit much even for a game running on a completely custom engine, let alone poor old Unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my vote would be a definite no on black holes, but a maybe on neutron stars.\u00A0Just\u00A0treat them basically as compact stars with a tidal stress kill radius and\u00A0no special physics beyond that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-12T09:58:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224002194\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203721\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221625874533\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150330\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cubinator\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/9/2021 at 7:48 PM, cubinator said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A tidally locked planet\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe Rask and Rusk will be tidally locked to one another though I assume you mean tidally locked to the parent star\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maria Sirona","CreatedById":210882,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-12T11:39:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would love to see a giant gas planet (bigger than Jool) with various different moons, including one Kerbin-style moon with breathable air, a blue sky, and plants, and a gas moon (like a gas planet but it orbits a planet already so it\u0027s a moon) around twice the size of Kerbin.
