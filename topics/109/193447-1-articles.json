Namely beamed propulsion of some sort. The kinetic energy of an object moving at 0.866c is about equal to its rest mass energy. Manufacturing antimatter takes, at a minimum, twice its rest mass energy (because such reactions generate normal matter as well). It\u0027s much worse than that though.

But instead of using massless photons that must travel at the speed of light you use particles that can travel at any energy. Then you \u0022reflect\u0022 them off the vehicle, likely using something similar to a magnetic nozzle among other hardware. Such a system would be vastly more efficient - the particles can be accelerated by an accelerator and then decelerated by the vehicle to rest (relative to the accelerator). And it doesn\u0027t suffer from the rocket equation since the energy source and the propellant are external to the vehicle. Such a setup would maximize the kinetic energy delivered to the vehicle. Accelerating 1000 tonnes to 100 million m/s would then just take the kinetic energy of 1000 tonnes moving at 100 million m/s - assuming perfect efficiency like we did for antimatter. We already know that kinetic energy -\u00A05.4601e\u002B21 Joules. Thirty times less. But this is scalable - to go to 0.866c like we wanted to earlier we would need 51840 tonnes of mass-energy to create the necessary antimatter, but only 1000 tonnes of mass-energy if we use beamed propulsion. We can also go the other way - more sedate speeds of 1000 km/s, something more likely for interplanetary travel. At such a velocity you\u0027d be wasting massive amounts of energy to use antimatter, you spend more than 1800 times the kinetic energy you get. Antimatter just isn\u0027t practical for propulsion.

Not considering that though, I feel this argument fails since energy requirements to generate fuel shouldn\u0027t need to be considered if the ship itself isn\u0027t generating the fuel. The point of fueling a ship is just to pack it with as much energy as possible with as little mass as possible and a 3% efficiency seems worth it for getting 170x the energy density per unit mass of perfectly efficient fusion, especially\u00A0if that mass will be brought along up to relativistic speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me though this all seems\u00A0 like type 1 civilization requirements to do and Kerbals seem to be, like us, a type 0 civ. If the base lore though allowed us to progress through the arc\u00A0of type 0 to type 1 and perhaps beyond I think it would be allowable. All depends on the scale the developers set for us in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-30T15:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223778190\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022193447\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221588229292\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180102\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mcwaffles2003\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, mcwaffles2003 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFusion does nowhere close to the same amount of matter-\u0026gt; energy conversion as matter-antimatter annihilation\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, deuterium-deuterium fusion yields a mass difference of\u00A00.025602\u202C Au (2.014102*2 - 4.002602)[2 deuterium - 1 helium] where as antimatter annihilation would yeild a mass difference of\u00A04.028204 Au ( 1 deuterium annihilating with 1 anti deuterium).

The advantage of antimatter is that you can make arbitrarily small explosions with fusion or fission. But this is already possible with Z pinch for fission and other methods for fusion - antimatter is too much hassle to use for nuclear drives that have other methods of initiating their reactions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA fusion drive has no hope of reaching antimatter energy densities.

There is no such thing as a perfectly columnated beam, all beams disperse over distance and this isn\u0027t a problem with current technologies but fundamental physics, specifically diffraction:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m aware of the engineering difficulties associated with particle beam based propulsion. Perfectly collimated beams do not exist.

But there are other options. Instead of a beam of particles we can send a stream of discrete objects - a mass stream. This has a few advantages. No beam collimation, for one. But it can also be guided while en route to the vehicle. The issue becomes one of how to accelerate the propellant but there are solutions to that - Sailbeam is one such solution, and many others exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe option space for mass beam propulsion is quite large, from particle beams to any other method of accelerating small objects to large energies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means for any ship traveling significantly far from the beam source there will be an exponential drop off in efficiency unless were supposing an infinitely large collector. In short your beam propulsion system would work for travel near already developed areas of space but not sufficiently far away where collection drop off becomes significant. This also wouldn\u0027t work in a colonized area if the target destination doesn\u0027t have a beam propulsion system ready as now the craft has no way to decelerate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned above there are methods we already know of that would deal with the problem of hitting the spacecraft.

It takes a while to set up but after a few flights you can establish a proper decelerator at the destination. This would primarily be an infrastructure investment allowing for less expensive interplanetary travel - in that specific context.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor other star systems you could use a magsail to decelerate.

Not considering that though, I feel this argument fails since energy requirements to generate fuel shouldn\u0027t need to be considered if the ship itself isn\u0027t generating the fuel. The point of fueling a ship is just to pack it with as much energy as possible with as little mass as possible and a 3% efficiency seems worth it for getting 170x the energy density per unit mass of perfectly efficient fusion, especially if that mass will be brought along up to relativistic speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnergy requirements to generate fuel are important - this is called \u0022Energy Returned for Energy Invested\u0022, and in the case of rockets it\u0027s a function of how much energy the fuel (and the rocket) costs to produce and how much energy you give the payload, among other things. If it takes too much energy then there are likely better uses for that energy. If a ship costs too much energy just to provide its fuel then it\u0027s not worth fueling the ship, not when there are better uses for that energy or better alternatives to get the same job done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur current energy consumption is small indeed, but so is 170 petawatts. That\u0027s only 62 tonnes of mass-energy per year. You\u0027d need much, much more than that to produce antimatter since most of that energy will be used for other things. Energy abundance of the type necessary to produce antimatter isn\u0027t going to happen on Earth - the waste heat alone would turn the planet into an oven.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that the 3% efficiency figure is a best case scenario (provided the exhaust velocity is 100 million m/s). A best case scenario. What you need to understand here is that antimatter production will be vastly less efficient - that efficiency number is probably going to be in the thousandths after considering real difficulties in producing antimatter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAntimatter is not a useful substance. It\u0027s too much hassle and takes too much energy to use properly. Let\u0027s put it this way. If the best case scenario is 30 times as much energy than vehicle kinetic energy, then that also means we can send 30 times more vehicles using mass beam propulsion than with antimatter. Antimatter\u0027s energy costs are too large, and remember this is best case. It\u0027s far more likely to be 300 times or even 3000, perhaps more. This means that a civilization that uses antimatter for propulsion could have sent hundreds or thousands of times more vehicles using mass beam propulsion (or some other alternative). In fact, a fusion drive to the same speed (100 million m/s) would be more economical - you\u0027d need vastly more fuel to do it but you can (at least theoretically) use the most abundant element in the universe as your fuel. You\u0027d have to use staging and lord knows what else, but the fuel already exists, unlike antimatter. Now I don\u0027t think we should do that either, but it would be more economical than antimatter. In fact if we wanted to go slower - about 10% of the speed of light, we\u0027d need nearly 70 times as much energy just to produce the antimatter than vehicle kinetic energy. A fusion engine would have a much larger mass ratio - but that mass would be a material that actually appears naturally, so it\u0027d be much easier to acquire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAntimatter gives you a lot of bang for the kilogram, but much less bang for the \u0022buck\u0022. Or perhaps, much less bang for the Joule. And that\u0027s before getting into the difficulties creating and storing antimatter. It\u0027s possible, but it will be difficult. Let alone engineering a beam core antimatter drive...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
