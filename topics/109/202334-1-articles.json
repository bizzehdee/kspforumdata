In my personal opinion I think all the exoplanets, star systems, and planets should show in sandbox and science mode. This just makes sense from the stance of the original game. However, career mode is almost like a story. So it does make sense for other stars and exoplanets to pop up after certain events, contracts, upgrades, or time.

For KSP2 I hope they add some more cheat options. I think all the cheats from KSP should be in KSP2 but some others should be added.

Just a tiny bit. Why? Well. They are stars after all and stars blamed together in the night sky in the real world. And from tur space realism stars would be a bit brighter if they were closer to us.

The question is not as simple as one may think, it\u0027s simple in KSP1, as you can\u0027t build infrastructure and everything you ever launch comes from a single site.

The question is not as simple as one may think, it\u0027s simple in KSP1, as you can\u0027t build infrastructure and everything you ever launch comes from a single site.

Basically Minecraft\u0027s creative mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other is KSP1 sandbox, literally, the same level of tech plus some minor additions, bases and stations but not colonies and only the Kerbol system. That at the start at least, it then gets filled with content you unlock in progression mode with an optional \u0022cheat debug mode\u0022 that gives you the other option I said in some men\u00F9 clearly labeled as a cheat/debug mode.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think there\u0027s any danger of other gamemodes (read: THE other gamemode) in KSP 2 becoming identical to sandbox. Namely, it seems that you\u0027re going to need physical resources to build structures and vehicles which aren\u0027t simply \u0022credits\u0022. So I think that a sandbox mode will not only see free reign of the initial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but also the cost of building everything would be reduced to zero resources. When you\u0027re playing adventure mode in KSP 2 the only way you should be remotely approaching this whole \u0022never wanting for resources\u0022 thing is when you\u0027re really, really late game. Like, 100\u002B nuclear salt water ferries doing automated runs from an asteroid mine every synod to your main orbital shipyard level of late game. Or whatever the equivalent to that is as actually implemented. The difference between sandbox and any other mode is thinking to yourself \u0022I want to build a 200 meter long colony ship to go to this other star system!\u0022 and then not having to grind for resources to make the parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway I have nothing else constructive to add, but this does seem to be a suggestion thread so have an MS Paint concept doodle I made for a radiator part ages ago!
