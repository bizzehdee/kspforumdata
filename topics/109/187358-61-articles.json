Most peoples\u2019 playstyles, including mine, would not work with this system. Problems like the one you pointed out above can be resolved through cooperation and a specific group dynamic (for example, you assume that the person missing their window and failing the mission is a problem, which it isn\u2019t for everyone, or that waiting two weeks is a problem, which again isn\u2019t for everyone).

My assumption from the beginning was that the multiplayer system would not enforce cooperation, outside of supplying optional moderator tools. I could understand the concern that people would abuse a shared time warp in order to hinder others, but remember that this is a game played among friends and this sort of toxic behavior shouldn\u2019t occur often. Additionally, the moderator tools are there to deal with the rare cases that someone crosses a line in their behavior. Shared warp is no more exploitable than other systems for ruining peoples\u2019 experiences, and it seems strange that you are singling it out as a system that would be crippled by competition. In fact, turn based competition is a well known style of play used in many games, and I see no reason to believe that someone would drag out the timer on their \u201Cturn\u201D with their friends.
