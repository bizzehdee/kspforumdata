I base this solely on the fact that I can, and regularly do, run up to three (3) separate, full instances of KSP right beside each other, where I let them use different monitors. In some cases I\u0027ve done this on a single monitor, on the laptop, alt-tabbing from one to the next and back. With the exception of moments where even a single instance starts displaying frame-drop or stuttering in the display, it runs perfectly fluid (like when loading craft with exceptionally high number of parts, or large number of undocked ports, etc... the known performance killers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese rigs were not gaming beasts even when they were newly bought- I\u0027ve never liked wasting money on overpriced \u0027top of the line\u0027 stuff, when less can do 90% as good. One is even a laptop (!), and both of them are over 3 years old. Which leads me to conclude that whatever the overhead may be of running just one extra window separate of the main view can hardly have any performance impact at all, if I can run three entire instances side by side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGranted, I run without mods. Still, three instances, compared to a single instance with one extra window showing the map view. What are we really talking about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly. Plus this will put much less strain on the computer because it\u0027s not doing extra physics calculations. The vast majority of lag in ksp comes from physics calculations, which my 7 year old secondary computer can handle at playable fps. The only lag from this would be rendering the map view graphics. Thus the extra strain would be on the gpu which ksp1 hardly uses at all and people with slower you\u0027d could turn down their graphics settings or not use the feature (I\u0027m pretty sure the map view graphics are not loaded when you are not in the map view.) Also, technical debt would probably not be an issue because they have to do 95% of the work anyway. All they have to do is tell the game to load the map view on a second screen, which is fine since they already did the work to make the map view. Also the 44% of users who have a second screen are not the only people who can use this. If it was a resizable window which would not be that much extra work anyone with a large enough screen would use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be fair though, it is probably more complicated than you would expect and it\u0027s not a must have, however consider the following: deadlines are probably not an issue considering that it should have been out for a few months by now, this is a 60 dollar game and if ksp2 is not a mess of spaghetti code like ksp1 than it will probably be a lot easier than in ksp1. Also the argument that they could add it later is flawed because adding it when the original dev team is no longer in the project and the code uses a version of unity that\u0027s probably going to be out of date by then is going to cause problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-15T00:04:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2020 12:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by catloaf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-15T00:22:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been wishing for multi-screen support for years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve gotten into the argument where I don\u0027t care if KSP has clouds, but others seem to think it\u0027s a felony that there are none in KSP. This seems to fall into that sort of argument. So one\u00A0solution (for those who don\u0027t want their game bloated by code they don\u0027t think they\u0027ll use) would be to put these sort of features as DLCs. Want clouds? Buy the Cloudy\u00A0DLC. Want Multi-monitor? Buy the MMmmm DLC. More planets? There will probably be\u00A0a DLC for that. Want all the things? Buy the Universal pass, and save 50% off the individual prices!!

Apparently not many, and not me, not exactly (my kid has started using an old monitor I had kicking around, hooked to his laptop-on-his-desk Minecraft one one screen, Let\u0027sPlay videos on the other). How many play on a laptop? I dunno, but I do. But here is the kicker: in this age of streaming services, how many have a separate TV? A big TV. A wall-mounted TV. For those desktop PCers, is your PC in the same room as your bigscreen TV? Cuz no, I don\u0027t have multiple monitors, but I do have a kind-of-big (small compared to the 80-inchers out there) 50\u0022 TV on the wall, which I can and do hook to my laptop on occasion (I have a pretty long HDMI cable). If your desktop PC is near the house TV, the same thing can be done, since most PCs have an HDMI-out these days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause KSP is a space program simulator, after all. And what would be more glorious than running your flight screen on your PC (laptop or desktop) with the map screen visible on that big TV on the wall, just like Mission Control. Because that is our role here: We, the players,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EARE\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Mission Control.

Intercept Games will probably be drastically reduced and have it\u0027s budget cuts after launch. c. Many people seem to think that ksp2 will not be stable at launch (EA has reported this post.) Considering that the game has had multiple delays, costs 60 dollars and will launch as a finished product (ksp1 still has that early access feel although I would say it will be done when the revamps are done, probably in 1.12 or 1.13.) So unless T2 wants to ruin any good will left in the community (and any chance of selling the game, much less any dlcs) they will release the game in a finished state with all non dlc content. If they run into a big problem or have deadline crunch then they should forget about it but if not they should include it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-15T04:24:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2020 04:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by catloaf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-15T08:52:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204108-catloaf/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022204108\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204108-catloaf/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@catloaf\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0it is an OPTIONAL feature that is wanted by less than 45% of people according to that poll.
