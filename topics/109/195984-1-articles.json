I do agree with Nate Simpson though, although another planet is something I personally want. Well ok, I sorta lied, I really think that by preserving the stock system, a lot of good features that they could have added are just not practical with this self imposed limitation (n-body*, small Jool moons, Dres moons, Lindor/Sarnus/GP2.) So I definitely have mixed fealings, but am also definitely on the keep it the same but change it a little and add new stuff mindset. Plus, it seems like squad had plans to improve the system but those never can to be. So maybe they should consider adding more planets in a future update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*It seems like there adding a hybrid n-body/patched comics system to make Rask and Risk work properly, but I think that a full n-body system will add better gameplay and be less complex to code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-31T03:03:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2020 03:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by catloaf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-31T03:17:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it would be okay to add new features to existing worlds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAxial tilt, for example.
