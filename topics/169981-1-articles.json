Since I don\u0027t ever need to operate the \u0027crew hatch\u0027 the label for it is occasionally getting the way while trying to trigger science, and getting Jeb or Val to get eva reports. I do see that some of the orbital debris isn\u0027t decaying into the atmosphere as I\u0027d otherwise expect. I\u0027ve got one large stage that dips down to 42000m but persists in its orbit.
