Currently I\u0027m at the stage where I\u0027m working on making sure it will fly well and I\u0027ve hit a bit of a road block, as the way FAR appears to work now is a lot different from the last time I played the game, and at this point I\u0022m not sure what I\u0027m looking at when I generate the information via FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is what I have right now. Its no where near a finished state and is mostly just where I\u0027m at right now. In order to go farther, I really need some help on what I\u0027m looking at what I need to fix. I\u0027ve already test flown this (For reentry) and while it stays stable it rolls for some reason.

The green curve shows you the amount of cross-sectional area over the length of your craft; for proper area ruling, you want no abrupt changes in the smoothness of the graph. The yellow line measures changes in cross-section ; you\u0027d like to have this line as flat as you can possibly make it. Finally, the blue line measures pressure over the length of your craft; where the graph crests, your craft is creating the greatest amount of drag.All three lines help to identify where your craft will create drag and gve you an idea of where to make adjustments in the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as far as your stability concerns go - you can check those in the dynamic stability simulation tab. Drain your plane of fuel and hit the simulator around the time all hell brakes loose in terms of altitude and speed. I believe the parameters you want to check are N\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u00B8\u003C/sub\u003E, L\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u00B8\u003C/sub\u003E, and M\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E. Put a value of 1 in the beta and w parameters (not at the same time, necessarily) and then mash go - if you see a graph that oscillates but the oscillation damps down or stays the same, you\u0027re good. If you see anything else, your craft is a no-go, and will need to be redesigned to maintain stability under the listed conditions. Your static stability parameters can tell you this as well - any red numbers are pretty much an automatic wash on your design, especially if you then run the simulation and get the aforementioned \u0022bad\u0022 graph shape (if you get a red number but then test it in the simulator and get a \u0022good\u0022 shape, then it\u0027s something that\u0027s probably livable; I myself have never seen this particular happy state of affairs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions - add dihedral to the wing, make the tail bigger and/or move the center of mass forward.
