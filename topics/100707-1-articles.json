Waht I really need is an easier way to shut down the engines. I guess I\u0027ll have to try manually shutting some off when I\u0027m on the last stretch. If I fly correctly I should be able to circularize the orbit below 70k and then push up with that for alot less fuel. Not sure about the range. That is something I\u0022m still working on. But the design can get into space. It\u0027s just about how little none pure liquid fuel reserves I can use. Though I did just get up to 799 air intake and seems to have problems on the runway.

It allows you to fly more in the third level of atmosphere a lot better. This could allow for much cheaper runs if it can lift heavy loads for getting to orbital bodies.
