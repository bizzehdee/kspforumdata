Therfore you can invent whole \u0022stages\u0022 and as more they are used unchanged they cheaper they get....as a result of the experience on the assembly line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould work like this - if you take any parts out and put it together you pay 100% of its single peace price. As you can save the whole launcher you can save the stage or a probe, a lander, a satellite.... And for any stage-configuration that one uses again the price for the parts-set will drop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing a stage a second time will drop its price for 10%, a third time will drop by additional 5%, from 4-10th launch the drop each time is 2,5%, up to the 25th launch is 1,25% and there after ist 0,75% up to the 45th launch - then the price of the stage configuration has decreased allmost to 50% and will stay there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltering designs would also be possible this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoving a part out of a stage will reduce the stage price only by 25% of the price of this part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding a part will increase the price of the stage by 10% \u002B the parts price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: After 10 launches one adds RCS thanks and thrusters to a stage - starting price was 10.000 at the first launch, by the 10th it was 7.161. Now the price increases again to 7.877 \u002B the price of the RCS stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will result in a more real live behavior of the financial aspect of KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the idea of adding things to the game that make for more ways we can optimize rocket design. For me the game is all about learning rocket design and learning how to fly rockets. Anything that adds more to this learning process is adding more game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyrunner27","CreatedById":64031,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T16:14:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sjwt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sjwt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre we going to have event driven tech? One of my fav old time games had quite a few event driven techs.. You had to try something and fail at it before you realised you needed that tech, very Kerbal if you ask me..\u003Cp\u003EImagine only getting to research heatshield after 3 differnt failed missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh its cold, no food and hard to breath up their... life support anyone??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mission failed due to too much drag?
