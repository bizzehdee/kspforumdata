Remember that mod that let you pop out of your seat and actually move around your ship? I would really love if something like that was a thing in KSP 2. Mainly because while walking around in your ship would be awesome! I\u0027m hoping we\u0027ll get to walk around and look at the insides of these HUGE facilities they are building for planet colonies. Maybe they\u0027ll just focus on the space stuff, and the colonies will just be there to make fuel and not to be looked at too closely. I hope that\u0027s not the case but it could be. Maybe if you ask a dev about it maybe they\u0027ll say eh, i\u0027m sure someone will mod it in, but it\u0027d be so awesome for something like that to be in the stock game... but just a wish is all. Either way this game is gonna be AMAZING! please release tomorrow.... lol jk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-05T13:54:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I don\u2019t care about the interiors- they could be done to look pretty just for the portrait pictures in the corner of the screen and completely blank everywhere else as far as I\u2019m concerned, because I almost never use internal views and the memory saved by not having them there could be used elsewhere, e.g. to make the outside of those ships/bases/stations look better as I see those\u00A0all the time.

As sparse as it is, I sometimes fly my craft in IVA, especially if they\u0027re equipped with one of the handful of cockpits that offer decent visibility\u00A0-- it can be a lot of fun especially for things like seaplanes, helicopters, VTOLs, or just small aircraft that are good at bush landings. With better cockpits and configurable instrumentation, you could fairly easily turn this into a flight-sim lite. That would open up a whole new dimension of gameplay fun.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kernel Kraken","CreatedById":181383,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-05T16:27:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want interior prop parts like chairs, beds, tables, large computers and others.
