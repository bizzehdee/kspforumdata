all,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust thought I\u0027d post a little about my frustrating experiences with KSP since purchasing it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can\u0027t seem to get anything right with this game. \u00A0I\u0027ve been playing flight sims for 20 years dating back to Pro Pilot for Windows 95/98 and getting deep into MS Flight Sim and Combat Flight Sim. \u00A0 But KSP just keeps putting me through the wringer and I\u0027m getting tired of failing all the time and having to launch again, and again, and again. \u00A0When I get one thing corrected, something else comes up. \u00A0For example..\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSimple Orbit...\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt takes me 4 to 7 tries to get a descent orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn one attempt, \u00A0I\u0027ll be burning horizonally just fine but the periapsis raises sooo slooooww. \u00A0 \u00A0Then the apoapsis begins climbing very fast and next thing I know, \u00A0my apoapsis is halfway to Mun while the periapsis is only 65km.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOk, now, \u00A0I finally get into orbit after about 3 or 4 tries. \u00A0I have feul so lets try a Mun flyby. \u00A0 RIGHT!\u003Cbr\u003E\nSet a maneuver node and get my apoapsis out to Munar orbit, \u00A0move the node to get a Mun encounter. \u00A0 Easy right?\u003Cbr\u003E\nComes time to burn, \u00A0line up with the blue marker and burn when the timer hits 0, \u00A0burn until the white meter is gone and the clock reaches 0 on burn time, \u00A0 my orbit is way, way past Mun with no encounter. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI try it again, \u00A0this time burning 1/2 before and 1/2 after node encounter. \u00A0 Now I don\u0027t even get anywhere near my node\u0027s path, \u00A0I get some orbit way off of where I want. \u00A0 I can\u0027t get this right and I really want to get into this game and I\u0027m trying really hard but I\u0027m getting beyond frustrated and ready to move on to other games. \u00A0I\u0027m so tired or re-launching. \u00A0Why does this game have to be so DARN HARD???????\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOk, \u00A0I get close to Mun after a bit of luck and somehow got the node right, (don\u0027t kow how I did it). \u00A0 I am nice and close and now I can\u0027t steer my ship, \u00A0I\u0027m tumbling all over the place and there\u0027s no way to get home because I\u0027ve lost control of my ship, \u00A0REVERT YET AGAIN! \u00A0UGGHHH!! \u00A0 I\u0027m beginning to hate this game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEVERY TIME I get something corrected, \u00A0something else goes wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen, \u00A0when I get the tumbling right, \u00A0the game crashed!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing wrong or why this has to be so complicated. \u00A0I shouldn\u0027t need to research for 2 hours just to get a descent orbit and I have given up on even trying a Mun landing, \u00A0I can\u0027t even loop around it and return home like Apollo 13 did. \u00A0 Either this is the hardes flight sim ever made or I\u0027m just getting to old for this crap and need to hang up my virtual wings. \u00A0I don\u0027t want to hate KSP but it\u0027s getting easier and easier by the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust venting,\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for reading and enjoy your day.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Controversial

going to help a lot in KSP though some of the terminology will be familiar and when flying planes it will help a bit\u00A0but for rockets about the only thing is you\u00A0will know to rely on your

by limiting your choices it helps guide you to a more successful experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are able to watch internet video you might try some of the many tutorial

get lots of help.\u00A0 And search that forum there\u0027s lot\u0027s of good advice about how to do these things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you really remembering how long it first took you to master a flight simulator?\u00A0 Bet it took more than a few hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like maybe you are being a bit heavy on the controls, but without details I\u0027m just guessing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your are still having trouble with the maneuver modes maybe you are trying to push yourself to far too soon.\u00A0 Make sure you can orbit Kerbin and return safely.\u00A0 Next do a Mun encounter (not orbit) and return first, once you can do that, then go for a Mun orbit and safe return.\u00A0 After that try\u00A0\u003Ca
