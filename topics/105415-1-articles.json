This note is intended to inform SQUAD, not complain.\n\nWith that out of the way:\n\nIn the VAB, some parts simply show as black shapes:\n\nCommand modules: Mk1-2 command pod,Rovemate rover body,Stayputnik Mk1\n\nFuel tanks: FL-r10, fl-r25, fl-t200,fl-t800, Large holding tank\n\nEngines: O-10\n\nC\u0026C: Advanced large reaction wheel\n\nStructural: the multi-point connector\n\naerodynamic - no problems, all appear ok\n\nUtility: illuminator Mk2, Mk16 parachute, sevice bay (both .25 and 2.5m models)\n\nScience: M700 survey scanner\n\nExternal textures appear to be absent outside the VAB too (ie: still not visible when launched).\n\nAlso, whilst the cockpit/command module interiors are visible, the outside world is not in any cockpit/capsule. Outside just appears black no matter which way the capsule/cockpit is facing and no matter whether it\u0027s on the ground or in LKO. \n\nOnly slight variation is that from inside teh Mk3 cockpt, the windows appear a streaky blue - but still no sight of the outside world through them.\n\nNote that I have to have aerodynamic FX urned down to minimal, else I get a horrible dayglo pink mush instead (due to the age of my graphics card). Textures are set to quarter res (to aid performance). All other options at default. I note we no longer appear to be able to set the window resolution.\n\nOS is Linux Mint 17, CPU is Intel\u00AE Core2 CPU 6400 @ 2.13GHz I have 4GB RAM. Graphics card is given by sysinfo as AMD/ATI RV516 (Radeon X1300/X1550 series)\n\nPS: those graphics issues were absent in v0.9\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T23:13:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 11:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Esme**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T23:17:02Z","Content":"Hello Esme, we\u0027ll try to help ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIf this is affecting only certain parts it\u0027s possible the textures for those parts never downloaded properly, 1.0 saw Squad change from .mbm and .tga files to .dds for textures, so they all should have been replaced.\n\nSomething to try first would be to verify the game cache in Steam, or see if the patcher is working with the store copy, you can run the launcher to get the latest patcher.\n\nFailing that, a redownload of the archive.\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t resolve the issue we\u0027ll have to look deeper."},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T00:05:51Z","Content":"Does it happen to look like this?

So it is possible that the new shaders that are used for these components require newer shading support that is not supported by that specific graphics card. \n\nIn game settings there is a specific option to \u0022Fallback part shaders\u0022 which might solve this but it might reduce game performance since the shading might be processed by the CPU instead of the GPU."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:37:26Z","Content":"It\u0027d be strange to be a graphics driver issue and be cross platform, but not everyone is getting this, only a handful, which suggests bad files in the download or an uncommon settings issue.\n\nAlso, please just try the KSP.x86 and KSP.x86\\_64, not the launcher as the Squad patcher is not accessible at this time."},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:10:21Z","Content":"This is not from a bad copy because I tryed the same game and game file on a different computer (a slightly better computer) and all graphical glitches were nonexistent"},{"CreatedByName":"Esme","CreatedById":107436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:13:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027d be strange to be a graphics driver issue and be cross platform, but not everyone is getting this, only a handful, which suggests bad files in the download or an uncommon settings issue.\n\u003E Also, please just try the KSP.x86 and KSP.x86\\_64, not the launcher as the Squad patcher is not accessible at this time.\n\nSal, I was only running the launcher in order to try to get the patcher, as per your earlier email.

For myself, even if it turns out that my system can\u0027t quite play v1.0 sensibly I won\u0027t mind too much, as it plays v0.9 fine, and I can have a lot of fun with that.

Most likely the older graphics cards that those with mentioned problems have don\u0027t support the required shader level that is needed for rendering those parts. \n\nI have expirienced similar isues on my old laptop when I tried running the game that required higher shader level support that was supported by my graphics card.\n\nIn a few cases I actually managed to fix this by manually changing the shader files that shipped with that specific game to forcefully lower the shader level that is required for even loading the specific shader. But this wasn\u0027t possible at all times becouse sometimes shaders had certain shading commands in them that were only available on higher shader levels.\n\nAnother reason why I\u0027m suspecting the shadder support problems is the fact that in the games changelog it specifically says that some parts shaders were redesigned to provide better visual expirience. So I asume those shaders were made with higher shading level support in mind.\n\nWhen I get home I Will try to check the game shaders (if I can find them) and compare them with previous version of KSP to see if my suspicions are correct."},{"CreatedByName":"Esme","CreatedById":107436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:45:03Z","Content":"I wouldn\u0027t be at all surprised if you\u0027re correct, SilverWarrior (although I confess I wouldn\u0027t have a clue how to look into the things you;re describing there).

I just thought it might be useful to Squad to have feedback from folk with older PC\u0027s so they have a better idea of where the lower-end of hardware that will work with the game is, so they can advise newcomers accordingly.
