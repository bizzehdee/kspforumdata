You also have to remember that in the US people tend to shop more infrequently, for larger quantities (grocery). Hard to take the bus with 6 bags of groceries, then walk a km in the blazing sun from the closest bus stop to home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not against transit, I\u0027m saying that in many western cities it is entirely implausible largely because of your observation that the cities largely devolved AFTER the automobile. The best US cities predate cars, making them more European in feel (walking cities). Once a city is spread out, you\u0027re stuck with cars. I have seen a bus on my own street, for example. A mini-bus. A neighbor is a child psychologist, and some of her patients come way up here on public transport. I think it is scheduled in some fashion, because it\u0027s not on a route, you must have to call and the mini-bus comes from the nearest real bus stop a couple miles away or more. If I needed to go to the nearest book store on transit, it would be a nightmare. It\u0027s probably 10 km to Page One. I\u0027m unsure about calling transit here (maybe it\u0027s only for medical stuff, for low income people). Even so, I\u0027d then have to likely take 2 more buses to get there, I bet it takes at least 90 minutes each way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRunning transit at a useful frequency requires ridership at all hours to justify it. I suppose autonomous \u003Cem\u003Ebuses\u003C/em\u003E might make this a little more plausible. But you\u0027d need those buses coming down every street every few minutes to make it worthwhile to consider, so you know if you need to change buses, you\u0027ll never wait more than a few minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-28T16:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223279578\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159891\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517119333\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMerging traffic with human drivers is nothing at all like efficient. Or people in the left lane not passing. Honestly, in urban areas it\u0027s so much worse than Albuquerque. We complain if it takes 5 minutes extra to get someplace 20 miles away because it\u0027s rush hour. In LA, the traffic is... horrific. Bad enough for wasted time, but if I could read this forum and type stuff instead of driving (if I lived in LA), it would be fine. The difference of course is speed. Slow downs cause more slow downs, even when not needed A single person needlessly stepping on the brakes causes a chain reaction, even if their actual slow down is imperceptible, the cars behind brake differently, and a jam is created.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLA, particularly eastern part of the metropolis is confined between mountains, although people live in those mountains and outside of those mountains. The freeways are concentrated in the Valleys and on the west LA is confined by the coastline. LaX you essentially take off, look down, its the Pacific ocean in about 10 seconds. And LA foolishly played into the hand of the oil and car industries until it was way too late to reform the transportation system. The way LA expands is unplanned, people build in rural mountainous areas and they essentially start using farm to market roads (i.e. thousand oaks) to commute to work. FMs are basically two land roads with no shoulders. So you have a situation that people live on the other side of a mountain range and try to commute around the mountain range to get to work on freeways that are limited by confinement to expand access.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe had a freeway here, 288, it was built and there was essentially no access, Some politician down 50 miles south wanted a freeway to end in his shopping center. lol. The freeway is finally finished, and people pour in the direction of that freeway. The freeway didn\u0027t change, just the number of people trying to use it, until its so clogged people don\u0027t want to use it anymore and the flux of people slows down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou get into situations where your core planning is bad, your city is expanding outward, neither do you have planning outward, but you don\u0027t have a core to connect to. IN japan where the city subways end, the private train systems begin. The private trains existed before development because they were servicing villages out at a distance. But so all you had to do is add more stations and you have mass transit. Its expensive, but convinient, and because its there first you can tell the roads folks, go over or go under.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-28T16:30:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223279845\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159891\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517154592\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n32 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the US, anyway, light rail is \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E cost effective.

Transportation involves people\u0027s perspective. It involve whether people (users and provider) see it viable. A lot of times, you have to make it visible before you decide it\u0027s viable.

Any transit has to make many more stops than a car trip, hence it always takes longer. Even with 10 minute buses on every single street, people will wait an average of 5 minutes for a bus change. We\u0027re on a grid, so that means that driving time from house to work is the default, T, and transit time is T\u002B5 for the single change, plus any additional time for stops (and buses don\u0027t drive super fast). That doesn;t include walking to the station, either. Call it a 5 minute walk on each side of the bus trip.
