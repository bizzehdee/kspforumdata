If it\u0027s not it won\u0027t let you build it.

The text will be green if the current section is valid, and orange if it can\u0027t be created.\u00A0 I think when closing a fairing the colour is a kind of light blue.\u00A0 the text is really very hard to see and would be good to see something different in terms of it\u0027s implementation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight click on fairing base\u003Cbr\u003E\nSelect Build Fairing\u003Cbr\u003E\nDrag fairing to first point and left click to lock it off (if it doesn\u0027t lock off it\u0027s for a reason - try a slightly different point and try again)\u003Cbr\u003E\nRepeat until you have the shape you want\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo close the fairing bring the fairing inwards until the text changes to some kind of bluey green

you first attach the fairing base plate below the payload, it automatically goes into \u0022build fairing\u0022 mode with the procedural fairing stuck to your cursor.\u00A0 The basic procedure from then on is, move the mouse out and/or up from the baseplate while watching the color of the text that appears as you\u0027re building the fairing.\u00A0 If the text is green, left-click to fix that part of the fairing in place and continue building the next section.\u00A0 To complete the fairing (assuming this is a nose cone), eventually bring the sides in above the payload.\u00A0 They won\u0027t quite meet but if the text is green, when you left-click it will close off the fairing in a point.\u00A0 If this is an interstage fairing, bring it up and in to the sides of the part above and left-click when you see green text.\u00A0 That will also close the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you right-click at any point in this process, you exit \u0022build\u0022 mode and have to start over.\u00A0 To start over, right-click on the base plate and select \u0022build fairing\u0022.\u00A0 You can delete completed fairings by right-clicking the base plate and selecting \u0022delete fairing\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome tips and tricks.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t want to build the fairing immediately after you attach the base plate, just right-click to exit build mode and go about your business.\u00A0 When you later want to do the fairing, right-click on the base plate and select \u0022build fairing\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause right-clicking kills the build process, you need to position the camera where you need it ahead of time, so you don\u0027t need to move it while building the fairing.\u00A0 Either that or use the arrow and KP-/KP\u002B keys to move the camera instead of right-click and drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the base plate is the same diameter or smaller than the parts above, the 1st section of the fairing is called the \u0022base section\u0022.\u00A0 This must come out mostly horizontally at least far enough to be slightly wider than the widest thing above it.\u00A0 This includes parts that stick out the sides of the parts stacked directly above the base plate.\u00A0 If you base plate is small compared to the width of the payload, you might have to make 2 base sections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have the width of the fairing established, you can go straight up making cylinders.\u00A0 You can only go so for at a time (IOW, fairing sections have a maximum size).\u00A0 Each time you go as far as you can, left-click to lock that part in place and start with the next section.\u00A0 Once you get near or just beyond the widest part of the load, you can start bringing the fairing in towards a point.\u00A0 It\u0027s possible to do this from below the widest part of the payload, but then you\u0027ll have bits of payload clipping through the fairing, which is a bad thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your base plate is larger than the widest part of the payload, you can go straight up from the beginning.\u00A0 Also, you can run struts from the payload down to the top surface of the base plate inside the fairing, which is sometimes necessary to stabilize the payload during launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen building fairings, don\u0027t make them as small as you can.\u00A0 Give some elbow room inside them.\u00A0 This helps prevent parts of the fairing from hitting parts of the payload (they especially like to destroy solar panels).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you complete a fairing, it will appear in the staging list along with your decouplers and rocket engines.\u00A0 Be sure to\u00A0drag the fairing where it needs to be on the list.\u00A0 I recommend putting it at the very top so it won\u0027t fire when you stage anything.\u00A0 Then, once you want to open it, you can right-click on the base plate and select \u0022deploy\u0022 to fire the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo not deploy fairings while the ship is under thrust or rotating.\u00A0 This almost always causes parts of the fairing to hit the payload and/or other parts of the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JackBush","CreatedById":149535,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T23:03:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat (and
