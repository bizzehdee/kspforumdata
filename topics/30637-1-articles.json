My last quicksave was after I put Jeb, Bill, and Bob into the seats of the rover as it was parked by my lander. After yet another incident I wanted to retry, I used the quickload. The rover regenerated half upside down and buried into the Munar surface, and after a couple seconds it generated lots of explodey noises and either killed Bill or at least permanently buried him under the surface. I\u0027ve reloaded the same save probably ten times but with the same result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I fix or properly use the current quicksave? I can live with losing the rover but I don\u0027t want to use any of the Kerbals; I just pulled them off of my space station so they could be actively involved in new flights. The rover was just sitting on the surface right side up, not moving, with everyone properly seated when I made the save so I have no idea why it reloads upside down, and I can\u0027t switch to it with [ or ] before it starts to explode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoDores","CreatedById":56567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T05:53:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: when I reload the save, if I immediately hit Esc and end the flight, it deletes the rover and (presumably) returns the flight crew to home. This is the option I\u0027ll use if I can\u0027t make the rover reload correctly, but I would really rather make everything work so I can finish my tests and properly return the crew to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T06:56:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShort of editing quicksave and placing rover 1 meter above the surface i can see no other option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoDores","CreatedById":56567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T17:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does one do that?
