HOWEVER, water also engages in Hydrogen Bonding- which reduces its ISP relative to Molecular Weight even further (because a given amount of heat-injection won\u0027t raise its temperature as high, leading to lower Exhaust Velocity), so a more accurate value would be around 0.25-0.28\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it is CURRENTLY set at 0.4714 instead.

This was a clumsy attempt to model a spacecraft\u0027s surface-area, much like the stock drag-model originally (currently) modeled/models drag as increasing proportional to spacecraft mass (fortunately, this is finally being replaced with a more realistic/intuitive drag-model in KSP version 1.0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact is, \u003Cstrong\u003Eheat doesn\u0027t just radiate out of heat radiators- it also radiates off the entire skin of a spacecraft\u003C/strong\u003E (although the sun-facing side of the spacecraft also absorbs some sunlight, the net balance of absorption vs. radiation favors a relatively cool resting-temperature for most spacecraft- around -40 Celsius for a passive body in Low Earth Orbit, where it\u0027s being bombarded with Infrared radiating off the Earth...) So, if you have only a couple small solar panels on a relatively large spacecraft, you wouldn\u0027t EXPECT it to overheat quickly. Even on a relatively small satellite in Low Earth Orbit, with comparatively large deployable solar panels, the solar panels themselves act as heat radiators (out their backside), so you usually don\u0027t have a *drastic* problem with heat management (a *very* small active radiator will do) unless the solar panels become VERY large relative to the spacecraft...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at it this way- most spacecraft are designed to maximize passive heat-radiation, and absorb as little sunlight as possible. That\u0027s why the surfaces of many spacecraft are painted white, and have intentionally high albedos... Most solar panels absorb only a few Watts of sunlight per square-meter. How hot do you *think* the spacecraft would have to get before the rate of heat-radiation out the backside equaled a few Watts from a small set of solar panels?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you attach something the size of a Gigantor to a tiny probe, you\u0027ll still get overheating, even near Kerbin.
