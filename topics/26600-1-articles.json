I was the same way. I was never one for partying, either, so I spent a lot of time doing my own thing.

I\u0027m 25 now, and part of that same group of friends and I still hang out... about once or twice a week, not counting xbox-live. Otherwise, I spend all of my time by myself reading, playing ksp, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give you an idea of the sort of social life I had... I got FFXI when I was 16, just after I got my driver\u0027s license. Over the next 5 years, I dropped 10,000 hours into it. So... yeah. You\u0027re not weird. Even the bit about communicating more easily with people older than you isn\u0027t all that unusual. I STILL do that.
