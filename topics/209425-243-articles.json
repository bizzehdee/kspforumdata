using. then pick a mobo that is compatible and gives you all the interfaces you need. then you do ram (usually something on the qvl). you cant stick an amd in an intel or vise versa.\u00A0even if you have the correct socket type, you might need to flash the bios to unlock a newer chip. fortunately that is really easy these days and you can do it without a cpu in the socket. read manuals before you buy. i usually theory craft multiple different builds before settling on one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni dont really do in-generation upgrades. no point getting a low end cpu and upgrading later. first off its got to be better than what you were running previous without jumping to a higher tier. wait too long and an upgrade involves replacing most or all core components anyway, so just buy something in your budget and plan on replacing most of it next time. cases, gpus, ssds, power supplies (in good condition and in spec for your build), fans if they are good (say noctua or some other high end fan product) usually end up in multiple build iterations.\u00A0when i upgrade im usually skipping 2 or 3 generations and im unlikely to hit the same socket twice. memory too is almost a new type, except current build still uses ddr4. will do gpu upgrades periodically and storage as needed (of course with m.2 i usually coincide this with the core components, because depending on build getting at them may require a near complete disassembly, im currently fine for another terabyte or two).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree at this time, in generation upgrades made sense back 20 years ago then you had an \u002B20% performance

wisdom of using these connectors, i do appreciate the space savings as id not have been able to get the longer psu in otherwise. but i do worry because i had to fold the cables 90 degrees for

flexatx psu. a piece of bar stock to serve as the mounting point. i dont have a press break to put the bend in the sheet metal where you screws usually go. incidentally i figured out hot wo make countersunk holes in bar stock, so the side that touches the gpu would be flush (just be really aggressive with the deburr operation). the cutout was done with a dremel, holes were made for the gpu ports and the power supply fan and power cable. bracket was secured in 3 places with m3 screws and nuts. a\u00A0gpu riser cable connects the gpu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni also made a kludge adapter so the gpu could be powered by the unused cpu power connector (mobo only needed a 4-pin and the psu had a 4\u002B4). i thought for sure that would cause cpu instability, but it didnt. its an industrial supply so it actually can do its rated power.\u00A0 i didnt have a 4 pin female so i used a 10-pin instead, using the 4 in the middle that matched the keying. i didnt want to destroy the connector so i just taped off the excess pins (now that it works i might go back in and dremel off the excess).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnoise, yes, lots. other than the cpu and gpu fans, there is a 92mm noctua and a little tiny no name 40mm fan in the psu, a recipe for loud. heat, yes. the case has almost no ventilation. a small strip above the i/o shield and the top of the case, and one fan intake, as well as a place where i cut the bracket too short.\u00A0\u00A0i recommend this build for no one. i offered it to mom but she hates change. but its still the 3rd most powerful system in the house.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-04T05:04:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022
