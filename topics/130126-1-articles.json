I did end up grabbing the asteroid, and I was able to get the initial intercept distance down to 10km despite the wobbliness. However it took an extra 100-150 dV trying to get the 10km down to just a few dozen meters before I used my RCS for fine tuning.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne question though, by intercepting in interplanetary space do you mean I should leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI and intercept it, or plot an intercept course for when IT enters Kerbin\u0027s SOI?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T00:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI meant grab it while the asteoid is still at 2/3 days to the Kerbin\u0027s SOI.

(I figured out that one skipper thruster with ~2500 dV quickly turned into ~150 dV when wrangling a class C asteroid. I had another stage with a low thrust high vac. Isp engine for the capture burn because I didn\u0027t expect the skipper stage to last that long. Needless to say it only had 19 dV\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
