However, the stock parts for things like this are very limited. I\u0027ll want to make a huge, fantastic space station and end up with a few \u0022Hitchhiker\u0022 containers stuck together with a cupola and some solar panels. There are a few mods to help with this, but it would be nice to have them be in the base game. The devs\u00A0making the parts would be better in a few ways; namely fewer bugs from more professional\u00A0designers (Although the mods I\u0027ve seen are very well made). Adding some more parts in a DLC would be great, and many people would buy it. I\u0027m pretty sure that this idea has been mentioned before in the suggestions, but that was only about\u00A0space stations and focused more on centrifuge rings and stuff like that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIDEAS:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCrew tunnels\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHydroponics Modules (For fun or for life support mods)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRover bay with doors\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome way to make it easy to land horizontal bases (Wide landing legs?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMORE SCIENCE\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry if there is another thread that is the same thing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-09T19:15:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2018 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Duck McFuddle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-09T21:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223502184\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022180457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221544382411\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188882\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Duck McFuddle\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Duck McFuddle said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCrew tunnels\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome way to make it easy to land horizontal bases (Wide landing legs?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/IIpgr9N.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022IIpgr9N.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223502184\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022180457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221544382411\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188882\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Duck McFuddle\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Duck McFuddle said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRover bay with doors\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome way to make it easy to land horizontal bases (Wide landing legs?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/eBxbRYu.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022eBxbRYu.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDifferent approach at legs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemme add this though: Without any additions to gameplay, new mechanics, like life support which you\u0027ve mentioned, I can only see two purposes for orbital stations or bases.

However, they are not pretty - like you said. As for the only purposes being mining and research, I also agree. Perhaps the DLC could include a new thing to do in orbit or on planets - this is, of course, a very popular suggestion, so maybe there could be an achievement\u00A0for having kerbals on the surface of a planet for a certain amount of time. Another idea would be specific modules for tourists, where they could be pampered and tended to. In career mode, you could even have to pay upkeep and shuttle in staff for the \u0022hotel\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
