The issue is that it requires a space station to be in orbit at the start, and no research to actually be done yet. The only way I can figure to do this is to build the space station and put it into orbit in 1 save (sandbox) and import it into another career save. I am unsure if that is possible, or if there is a better method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thought is to change the save file and take away research and everything while only leaving the station in orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T00:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth of the methods you propose would work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to build the station in one save, then put it into a \u0022new\u0022 save, it\u0027s a matter of copy/paste for the VESSEL structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to build the station, then sort of \u0022reset\u0022 your save, you can also do that but requires a bit more \u0022cleanup\u0022 and work to catch all the bits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can probably help you through either process, but it\u0027s a bit lengthy to write them both out right off the bat.

In which case, hyper edit would only help getting starter parts to space, and would still require the player to spend funds to get it going.
