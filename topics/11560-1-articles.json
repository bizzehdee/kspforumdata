By the time you correct the orbit its too late, your out of sync for the rendezvous"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-02T00:14:27Z","Content":"The information part of the rendezvous module works brilliantly.\n\nThe ship-pointing part of the rendezvous module less so.
