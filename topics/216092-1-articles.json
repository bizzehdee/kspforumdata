I couldn\u0027t find a good single-engine solution that would push 22-odd tons off the pad in a 1.25m form factor, and there aren\u0027t any XS sized SRBs yet, so I ended up sticking a pair of Thuds to the bottom, dialed their throttle in to be just a bit too high, and designed them to be staged off halfway through the first stage burn. Both to reduce the then-unnecessary thrust, and to let a higher-Isp sustainer have the rest of the fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happened was that I suddenly had a rocket where, if I found myself going too shallow, I would just delay dropping the Thuds and let their excess thrust correct the problem.

If you hit that mark, stage the Thuds off when your time to apoapsis hits 50 seconds. If you find yourself shallower, perhaps 9km by 45\u00B0, then hang onto them until 55secs to apoapsis. And at 8km at 45\u00B0, just keep them until the stage burns out. Conversely, if you end up at 11km by 45\u00B0, drop the Thuds by 45sec to apoapsis.

Keep speed to be about 1/10 of your altitude until you reach 3km. Between 3km and 17km, gradually rotate to 45deg. At 17km, atmosphere gets considerably thinner, so it\u0027s less risky to flip over. Slowly point to 60deg, and keep speed below 1500ms until you reach 30\u002B km altitude (to minimize heating effects). After that, try making AP as far away as possible, so circularization burn is as small as possible.

It priorizes the wrong things at the wrong time and, for all its manual effort, ends up spending more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to orbit than a regular, passive gravity turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConcerning here is primarily your repeated advice to \u0022limit speed\u0022. This is bad advice, because aerodynamic drag is a largely negligible part of the cost of reaching orbit on Kerbin, whereas gravity drag is substantial and is incurred in larger amounts the slower and steeper you go. Throttling down is an acceptable response to accidentally launching too steeply, but you should not build it into your standard procedures. Excess speed should be put either into flattening out your trajectory sooner, or into redesigning the rocket to let it carry more fuel/payload on the same set of engines, so it trades the unneeded speed for something more useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPushing the apoapsis far away is also not minimizing your circularization burn, because it will result in a long coast phase, during which your altitude will increase and your speed will decrease. Remember, the goal of circularization is to lift the periapsis out of the atmosphere, and therefore, the measure for how large or small your circularization burn is going to be is how high you can get your periapsis before your apoapsis reaches your desired target altitude and you have to cut your engine and coast. And the best place to raise your periapsis is to burn directly on top of the apoapsis - yes, even during a launch. This, of course, would mean that your apoapsis itself won\u0027t rise anymore, so in practical application you\u0027ll always be pushing your apoapsis ahead of you by at least a minute or so, to ensure you maintain vertical speed until you leave the atmosphere. But trying to intentionally push it away as far as possible actually has the opposite effect that you think it has.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also don\u0027t understand how you are first describing pitching over to 45 degrees, and after that, say \u0022point to 60 degrees\u0022. The horizon is 0\u00B0, so 60\u00B0 is steeper than 45\u00B0 - therefore you would be going backwards, pulling the rocket back upright instead of letting it flatten out.

Maximizing payload fraction to orbit, minimizing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cost to orbit, minimizing funds cost to orbit (back in KSP1 where that mattered), or a number of other goals might require different strategies . For example, minimizing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cost to orbit usually involves extremely high thrust, tipping over really hard really early, and watching your rocket be a fireball all the way to space. Very few people actually play like that, though, not least because that greatly limits you to very small, sleek payloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen considering the average use case, where a player wants to push a not-ridiculously-shaped but otherwise unspecific payload to orbit in a neat, clean, and efficient manner, without going hard into any particular optimization corner, then you arrive at something like this: your rocket has a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of around 1.3 to 1.4 when sitting on the pad; it will begin by ascending straight up for a short distance, until a certain speed is reached; it performs a single pitch maneuver that tilts it a certain amount of degrees over to the east; it activates \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Hold Prograde; and then it flies completely without the player touching the keyboard. Due to the choice of pitchover speed and magnitude, it will hit 45\u00B0 towards the horizon at around 10 km in altitude above sea level. It will eventually receive a staging command from the player to drop the spent first stage and light the second. It will continue flying hands-off and full throttle, like it has the entire time, until the target apoapsis altitude has been reached; at which point it will cut the engine and coast to apoapsis for orbital insertion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOptionally, the player can intervene in the flight of the second stage by starting to throttle down at some point to prevent the apoapsis from running away from the rocket. Keeping the apoapsis close to the rocket more efficiently raises the periapsis, and because the rocket is nearly level to the horizon at that point, gravity drag is no longer a factor. However, this should only be done when the apoapsis is already close to leaving the atmosphere, something like 55-60 km up. Otherwise you risk stalling your ascent in the upper atmosphere, which is the opposite of what you want.
