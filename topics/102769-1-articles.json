And to those who read it, please don\u0027t laugh! I mean, it sounds pretty funny, but It\u0027s something true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I started playing Rust, I had the toughest time learning how to survive. There were so many things to do, and though I did have some friends help me learn the ropes of how to do basic survival (we had a little tribe of us three) it was the other players, the more experienced ones, that would sometimes kill us, threaten in the chat, all that standard video game nonsense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I noticed that whenever I thought about striking back, or perhaps even of finding some player that was even less experienced than I, to take their things so I could advance myself, the thought terrified me. I can\u0027t explain it- I\u0027ve played CoD and L4D and Counter Strike and all sorts of games where you kill people indiscriminately. Killing a virtual player meant little to me, but in Rust I simply didn\u0027t think I could do it. Not only that, my friends (also gamers with histories similar to my own) also thought that it would be super wrong to do, like it was a real evil to kill someone in Rust. We mostly kept to ourselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter playing the game for a month, we grew tired of hiding and scavenging, and again considered the possibility heavily. We decided that we would try it, killing a player and stealing their resources to add to our collection. Long story short, it was one of my friends that did it first, killing a player under the pretense of friendly trading. His back was turned as he was shot by my friend, and we learned he had killed him through the Skype chat. I can\u0027t quite say for sure what my second friend was thinking, but I know that I felt horrible even then from the virtual life that was taken for our group\u0027s own betterment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a short time later that it was my turn to kill for the group. It was a similar setup- We\u0027d find a lone player, offer to trade, and I would go to facilitate the trade with our supplies. Of course, I didn\u0027t bring anything with me besides my armor, a pistol, and several clips of ammunition. I didn\u0027t intend to come back empty-handed, or injured. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI traveled to the player\u0027s outpost, a simple wooden shelter. As he opened the door and fetched supplies from the crate, I drew my pistol and took three shots. His body ragdolled hilariously as he dropped to the ground as my heart raced. In a rush, I grabbed his materials, raided the rest of his supply chest, and made a run for it. In real life, I looked down at my arms and found that I was physically shaking from the experience, and my voice had a slight waver as I told my friends through Skype what I had done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll remind you that I still can\u0027t explain why I felt this way- I dunno why I was shaking, why the murder would\u0027ve felt so different than the other times I\u0027d killed in video games. It just felt horrid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, however, the game went on. I logged more and more hours in the game, and I noticed that my group was changing subtly. As the time went on, and we grew more experienced, we felt less guilty about the murder and the stealing. It was a game, sure, but we killed and stole to support ourselves where gathering was insufficient, or boring. We grew our operations, moved around, and became quite proficient at breaking and entering, killing people and stealing their goods before their reinforcements showed up. Each time I shot somebody, every time I took another life made up of code and textures, I still felt a pang in my heartstrings to remind me what I was doing. Over time, I learned to work with it, and continued the business. Even when my group got into a huge firefight with a rival gang, with huge quantities of materials on the line, it\u0027s an experience that is completely out of this world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not trying to promote Rust or anything, this is just my story. I used Rust as an example in this thread because I felt it was some kind of analogue, and there were plenty of stories just like mine, but I hadn\u0027t heard them. I usually killed them before I learned who they were. That\u0027s what I became, a raider, a bandit that new players are warned of. And to this day I continue this lifestyle in the game, just because it\u0027s what I know best. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a little idea of the mental processes, that\u0027s all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T17:36:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess thats how people become serial killers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T17:42:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kibble\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kibble\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh I meant in thousands of years when they invent radio.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kibble\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kibble\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for those various questions you posed, I don\u0027t know the answers.

Civilization has changed our way of life, and most people have lost the knowledge that used to be commonplace. People have a lot more knowledge than we did ten thousand, two thousand, even one hundred years ago. That knowledge, however, has become so specific that it is very hard for an individual person to keep a useful general base of knowledge about how their life works. The question I have is: When do we become so dependent on technology that we cannot survive a societal collapse? Have we passed that point already? I\u0027d argue that parts of human society already have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
