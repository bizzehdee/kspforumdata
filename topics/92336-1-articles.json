Even just sat through the 10 minute timewarp it took to get me to a transfer window. The transfer itself went well, though my mid-course correction had to be done manually because my maneuver node wouldn\u0027t place on my actual trajectory and rather the one I\u0027d be if I simply did a fly-by of Duna. Lost some dV that would have gotten me a nicer, equatorial landing, but hey, not bad for the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T01:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats!
