Instead of using fuel and air for its airbreathing mode, it would just run the air through a nuclear reactor similar to project pluto. This would allow it to get great efficiencies in atmosphere at super/hypersonic speeds, and fly with basically no fuel needed. This engine can swap to a mode similar to a NERV engine, to where it runs on liquid fuel only instead. The upsides of this engine would be incredible isp, high in atmosphere thrust and near infinite fuel for air breathing. The downsides of this engine would be high mass, large size, and low thrust in space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vortygont","CreatedById":223549,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-13T20:27:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like imbalanced.\u00A0Seen this idea a few times, are there any design challenges and weaknesses with this engine?\u00A0What technologies can it be ranked with in the technology tree?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strawberry","CreatedById":222150,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-13T20:31:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s definitely overall stronger then RAPIER but that isnt a bad thing, as it requires more technology and is more expensive resource wise. Itll be competing with metallic hydrogen jets which would be a lot more lightweight and compact. The engine could be given a long shape and/or radial attachment only to make it harder to design a plane around. It should definitely be something you unlock late in the game, like right before you unlock metallic hydrogen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-14T10:35:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch an engine is plausible, yes its very radioactive so shielding the crew would be an problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ember12","CreatedById":217583,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-14T17:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224198656\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210606\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221668422115\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257801\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, magnemoe said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch an engine is plausible, yes its very radioactive so shielding the crew would be an problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course this also applies to NERVA\u0027s and Orion drives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that in addition to this nuclear RAPIER, a nuclear turbojet would be great as something that can run for weeks or months without a refuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-14T17:56:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224198735\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210606\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221668447532\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022217583\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ember12\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, Ember12 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course this also applies to NERVA\u0027s and Orion drives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that in addition to this nuclear RAPIER, a nuclear turbojet would be great as something that can run for weeks or months without a refuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrue, but in space you can add an truss to put the engine far from the crew.
