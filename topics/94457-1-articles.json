I\u0027ve always been annoyed that I can\u0027t go to faster time warps at lower altitudes when I as a player know that it\u0027d be safe (or at least, know that I just hit F5 and am willing to accept the consequences of my actions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand why the game slows down time warp as you get closer to a planet and then doesn\u0027t allow it for fear that you\u0027d be plummeting straight down and warp right through the planet, but I also know that when I\u0027m orbiting at 75km over Kerbin waiting 3 hours for my next maneuver node, it\u0027s really annoying to only be able to warp at 50x. It\u0027s also annoying to have to go back to the space center or a flag somewhere in order to do the warp, especially if I\u0027ve not installed Kerbal Alarm Clock to tell me when to go back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe already use the ALT key when NOT at time warp to initiate Physical time warp (1-4x, you can control the ship). However, ALT does nothing special when you are already warping in NON-PHYSICAL time warp. So here\u0027s my suggestion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen warping in NON-PHYSICAL time warp, if you hold ALT while increasing warp, the game allows you to go past the normal restriction. It will still slow down if the state changes (like if you pass from 125,000km to 115,000km around Kerbin) but it will otherwise not restrict you in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike the first time you physical time warp, the game should give you a pop-up that tells you that what you\u0027re doing could be dangerous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T02:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis needs to happen \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I can\u0027t even count the number of times this has been a problem for me - it\u0027s certainly in the hundreds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helter","CreatedById":135677,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T02:01:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know, what I think I would rather have is an actual time warp.
