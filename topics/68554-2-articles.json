The new engines pretty dramatically outperform the old size 2 ones. This is especially silly, as the LFB can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Mainsail, and is available at the same tech node. The LFB has slightly better TWR than the quad RS-25, but that gets lost in the chunky nature of KSP\u0027s fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore generally, there\u0027s the problem that these parts start to make sense \u0022too early\u0022 in terms of payloads. Their thrusts are only 1.25 - 2.13x that of the Mainsail, so by the time you\u0027re considering using lofting an orange tank, they\u0027re the way to go. Compare with the Rockomaxx engines, where the Skipper\u0027s thrust is 3.02x that of the LV-T30, and the Mainsail\u0027s is 6.78x. Perhaps if they had thrusts of 4000 - 10000 kN (with comparable mass increases), there would still be a role for existing parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut really, this is just another general symptom of KSP needing another round of balancing, as half the parts obviate the other half. The Poodle has a clear role as an orbital transfer / lander engine but is generally worse at those than the venerable LV-T30. The LV-909 and 24-77 once had clear roles for lower mass craft (especially landers and probes), but those were eaten away by the 48-7S, and all but eliminated with its thrust buff. The surviving utility of the LV-909 is early in the tech tree. The Skipper has always suffered from being outclassed by arrays of LV-T30s (with perhaps the occasional LV-T45), and the Mk 55 only briefly had a clear role. The tricoupler was rendered superfluous back in 0.13, but nonetheless bicouplers and quadcouplers were added. The Mk1 fuselage is worse at storing fuel than any other aircraft tank, or even rocket tank. The Aerospike has been fixed from a reasonable though poorly executed nerf, but remains a hassle to use outside of (surprisingly efficient) launch stages for small payloads. Nosecones are generally better done without. Ditto adapters. The tech tree is the only reason not to use an okto2 over the other probes, and still leaves the RGUs without a reason to exist. A large number of parts (eg: cupola, Mk2 cockpit, TVR-300L, TVR-400L, docking ports, and perhaps SRBs) have rather WTFy drag values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that I am not complaining about these parts making the game \u0022to easy.\u0022 I am complaining that they are not well integrated into the rest.

I\u0027m somewhat concerned that the LV-1 and ion changes are solving the wrong problems, but that\u0027s a different issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"csiler2","CreatedById":62800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T02:47:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022merendel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022merendel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhile probably true we have no idea to what degree. For one thing we have no idea what our budget will look like. For another the price listed on the parts is all over the map and make no sense. The Skipper, Mainsail, and KR-2L all have the same price listed. The same price would only get you 3 LV-T30s. The thrust to weight and thrust to cost ratios as they stand are drasticly in favor of the KR-2L over a cluster of T30s.\u003Cp\u003EIf the prices are not placeholders then any time you need 4 or more LVT\u0027s in a cluster your better off with the KR-2L.

The tanking prices are all sorts of strange with Orange tanks holding less but costing more than their ARM counterparts, however just looking at engine prices shows that you\u0027re paying a massive premium for ARM engines. The S3 KS-25x4 and LB KR-1x2 both cost 5900 credits, over twice the cost of re-priced Mainsail at 2850 (iirc it used to cost 850), yet neither provides twice the performance of the Mainsail. Is it going to make sense for you to spend the extra money? My guess is no, unless you have a payload that falls into the pricing sweet spot where ARM engines are more cost-effective than Mainsails (eg one S3 would suffice in place of 3 MS CBCs), then you\u0027re probably going to want to opt for mainsails, assuming tank prices are rebalanced. The only engine that doesn\u0027t obviously fit into the program is the KR-2L which has better performance than the Skipper and Mainsail, but costs the same. I suspect it should probably cost 5900, just like the other ARM main-stage engines, but only time will tell.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T03:21:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maccollo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022maccollo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethis is kind of silly.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally all that proves is that a large SSTO can easily do what a smaller non-SSTO can do.

As we all like to look to the real world for inspiration about how things in KSP should be done, please consider the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike ARM parts, the Saturn V has a huge advantage over other current launchers. It could carry almost five times more payload into LEO than the Delta IV Heavy, the current heaviest lifter. My goodness, you say, that\u0027s just unfair that the Saturn V\u0027s performance is so much better than Delta, Falcon 9, Atlas, and other boosters! Well, we stopped making them and launching them because they were too darned expensive at $1.2bil per launch (vs appx $170mil for a DIV-H launch).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow look at the cost of ARM parts compared to older KSP parts. Based on raw performance specs you are not nearly getting the same bang for your buck unless you want to launch really heavy things AND you have the budget for it. That sounds a lot like the Saturn V! Lots of lift capability, but very expensive. The Space Shuttle is another example of an item that does its job pretty darned well, it could lift just a bit more payload than a Delta IV Heavy, but it cost significantly more to launch at appx $450mil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, we don\u0027t know exactly how the finance system is going to work, but as we know we\u0027re going to have a budget of some sort, players are probably going to want to spend their budget as efficiently as possible. That\u0027s going to limit their ability to use ARM and maintain a sustainable space program as they look to keep their budget balanced. You\u0027ll probably end up having a lot of small, cost-effective launches with the occasional big-budget spender.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, in the end, it\u0027s just a game. The \u0027balance\u0027 of rocket engine performance isn\u0027t as important as balancing weapons in an FPS because you\u0027re not competing with anyone.
