Some or all properties in that set may be shared by other numbers but no other number have the same, full set of properties. With these numbers we can play around and construct other objects, like matrices, or a grid of values arranged to represent something. What if some other species elsewhere in the universe don\u0027t think in terms of units as we do but instead think of numbers as matrices of properties so that to them, the idea of a single digit value say 1, is just plain unthinkable.

Ternary is far more efficient. It\u0027s a shame we didn\u0027t go with it for the computers back in the day. Setting aside a huge boost in memory capacity and performance, even simply splitting data is more convenient. Instead of nibbles, we\u0027d have sets of three trits, which is sufficient to encode 0 \u002B 26 letters of alphabet, which would make for more\u00A0convenient representation than hex. Alphanumerics would be sent with pairs of these\u00A0allowing for larger alphabet and more error correction data, while a data stream would probably run in threes. A 9 trit instruction set would already put us close to 16bit machines with only a slight overhead over 8bit architecture. We\u0027d probably have powerful personal computers half a decade sooner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only downside is that powers of 3 don\u0027t fall close to powers of 10, and the base-3 logic is slightly less intuitive than base-2 logic. Although, tritwise-Z\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0is always an option.

Having three possible states means you need transistors (or vacuum tubes!) to be half way... something. Either half charged, or half open, or half full. Which is a lot harder to design and build for, and squeezing all sorts of current through \u0027half open\u0027 gates would\u00A0introduce all sorts of electrical friction and heat in a modern computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T02:57:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222450740\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133730\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457621366\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022140595\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LN400\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, LN400 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a talk that raises some interesting points on maths including how 1\u002B1 does not \u003Cem\u003Eneccessarily\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0equal 2.
