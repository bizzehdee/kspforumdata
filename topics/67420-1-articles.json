If I undock the docking nodes one or two of the parts docked to them it suddenly starts accelerating violently. It\u0027s not a thrust problem as they detached parts add up to a tonne at most and kerbal engineer shows the the TWR is 6 for the mun. Is this just a limitation of the physics engine (i.e. needing to update the craft by undocking things) or an I doing something wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is appreciated\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-01T18:29:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2014 06:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cranachan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T14:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you could post pictures of your craft and the .craft file it would make helping out much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T14:35:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s something below the engines it can block them.
