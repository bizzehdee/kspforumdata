It finally got just a hint of sunlight and i was able to rotate it to recharge the batteries, but afterwards the SAS on the satellite was broken...The little \u0022SAS\u0022 light would turn on but all the options disappeared (it was a model with all the options). It wouldn\u0027t even stabilize itself, and is slowly spinning more and more out of control. Is this supposed to happen, or is this yet another bug?"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T02:17:30Z","Content":"I think I\u0027ve had this bug happen before as well.
