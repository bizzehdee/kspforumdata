Grapple it with a klaw and bring the whole thing back to Kerbin.\n\n2. Make a trivial one-line edit to your game save file to turn it into, say, a Mk1 lander can, then re-load the game.\n\nI normally hate the idea of manually editing a save file, but I confess I\u0027ve been going with option #2 when I run into this problem, only because #1 is even worse for me (the klaw is so buggy that I seem to hit the kraken every time I ever use one-- I just never use it for any purpose ever, anymore)."},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T18:52:54Z","Content":"I opted for #3 - Hyper edit it to a landing.
