I\u0027ve guess this is already partly implemented as recovered parts only need to be patched up. There could be something here but it would mainly be a change of concept, let me know what you think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs yet another suggestion, (XD sorry), and it may help with the previous issue of getting tourist on board. I think changing the default UI when opening the launchpad and runway, to launch crafts, and instead only show already available crafts for flight, picking the craft and crew with the default UI, if that\u0027s possible. That way it could things a lot cleaner and possibly solve the previous mentioned issue.

It especially has issues with when you destroy only one of a symmetry partner. I\u0027ll work on that a bit probably after the 1.0 release, since at the very least I should try to avoid letting you put corrupted craft into storage and breaking your game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I too suspected it could be buggy. You\u0027re making the right choice. In any case if it doesn\u0027t work, the feature is not all that required, you can still build the craft with a bonus speed for parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you though about trying to match the recovered craft with one of the saved craft files only? For example, using the craft from file as if it was new. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe just plainly giving the user the option to return to hangar when landed in the appropriate space.... Oh I got an Idea, give the option to return to hangar and refit, the user then chooses one of the saved craft files, parts that are the same are reused but parts missing cost more.

There was/is a larger focus on repurposing the existing GUIs rather than making new ones, but it essentially requires a rewrite for it to work well, so KCT won\u0027t be having that change. Repurposing GUIs is also very dangerous and can break other mods that depend on them and I\u0027d rather have KCT play nicely with others. Building craft also was going to be split into at least two phases, the first being part sourcing and the second being assembly.
