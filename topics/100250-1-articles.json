Granted. But dont spread incorrect informations. The Versions from Boris-Barboris and FreeThinker are working just fine (there are not more \u0022weird bugs\u0022 than in any other mod here including yours and its heavily worked on), and with a certain amount of mods in 32bit the use of the (also working fine) Advanced Texture Manager is highly encouraged anyway.\n\nAnd about realism ... we are talking about a highly theoretical scientific concept for a warp drive that may or may not be possible in our (multi)universe. Not even a engineering problem right now, no one knows if something like this is even practical. The (original) KSPi Warpdrive is exactly as \u0022realistic\u0022 as the later one from roverdude (who i really like by the way).
