This worked out quite cheaply as aerobraking meant the return costs\u00A0from Minmal orbit, were er, minimal. The ship remained in orbit, and only fuel supplies and a launch/crew return vehicle needed to be sent from Kerbin to the station in LKO. With\u00A0the atmospheric heating introduced in 1.0, direct aerobraking from a Minmus-Kerbin transfer gets pretty hot, and so realistically engine burns are needed (I know you can make multiple passes, but it\u0027s not very convenient in terms of time.) This means hauling more fuel along for the whole trip and so makes the craft larger as well as needing\u00A0more refuelling.\u00A0Heat shields help, but they\u0027d be depleted after a couple of trips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what\u0027s everyone\u0027s preferred way to get Kerbals to and from the Kerbin system\u0027s moons?

For that I then used expendable capsules to take crew to the station and back to Kerbin, along with a reusable lander to make Mun landings in various biomes and bring science back up for the lab on the station. This seemed to work pretty well. I sent the space station out with a bunch of fuel, but tech tree permitting I could have done ISRU to fill it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince pictures are being requested, this is said station\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/yxSxUs\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5678/21364090878_c2a6057403_h.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u002221364090878_c2a6057403_h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/yxSxUs\u0022\u003EDelivery of our new solar array\u003C/a\u003E by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/photos/52548818@N05/\u0022\u003Ecantab314\u003C/a\u003E, on Flickr\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbiter is on the near side, the Mun lander on the other side, and the solar array is being brought up - science labs are power hungry! The half orange tank was enough to support five landings, and I sent four orbiters to visit (though one was destroyed being used to rescue Jeb from the Mun\u0027s surface after he got stuck on a mountain with no EVA fuel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
