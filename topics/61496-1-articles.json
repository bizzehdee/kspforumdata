According to the recently posted Polygon article on KSP--which you can find a link to at the dev blog--NASA plans to land a human on an asteroid by 2025.

Late last year, the House held the first hearing on the \u003Cem\u003Epossibility of alien life\u003C/em\u003E, followed by an last minute decision supported by both political parties that increased NASA\u0027s budget to fit in another large flagship type mission (According to Spacenews.com, Congress has ordered NASA to provide proposals for another robotic flagship mission May this year, along with 80million in funding to study an robotic mission to Europa). The issue is, I don\u0027t think the Congressmen/women know how to express that interest other than forcing NASA to build rockets to nowhere. So while the government is starting to warm up back to its old stance of total support for spaceflight (Understandable, when you realize that China is catching up quickly with NASA).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while some interest in NASA is only for the pork, its nice to know that NASA has true political supporters who truly see the beauty in space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T22:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it\u0027s really congress becoming interested in space themselves for the most part.
