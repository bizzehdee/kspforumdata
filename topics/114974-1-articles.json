Also I like craft that deliver reproducible results, so flukes and genius piloting are no factor in my gameplay. And I use MJ for keeping track of delta-V and measuring transfer windows, which also comes in very handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday I was able to build a lander that has enough delta-V and TWR to take-off from Eve near sea level (400 meters or so) and reach a circularized orbit of 100km. I tried this using HyperEdit, so by no means near a complete mission, I\u0027m just testing the lander for now. Today, I added a new landing gear, parachutes and figured out how to fix the heat shields so my lander is now able to drop freely from a circularized 80km orbit (just enough for the atmosphere to take hold and slowly drag it in), land safely, do EVA and board the craft to launch it back up to a 100km orbit again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the some pics, hopefully they can be helpful/inspiring to you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/FWLHp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/FWLHp\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain problems in 1.0.4 I\u0027ve encountered compared to previous version are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- overheating in Eve\u0027s atmosphere when coming down\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- engines at lower altitudes have lost a lot of power/efficiency\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- stability of the craft when launching to orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- part count drags down game performance (had to simplify my craft enormously to even get it running)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext steps are to build an interplanetary stage around this lander and somehow get everything to launch in a single go from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T18:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGoodluck!
