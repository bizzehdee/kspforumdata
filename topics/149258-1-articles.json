I was thinking along the lines of a one use permanent interlocked port that cannot be separated once connected, also a way of connecting struts and fuel lines whilst in space would also be helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also noticed the difficulties in refueling, or transferring other resouces from surface bases, and a landing pad module could help with this. This module would be placed on top of a base and when deployed would expand the surface area to twice the diameter (1.5m\u0026gt;3m, 2.5m\u0026gt;5m etc)to allow for landing legs and once landed it would allow for cross feed of resources. Obviously this module would have to be heat resistant to withstand the wash of the rocket engines but perhaps with a limit so that if you take a long time to land you risk damaging the pad\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Twreed87","CreatedById":50017,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-04T11:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been thinking a lot about the difficulty of connecting surface-landed craft.
