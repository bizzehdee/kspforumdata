Results in more pitch stability, but seems to increase mach tuck effect at transonic speeds. Still can keep control so not a biggie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Added front canards to increase pitch stability (as per Ferram\u0027s suggestion, and to mitigate mach tuck effects)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Added more length to the delta front section of the wings, to increase wing surface area (used a 3rd procedural wing clipped in between)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* negative dihedral on the whole wing area (one small rotation step in the SPH, not sure about the exact angle). The net result is very good stability in most flight situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Move the tail fins a bit apart and gave them a slight tilt outwards, seems it\u0027s working (thanks again Ferram !)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Increased the span of the rear part of the main wing, to account for the increased weight and length (added tank). Increased sweep a bit too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt handles as beautifully as the looks suggest. Roll is very sensitive (like a jet fighter basically), new v0.22 SAS is totally lost there. Deactivate SAS and the plane flies very nicely. Landed without SAS at north pole, almost lost control just before landing (i use keyboard !!), AoA at low speed must be kept tight to avoid a stall (i guess due to the highly swept wings). It also wants to dutch roll like crazy so yaw inputs have to be very subtle and progressive.. I can now throw it into a stall while supersonic, by giving it too much pitch input, i guess it\u0027s a compromise i have to live with (like the real world counter parts, so it\u0027s not surprising). Good thing is in most cases it seems to come back to stable / prograde by itself and not go into a spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3 tank sections allow for more precise fuel balancing (wish i had fuel loaded wings..).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight data with unstable SAS roll (but stable normal flight):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YA7iN76.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YA7iN76.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb approves this spaceplane and FAR !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jjgclnx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jjgclnx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we are still missing fully retractable ladders and gear bays.

If you want i can post my latest craft file. On it there\u0027s a Mechjeb2 attached too (i can remove it if you want it mechjeb-free). Making it yourself can be time consuming (but FUN !) as some design details such as strut placement and wing angles are critical. Also you have to assign control surfaces to specific inputs in FAR - canards and stabilators for pitch, wing control surfaces for roll, and tail control surfaces for yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not using DRE yet as i\u0027m at the stability limit of KSP at the moment, although i\u0027m quite sure this design can survive, apart from the cockpit side ladders maybe (unfortunately, no retractable / shielded parts are available for this) - but i\u0027m considering it maybe later, at the moment FAR provides me with tens of hours of fun and engineering \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the results my latest aerodynamic improvements, after hours and hours of flight tests and fine tuning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rH6c909.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rH6c909.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe HyperJet MK4\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to B9 i now have more reasonably sized stabilators. Went for a more radical wing sweep. As a result of both i lost the stall recovery of the previous design: this one is very resistant to excessive input, but stupidity can still make it go into a spin (which is quite hard to recover). To avoid problems, as usual fuel balance is needed (the 3 tanks help here) - transfer from back to front before re-entry or aerocapture. The airbrakes help aerocapture performance, and of course landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI LOVE THE NEW B9 LANDING GEAR it\u0027s a lot more aerodynamic than the stock one.

Handling without SAS has a tendency to dutch roll and otherwise wiggle around a bit especially at transonic speeds, but at mach 2\u002B if you just trim it, it flies straight, and for landings it\u0027s behaving nicely by itself. SAS tends to spaz with roll inputs sometimes (esp. at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA, perfect straight flight, weird stuff here), for no good reason, it goes into a \u0022shake\u0022. Just give some pitch (up or down, doesnt matter) and it comes back to reason.. My previous design could do a \u0022cobra\u0022 and still have control during the stall, i\u0027ll have to explore that a bit more with a lighter design (without SABRE\u0027s and all that fuel to go to Laythe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal weight is 33.8T fuelled up, 76 parts, so it\u0027s nice and light (for a Jool capable SSTO spaceplane..).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal work on this is about 30 hours including flight tests ! I tried a LOT of aerodynamic setups. The new B9 stuff with the fixed trailing edges open some new possibilities (mhhh elevons..). Maybe the next step would be leading edge elevons/slabs: this is needed for tailless designs (cannot wait for procedural control surfaces for this !). Variable geometry would be fantastic too, i\u0027ll try to look at what i can do with the Magic Smoke pack, but that wont be a small jet-fighter-esque design like this one and more like a big cargo (due to size of mobile parts..).
