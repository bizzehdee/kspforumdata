But there\u0027s no money in that, and that\u0027s what game development companies do. Make games to make money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople need to get over themselves and stop thinking that whichever company they like is making a game specifically for them. Using your example, the X series has been going on for quite some time now and has developed an incredibly dedicated fanbase. They\u0027re also the only dev team I know that\u0027s been able to consistently better themselves every single game, with very few faults to speak of. But before X:Rebirth was announced and publicised, how many people did you know that knew about X? Pretty much all my friends are gamers and before I mentioned it, no one had heard of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was the same with The Elder Scrolls. Arena and Daggerfall were (and still are) fantastic games, but before Morrowind barely anyone had heard of the series. Even then it took Oblivion to come out for the series to really take off. Then they come to Skyrim and remove a lot of features that made the games such a hit with the established fanbase and there was a rift in the community. Half of them were saying \u0022This is so awesome, I can get lost for hours\u0022 and the other half saying \u0022OMG it\u0027s rubbish\u0022 because they took out attributes/skills. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you take a step back and realise that Squad, like Egosoft and Bethesda have to make money. We\u0027re lucky that we can mod our games into what we want them to be. With KSP you can use mods to increase difficulty. I\u0027m sure with X:Rebirth we\u0027ll be able to mod in new playable ships. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the record, X:Rebirth is a new beginning as the name suggests. It\u0027s not part of the X:BTF, X2 and X3 series, hence it not being X:4. We only got to pilot one ship in X:BTF as well, if you recall.
