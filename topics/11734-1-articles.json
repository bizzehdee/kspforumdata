Any tips? Also while I am at it tips on making sure the engine segments connect in the proper directions.\n\nIts just OCD I can not progress with MechJeb experimentation until I know.\n\nEdit:\n\nApparently fork around enough and it might just go in....I got it in...it dosnt make sense.\n\nEdit2: oh great now I try to attack something to the bottom and it now flips out all over again. \n\nEdit 3. I think the thing to do is take it over the top and hope for the best. Like playing Hupla. Get the ring around the peg. Just do that motion."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T06:17:14Z","Content":"MechJeb doesn\\\u0027t use fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T08:54:07Z","Content":"Ahh I know what you mean, the fuel carrying heat shield for the MechJeb command pod.\n\nIt has several attachment points making it tricky to assemble, I have not experimented with it much as I do not use MechJeb to fly unless it is for DonLorenzos forum campaign.\n\nAs you have no doubt seen though, trying to attach it when looking at it from the side is very difficult, as it will try to snap to one of the outer points, so try moving the camera and looking at it from below, this should make it easier to see when you have the center attachment node lined up with the MechJeb core.\n\nHope this helps ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T09:28:49Z","Content":"Oh that !

Just throwing it on and seeing if it sticks. It works just is tricky. \n\nAbsolutely stunned at the intelligence of Mechjeb, Doing stuff I never could do. It wont take a replacement of flying the ships. However It will add to survivability...more so when I have ruined the mission. \n\nAlso got the mini engine on fine. There is 8 sections but the engine only fit 4. And boy when Mechjeb pod 2.0 panics its saves itself with those engines. Just wow. Plugins are going to get crazy from this point on. Already messing with folding and hinges."}]}
