Any tips?

I think the thing to do is take it over the top and hope for the best. Like playing Hupla. Get the ring around the peg.

It wont take a replacement of flying the ships. However It will add to survivability...more so when I have ruined the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso got the mini engine on fine. There is 8 sections but the engine only fit 4. And boy when Mechjeb pod 2.0 panics its saves itself with those engines. Just wow. Plugins are going to get crazy from this point on.
