It\u0027s a 20 some line program that I threw together because maybe someone else needed a calculator that does this. I plan to make it more user friendly, but the bulk of my efforts went to the mathematics. Any one can plug starting weight, ending weight and Isp into the rocket equation, but this gives you the exact number of litres you need accounting for the addition of fuel tank weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA spreadsheet at this point in time would be essentially the same level of efficiency. My program uses a few std::cin s and std::cout s for io, so I could do better. I hope this answers your confusion.
