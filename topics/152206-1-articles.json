I just landed an unmanned ship with 2 rovers attached and they both had 1 wheel pop\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E. I would love to send a repair mission to Duna but my funds are currently low, does anyone have any experience with a mod that you can automatically repair rover wheels without an engineer? Thanks so much!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-18T08:53:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not heard of such a mod...
