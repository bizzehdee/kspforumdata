We want to have Dog-fighting battles but they do not work well. The player sync on DMP is not very good. When I shoot him he has exploded on my screen but is fine on his screen vice-versa. About 10 secs later he seems to resurrect and fly fine again. I heard something about dog-fighting only working in a vacuum on DMP but not sure.\u00A0We try to dogfight in atmosphere of Kerbin with no luck. Any help is appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-05T23:00:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi as far as I\u0027m aware the BDA DMP interaction is very version specific, you have to have exactly the right versions\u00A0\u00A0 Normal non DMP\u00A0 BDAc releases will not work on DMP , the DMP version of BDA was a fork developed specifically for DMP. and contains special features that are not present in the normal public releases.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick look the the github history shows no recent/this year activity on the DMP fork, so presumably there\u0027ll be issues that have long been resolved in normal BDA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-05T23:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175589-midnightzero/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022175589\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175589-midnightzero/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@midnightzero\u003C/a\u003E, welcome to the forum!
