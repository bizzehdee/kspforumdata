So a journey to Duna will take about the same time as a journey to Mars. Haven\u2019t really given much thought to hard numbers though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for part specs - that\u2019s a tricky one. I haven\u2019t played with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E or any scale-up mods, so I don\u2019t have a feel for how the stock parts would need to be scaled up to work with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Also, some of the in-story parts (the RT5 in particular), were written into First Flight long before they appeared in the game (if indeed they have - I\u2019m not sure if an\u00A0LV-T20 ever made it in)\u00A0so their specs probably don\u2019t match up at all. I\u2019ve also taken some liberties with the part specs - my LV-T30 is gimballed for example, unlike the Reliant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMostly (as you\u2019ve correctly pointed out on the TV Tropes page) I was looking\u00A0to provide some sense of continuity to the game parts rather than trying to exactly match in-story part specs to in-game part specs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that I\u2019ve totally ignored though is part diameters, mostly because I don\u2019t see them as being terribly important to the story. Or the game for that matter - to my mind KSP has never been particularly\u00A0consistent or realistic about part sizes, and pinning exact numbers on them just raises more questions than it\u00A0answers.\u00A0But I digress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want a rough point of reference to the game however,\u00A0an in-game analogue of\u00A0the\u00A0Eve booster would have\u00A0a central 2.5m core stage with three LV-T30s attached, with three 1.25m strap-on boosters each with an underpowered LV-T30 (in-story, the LV-T20) attached. The upper stage consists of a shorter 2.5m\u00A0tank with a fourth, vacuum optimised LV-T20.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe early Rockomax boosters were heavily based on SRBs, their first decent liquid fuelled booster (for launching Endurance) would be based on 2.5m tankage with a single Skipper on the lower stage and a single Poodle on the second stage.

Tom glanced at him and nodded to himself. \u201CIngenious piece of kit your Kerm telegraph,\u201D he said. \u201CI used to work in telecoms myself before I started in television, and what\u2019s left of the engineer in me did like the combination of high-tech sensing and old-fashioned dot-dash code. How are the Kerm finding it to use?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt took them a while to get used to it,\u201D Jonton answered. \u201CFocusing on one small, specific task doesn\u2019t come easily to Kerm \u2013 they\u2019re used to working with all of their Grove at once, keeping everything in balance by instinct.\u201D He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201CAlthough that\u2019s not quite right. How best to explain?\u201D Tom raised his eyebrows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI suppose it must be a bit like being a musical conductor,\u201D Jonton said at last. \u201CListening to all the musicians at once, keeping them in harmony but at the same time knowing how the sounds from all the different instruments fit together to make one piece of music, and how to steer that music to make the piece \u003Ci\u003Eyours\u003C/i\u003E. I\u2019m not very musical myself but I can\u2019t imagine that a conductor has time to consciously think about what they\u2019re doing \u2013 they just listen and \u003Ci\u003Eknow\u003C/i\u003E.\u201D He offered Tom a faint grin. \u201CThat was the mistake I kept making to begin with \u2013 thinking too much. The more I tried to plan everything out logically, the more of a mess I got into.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton shook his head. \u201CAnyway \u2013 once they learned how to use it reliably, they certainly took to it. Jonelle \u2013 my daughter\u2019s Kerm,\u201D he added, \u201Cspends a lot of time on it, talking to Professor Erlin\u2019s Obrinn.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd isn\u2019t that always the way with new technology?\u201D Tom agreed. He tapped his earpiece. \u201CAhh, it appears that our guests are ready. Shall we make a start?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton was surprised to notice a definite rumble of voices from behind the stage curtains. Composing himself, he turned to face the cameras and the hidden crowd beyond, as Tom flashed a hand signal at the broadcast director standing in the wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGoing live in four\u2026three\u2026\u201D Tom raised two fingers, then lowered them one by one. The curtains swept back, the noise from the crowd becoming suddenly louder from the darkness behind the lights. Tom leaned forward in his chair and discreetly cleared his throat as the \u003Ci\u003EEngines and Engineers\u003C/i\u003E theme music swept out from the speakers overhead. Large screens around the side of the stage lit up, showing himself and Jonton sitting at the table\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood afternoon, and welcome to a special one off \u2013 and I think the most unusual episode of Engines and Engineers that I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to present. With me in the studio is Jonton Kermol, known to many of you as the Sage of Barkton. It is also my distinct honour and solemn privilege to welcome two guests of the highest importance, neither of whom will need any introduction from me. Good kerbals, please be upstanding for the President of the Regionality of Doren, Dr Chadlin Kerman and the Chief Ambassador of the Forseti-Spierkan Confederacy, Mr Aldwell Kermol.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two leaders walked on-stage to a standing ovation and more than a few astonished comments from various members of the audience to their neighbours. At the back of the studio, two banners descended from the ceiling, bearing the flags of both Regionalities. President Chadlin shook hands with Chief Ambassador Kermol although, from his vantage point behind the table, Jonton couldn\u2019t help noticing that their expressions were polite rather than effusive. The rather obvious political statement of bringing a decidedly pro-Kerm Chief Ambassador and a pragmatic President around the same table, did not escape him either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollowed by Jonton, Tom walked out onto the stage, a quiver in his step. \u201CMr President. Honoured Chief Ambassador. Welcome to the show and thank you, on behalf of everyone here today, for making time for us.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadlin stepped forward to shake hands with the presenter and the former an-Kerm. \u201CIt\u2019s good to be here. \u201CAnd, on behalf of the Council of Twelve Pillars, we would like to thank Mr Jonton for \u003Ci\u003Ehis\u003C/i\u003E time and the Engines and Engineers team for all their recent assistance at short notice.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd we welcome the opportunity to participate in this public forum,\u201D Aldwell said formally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen, please, let us all be seated,\u201D said Tom. He waited for the two Pillars to take their seats and for Jonton to sit down again, before going to join them at the table. \u201CI think,\u201D he began, \u201Cit\u2019s fair to say that last week was a very big week for the Council.\u201D The expected ripple of laughter ran through the audience and Tom waited for it to subside before continuing. \u201CCulminating, of course, with the Joint Declaration and its hope of an end to the Kerm Crisis.\u201D Tom took a sip of water from the glass in front of him. \u201CSo, I expect that there are many kerbals in the audience who are wondering quite why you\u2019re here today?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf you\u2019ll forgive the political clich\u00E9, Tom, we\u2019re here for you, the people. We understand that there will be public scepticism about the Declaration and so, to borrow the words of my esteemed colleague,\u201D Chadlin bowed to Aldwell, \u201Cwe are here in this public forum to try and address that scepticism and to answer any questions \u2013 about the Declaration, I should say,\u201D he added to another ripple of polite laughter.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTom turned to the camera. \u201CAs I mentioned, we are also privileged to have Mr Jonton Kermol, known to many of us as the Sage of Barkton, here with us today. For those that don\u2019t know him, Jonton brings with him a unique, and very personal, perspective on the Kerm crisis and, as you will hear, his experiences form the bedrock of the plan set out in the Declaration. But let\u2019s start by casting our minds back to the heady days of the first Munar Landing and to the words of President Obrick.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stage screens turned black. The \u003Ci\u003EEngines and Engineers\u003C/i\u003E logo appeared for a moment before being replaced by an image of three kerbonauts strapped into a space capsule. Then, as it had for countless kerbals so long ago, a familiar commanding voice rolled out from the speakers:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Ci\u003EFor we have also tasked our greatest scientists with a mission of peace. To understand why the Kerm are led to fight amongst themselves and learn whether we kerbals can help them to live together without conflict or Blight. Our very survival as a species depends on their success and for that we must buy them time. Which is why we now call upon the six Regionalities of Kerbin to unite behind this Council of Twelve Pillars\u2026\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresident Obrick\u2019s voice faded out and the screens switched back to the view from the stage. The sudden silence was broken by a cough from the audience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStirring words,\u201D said Chadlin, \u201Cbut we did not follow them. Why the Kerm are led to fight amongst themselves remains a mystery. And we, the Council of Twelve Pillars, failed to unite the Regionalities behind us. However, a way of helping them live together without conflict or Blight has been discovered due, in no small part, to the deeds of the kerbal sitting before you today.\u201D He dipped his head to Jonton.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThose deeds are many, and some of them you will find shocking,\u201D said Aldwell. \u201CBut they hold the keys to our future and so they should be known by all.\u201D He turned to Tom who cleared his throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Chief Ambassador. And on that note, please now hear the words of the Sage of Barkton \u2013 Mr Jonton Kermol.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton bowed to the two Pillars. \u201CThank you, Mr President, thank you, honoured Chief Ambassador. Thank you, Tom. As a good friend of mine would be sure to point out, this is a long story although I will try my best to keep this telling of it as short as possible.\u201D He paused, a mix of emotions chasing their way across his face. \u201CIt all begins with a Kerm seed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton described Gerselle\u2019s discovery, the traditional one-day journey to find a place to plant the new Kerm, and his fateful decision not to bury the seed on stony ground but to plant it closer to his own Grove. Behind the stage lights, several kermol in the audience winced whilst others scowled and muttered to their neighbours. Those few shook their heads at Jonton\u2019s clipped description of his Kerm\u2019s battles with the new sapling, his and Gerselle\u2019s realisation that those battles were the cause of the then recently discovered Blight, and finally his desperate reasoning that if a thirty-seven tree Kerm wasn\u2019t intelligent enough to help stop the Blight, then maybe a thirty-eight tree Kerm would be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd so, I decided to plant a new cutting in my Grove.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the uproar showed no signs of subsiding after five minutes, Tom jumped to his feet to plead unsuccessfully for calm. Only the sight of President Chadwick getting to his feet, began to quieten the incredulous clamour from the audience. Kerbals sat with folded arms, glaring at Jonton as he described his struggle to preserve and eventual surrender to, the melting shards of his Kerm\u2019s mind. By the time he\u2019d recounted his experiences as an an-Kerm, leading on to his promise to stop the Blight still afflicting his Grove, the anger in the audience had begun to fade, replaced by fascination and, from a few, by sympathy. Still others leaned forward in their seats, eyes brightening with a dawning comprehension.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFighting against several hundred years of instinct was hard. Not to mention painful. But I was able to pull back my borders and give Gerselle\u2019s Kerm space to grow in peace. From there, it seemed obvious \u2013 if enough Keepers could go an-Kerm, then we could make space to plant all the new seeds without causing Blight or conflict. But by then, the first shots were being fired in what would eventually turn into the Kerm Conflict. Gerselle and I took in a Wakiran refugee called Enely\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo mounting awe from the audience, Jonton talked them through Elton\u2019s awakening. Awe rapidly turned to sympathy and more than a few fiercely blown noses and jaws clenched against the onset of tears, as he described the disastrous attempt to Awaken Gerselle\u2019s Kerm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEnely managed to save her Jonelle - her Kerm \u2013 although I still don\u2019t know how. Gerselle is still in a coma.\u201D Jonton swallowed hard. \u201CAnd we discovered that Jonelle was extremely protective of our daughter Joenie. I made the mistake of trying to intervene and got badly Kerm-stung for it. But eventually we made peace with Jonelle and, more importantly, helped to broker a peace between her and Elton.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton took a long drink of water. Tom quietly re-filled his glass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBy then of course,\u201D Jonton said heavily, \u201Cthe Kerm Conflict had escalated into all-out war.\u201D He paused. \u201CAnd, another Kerm was about to Awaken \u2013 after we had learned many hard lessons from Jonelle\u2019s Awakening.\u201D He looked down at the table before staring out at the hidden audience. \u201CThis is the last part of the story and it started with a request from Elton.\u201D The cameras zoomed in on his sombre expression. \u201CI know this will be difficult for many of you but please, please remember that it started with a request from a Kerm.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe audience fell silent as Jonton finished his summary of Obrinn\u2019s origins as a frozen seed with a brief description of the Berelgan\u2019s Kerm telegraph. Around the table, Chief Ambassador Aldwell\u2019s expression was unreadable. He glanced at Chadwick before shaking his head and turning back to Jonton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you for a most illuminating \u2013 and admirably brief \u2013 summary, Mr Jonton.\u201D Aldwell steepled his fingers and stared directly at the cameras positioned just off-stage. \u201CMy views on the cold storage of Kerm seeds have always been quite clear and I have made no efforts to hide them, as my fellow Pillars will be more than aware. On my own, I would not have authorised the course of action which led to Guardian Obrinn being planted.\u201D Aldwell laced his fingers together. \u201CHowever, I am kerbal, and as such, I would have found it extremely difficult to gainsay a direct request from Guardian Elton. I would encourage all those who hold similar views to myself to reflect on that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIndeed.\u201D President Chadwick took a sip of water. \u201CAnd be assured that it was only after a great deal of personal reflection and considerable debate in Council that the decision was made to entrust the final decision on the cold storage of Kerm seeds, to the Kerm themselves. Including Guardian Elton, twenty Kerm in each Regionality will be Awakened. The Kerm telegraph will be extended to link each and every one of the Awakened Kerm. We shall present all sides of the argument to them, and then we shall act on their verdict.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe can also hope,\u201D Aldwell stated, \u201Cbut cannot presume to insist, that they will follow Jonton and Guardian Elton\u2019s example by deliberately restricting their territories for the sake of all the Kerm yet unplanted. And thus, as set out in the Joint Declaration, do we hope to bring an end to the Kerm crisis.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs do we all, Chief Ambassador. As do we all.\u201D Tom took a deep breath. \u201CBefore we open the floor to our audience, I do have one question of my own. What is going to happen to Project Starseed?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThus far, the Confederacy has played a very minor part in the space program.\u201D Aldwell gestured at Chadwick. \u201CI believe that President Chadwick will be better placed to answer that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadwick nodded his thanks. \u201CVery briefly, Tom, Starseed continues - because it may yet be our one and only option to survive the Kerm Crisis.\u201D He ticked off his points on his fingers. \u201CEven if the Awakened Kerm permit cold storage of seeds \u2013 which remains to be seen \u2013 that merely postpones the inevitable. Many more Kerm would need to be Awakened and to agree to restrict their territories to create sufficient planting space for the ongoing Seeding. As Chief Ambassador Aldwell noted, we hope but cannot presume that they will do so.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadwick took a sip of water. \u201CTherefore, the Council stands behind the Kerbin Space Agency and the magnificent achievements of it and all its volunteers.\u201D The corner of his lip quirked upwards. \u201CMore tangibly, an emergency, cross-Regionality, Starseed funding bill is being drafted, as we speak.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd about time too!\u201D came a call from the audience, to growing applause. Tom raised his hands for calm. \u201CMr President?\u201D He saw the slight shake of Chadwick\u2019s head. \u201CIn that case, I open the floor to our audience. And for our first question\u2026 yes, you ma\u2019am, in the green poncho.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Joint Declaration seems like an awfully large change of policy for the Twelve Pillars. May I ask what prompted this plan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA very good question,\u201D Chadwick replied. \u201CIn truth, it was not a new idea. It had been mooted in Council and proposed a number of times by various sources. Including,\u201D he added, \u201Cpart of from Geneney Kerman \u2013 yes, the KSA flight director \u2013 given as part of a testimony on a matter concerning the space program. Mr Geneney advised us that he had communed with Guardian Elton and found him to be a firm supporter of Starseed. On that basis, he wondered if we should find out whether any other Kerm felt the same way. It later transpired from a conversation with Director Lodan that Mr Geneney had previously been heard to comment, rather pointedly, that the Kerm Conflict \u2018mostly boiled down to people fighting over what they \u003Ci\u003Ethink\u003C/i\u003E the Kerm want and that maybe one of us needs to ask one them what they \u003Ci\u003Eactually\u003C/i\u003E want.\u2019 \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldwell nodded. \u201CWhilst a perfectly reasonable suggestion it did have the very obvious flaw that we could only Commune with one Kerm at a time and, crucially, that there no was no apparent way for widely separated Kerm to confer amongst themselves and arrive at a joint decision without kerbal input. As you\u2019ll appreciate, we anticipated a certain amount of difficulty in finding kerbal go-betweens whom everyone would trust. The Kerm telegraph avoids that difficulty.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, indeed,\u201D murmured Tom. He scanned the audience. \u201CNext question please \u2013 from you, sir, I think.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Kerm telegraph seems terribly convenient. Other than Mr Jonton\u2019s word, what proof do we have that it\u2019s real?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTom chuckled for a second. \u201CPlease excuse the levity because that is also a very good question. May I ask, sir, do you watch Engines and Engineers?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve seen every episode but yes, I do. Or did.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTom nodded. \u201CThe Council didn\u2019t expect\u003Ci\u003E \u003C/i\u003Epeople to take the Telegraph seriously. I didn\u2019t, when I was first told about it \u2013 couldn\u2019t get the image of a big old Kerm tree reaching down with one of its branches and tapping away at a telegraph key.\u201D He waited for the laughter to die away. \u201CThey thought everyone might have an easier time believing it from Engines and Engineers which, I have to say, was extremely flattering. So we ran an \u2018Is it Fake?\u2019 investigation on the whole thing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTom\u2019s eyes lost their focus for a second. \u201CThe scientists at the Berelgan showed us \u003Ci\u003Eeverything\u003C/i\u003E. We got to Commune with Guardian Obrinn, we got to\u2026 experience is the only word I can think of\u2026 him using the Telegraph, and we tested that piece of equipment every which way we could think of. We\u2019ll be broadcasting the investigation tomorrow night and I would urge everyone to watch it and make up their own minds.\u201D Tom\u2019s voice shook. \u201CBut my mind is quite made up. The Kerm telegraph is real \u2013 and it is wonderful. Next question please. Two rows back, striped scarf. Yes ma\u2019am?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWho\u2019s going to Awaken all those Kerm?\u201D The question dropped into a sudden silence. Jonton raised his hand. \u201CIf I may?\u201D Everyone around the table nodded their assent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs with so much else about the Kerm crisis, we\u2019ll be seeking volunteers. They will get to Commune with Elton and his daughter.\u201D A ripple of surprise ran through the audience. \u201CYes, he thinks of Jonelle as his daughter. The volunteers will get a chance to understand the joy of Communion with two Awakened Kerm. They will also get a chance to understand the risks involved.\u201D Jonton\u2019s voice went flat. \u201CThey will get to see Gerselle and, if I am strong enough to face it, to experience her\u2026 accident. Nothing will be hidden.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Jonton.\u201D Tom said respectfully. \u201CAnother question please.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat are you going to tell the Awakened Kerm? For all of Chief Ambassador\u2019s fine words, how can we tell that the politicians won\u2019t just ask the question that gets them the answer they want?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldwell adjusted his microphone. \u201CAn excellent question and one which I personally raised in Council although not in quite such blunt terms. However, if I may borrow Mr Jonton\u2019s words, nothing will be hidden. \u003Ci\u003EEveryone\u003C/i\u003E, be they kermol, neo-Kerman, or a Child of Kerbin, will have their views put before the Kerm. On that you have my word.\u201D Aldwell looked straight at the camera. \u201CIn this forum, as a Pillar of the Council, I do place my words on the public record.\u201D He turned back to the audience. \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u201CI trust you will find that sufficient, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis questioner nodded dumbly. \u201CVery much. Thank you, Chief Ambassador.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd on a practical note,\u201D Chadwick added. \u201CAll aspects of our case before the Kerm will be made available to the public for scrutiny and suggested revisions, with the final version being approved by pan-Regionality referendum.\u201D He paused. \u201CTom, before we go back to the audience, I have a question of my own.\u201D Chadwick looked at Jonton. \u201CYou took it upon yourself to speak for Guardian Elton when you told us that planting Guardian Obrinn was done at his behest. May I presume that you consulted Guardian Elton before attributing these actions to him?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CYou may, Chief Ambassador.

The major milestones won\u0027t be a big surprise if you\u0027ve played KSP but I\u0027ve tried to put my own spin on them - my kerbals tend to be a fairly serious lot, certainly when it comes to rocket engineering but the various space crews do find time for some light hearted moments as well.

Away from all the adrenalin and rocket fuel, away from the intrepid engineers and pilots of the space program, these are the farmers, villagers, and everyday kerbals-on-the-street. You\u0027ll get to know some of them quite well. Along the way you also get to find out about the historical significance of the Kerman name and why quite so many kerbals share it.\u00A0There\u0027s also a fair bit of other worldbuilding mixed in throughout the story - architecture, food and drink (including those all important snacks \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022105.88\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022 width=\u002217\u0022\u003E ), family life, funeral rites, flora and fauna, and fragments of an ancient language.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrucially, you also get to meet the \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E sentient species on Kerbin and find out about their history with the kerbals, how that history has shaped kerbal society over the centuries,\u00A0 how much of it\u00A0 has since been lost.

The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s main assembly floor stretched out before him, a Type 6 core stage, all four lateral boosters attached, stood atop its mobile launcher, cradled within a tower of gantries and walkways that allowed access to the various rocket systems. Overhead, the second stage edged towards the launcher, suspended from its oversized gantry crane. Danfen watched the crane crawl past, mentally measuring it up for the massive Type 7 second stage that he and his team were constructing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the far end of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, a payload fairing sat nestled within its own gantries, both halves united and ready for mating to the completed Type 6 booster. Danfen could make out the faint seam between the halves, marked by the equally faint bulges covering the latches and modified Roncott actuators that would deploy the fairing in flight, to reveal the second of many cargo pallets to be delivered to the growing \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u003C/i\u003E space station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNodding to himself in satisfaction, Danfen picked up a full-to-bursting clipboard from his desk and let himself out of the office, locking the door behind him. As he left the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, he noticed a crowd gathering around the entrance to Manufactory B. Quickening his pace, he joined the group of engineers and machinists in time to watch a massive, blunt ended cylinder emerge from the main doors on its oversized tractor-trailers. Impossibly, the cylinder kept on coming, dwarfing the figures around it, an immense flag of all-Kerbin painted on its gleaming white flanks. The tips of two gigantic shrouds appeared, their smoothly flaring surfaces hiding the complexities beneath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, finally, the engine bells emerged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen walked around behind the rearmost trailer and stared up at the five SK-2M Mainsails, each of their gaping maws more than able to accommodate two kerbals, one standing on the other\u2019s shoulders. \u003Ci\u003EAssuming\u003C/i\u003E, he thought, \u003Ci\u003Ethat such a thing was\u003C/i\u003E \u003Ci\u003Epossible\u003C/i\u003E. He lifted his eyes to the sky, picturing the booster stage in front of him, standing upright on the launch pad, second stage and payload stage stacked atop it in a titanic monument to engineering ambition and desperate need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre they really, um, going to launch that?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeelan snorted. \u201CThey\u2019d better.

The review team here thought your design was solid.

Whatever happens, we\u2019re going to know about it in detail.\u201D He looked Roncott in the eye. \u201CBut if it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work. We go back to the drawing board and try again \u2013 with plenty of honest-to-Kerm test data to work with next time.\u201D A flashing light in the distance caught Bob\u2019s attention. \u201CRight now, though, I think our transport is arriving.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs if on cue, doors began opening around them, a growing crowd of kerbals joining the three engineers. Everyone backed themselves against the walls to let the enormous flat-bed truck back up into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, its cab doors painted with the logo of a local speciality haulage company. Bob watched the massive test spacecraft descending centimetre by centimetre, finally settling into place on its shipping cradle. He saw the tension on Roncott\u2019s face as a team of white hatted kerbals tied the spacecraft down. Then, with a blast on its horn and a whine of high-powered electric motors under strain, the truck rumbled forward.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it cleared the Space Centre gates and pulled out onto the main road, the truck was joined by two outriders from the Barkton Department of Civic Works, the warning lights on their roofs strobing bright orange. Bob could hardly bear to see the look on Roncott\u2019s face as the haulage truck, and its oversized cargo, reached the next junction and took a ponderous left turn towards Barkton railway depot. \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EWith a last glimpse of flickering orange, the trailing outrider rounded the corner and disappeared from sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton writhed on his bed, only deep-seated instinct holding his head still enough to maintain Communion.

Gerselle\u2019s last, desperate plea rang in his ears, his link to Elton constricting again in response. \u003Ci\u003EIncluding whichever poor kerbals were Communing with us\u003C/i\u003E.

Jonton sat up and rubbed his, still-throbbing, knuckles, the gashes across the backs of his hands matched by the streaks of blood across the bedstead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next morning, Jonton watched a small group winding their way up the path to his hut. Most of them were elderly but he was pleased to see a number of younger faces in amongst them. He waited for them to gather at the top of the hill before stepping out to greet them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood morning everyone. Thank you all for coming \u2013 it\u2019s good to see so many of you. Please come on in. This is Patbro,\u201D Jonto gestured at his friend sitting at the kitchen table. \u201CKeeper of one of the nearby Groves and one of my best friends. I spend a lot of my time at Guardian Jonelle\u2019s Grove and Patbro has been very kind in helping me look after my hut here and being a companion for Guardian Elton.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot that that is \u003Ci\u003Eany\u003C/i\u003E sort of chore,\u201D Patbro stood up. \u201CWelcome everyone.\u201D He studied the group, noting the green trimmed collars on several ponchos. \u201CGuardian Elton has asked to Commune with you all together without myself or Jonton present.\u201D Two or three of the faces staring back at him looked suddenly nervous and he gave them a reassuring smile. \u201CDon\u2019t worry if you haven\u2019t Communed before; we will be there to help you get ready, and I\u2019m sure some of the Keepers here will be glad to help too. So, if you\u2019d like to follow me please.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton followed the group into his sleep room and its rows of bunks, all neatly made up. He and Patbro moved through the group, helping everyone to get settled, bringing extra pillows for some, and offering discreet reassurance to others, including some of the Keepers. They watched as everyone lifted his or head into a waiting leaf cluster, waited until they were all safely in Communion and then left, closing the door behind them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat did you think?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton scratched his head. \u201CThe number of first-timers was encouraging. Definitely a few nervous faces when you mentioned that we wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut none of them backed out. They all passed Elton\u2019s first test.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhich was also encouraging.\u201D Jonton\u2019s face looked suddenly haggard. \u201CI wonder how many will pass the second one.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe clock on the wall had just chimed twelve, when the kitchen door opened and a group of pale-faced and visibly shaken kerbals filed into the room. Jonton stood up to greet them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry that you had to see that.\u201D The quiet sincerity in his voice and shadows behind his eyes were enough to still any questions. \u201COne reason that Elton asked to speak to you without me was that he knew I couldn\u2019t bring myself to live through it again, even with his support. Please believe me when I say that we tried.\u201D Jonton swallowed and when he spoke again, there was an unmistakeable quiver in his voice. \u201CIf any of you wish to, you would be welcome to visit Jonelle\u2019s Grove this afternoon and see Gerselle for yourself.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI would like to see her.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA young kermol, possibly the youngest in the group Jonton thought, stepped forward. \u201CI don\u2019t know how many new Kerm will be in the One-Twenty but I would like to be Keeper for one if you\u2019ll have me.\u201D The kermol looked up, shadows behind his own eyes. \u201CMy great uncle\u2019s Grove was one of the first to Seed.\u201D He looked straight at Jonton. \u201CAnd after Communing with Guardian Elton, I think it may have been seeing great uncle Cormund on the news that prompted you to plant that thirty-seventh cutting in your Grove.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u2019s jaw dropped open. Before he could speak, one of the older Keepers stepped in and clapped the young kermol on the shoulder \u201CBravely said, lad. Your great-uncle would be proud to hear you.\u201D He turned to face Jonton. \u201CReckon I\u2019d like to see your Gerselle too \u2013 and you can all count me in for the One-Twenty if you need me. If I could talk to my old Kerm like I jus\u2019 did with your Elton, that would make it all worth it. And if anything goes wrong, well we\u2019ve both had a good turn.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis expression turned inward. \u201CMy missus passed on two years ago this month and our lad never came home from Wakira. Nobody left to miss this old kermol. And we\u2019re at the end of a valley to boot \u2013 only one neighbouring Grove and that not close enough to take any hurt. Just promise me that the folks in my village will be taken care of if it comes to it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs he turned off the highway and onto the back roads leading to Elton\u2019s Grove, Jeb glanced at Wernher in the passenger seat. \u201CWe missed that last turning when I came here with Gene. Took us a while to find the right road again.\u201D The engineer and veteran kerbonaut grunted, staring straight ahead with his arms folded across his seatbelt, as he had for most of the journey. Jeb glanced at his friend and nodded to himself before turning his attention back to the road.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs before, the forest began to thin out and streetlights began to appear by the side of the road. Jeb caught a glimpse of a marquee in a field, ghostly with lights glowing behind its canvas walls. He took a now-familiar right turn, skirting around the village before pulling up at the foot of the hill leading up to Jonton\u2019s hut. He thumbed the motor off and rested his hand on Wernher\u2019s shoulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf I know Patbro, he\u2019ll have a good hot meal waiting for us. Come on \u2013 let\u2019s not disappoint him.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded and climbed out of the car. He glanced at the multi-story hut silhouetted against the evening sky. \u201COdd-looking hut. Was the Keeper trying to make it look like something out of a kerblet\u2019s storybook?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb chuckled. \u201CNow that you mention it \u2013 and you should have seen it by munlight.\u201D He closed the car door. \u201CLong story but Jonton had it built to accommodate all the travellers coming to Commune with him. Apparently, that\u2019s when the whole Sage of Barkton thing got started although it was around the time of Ornie\u2019s crash which probably explains why I didn\u2019t hear much about it.\u201D \u003Ci\u003EAnd about the time you flew out to Site D\u003C/i\u003E, he added silently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh,\u201D Wernher frowned. \u201CI thought Jonton was the Keeper, not the Kerm?\u201D He saw Jeb\u2019s patient expression. \u201CSorry \u2013 I think you\u2019ve explained all this to me before but it didn\u2019t really sink in.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot a problem.\u201D Jeb gripped Wernher\u2019s shoulder. \u201CElton \u2013 he\u2019s the Kerm \u2013 will be able to \u003Ci\u003Eshow\u003C/i\u003E you everything much more clearly than I can explain it anyway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they walked up the path, the front door opened and a figure stepped out to greet them. \u201CGood evening, Jebed\u2026 sorry, Jeb.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CPreserve me but I\u2019m still not used to that. And you must be Wernher? Please \u2013 come inside.\u201D Patbro bustled in ahead of them. \u201CThere\u2019s fish stew on the stove if you\u2019d like, although I don\u2019t have much more than herbed bread and butter to go with it and fruit and coffee for afters.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFish stew sounds more than welcome to me.\u201D Jeb glanced at Wernher, who nodded. \u201CTo both of us. You shouldn\u2019t have gone to so much trouble though, Patbro.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, it\u2019s no trouble.\u201D Patbro hunted in a cupboard and produced a tin. \u201CDo you take your coffee with anise, Wernher? I know Jeb does.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes please. And a pinch of firewhisker if you have any.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb opened his mouth before hastily closing it again. Patbro looked surprised. \u201CYou don\u2019t sound Wakiran, never mind Hazachim. I should introduce you to Enely.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, I\u2019m not Wakiran. I\u2019ve just spent a lot of time working near the edge of the Hazachi desert. You pick up some of the local tastes.\u201D A bleak expression crossed Wernher\u2019s face. \u201COne of my colleagues was Hazachim \u2013 he introduced me to firewhisker coffee.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro looked from one to the other. \u201CAnd maybe that\u2019s a story for another time, if you ever feel like telling it. But for now, you\u2019re here to Commune with Elton and that always goes better on a full stomach. Pull up a seat both of you and I\u2019ll serve up.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a hearty supper in which Wernher was persuaded to take second helpings of stew and Jeb managed to eat over half a loaf of herbed bread, the three kerbals finally pushed their plates away. Wernher sipped at the remains of his coffee, a distant look on his face. Jeb eyed him for a moment before leaning back in his chair. \u201CThanks, Patbro \u2013 that was excellent.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re welcome.\u201D Patbro cleared his throat. \u201CIf you\u2019re ready, Wernher? I know Elton would be keen to speak to you tonight if he can.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI suppose so.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb got to his feet. \u201CI\u2019ll help you. It\u2019s a bit unnerving the first time.\u201D He put his hand on Wernher\u2019s shoulder. \u2018Come on.\u201D He led his friend out of the kitchen, nodding to Patbro as he went. The Keeper poured himself another coffee and retired to the sitting room to wait. He had just begun to think about reading the book that he was thumbing through when the sound of footsteps made him look up. \u201CIs everything all right?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb came into the room, closing the door behind him. \u201CHe\u2019s fine, I think. He wasn\u2019t showing any signs of coming back out of Communion anyway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro sniffed the air and glanced at the ceiling. \u201CNo reaction from Elton either.\u201D He waited until Jeb was seated. \u201CHow is Geneney?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe\u2019s very well. It\u2019s been a long couple of weeks for him though, taking the second half of the Tenacity flight.\u201D Jeb stretched out his legs. \u201CWe can show you Tenacity tomorrow if you\u2019d like, assuming Guardian Elton is still available?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe will be for that. We\u2019ve tried to keep him up to date with the space program but we can only show him what we see on the news.\u201D Patbro\u2019s face clouded over. \u201CUnless Wernher needs more time with him. I\u2019ve seen that thousand-metre stare before on Jonton and it was never a good sign.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo.\u201D Jeb sighed. \u201CBetween you, me and the four walls?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe colleague he mentioned, the one who introduced him to firewhisker coffee, was Hading Kerman.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro looked puzzled for a moment, then his eyes widened. \u201CAs in the\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHading Accords? Yep. Wernher was out at Site D when all that happened. Led the survivors to safety and nearly killed himself in the process.\u201D Jeb shivered. \u201CI saw him in hospital afterwards \u2013 he was \u003Ci\u003Ewizened\u003C/i\u003E. Like a piece of fruit left too long in the sun, which I guess isn\u2019t far off the truth. The hospital managed to fix his heatstroke and dehydration on the outside but they\u2019ll still be there on the inside; locked away behind that thousand metre stare. Elton will help.\u201D Jeb\u2019s voice lost its bleak edge. \u201CHe helped me and before we Communed, I would have told you that that was impossible.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro nodded. \u201CHe has a way about him. Sometimes I think it\u2019s just his sheer age. I doubt there\u2019s much he hasn\u2019t seen over the centuries.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat would give him the long view on most things,\u201D Jeb stared at the ceiling reflectively. \u201CAwakening the One-Twenty\u2026 I just hope that most of them turn out to be like him.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was Patbro\u2019s turn to shiver. \u201CAs do I but I fear they may not be. There\u2019s a lot of Jonton in Elton I think, because of the length of time that he spent an-Kerm before Elton\u2019s Awakening. The others won\u2019t get that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd isn\u2019t that a cheery thought.\u201D Jeb shook his head. \u201CGenie was right though, for better or for worse. Asking the Kerm what they actually want rather than fighting over what we think they want.\u201D He glanced at the door. \u201CThey\u2019re taking a long time in there.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou took longer,\u201D Patbro replied with a faint smile. \u201CHow about a game of Tiles while we\u2019re waiting?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019ll have to remind me how \u2013 I can\u2019t remember the last time I played.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game trickled along, both players paying more attention to listening for footsteps than the game board. Jeb was about to suggest that they called it a draw and put the board away when Wernher appeared in the doorway, blinking in the light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGreat \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKer\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2026\u201D He paused. \u201CThat doesn\u2019t seem particularly appropriate.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry,\u201D said Patbro. \u201CYou\u2019re far from the first and I doubt you\u2019ll be the last.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded and arranged himself on top of a sack chair. \u201CI see why you insisted on doing this, Jeb. That was\u2026was\u2026\u201D He shook his head. \u201CI could go kermol right now and join the One-Twenty.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s far more coherent than Genie and I were after meeting him,\u201D Jeb said wryly. \u201CDid you manage to get a word in edgeways or have you been answering questions about spaceflight for the last couple of hours?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo\u2026no we talked about a lot of things. A lot of things.\u201D Wernher stared at the wall. \u201CIncluding the thing we came to talk about, before you ask, Jeb.\u201D He raised a finger. \u201CNot now. I\u2019m going to need some time to think it all over but tonight\u2026 gave me a different perspective on it all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know that feeling,\u201D Jeb said quietly. \u201CI\u2019m glad he managed to help you as well, old friend.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher gave him a wan smile. \u201CHe certainly did. But if you good kerbals will excuse me, I think I\u2019ll turn in.\u201D The smile became more genuine. \u201CYou should get some sleep too, Jeb.

I would introduce you to Jonton my First of Keepers, his daughter Joenie, and my own daughter Jonelle\u0026gt; \u003C/i\u003EA flicker of pride rippled over them and the haze fell away. One of the two presences came \u003Ci\u003Eforward\u003C/i\u003E, greeting Patbro happily and studying himself and Wernher with what felt like awe. The second presence stayed back at a more reserved distance. Beyond them, the previously misty expanse flared into brightness, revealing a second, flatter mindscape, a row of trees marking the border between it \u2013 her, Jeb realised belatedly \u2013 and Elton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u0026lt;\u2026Jebediah and Wernher.

Fragments of muted conversation and flickering emotions washed over the others, finishing in a wave of resignation that was echoed by an undercurrent of amused tolerance from Elton\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EAll right, Joenie. All\u003C/i\u003E right. \u003Ci\u003EI\u2019ll ask him\u003C/i\u003E. Jonton turned to Jeb, his mental voice sounding faintly embarrassed. \u003Ci\u003EI\u2019m sorry about this but my daughter has reminded me to ask if you have time to visit a friend of hers.\u003C/i\u003E An image of a cardboard box appeared, a pair of small feet protruding out from under it and what looked like a framed picture of Kerbin from space resting against the side. A kerblet crawled out from under the box, turned the picture round to show a picture of the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En and disappeared back inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb stared. \u003Ci\u003EI recognise those photos.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EFrom the old \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E shop I think\u003C/i\u003E, said Wernher. \u003Ci\u003EI like the spacecraft design \u2013 very compact.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003ESturdier than Kerbal 1\u003C/i\u003E, Jeb agreed with a grin. He turned to face Joenie\u003Ci\u003E. I\u2019d be very happy to meet your kerbonaut friend,\u003C/i\u003E he said. \u003Ci\u003EWhat\u2019s his name?\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EGildas\u003C/i\u003E.

Of course\u0026gt;\u003C/i\u003E he added in response to an unvoiced question from the engineer, and the mindscape shimmered into a star-speckled blackness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey sensed Wernher\u2019s concentration and then a shape appeared, an outline at first, which only Jeb recognised, but quickly acquiring more detail. A second, larger, shape sketched itself out behind the first, before it too gained definition and form.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EThese are the first two parts of the\u003C/i\u003E \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u003C/i\u003E \u003Ci\u003Espace station\u003C/i\u003E, Wernher began. \u003Ci\u003EAs I mentioned to Elton last night, Tenacity can\u2019t fly anywhere \u2013 it isn\u2019t a spacecraft \u2013 but we\u2019re building it to practice making the parts for the Duna ships and to practice putting them together in space.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u0026lt;how many kerbals can live inside?\u0026gt;\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EOnly four at the moment. There\u2019s room for many more but we can only bring four home if something goes wrong because we only have room for one actual spaceship\u003C/i\u003E. A Pioneer capsule blinked into view, docked to the front of the fledgling space station. \u003Ci\u003EEventually we\u2019ll have room for a second spaceship, so we\u2019ll be able to double the crew, but that won\u2019t happen for another two flights\u003C/i\u003E. \u003Ci\u003ERight now, we\u2019re building another part of the station. It\u2019s not finished yet but this is what it looks like so far.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne by one, a set of eight tubular spokes appeared, arranged around the central hub module which Wernher had already sketched out. Jeb felt a familiar wave of concentration from Elton, matched by intense curiosity and then delighted recognition from Jonelle. A burst of images flickered between her and Joenie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u0026lt;this is good. You make very clear images\u0026gt;\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sensed Wernher\u2019s reticence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EI suppose I\u2019ve always found it easier to build things if I can visualise them first. Anyway, each spoke will be more than twice as long when it\u2019s finished and then we\u2019ll join them all up to make a wheel.

High atop the transporter, a lone, yellow hatted kerbal watched them go before turning to face the booster and raising both clenched fists over his head. With a great clanking of steel treads and a deep thrumming rumble that shook the ground beneath their feet, the transporter crept forward, beginning the half-day journey that would carry the Rockomax Type 7, \u003Ci\u003ELeviathan\u003C/i\u003E to its launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CT minus forty seconds and counting.

Remaining engines are Go.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton didn\u2019t need to consult the mission rules. \u201CChamber temperature?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWarm, Flight. We\u2019re thinking a jammed intake valve, maybe a plumbing failure from the pogo but we\u2019re not seeing a LOX leak.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton heard more than a few relieved murmurs from around the consoles. \u201CThank you, Booster. Guidance?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWorking it, Flight but it\u2019s not looking good. We\u2019re off trajectory on stage one, which just threw out most of our contingency plans for stage two, which didn\u2019t figure on an engine-out before staging anyway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood.

Around the room, the flight controllers sat hunched over their screens, one of them tapping a pen on the edge of his console in a broken rhythm that Nelton doubted he was even aware of. Then a green light glowed on her communications panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, FD.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo ahead FD.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo for staging, Flight. Switching to onboard camera.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe controllers around the Booster console looked up before going back to their readouts. A sudden silence descended as the remaining controllers turned to face the darkened main screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA crescent sliver of light appeared, followed by a dazzling glare from the stage separation motors. The flare subsided, leaving a view of \u003Ci\u003ELeviathan\u003C/i\u003E\u2019s first stage falling away towards a curved, blue horizon. Seconds later the interstage slid free, lit from within by the glowing engine bells of the four functional SK1-P second stage engines, and then blasted away, limned with flame, by their exhaust plumes. As the still-burning shroud tumbled away, Kerbin was revealed in all its majesty, the Doreni coastline rolling past the camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSecond stage ignition confirmed on two through five. All systems nominal at this time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a patter of relieved applause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Booster.\u201D Nelton sat back in her chair, eyes flicking between the repeater displays on her console and the view from space on the main screen. The sudden jangle of a ringing phone broke the quiet the light on her console indicating an external line. Frowning, she pressed the button to divert the call and turned back to her displays, flipping through her communication loops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the phone rang again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScowling, she picked up the receiver. A handful of controllers glanced round and promptly turned back to their consoles at the sight of their flight director\u2019s face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNelton.\u201D She cocked her head to one side, lips compressing to a thin line as she listened. \u201CYou can tell Ademone that I\u2019ll be there at her earliest convenience \u003Ci\u003Eafter\u003C/i\u003E we reach orbit. Now get off this line.\u201D Not waiting for a reply, Nelton dropped the receiver onto its cradle and turned back to the main screen. \u201CHow\u2019s it going, Guidance.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTouch and go, Flight.\u201D The strain in the controller\u2019s voice was audible. \u201CWe\u2019re in mode eight and our propellant levels are way off the curve.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood.\u201D Nelton picked up her phone and dialled for an outside line. \u201CHello, Gene. We\u2019ve had a couple of problems here. You have? Yeah, we\u2019re working that. Your bird\u2019s going to space but we can\u2019t guarantee your periapsis. Understood \u2013 we\u2019ll drop the booster as soon as. Thanks, Gene.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Guidance.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo ahead, Guidance.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got a periapsis, Flight but we\u2019ve also got an amber quantity light on both tanks.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood work. Stage on red.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy tha\u2026 staging! Clean separation!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll eyes turned to the trajectory plot on the main screen which showed \u003Ci\u003ELeviathan\u003C/i\u003E\u2019s payload in a pronounced elliptical orbit. The seconds dragged out, seemingly into minutes, and then cheers erupted around the room as the ellipse began to expand, lifting the lower point of the Orbital Propellant Test Article\u2019s orbit out of the atmosphere and up to a safer altitude. Nelton dipped her head, acknowledging the collective thumbs up from her flight controllers before mopping her brow and picking up the phone to Barkton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can see that but what in the seven smoking hells \u003Ci\u003Ehappened\u003C/i\u003E?\u201D Nelton surveyed the wreckage. One end of the flame trench had collapsed entirely, revealing twisted rebar and torn pipes. Blackened refractory bricks lay strewn across the floor of the trench, like a set of blocks discarded by a bored kerblet. Despite herself, Nelton winced at the sight of still more bricks scattered over the launchpad itself. On both sides of the trench, the massive spray heads for the sound suppression system were twisted out of true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI would quite like to know that too.\u201D Ademone\u2019s quiet words cut through Nelton\u2019s shock. \u201CI thought these systems had been thoroughly proven on the test stand?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey were.\u201D Hanbal ran his hands through his hair distractedly. \u201CWe scaled them up from the Type 6 launchpad and added an extremely conservative safety factor on top of that. We never had a single problem on the test stand.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen nodded. \u201CHe\u2019s right. The sound suppression system was the most reliable part of that stand.\u201D He poked a charred lump of brick with his toe. \u201CThe only thing I can think of is some kind of resonance effect. Something that only became a problem when the booster lifted away from the pad.\u201D He lifted his hands. \u201CDon\u2019t hold me to that, but booster altitude is about the only factor we can\u2019t simulate on the stand. I\u2019ll start with the camera footage and see if we can pin down when it happened \u2013 whatever it was.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo that.\u201D Ademone turned to her flight director. \u201CCould the problems with the booster have been caused by acoustic damage?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton shook her head. \u201CToo early to tell. It might have contributed but the engine-out happened too high up for it to be the only cause.\u201D She glanced at the chunk of brick by Danfen\u2019s foot. \u201CWe saw a lot of pogo on the way up, so my guess would be that as the primary cause. The second stage problems were almost certainly caused by pogo.\u201D She looked at the chief engineer. \u201CWe\u2019ll cross check the telemetry feeds with your camera footage anyway and see if anything matches up. I\u2019ll get a flight operations team together as soon as we hand over control of the payload to Barkton.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd I\u2019ll put a team to work on figuring out the pogo problem.\u201D Hanbal rubbed the corners of his eyes. \u201CWe found a way to control it on the Type 6 \u2013 we\u2019ll find a way to control it on the Type 7.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton stacked the last of the lunchtime dishes in the sink and put the kettle on. \u201CWho\u2019s for coffee, who\u2019s for \u003Ci\u003Edjeng\u003C/i\u003E?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCoffee for me please,\u201D Meleny called from her sack chair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBlack coffee for me please,\u201D said Enely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCould I have a coffee and sapwood, Dad?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u2019s eyebrows lifted, as the rest of the party called out their preferences. He found a nearly empty bottle of sapwood syrup at the back of one of the kitchen cupboards and set it down on the worktop. The kettle clicked off behind him and presently, the aromas of fresh coffee and hot djeng filled the room. Jonton put everything on a tray and carried it over to the living room table. He poured everyone\u2019s drink, watching Joenie\u2019s change in expression with a faint smile as she stirred two spoonfuls of syrup into her coffee and blew on it before taking a sip. A dish of sweet nibbles was handed round before Jonton disappeared into the next room and returned with a bag. He tapped on the table for attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe all knew this day would have to come but now that it has, I think we all wish it hadn\u2019t had to come so soon.\u201D Jonton watched Joenie nodding vigorously. \u201CIn many ways it feels like Enely has always been here and having him go is going to be like losing one of the family. But we also know that he\u2019s leaving to do important work that very few others in the world can do.\u201D Jonton lifted his mug. \u201CSo, this one\u2019s for Enely \u2013 and we wish him the very best of luck on his next journey.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTo Enely!\u201D Everyone clinked their mugs against his in a toast. Enely blushed with pleasure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton cleared his throat. \u201CWe\u2019ve also got a few little things for you to take with you and remember us by.\u201D He reached into the bag and pulled out Enely\u2019s pack. \u201CThis is from Fred and Ferry, hopefully as good as new.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely turned his cleaned and mended pack over in his hands, noting the new stitching and straps, their buckles polished up to a soft gleam. Feeling a lump in the bottom, he opened it and pulled out a similarly polished and mended mess kit. \u201CThey\u2019re better than new.\u201D He looked up at Ferry. \u201CYou shouldn\u2019t have\u2026 thank you both very much.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFredlorf waved his thanks away. \u201CYou\u2019re welcome. Couldn\u2019t let a \u2018kerb hit the road without mended gear or a good pack to see him right.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is from Meleny, Thombal and Adbas.\u201D Jonton pulled a small wooden chest out of the bag. \u201CAdbas and Thombal made the chest and Meleny filled it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s beautifully made.\u201D Enely looked at Adbas. \u201CYou could be a joiner.\u201D He opened the chest and found it packed with rows of labelled herb bags, each tied off with a little drawstring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey\u2019re all traditional Kolan blends. Some for food, some for drinking, and a couple for freshening a room and helping you sleep.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely read the label on one of the bags and smiled. \u201CI know this one.\u201D He lifted out another bag and tugged the drawstring open. \u201CAnd I don\u2019t need to read the label on this one \u2013 thank you all very much!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton waited for Enely to put his herb chest to one side before handing him two small, oddly shaped parcels. \u201CThese are from Mallas and Joenie.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside the first parcel was a dark wooden trinket carved into the shape of a cactus. Enely held it up the light, turning it this way and that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKerm wood for luck,\u201D said Mallas. \u201CGuardian Elton contributed the wood; I just did the carving.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt is also beautifully made \u2013 and a very good likeness. Thank you, Mallas.\u201D Enely unwrapped his second parcel and a polished slice of lighter wood fell out, a keyring fastened through a knothole in one corner. Both surfaces were carved with the letter J, in slightly wobbly strokes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJ for Joenie,\u201D Enely hugged her. \u201CAnd also, J for Jonelle?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie nodded. \u201CShe let me have a piece of her branch.\u201D A note of pride crept into her voice. \u201CAnd I did most of the carving but Mallas helped with the curvy lines.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s wonderful \u2013 thank you.\u201D Enely clipped the keyring onto one of the buckles on his newly mended pack. \u201CI\u2019ll keep it on here and take it with me everywhere I go.\u201D Joenie beamed at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton waited for Enely to sit down again. \u201CAnd finally,\u201D he said, \u201CI wanted you to have this.\u201D He handed Enely a small brass plate, chased with a Kerm leaf design around its edges. \u201CIt\u2019s from my student days - I don\u2019t know if you have them in Wakira but you wear it on your belt for good luck during exams.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely took the belt charm. \u201CI don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u0022 He turned the charm over in his hands and noticed two numbers engraved between the belt slots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTelephone numbers for here and my hut,\u201D Jonton said quietly. He walked round and gave Enely a hug. \u201CCall any time \u2013 don\u2019t be a stranger.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely blinked the dampness out of his eyes. \u201CI won\u2019t. Thank you, Jonton.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re very welcome.\u201D Jonton raised his voice. \u201CWe\u2019ve still got time for Enely to say goodbye to Elton and Jonelle, before we take him to the station. You\u2019re all welcome to join us \u2013 as most of us have discovered, some things are easier to say in Communion than they are in words.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m going to miss having Enely around. I got the strong impression from this afternoon that Elton and Jonelle will as well.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton stared at the chink of evening sky showing through the living room curtains. \u201CVery much so,\u201D he answered. \u201CBut as we were lucky enough to get two confirmed Awakeners in the first intake of possible volunteers\u2026\u201D His voice trailed away. \u201CIt was the right thing to do. Not easy \u2013 none of this has ever been easy \u2013 but right.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre we getting many more to visit any time soon?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CQuite a few more, I think. I\u2019d hoped to see a few more from further afield but for our second group?\u201D Jonton lifted his hands. \u201CAt least we got a second group.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThombal tucked his hands behind his head. \u201CI suppose it\u2019s still a big decision to travel in from overseas at the moment. Maybe they\u2019ll start coming once the airlines start getting back to normal.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny set down her mug. \u201COr once Enely\u2019s had time to help Awaken a Kerm or two that\u2019re closer to home. Someone that they can visit, find out that some of your story was true and maybe get curious about finding out about the rest.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton smiled to himself at Meleny\u2019s choice of words. \u201CThat should help too,\u201D he agreed. \u201CCan I get you a top-up, Tom?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlease,\u201D Thombal paused, mug of \u003Ci\u003Edjeng\u003C/i\u003E halfway to his lips, head cocked to one side at the sudden squeak from behind the door. He looked over at Jonton who raised a finger to his lips and shook his head. \u201CTime for one more before bed.\u201D He put his mug on the table and watched Jonton refill it from the pot. \u201CThat\u2019s plenty, thanks.\u201D The loud silence from behind the door was broken by the creak of floorboards, followed by a tense pause and another, fainter creak. Thombal looked up, unsurprised by the sadness behind his friend\u2019s eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJoenie?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CShe\u2019ll be going to see Gerselle again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny lowered her gaze. \u201COf course. How long has she been\u2026\u201D?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSince before our first trip to the Berelgan, probably quite a bit before. I haven\u2019t asked.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny looked up at him with a frown. \u201CDon\u2019t you think you should?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot yet. Maybe if it starts happening every night. As long as she still feels she can talk to me about Gerselle when she needs to though, I\u2019m turning a deaf ear to any late-night squeaky floorboards.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie froze, berating herself for her mis-step. The murmur of voices from behind the door carried on; she heard her father offering somebody a top-up of something. She lifted her foot, wincing at the second creak, before tiptoeing down the passage to the sleep room. Easing the door open, she darted inside, closing it behind her with a snick. She drew the curtains, letting munlight spill into the room, before turning to the figure on the bed. Shadowed Kerm vines twined up the bedframe and a fan of silver-tinted hair spread across the pillows. Joenie picked up a hairbrush from the bedside table and sat down on the corner of the bed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScooping up one of her mother\u2019s tresses, she began to brush it out, her murmured voice rising and falling with the swish of bristle through hair. \u201CWe\u2019re home, Mum. We stayed at the Grove hotel again on the way back and the waitress remembered us from last time. Dad was worried that something bad might happen to Meleny or Thombal so he sent them and Adbas away to Mr Patbro\u2019s Grove. They\u2019re back now though.\u201D Joenie ran her fingers through the tress of hair, laying it to one side before picking up the next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe only stayed for one night at the Berelgan and Professor Erlin was busy, so I didn\u2019t get to talk to Obrinn for very long. He sent a telegraph message to Jonelle for me.\u201D Joenie smiled, munlight gleaming from her teeth. \u201CHe and Jonelle are getting good at using the Telegraph. They\u2019ve started making up their own words for some things - I guess it\u2019s quicker that way. I think you\u2019d like Obrinn, Mum. He\u2019s quite quiet compared to Jonelle, a bit like me and Adbas I guess.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA silvery droplet trickled down Joenie\u2019s cheek. \u201CDad was great on the television, telling everyone about you and Elton and Jonelle and Obrinn. He told me on the train that he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to talk about you but he did. I think it worked - people are coming to visit again, the way they did when Dad was still part of Elton. They get to meet Elton and then we bring them in to see you as well. That\u2019s why I\u2019m brushing your hair for you again.\u201D The brush rose and fell. \u201CDad said that they needed to know all about what can go wrong if they try to wake up their own Kerm, so they need to see you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie sniffled. \u201CYou scared most of them I think but two of them weren\u2019t afraid. There was one old guy \u2013 he was all smiley on the outside. He told uncle Enely that he wanted to be able to talk to his Kerm the way we talk to Elton. His eyes weren\u2019t very smiley though \u2013 I think he was sad on the inside. I hope uncle Enely can help him quickly then he can come back soon.\u201D Joenie blew her nose. \u201CThe other guy was much younger and sort of cute. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d better mention that to Adbas though \u2013 and definitely not to Dad. I wish I could talk to you about him, talk properly I mean\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe silvery droplet became a rivulet, dripping onto the bedcovers. \u201CIt\u2019s not \u003Ci\u003Efair\u003C/i\u003E, Mum. You can\u2019t get to meet him, or Doctor Mallas or Professor Erlin. You can\u2019t talk to Jonelle, or Obrinn or any of the other Kerm that uncle Enely has gone to help wake up. The brush clattered to the floor, the rivulet becoming a flood as Joenie buried her face in her mother\u2019s unmoving arms. \u201CI miss you, Mum. I wish you could\u2026you would\u2026\u201D A choked sob forced its way out of her throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026wish you would wake up too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3713367\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 106\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3733989\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 108\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-01T15:39:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2020 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-06T09:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick aside - if you want a musical accompaniment to the Leviathan launch, may I recommend \u003Ci\u003EThunderstruck\u003C/i\u003E by AC/DC - especially any\u00A0live version!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of my all time favourite rock intros.
