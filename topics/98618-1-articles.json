I get crashes, which I assume are probably related to running out of memory. But, I have looked through my output_log files, and I see tons and tons of NullRefs throughout. I don\u0027t know enough about these things to interpret what might be going wrong, so I was hoping that someone could take a sneak peak at one of my log files, and maybe there are some things I can fix to cut down on the crashes, assuming at least some of them aren\u0027t memory-related.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod List:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eblizzy Toolbar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EATM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntennaRange\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAviationLights\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVE (Clouds, no City Lights)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECactEye\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChatterer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadlyReentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDMagic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPorkjet\u0027s Hab Pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHome Grown Rockets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERasterProp Monitor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Attachment System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Construction Time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKER\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKIDS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfernal Robotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENavyFish Docking Tool\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS Build Aid\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal Chute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCANSat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage Recovery\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC LS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweakable Everything\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUniversal Storage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy GameData folder is 1.92 GB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s too much of a bother, that\u0027s totally OK.

This crash is completely unrelated to KSP running out of memory... a 1.92GB game data folder is impressive, but depending on what you have installed it can still run fine. The issue here is that one of your mods is referencing either something in unity that no longer exists or is referencing something in KSP that no longer exists. First thing I would do is make sure all your mods are up to date. Out-dated mods = remove them. After you\u0027ve done that, give it another try. If that does not fix it, try removing some of the more inactive or older mods even though they claim to be up to date. After you\u0027ve done that, try it again. If all else fails, try running KSP with only your most essential mods that you need to play with. If THAT still doesn\u0027t fix it... well... I\u0027ll think about that one later.
