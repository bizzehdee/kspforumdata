It is designed to be launched with a rover coupled to the docking port below it - that way when you get to your destination, you have the ability to send men on reconnaissance operations...Kethane mining, refueling, whatever the case may be. The docking port was spaced so that a DEMV Ant MK-5 can fit - but now that we can design rovers, I\u0027m sure you could design your own rover that will fit the bill. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7Pvp1iE.png\u0022 alt=\u00227Pvp1iE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/m358c5fb269nyh4/CygnusBase.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/m358c5fb269nyh4/CygnusBase.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
