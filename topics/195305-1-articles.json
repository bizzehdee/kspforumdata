Since you are not using your wings during liftoff, and you are not using them to actually land, the only major thing they are used for on reentry is to create variable drag -- so that you can slow down to parachute speeds at the correct moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-04T02:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, but what if I want to extend by crossrange/downrange?

You need to apply force without drag to maneuver crossrange. And that means lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownrange, no. You need very little lift to change your impact point by a long distance. Keep your speed and altitude as long as you can, then go to a very bad stall to scrub all your speed with a lot of drag when you are almost over your target. This takes drag more than lift, and any craft that has some control authority in the atmosphere can go into a stall or spin to scrub speed quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
