AFAIK KSP doesn\u0027t care about your symmetry, it just cares about the center of mass. You can make an assymetrical craft and it will fly just like a symmetrical one, provided that the CoM and drag coefficients on both sides are equivalent. (Yes, OP uses FAR which would make a problem. But his payload is in a fairing, so no possible problems there)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leopardenthusiast","CreatedById":26084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T13:11:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOP, since you\u0027re using FAR, you might want to put some nose cones on the boosters.

I find tail fins on each stage helps. The earlier stages have bigger fins to keep lift on the arse. Also lots Well placed struts helps. You wanna make triangles where ever possible with them. Any looseNess at the bottom will cause enines to swing out. Causing as symmetric thrust. If this happens mid flight. Throttle back. I will upload pictures of my large lifter soon\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
