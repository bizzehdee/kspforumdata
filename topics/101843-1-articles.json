In what manner? Screenshots would help). The only thing I can tell you from looking at the screenshot is check your fuel lines. If one or more of the side tanks drain asymmetrically it will become a problem."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T00:16:22Z","Content":"It could be the wings..."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T00:39:57Z","Content":"If you put wings anywhere on your rocket, put em at the bottom.\n\nEven then, they\u0027re unnecessary.

The two on the one side have less moment arm from the chosen datem. In fact if that was the case then ANY 3 way symmetry would be unbalanced.\n\nIf moving the fuel lines made a difference then what was happening is you were draining fuel from tanks in a non-symmetrical way. Probably one of the lines where wrong. I have heard (but never tested) that it is possible to have non-symmetrical fuel drain even from a symmetrical rocket under certain circumstances but I don\u0027t know what they were. If you eliminated a wrong fuel line then I would check out that possibility. I wonder if anyone here knows the details?"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T13:02:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I very much doubt that is the issue.

AFAIK KSP doesn\u0027t care about your symmetry, it just cares about the center of mass. You can make an assymetrical craft and it will fly just like a symmetrical one, provided that the CoM and drag coefficients on both sides are equivalent. (Yes, OP uses FAR which would make a problem. But his payload is in a fairing, so no possible problems there)"},{"CreatedByName":"leopardenthusiast","CreatedById":26084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T13:11:27Z","Content":"OP, since you\u0027re using FAR, you might want to put some nose cones on the boosters. It\u0027ll make the rocket more aerodynamic."},{"CreatedByName":"Blondai","CreatedById":80004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T13:12:32Z","Content":"I jad this problem with my larger rockets in a similar style to that. I find tail fins on each stage helps. The earlier stages have bigger fins to keep lift on the arse. Also lots Well placed struts helps. You wanna make triangles where ever possible with them. Any looseNess at the bottom will cause enines to swing out. Causing as symmetric thrust. If this happens mid flight. Throttle back. I will upload pictures of my large lifter soon"}]}
