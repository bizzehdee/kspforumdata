That and I sometimes randomly get scene crashes when flying over new terrain (I had one quicksave that was bugged on my flight to the desert temple where the game would crash every time I flew close to the temple, finally fixed it by turning all the detail settings down to minimum and landing to get the game to update the persistence file, the crash report kept complaining about not having enough memory to create a new vertex, squad really needs to fix their memory leaks).
