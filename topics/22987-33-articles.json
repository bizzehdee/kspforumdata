You could make RD-190, RD-180, RD-170 and RD-0124 to go with it. That would be essentially the old Angara pack, and people would love to have that back. You can do single-axis gimbals with a plugin, and they\u0027ll even work to roll the rocket if they can. Oh, and that would make Rus-M possible. Also, if you made the RD-120, you could also have the Zenit. I believe a 2.5m URM has a lot of potential to expand your pack. There are situations where URM-125 just doesn\u0027t cut it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, I can see URM-375 having two notable uses. Proton and UR-700.

If you wanted to go even further, you could make 5m parts and create an Energia/Vulkan set of parts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T17:42:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey CBBP, just wanted to report that in the latest update, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003EKosmos SSPP R4.71\u003C/span\u003E, the APAS-69 docking port, the Salyut and TKS RCS Blocks and the LED Flood Light are not included.
