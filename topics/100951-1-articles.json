Recently the game has started crashing whenever I try to launch a plane from the run way. I\u0027ll be able to fly for a bit but it consistently crashes within about 3 minutes. It\u0027s not a memory error as I\u0027m running 64 bit with 16GB of ram in my PC and KSP is only using about 7 while the game is running. \n\nScreenshot of my GameData Folder: \n\n[http://i.imgur.com/6DhKdqU.png](http://i.imgur.com/6DhKdqU.png)\n\nLink to KSP.Log \n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/62qmgr0wtfm1elv/KSP.log?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/62qmgr0wtfm1elv/KSP.log?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Goliathan","CreatedById":110871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T21:09:42Z","Content":"Update: The problem is with Ferram Aerospace although I\u0027m not sure what is causing it. I thought it might be trajectories mod but uninstalling/reinstalling didn\u0027t make a difference. A fresh install of FAR will allow the game to work for 2-3 flights then start crashing again. Does anyone know if Ferram publishes dev builds? I\u0027m running 14.6 (the latest version)."},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T02:55:18Z","Content":"Are you using real time reflections in texture replacer and what version is it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Goliathan","CreatedById":110871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T03:05:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are you using real time reflections in texture replacer and what version is it?\n\nYes. 2.2.5 , There is a look vector error that seems to be causing the divide by zero error with FAR, could TR really cause that?"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T03:41:54Z","Content":"Yes I had the same issue ruin several major careers as I hacked my mod folder apart trying to find the cause. It may not be for you but try turning off real reflections and launching the planes or rockets that were crashing and see if that fixes it. I hope this helps!"}]}
