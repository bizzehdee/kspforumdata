The basic reason: air pressure doesn\u0027t really matter, but gravity matters a lot, because gravity defines how fast you need to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe full reasoning starts here: Let\u0027s say you build a spacecraft with one turbojet that reaches orbital velocity plus a tiny bit at 30 km on Kerbin while going full throttle, but would flame out a meter higher. So you\u0027re going 2368 m/s orbit speed, which is 2193 m/s surface speed assuming you\u0027re flying East (which you should be!). Once you get to that speed, you\u0027ll climb a tiny bit since you\u0027re going faster than orbital velocity; throttle back when you climb, to avoid flaming out. Throttling back means you lost thrust, but you also lost drag; if you work out the equations, the amount you need to throttle back is (almost) precisely equal to the amount that drag falls, so you can maintain orbital velocity plus a tiny bit, and keep rising all the way to the top of the atmosphere. Then a tiny burst from a rocket (or even an ion engine) will push you into a stable 70km circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow take that same spacecraft to Laythe. You are facing the same atmospheric pressure at 23 km on Laythe as at 30km on Kerbin: you\u0027ll be able to go Kerbin\u0027s orbital velocity there, and you\u0027ll flame out 80 cm higher (rather than 1m higher). But you don\u0027t need to go that fast, you only need to reach 1878 m/s surface speed to reach Laythe\u0027s orbital velocity, 86% as fast. Since drag is quadratic, that seems to mean you can throttle back by a quarter (26% to be precise). But now you have more air than you need. So remove a quarter of the intakes, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, it gets better. There are two other effects to keep track of: most important, thrust depends on your speed, quite significantly. Let\u0027s say our spacecraft has a single turbojet. Full throttle at 2193 m/s, it delivers about 58 kN, which gets us to Kerbin orbital speed at 30 km. We can reduce that thrust by 26% to achieve Laythe orbital speed at 23 km, so we need 49 kN. Full throttle at 1878 m/s, the turbojet delivers 126 kN, so we can reduce throttle to 39%, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eremove 60% of the airflow\u003C/strong\u003E.
