But there was always one thing about this that bothered me. Theres nothing stopping me from just quick saving on the launch pad to circumvent that. So why not simply make it so you cannot quick save on the launch pad when the disable revert option is chosen? Save for the runway I suppose. Could this not be modded in as well? I know you can disable quick save all together, but I\u0027m not that much of a gluten for punishment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-11T07:02:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2015 07:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu2","CreatedById":154334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T07:08:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the real problem? If you do not want to quicksave at pad you just do not quicksave. Game does not do it automatically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion it would be waste of resources to define strict rules and try to program game so that all \u0022cheating\u0022 is impossible. Everybody should have so much self discipline that can obey they own set of rules. There are so much real bugs and deficiencies in this game and they are much more annoying than possibility to \u0022cheat\u0022 against myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MircoMars","CreatedById":61811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T07:48:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nisn\u0027t there a general \u0022allow/disallow quicksave/load\u0022 feature?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand yeah, the rest is self-control. just do not press that F5 button on the LP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T08:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts.. just a simple mechanic to make the no-revert flight option more meaningful.

With the press of a button you can save your craft on the pad before launch and just quickload and revert to vab.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisabling quick save completely is too much. Missions get far too complicated and time consuming. So what this does is ensures that you atleast must\u00A0deal with the consequences of a design flaw at the initial launch.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretending the unrestricted quicksaving doesn\u0027t exist isn\u0027t a solution. It\u0027s career mode for a reason. If I want to pretend I play sandbox.
