I\u0027ve been boating for practically all my life, here are some tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a little something called a plug on the bottom of the transom (Back part). Be sure to screw it in when you put in and unscrew it when you pull out. Trust me on this one, we almost sunk our boat by not putting it in, and the transom eventually rotted off the back and we had to get a new one put on because the plug wasn\u0027t pulled and the water let out every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://fishandboat.com/boatcrs/pfd/fit.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elife jacket that fits\u003C/a\u003E for everybody who\u0027ll be on board, a throwable PFD, some flares (reqd. on Great Lakes, but good to have everywhere. Lets people locate you easy and know you need help and you need it now.), a loud whistle (required in most, if not all places; any one will do, I recommend the Acme Whistle Model 636 or the Fox 40) and (THIS IS IMPORTANT) a good, long paddle, about 3-5 foot long at least. The paddle has saved me countless times, and you can push off the bank/dock with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep some tools (stndrd. and Phillips head Screwdrivers, pair of dikes/Diagonal Cutters, pair of vise grips, pair of pliers is what I\u0027d recommend at the least) in a box on board, they\u0027ll come in handy. Keep a good, sharp knife on board, too, and keep it away from kids and stupid people. If you carry a pocketknife (like I do) or leatherman you can omit the knife. Learn how to fix your motor, no matter how good you think it is WILL fail on you when you\u0027re on the water. The paddle also comes in handy if the motor decides to flip you the bird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpect to get wet \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eevery time you go out\u003C/span\u003E. Learn how to swim if you don\u0027t know how. An easy way to learn how to swim is to get somebody to toss you in the water, that\u0027s how I learned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it doesn\u0027t have a ladder on the back, be prepared for some pain when getting back in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETie the rope on the boat before you try to launch (It happens, and it sucks when it happens). Launch with \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eat least 2 people\u003C/span\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever you do, be sure to follow the rules, regs, signs, and buoys in whatever water you\u0027re in. The coast guard or whoever patrols the water will, from quite a long distance away even, write down your boat\u0027s registration number with a pen and a pair of binoculars and send you a fine in the mail. They might even pull to the side of your boat to talk with you and even ask to board your boat, it just depends. Don\u0027t drink while boating, that\u0027s how people crash and get hurt. And please keep your boat registered (All you gotta do is pay the fee and put a sticker you get in the mail on it like you put a sticker on your license plate), it\u0027ll save you a lot of money and trouble down the road.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re young, check your state\u0027s laws on age and operating boats. You might need to get a Boating Safety Certification, which I had to take an 8 hour class and pass a 35-question test to get. It cost me very little, I think it might\u0027ve been free now that I think about it. Don\u0027t worry, the test is dead simple \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eif you pay attention\u003C/span\u003E. Check your state\u0027s Boating Comission/Authority/Department website to find out about the laws and Boating courses. Boats might be covered under your state\u0027s DMV if it doesn\u0027t have an official, separate organization for boats. For the Boating courses you can also look up your nearest Coast Guard Auxiliary, they offer classes. Either way, I recommend the classes for everybody, I learned a bunch of stuff I never learned in many, many years of boating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get cavalier and do dangerous or stupid stuff to impress people or have fun. That\u0027s how you get hurt and a fine and/or a hospital bill in the mail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoats are always referred to as \u0022she\u0022 and \u0022her\u0022. That\u0027s because you should treat them like you would a fine, young lady. It\u0027s also considered bad luck not to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re planning on going to the Great Lakes, check the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.crh.noaa.gov/greatlakes/?c=map\u0026amp;l=gl\u0026amp;p=a\u0026amp;m=wh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENOAA wave height forecast\u003C/a\u003E for the lake you\u0027re going to (Click on the lake to to be taken to it\u0027s forecast, use the bottom grid of dates \u0026amp; times to check forecast for each of the things on the left).

Most of the time it\u0027ll be a dry fire extinguisher, meaning that there\u0027s a bunch of powder in the extinguisher that gets shot out when you use it, and motor vibrations and impacts with waves can cause that powder to compact and make the extinguisher useless. Shake it up for a minute or few every once in a while, or better yet, every time you go out. And aim the extinguisher at the base of the fire, not at the flames.
