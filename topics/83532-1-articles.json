The Round 8 fuel tank and LV-1 needs to be used on the payload stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You must unlock all parts needed for the mission. No using contract for testing the parts needed before you unlock them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. No cheats such as hacking science points so you can unlock the parts needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. You must have the Mun Exploration contract. While it should appear in plenty of time for the mission, if you land Jeb on Mun to get science points, it may not show up in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConduct the Munar exploration contract with the Minotaur 5. The payload consisting of the Round 8 fuel tank, LV-1, probe core, batteries, solar panel, science instrument, antenna, is easily landed on Mun, landing gear is not needed.

If you have the Mun Contract and send Jeb to do science, land, get science and a sample and return, you will be unable to complete the challenge since the contract will have been completed. If Jeb, or a probe, goes to Mun before the contract shows up, you may never get it. Place Mun off limits until you can send the Minotaur 5 there. Jeb can go to Minmus for the science points instead. A Too Hot thermometer, which you can unlock quite early, is all the scientific instrument that will be needed for the mission. To fulfill the contract, transmit the data back to Kerban.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit Mun, get a temperature reading, transmit back the data, land on Mun, transmit the data and get a screenshot showing the contract completed. Then, to log the total time of your space program once the mission is complete, get into the tracking station where the date and time of your space program, not the mission date and time, will be displayed along with the status of the Minotaur rocket on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-05T02:19:51Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2014 02:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vat21s","CreatedById":34187,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T07:16:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy attempt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/oZlBM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/oZlBM\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-06T00:48:18Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2014 12:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by vat21s\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding album\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T12:06:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlenty of room remains for weight reduction, possibly for a faster completion of the mission unlocking needed tech wise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vat21s","CreatedById":34187,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T08:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe time was because I took some science from the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T11:16:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe big challenge is getting the science points to unlock the tech as quickly as possible. That makes exploration a high priority followed with contracts that yield science points. With Mun off limits, the next closest high yield biomes are on Minmus some 7 to 14 days away. Several flights need to be launched at one time to cut the total time to wring out all the science available there in the shortest time. Currently testing out how quick I can get this done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can easily see this challenge taking several real days of playing or quite a few hours to reach the goal of unlocking the parts required for the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the scrounging for all the science points possible from Kerbal, I have noticed a host of new contracts coming up that, combined with goo canisters and the material bay, yielded a bunch of money and science points on one orbital flight alone.
