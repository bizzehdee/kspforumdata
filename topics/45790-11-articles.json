KineTechAnimation is usually downloaded for another mod, so no worries about that. I had KJR before Squad strengthened everything, never used it since. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a player: Firespitter, RPM, and Kine are all good; KJR I probably wouldn\u0027t even notice if I downloaded the release mod.
