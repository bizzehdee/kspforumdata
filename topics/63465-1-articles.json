If career, do alot of missions to mun and minmus, like orbiting and landing. explore different biomes on them, this will give you hell-lotta science. after this, send probes to different planets and send the science back to kerbal, so you dont have the need to bring them back, but you also won\u0027t lose any kerbals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo all this Stuff until you have atomic engines, you will need them to do interplanetary mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just had a manned flyby on duna last week and i went all this way through career, but so i learned alot of the techniques in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last but not least: Look for Scott Manley on Youtube.
