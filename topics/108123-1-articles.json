For example, may start game with a basic eva suit that has no thrusters, no stabilization and advance to an end game suit with all suit features including advance features like ability to interface with space center orbital trajectory calculators to assist with rendezvous with distant vessels."},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T00:52:27Z","Content":"That would be great, and also in general I think that linking the ability to do EVAs and take surface samples would make a lot more sense if it was tied to acquiring parts rather than upgrading buildings. Ditto the ability to place maneuver nodes. That should be some kind of navigational computer vessel part."}]}
