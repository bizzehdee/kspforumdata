Slow going climbing the hills, as I had to stop to refuel every few kilometers, but not at all difficult.

Careful readers will note that it actually got dark on Eve between the time I started the surface dock and when I finally finished it. I chose not to show all the work, but at one point I did have to reset the ports in the .sfs because the M7\u0027s showed \u0022docked\u0022 not \u0022ready\u0022. Anyway--dock accomplished, and refueling has begun!\n\nAnd now **a request:** I could use a couple of custom IVA suit textures to do the last chapter of this book, when the time comes. Interested party(ies) please contact my by PM. I know what I\u0027m looking for in the suit designs and can provide prototype artwork for you to turn into Texture Replacer-ready suit files for me.
