I figured I would spend a few hours with it here or there, and I did. And then a few days, and then weeks. The words started slowly, just a few notes at first, detailing altitude thresholds and biomes and such. But soon there were more words, a crude scaffolding to provide context for the hundreds of screenshots suddenly piling up on my hard drive. This in turn became a few paragraphs here and there, detailing the machines rolling out of my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and the various problems they were being asked to solve.

The harsh stink of overburdened electronics bled into the thin mountain air as the trundle\u0027s electric motor slowly labored itself to death. Someone was going to \u003Cem\u003Epay\u003C/em\u003E for this. There was a flash of sunlight on metal up ahead, the sharp chuff of a steam engine.

The steam trundle shot into the opening at a recklessly high speed and the provost followed, the siren painfully loud in the confined space. Like much of the new construction in the mining town, the tunnel had been built with sections of surplus pipe, and the riveting flashed past in regular patterns as the trundle rattled down the tube. The tunnel ended in a sudden burst of daylight, the trundles blasting out of the tube and through a small market. The stalls of the vendors sped past on either side, wooden placards, fabric awnings, and even a few bits fashioned from metal, the thin lengths of pipe gleaming in the morning sun. The provost\u0027s trundle tipped up onto two wheels as it slid past the last stall, the wooden planks of the road giving way to bare rock, the electric motor making an unhealthy noise as they started up an incline. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThe steam trundle was starting to pull away, its antiquated but powerful engine giving it an advantage on the steadily increasing slope.

Jeb kept back from the press, scanned the framed news-sheet clippings on the far wall with feigned interest. He tried to focus his mind on the details of the contract, the points he needed to push for if the effort was to be worth his while. And he desperately needed it to be. Jeb had six trundles to his name now, but only two of them had motors. The other four were old, manually powered models that were barely adequate for hauling even modest loads. The labor pool in the small mountain community seemed to trickle lower every day, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to hire the mechanics necessary to keep the trundles working, never mind finding kerbals actually willing to drive the pedal-crank machines. Jeb\u0027s waste disposal business was in trouble, and he needed this job if he was going to keep the lights on. It was either that, or cash out and go to work in the mines, and that was something he swore he\u0027d never do.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EOne of the faded news-sheets mounted on the wall of the depot caught his eye, and Jeb stared at it for a long moment, his quick, half-hearted smile reflected in the glass that protected the yellowing paper. His much younger self stared back at him, the grainy black and white photograph taking him back to a much wilder time in his life. Jeb winced at the sight of the ragged parachute, his mother\u0027s best tablecloth. And sheets. And curtains.

The provosts made an effort to clear those desperate souls away from the train, but there were always some who escaped notice. And there were always a few bodies at the other end of the line, the remains of those who hadn\u0027t chosen their hiding places in the shifting cargo with enough care. Jeb clambered onto the train just before it started rolling, the provosts waving him past after a few words from his guide. Somehow he was going to have to find his way back home after this meeting was over-- if it went well, perhaps he could negotiate the cost of a return ticket into the contract. If not, well, it wouldn\u0027t be the first time he\u0027d had to sneak onto a train in order to get somewhere. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThe interior of the car had been converted into a small office space, a plain banker\u0027s desk and a pair of chairs tucked inside a thicket of file cabinets and stacked paper.

Jeb kept to his feet, shifted his weight to counter the increasing sway in the floor. The sunlight coming in from the narrow windows set high on the walls slid around the compartment as the train picked up speed and the track curved underneath it. Jeb took note of the carefully ordered clutter, couldn\u0027t help but compare it to the disorganized morass of paperwork that littered his own office. \u003Cem\u003EMaybe there\u0027s a lesson here. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThe train\u0027s whistle blew again, softer now, the attenuated warble having to travel almost the full length of the train in order to reach the little car.

Many of the major rail depots had telegraph stations now, and the pipeline complex had two. There was even talk of building one specifically for the Rockomax ore cracking facility that had produced the bulk of the raw material his train was currently carrying. Many of his peers had left their trains in the hands of subordinates and moved into large office suites with ready access to the telegraph lines, but he had resisted that so far. There was just too much happening right now for him to risk getting fat and happy in some office back where he couldn\u0027t see his operation with his own two eyes. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThe door on the other end of the compartment opened and then closed.

The whole routine was a well practiced act intended to make the poor soul on the other side of the interview as uncomfortable as possible-- even the chair itself, though ornate enough to match the rest of the decor, had been made to be just a little too small, a little too hard on the back. He\u0027d tried it himself a number of times, had yet to meet anyone who could sit in it for any length of time without squirming. Yet when he finally looked up, the junkman seemed completely at ease as he waited for the interview to start-- it was time to turn up the heat. The phonograph cut off abruptly at the press of a discretely placed switch, and William picked up a stack of clipped paperwork and tossed it across the desk in the junker\u0027s direction. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u0022Standard contract terms, three month duration.

The contract came up, of course, as had general pleasantries and, eventually, the story behind the contract. William\u0027s rail business owned a large stretch of land adjacent to the construction project that had been driving so many of the mining start ups in the area. Originally, the land had been procured with an eye towards developing it as a warehouse district, but the initial surveys had been overly optimistic and the area was so swampy that it just wouldn\u0027t support buildings of any size. Meanwhile, the pipeline had gone through a major \u0022false start\u0022 almost a full year into development, and the rail company had recouped some of their investment by allowing the builders to use the land as a dumping ground for the resulting construction waste. But as the project recovered and the workforce swelled, the land had become more valuable and the local government had decided to rezone it for development. The rail company had received notice that they had one year to clean up the land, or face stiff fines. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EJeb set his glass down. \u0022Well, I think I can help with that. Rockomax has a good, long stretch of mining tunnel that is completely played out. They\u0027ve been trying to sell it off as underground housing, but everyone knows the tunnel is unstable and no one is willing to risk it. The asking price is desperately low, and I can\u0027t think of a better place to park that construction waste. I can hire some people to transfer to the work site directly, and we can move the material by train up into the mountains.

Angry at himself for having wasted so much time, William gave this \u0022Jeb\u0022 fellow a look declaring in no uncertain terms that the meeting was over. But the junker didn\u0027t flinch, made no move to stand, actually seemed to settle deeper into that horrible chair. He picked up his glass, seemed to consider the liquid inside it for a moment.

Barges and skiffs of all shapes and sizes jostled for space on the open water, some headed to shore for the evening, others lying at anchor in the gentle currents. The lazy bulk of an airship drifted overhead, the soft drone of its engines barely audible to those down on the water. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThe breeze was warm, the air heavy with the smell of saltwater and coastline. Bob cupped the kofi mug, leaned against the railing fixed to the side of the barge, gazed westward towards the pipeline complex. The lights in the adjacent hamlet were starting to come on, the soft glow contrasting with the darkening bulk of the giant extruder. To the north, farther along the coast, the lights of Capitol City shone brighter and appeared more inviting than those nestled close to the pipeline. But although Capitol City had larger warehouses and a better harbor, most of the barge traffic was headed towards the complex. Bob had learned, as the locals had known for years, that Capitol City traded in promises, not answers. These days, to those living as far up and down the coast as the rail lines reached, and indeed over the mountains to the western coast, the pipeline was the only answer they had.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EAnd that answer was starting to ask difficult questions of its own. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E50 years ago, Kerbin had seen the outbreak of the Great War, a conflict that had eventually engulfed most of the planet. The war burned for years before ending in a stalemate of mutual exhaustion, the belligerents no longer capable of the industrial output needed to stay in the fight. But there were exceptions, those few regions that had managed to stay clear of the war. And Grand Peninsula had been a very special exception. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EComprised of more than a dozen semi-independent city states, Grand Peninsula not only avoided becoming involved in the war, they had discovered themselves uniquely positioned to profit from it. When the war finally ground to a halt, the Peninsula\u0027s various potentates quietly arranged to sell weapons and material to all sides of the conflict. When war broke out again after only a few years respite, the belligerents lashed out mercilessly, each believing they were the only ones who had been able to rearm through their clandestine trade agreements. The city states grew quite wealthy during the resulting conflagration, but the steady stream of armaments flowing from their factories allowed the conflict to last much longer and be fought much harder than it otherwise would have been. When Grand Peninsula finally decided that things had run their course and the city states cut off their war trade, the balance of Kerbin\u0027s industry and civilization had been cast down into ruin. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EIn the decades that followed, much of the recovery had been driven by the whims of Grand Peninsula, and that recovery had been slow.

The coursework had been challenging and thorough, but most of the emphasis had been on irrigation and transport systems for the inland potato plantations, or on mining techniques and refining processes. And there was always plenty of need for the steam engineers who worked for the rail companies. Bob had focused instead oceanography, had completed his Kermanship with an analysis of deep sea diving techniques. There certainly hadn\u0027t been much call for that kind of work, but Bob had distinguished himself by being one of the few kerbals willing to operate the primitive diving bells in use at the time. He\u0027d made his way well enough as a contractor, moving from job to job and trusting those who stayed on the surface to do their best to keep him alive on the cold dark of the ocean floor. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EAnd then the pipeline had happened. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThe swamp south of the capital went on for miles, and had long been viewed as a deep, impenetrable mire with no economic value.

Running roughshod over the local authorities, the Peninsulites had moved in and set up shop, clearing the vegetation and draining enough of the swamp to establish a work site. The government protested at first, but as more locals were hired to work on the pipeline and the tax revenue started coming in, the protests grew quieter. When it became obvious that the project was sustaining and even expanding local mining interests, those protests turned into tacit support. For two long years, the pipeline project had fueled an economic resurgence that had resonated from one end of the continent to the other. The hamlet surrounding the work site was growing into a proper boom town, with businesses springing up to support the workforce, and then suppliers to support the businesses. There was a school now, and a small hospital. And of course the port and rail depot. And even some rudimentary laboratories, staffed by underfunded and under appreciated scientists who had been drawn by the influx of money.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EAnd now, the pipeline had cracks. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EBob took another draught from the mug, the gently rolling ocean having a calming effect. It was not his way to worry about things beyond his control, and this certainly qualified as one of those things. A year ago, the expensive decision had been made to increase the interior width of the submerged pipe so that laborers could work inside sealed off portions. Bob had argued against that, but he was only a contractor and the change had gone ahead. But the water was getting deeper, the sea bed less forgiving, and the strain on the pipe was growing with each additional meter. Soon, well. . .sooner or later they would figure something out.

He had to admire the workmanship, the delicate balance of weight and power that allowed the big machine to take to the skies. The airship was almost certainly owned and operated by the government, probably headed for the secondary work site that had recently sprung up on the island chain southeast from the complex. That was another change they were going to have to get used to-- after two years of alternating between railing against the pipeline and pretending to ignore it, Capitol City was finally starting to get involved. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThe sudden clank and rattle of the barge\u0027s anchor signaled an end to their trip, the barge\u0027s engines stilling as the sun dropped out of sight behind the mountains.

And despite their size, the delicate craft just couldn\u0027t carry very much. Kinsey sighed -- there had been a time, long ago, when great loads had been hefted skyward by graceful, winged machines of metal and wood. She\u0027d seen the pictures, carefully tucked away in old history books. But that technology had been warped and twisted by war, a terrible march of \u0022progress\u0022 that had eventually culminated in the infamous V-2.462 missile. The weapon had been produced en masse, its deadly accuracy made possible at the expense of the \u0022volunteer\u0022 sealed inside it. The horrors of that weapon had burned deep into the psyche of civilized kerbals everywhere-- though balloons and light gliders were still commonly used, airships were tightly restricted.

But the steady stream of skiffs, barges and work platforms had begun to crowd out the local fishermen, and there had been three major collisions over the last six months. What started as a small, government funded study had quickly ballooned into a major project. And from there, things had gotten truly ridiculous. Capitol City had laid claim to an island just off the coast, and had decided to solve the problem by building the largest lighthouse the world had ever seen. Or at least, the largest one they knew about. A group of contractors had been brought together to plan and draw up blueprints for the structure, and the new company had in turn hired Kinsey to over see the actual construction. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EThey\u0027d gotten the work area cleared well enough, and had two warehouses now that could hold most of what they would need going forward.

Kinsey didn\u0027t know if that was because the pipeline complex was reluctant to give her company time on the extruder, or if Capitol City had just neglected to pay for the work.

A lot of what I\u0027m doing here in these first chapters is setting the stage for the start of the gameplay progression. For example, one of the early parts mentions that it\u0027s a \u0022KKII Surplus\u0022 component that came out of a war museum. And although it looks like this has been corrected in current versions of the mod, the version I\u0027m using is heavily biased towards rockets-- the airplane parts and engines are pretty far up the tech tree and don\u0027t seem to serve much purpose.
