Normally I (like everyone else assuably) use even numbers so I know I can drop opposing tank/booser setups without having to fear loosing control of my rocket, in a odd number setup you pretty much have to drop them all at the same time. That is not to say that it wouldn\u0027t be useful for attaching arrays or solar panels/attachments to the **** however. In fact that is probably one of the more useful applications for 5 sided symmetry as it gives you the benefit of having multiple panels for electricity while saving some of the weight by not pushing up to that next even number. A lot of times I use 3 panel arrays, but for something potentially more power consuming I think I could see a 5 sided application there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, this was an interesting video, not sure I\u0027ll be using it anytime soon but worth watching to know the option was available =P and \u002B1 for adding 5 sided to default for the off chance you need it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T03:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny item can be used to exploit the five sided bug.
