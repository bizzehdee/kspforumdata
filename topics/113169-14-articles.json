(Once again, the forums get the information from 3rd parties, like always)\n\n[http://www.polygon.com/e3-2015/2015/6/17/8796869/kerbal-space-program-is-coming-to-ps4-thanks-to-sonys-strength-in](http://www.polygon.com/e3-2015/2015/6/17/8796869/kerbal-space-program-is-coming-to-ps4-thanks-to-sonys-strength-in)\n\nMostly cheerleading about Latin America and new markets, but there is this quote:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Console controls, Sabido added, are largely being gleaned from community-based mods already available in the game\u0027s forums. The PS4 version will feature a new, unified UI system that **may carry over into the PC game.**\n\nThis is exactly what I didn\u0027t want to read. This is ALWAYS the pitfall with cross-platform games, especially those that do not naturally lend themselves to console-style controls (and KSP is easily the greatest example of this in history, even more than mouse-based strategy games, which are almost universally subpar on consoles.)\n\nWe already know they had to redo the UI due to Unity 5 changes, as stated in a past dev note. It\u0027s fairly clear now that during this redevelopment of the UI that it will have been changed to work with the Dual Shock contoller. I just can\u0027t imagine that concessions to the UI had to have been made and that we\u0027ll be getting a different UI with the Unity5 release that is \u0022console optimized\u0022 - those words should frighten every PC gamer who has played a console-first game (like Skyim, which was crippled by a console UI, but there have been hundreds of others)\n\nSo the theory that this doesn\u0027t affect the PC version is debunked. One can wish that it won\u0027t have negative consequences (I wish this very very much) but we honestly have no way to know this, and a dev saying this is just being as hopeful as we are.\n\nTo me, there\u0027s a huge concern that future features and implementations will have to be simplified or compromised to work on the Ps4. Multiplayer seems to be a big example of this danger - it seems like the entire thing might have to be designed to to be \u0022closed\u0022 with lots of security overhead so it is PSN-safe rather than being open and fairly lightweight without much central control, which males much more sense for the KSP we knew before yesterday.\n\nI mean, I don\u0027t begrudge Squad trying to hit new markets, but I don\u0027t feel KSP was polished up enough in its current platform for this to happen yet, and I think its just a bunch of \u0022Shiny, happy hopefulness\u0022 to think this won\u0027t affect their core customers, possibly negatively.\n\nWe need way more information about this before I\u0027ll feel good about it."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T21:15:54Z","Content":"Tiberion, HarvesteR has indicated otherwise: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E No, not by any means.

So, conflicting statements aside, I still don\u0027t know what to think, and none of it pleases me.\n\nAnd my point about future decisions being made to work better on Ps4 remain.

They don\u0027t say \u0022UI which that will carry over\u0022 they say \u0022**UI system** that *may* carry over\u0022. (In fact they got that wrong, if you read HarvesteR\u0027s blog: they ARE rewriting the UI to use Unity 5\u0027s new, powerful, easy-to-use UI model.) But that doesn\u0027t mean that any design decisions will also carry across, only underlying code for the UI-engine.\n\nYes, some software houses insist on having a UI which is consistent across all platforms. Sometimes it\u0027s for practical reasons (it makes development easier and means they need fewer graphical assets) and sometimes it\u0027s because of some mule-stubborn insistence that the game looks the same on all platforms.

It them took Squad a month of helping them to get KSP working on Ps4 well enough to start actual development or whatever.\n\nAlso, this has been in development for **7 months** already (one more of Unity work,and 6 months of smooth sailing since.) Once again we\u0027re left to wonder how getting a sony license or working with FT affected the \u0022one beta release and done\u0022 decision, which happened around that time. Note that Polygon\u0027s article says they hope to release it in the third quarter of this year, rather than in 2016. That\u0027s from July 1st to September 30th. Maybe Max was a little sleepy during the Polygon interview.\n\nOne thing is for sure, things are far different from the very open development discussions that existed around here in the early days when I first picked up KSP. Sometimes its hard to reconcile.\n\nEdit; another question from the article; It says the console controls are mostly based on community mods available on the forums. This seems to directly contradict what Harvester said in his blog, that they are building them from scratch. \\*headscratch\\*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T21:56:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 09:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tiberion**"},{"CreatedByName":"Baconation","CreatedById":122914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T21:50:49Z","Content":"This is disappointing.\n\nSony is on a MAJOR kick lately to make as much as they can exclusive to just Playstation.
