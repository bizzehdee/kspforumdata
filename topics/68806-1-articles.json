However, KSP doesn\u0027t yet force that on you. That being said, if you have a lot of wing surface up top you\u0027ll want to avoid large, sudden pitch changes. Especially if you have control surfaces (and not just wings) up top like those canards.

This has the airplane assembly facing down on the bottom of a central fuel stack, so you can still use the rear end of the airplane to attach the rocket to. Then you have radial tanks/engines coming off the central fuel stack so that their nozzles are down by the airplane. In this way, the airplane\u0027s wings act as the tail fins of the rocket, the rocket\u0027s fuel is all balanced as normal, and all is well.

But it all depends on the situation. Each airplane is different; some are more finicky than others. You have to tune the lifter for the specific plane and it might take a few crashes to sort it out. In my example here, I put the tail feathers on the central stack from the get-go because I suspected I might have a problem with the backwards controls on the airplane, so the rocket fins would maybe cancel them out, leaving torque to steer with. I don\u0027t know if this is actually what happened or whether the airplane cooperated with the rocket, but anyway it flew just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
