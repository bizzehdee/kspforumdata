I am currently building a small refueling station in Low Kerbin Orbit.\u00A0 I made a small emergency shuttle/escape craft. It looks like this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GDT6hn3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002281.85\u0022 height=\u0022618\u0022 width=\u0022755\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GDT6hn3.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CiFKkCf.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.30\u0022 height=\u0022490\u0022 width=\u0022762\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/CiFKkCf.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs you can see its very small. It has ~600\u00A0\u0394v - which is more than enough to correct orbits after a disaster and have some say in were it lands. It has parachutes too.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow my problem is I have now tested its re-entry characteristics.. and even though it had 2t out of 2.6 ton Monopropellant to counter balance the mass of the engines it would still flip and fly ass first - even at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of 10\u00B0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only time it managed to not flip was when i told it to follow the prograde all the way down.. and lets just say that Bob seized to exist because man.. he hit the ground fast.. I dont think it went sub 1000 m/s - which means had heat been a thing.. i guess he would never have touched the ground.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe plane becomes controllable again at 400-800 m/s (depending on how well the flip maneuver goes) - but once heat is introduced.. i dont think it will make it to that point if it doesn\u0027t stay belly down.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have a few ideas to \u0022fix\u0022 the problem:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Put decouplers on the engines to drop them after re-entry burn... that would remove the mass (how ever i would like for them to stay...)\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Try some how add more mass to the nose..\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nare there any one who have any other ideas? Or is this craft to small to be possible to get stable... and i should really just get pods for escape crafts?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223PQBzVi.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002257.39\u0022 width=\u00221103\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3PQBzVi.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-21T19:17:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2023 07:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by BechMeister\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-21T23:53:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem seems to be the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E is too far aft, or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E is too far forward. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne suggestion for having less mass it the back: \u00A0Does that small shuttle really need 2 engines? \u00A0I suspect a single engine would be more than adequate. \u00A0In fact, just for doing orbital maneuvers and a de-orbit burn, a single small engine would be more than adequate. \u00A0That would help reduce the mass in the rear of the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother suggestion is either move the wings aft, or add control surfaces at the very back of the plane, which would move the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E aft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, one reason your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E is so far forward is because the MK2 cockpits and fuselages produce some lift themselves. \u00A0That isn\u0027t the end of the world, and can usually be compensated for by reducing engine mass at the back, and adding wing area at the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are not using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E display tools in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, those are very helpful in evaluating how changes you make affect the relationship between those two values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BechMeister","CreatedById":228007,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-22T05:41:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh wow.. I dont know why i didn\u0027t think about reducing it to one engine.\u00A0 I think its because it was an older design from a time were i just wanted as high a lift to weight ratio as possible. But yeah one engine would help a lot. Funny story. I was testing a new iteration were i put 2 batteries inside the nose to place more mass at the front. And i was looking at other ways to get it into space. I put two stack separators on the two engines and when i staged after getting into space on a sub orbital path it broke one engine off.. I have yet to find a way to stage that wont break 1/2 engine off. But I did get to test the flight characteristics... and with the new changes I was able to some what control it on its ascent down with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E on 10%\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also tested the parachutes as it was landing over water. I had placed the schutes in accordance with the center point of mass when the tank is full, brain farting that the center of mass would shift forward wen its empty. So it hit the water with the nose down (which i dont think is ideal)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut yeah.. No Brainer.
