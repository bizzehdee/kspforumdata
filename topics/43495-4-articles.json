I just wish they\u0027d fix established stock features before moving forward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... despite how much it annoys me to play at times, there are times I enjoy it... I think the direction game development has been starting to go toward is hurting itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have edited the quote to show imho salient points hope you dont mind TouhouTorpedo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree we should be kind to devs. I want to consider the OP and come full circle to the topic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a personal hunch that players tend to transfer their emotions from the game environment onto their communications with devs and other players and ultimately all activity on the internet. Some become conditioned to treat all online activity as though it is just a game environment so they dont consider the severity of injurious statements seriously. Whereas they are sometimes received by people who do take them seriously and the mismatch between degrees of seriousness is a problem. What some see as vile and violent attacks, is to others just playful self expression, a verbal reenactment of a scene from Bioshock, Batman Arkham Asylum or GTA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game environment of many games permits acts of make believe violence, its part of how the game entertains, how players find diversion and is how some devs make a living, but the game environment can end up leaking into reality and influencing developer-player relations. This is partly because people cannot help it as play is learning behaviour, but some devs and communities exploit this weakness very deliberately to generate hype and excitement about digital products. People who say that leaking doesnt or shouldnt happen are simply idealists in denial of reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO Harv\u0027s policy of not weaponising or hyping KSP is part of the reason we have a relatively civil community. KSP is quite a cerebral game, even though its also a lot of fun. IMHO The nature of the game shapes the community. But that does have a knock on effect which is where the game is frustrating to play it can cause tempers to get frayed in the online community as well, since people bring the game experience to the BB and feel a desire to express it. Though frustration is caused by obstacles in the way of desires. That people feel enough desire to get frustrated is in a way a good sign for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat does not excuse incivility or DOS attacks but I think it may be true that when gameplay annoys people in all honesty this increases the likelihood of bad tempered behaviour. I think there is no choice here, standards have to be maintained by moderators to ensure that the community stays within the bounds of good humour. But if you set boundaries based on good humour you can only truely maintain them good humouredly! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I am very cautious about reporting problems with the gameplay as I dont want my game experience to reflect too directly in bug reports. Where I experience problems I dont want to be too emotional, critical or bring the devs down, on the other hand they do need to know and it should be possible to have a calm and rational discussion with devs about the game and players hopes for its future. The law of nature though is there is always one (at least) who will abuse a situation of trust (its not an evolutionary stable strategy) so one has to back openness with security.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest I have held off saying that they should fix existing systems because I am aware that development is not linear and for example the VAB and other systems will receive upgrades once other modules are in place. The problem which arises for Squad in developing alpha code in a playable state so they can fund development is how much effort they should spend on making it playable and how much on reaching the finished functionality, to save effort and time until the point where final passes which fix all outstanding bugs are worth doing. I think its would help if we tried to understand this as a community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-22T22:30:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2013 10:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceHole","CreatedById":79449,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T22:28:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022roosterr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022roosterr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe car salesman told us the car could bugged for a while and that he had no idea how the final car would look and guaranteed us nothing. \u003Cp\u003EIn this case, the car has exceeded my expectations and I am a happy customer and by far got my $23 worth of fun and then some!

Except perhaps in the case of software, which is still a gray area to some extent. And that is quite understandable, I think, because it is by no means a simple matter. By comparing it to a car sale you are simplifying the problem. Or ignoring it.\u003Cp\u003ESome of your points are true and valid. But software is by itself an intangible product, and buying software still under development only makes it even worse. This is something a buyer should be well aware of. Consumer protection should never relieve buyers from taking responsibility for their own decisions and actions. Afterall, it is also in everyone\u0027s interest to protect software startups from malicious lawsuits and unreasonable claims.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn most judicial systems you look for \u0027malicious intent\u0027 when you try to determine wrongdoings. I don\u0027t think anyone can reasonably accuse Squad of that. They have a vision for a future product, and they are investing in a project to realize that vision. They have presented the vision as clearly as they can, and everyone is free to support it - or watch from the sideline. As a buyer it is an investment like any other. A high-risk investment (buying early) provides better returns, but no promises. If you want promises and guarantees you should opt for the low-risk investment - which is waiting for the finished product, complete featurelists and external reviews before you buy. The latter option being of course more expensive. Are you interested in the journey or the destination? You get what you pay for either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the vision Squad have for the game may not at all resemble the buyers vision. In many cases it is probably not even discussed or properly thought out yet. Or, it may very well change underway. That is also quite understandable in an ongoing development project. Again, this is something the buyers should be well aware of. As for marketing... well, I learned that a looong time ago. Always do your own research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point here, and the topic of the thread, is to stay reasonable. Of course, con artists should not be allowed to swindle money from gullible buyers, and of course, con artists should also not be allowed to swindle money from na\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AFve software startups. It never hurts to try to see things from the other point of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your example. If Squad stopped development on KSP tomorrow it would still leave me with a very fun and entertaining product. Same can be said for Prison Architect, and a bunch of other titles. I am, of course, rather careful in which titles I choose to purchase and why, and I don\u0027t expect to be protected from myself in that regard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jeti140973","CreatedById":61447,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T08:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bothersome\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bothersome\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s what I saw on Steam when I bought it.
