This plane flies parabolas to give an accurate depiction of weightlessness aboard a real spacecraft (although only for ~20 seconds at a time.) The result, after flying around twelve parabolas, is a combined total of nearly five minutes of true weightlessness. Cool beans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took aboard a little plasticine model of Jeb that I had made. (I could have brought a Shapeways model but I didn\u0027t have one, and even then, I\u0027m not sure if it would have survived the flight.) Jeb happily bounced about the cabin for two parabolas. I shot some video of him but it will take a while to edit... so, here\u0027s a quick screenshot of Jeb flying weightless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rce63l3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rce63l3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStay tuned, and let me know what you think! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jebs_in_tha_house","CreatedById":100311,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T02:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehaha thats really cool, and also, how much does it cost to go on one of those flights? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T12:14:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jebs_in_tha_house\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jebs_in_tha_house\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehaha thats really cool, and also, how much does it cost to go on one of those flights? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWondering the same...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T12:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s awesome!

I was far more concerned with a) keeping track of the Kerbal, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E trying unsuccessfully to stay more-or-less upright and not float into an upside-down position, and c) having the time of my life.

Immediately before flight, Murphy\u0027s Law dashed the poor Kerbal\u0027s leg off. Despite the lack of conventional glue, Jeb\u0027s leg was soon firmly reattached with some super-sticky ginger candy. The candy, originally brought to quell any feelings of space-sickness, turned out to serve an even better purpose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I felt great throughout the flight, though three people ended up tossing their cookies.
