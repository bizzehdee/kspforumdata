I\u0027ve completed a few missions, including a flyby, placing a satellite in orbit around Eve, and more recently, a Kerballed mission to orbit and back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy method for getting to Eve tends to be to wait until the correct angle, getting into orbit around Kerbin, and set a maneuver that gets the \u0027closest encounter\u0027 marker to be \u0027fairly close\u0027, then at one of the Dn or An nodes in orbit around the Sun, set another maneuver to match inclination... plus a bit of fiddling to try and put me into a fairly close encounter. I might then add another maneuver a little closer to Eve to fine tune.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has worked... reasonably well... for the missions I\u0027ve been on; but it does feel like I\u0027m winging it a bit. Returning from Eve is even more unreliable, and essentially devolves into a lot of time spent fiddling with maneuver nodes to try and get some kind of encounter with Kerbin. It all feels \u0027brute forced\u0027, wasteful, and incorrect. Mainly because I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t\u00A0like to feel like I\u0027m crossing my fingers and hoping for the best, especially as I don\u0027t have quicksaves or reverts on, so I wondered if there was any advice - particularly about matching inclinations while I\u0027m in orbit of Kerbin, as theoretically I might be able to plan a maneuver that gets me an encounter while still in Kerbin/Eve orbit. That means I can feel a bit more confident about the maneuvers\u00A0I\u0027m planning, rather than sending poor Jeb off into interplanetary space, without knowing if he\u0027ll ever make it there, or back again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t use mods, so I\u0027m just working with what I\u0027ve got.

If you really want to skip making mid-course corrections, you can employ an external tool to precalculate a ballistic transfer for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve\u0027s orbit is inclined compared to Kerbin\u0027s orbit. Eve\u0027s orbital period is different from Kerbin\u0027s. Even the eccentricity differs, although not by much. But, to put it in highly unscientific terms, these differences are not \u0022the same\u0022, not \u0022in sync\u0022. As in, If you fly transfers at various recurrences of the correct phase angle, then you will not always have the same transfer with the same plane change to do. Each time the planets line up in the correct angle, the alignment of orbital planes and parameters will be different. This means there is no magical solution to the way you should do your Kerbin departure burn that works in every case. You literally have to find a new unique solution each time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as matching inclination directly through your Kerbin departure burn Kerbin goes - the general rule of the thumb is \u0022you cannot\u0022. There are special alignments where it is possible, but outside of them, it flat-out doesn\u0027t work. If you think about it for a moment, the reason becomes clear. Where do you normally do your mid-course corrections again? The ascending/descending node, I hear you say? Yes, that is the correct spot. At these points (or rather, along the axis that goes through both of these points and the parent body), the orbital planes intersect. So you can go from one to the other. If you are not where they intersect, you cannot go from one to the other. Any attempt to do so will invariably lead you to go into a different orbital plane instead (even if only slightly different). Try and imagine it in your head - two paper discs stuck on top of each other at an angle, intersecting along a line. And you can only travel along the rim of any given disc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means that, in order to match inclination with Eve\u0027s orbit directly with your Kerbin departure burn, \u003Cem\u003EKerbin itself\u003C/em\u003E needs to be at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E with respect to Eve\u0027s orbit. Then, and only then, this maneuver works. You\u0027ll simply be folding your normal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E course correction into your departure burn. Of course, since the difference in orbital periods, inclinations, and eccentricities are not \u0022in sync\u0022, Kerbin won\u0027t do you the favor of being anywhere near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E on most phase angle matches. People still use the so-called \u0022apoapsis transfer\u0022 to go to Moho, because a Hohmann transfer to Moho is the single most \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E-expensive and precision-dependant transfer you can make in stock KSP, and most people would rather have a cheaper and less finnicky option even if it takes a few years longer to arrive. For Eve though, which is already one of the cheaper transfers to other planets, this seems unpractical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can, however, still typically get a direct Eve encounter from Kerbin orbit anyways. The lack of sync just means that this will be fairly easy to do for some opportunities, and fairly hard for other opportunities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next thing you need to understand is that, by being in Kerbin orbit, you are also in solar orbit, because Kerbin itself is in solar orbit. KSP does a bit poorly at representing this fact, due to the way you can only be in one sphere of influence at a time. But orbital mechanics won\u0027t let you cheat either way. Try launching a spacecraft into a perfect 90\u00B0 polar Kerbin orbit. Now make a retrograde escape burn like you normally would when going to an inner planet like Eve. What\u0027s your inclination around the sun going to be like? 90\u00B0 too? Hah, not even close. It\u0027s likely going to be less than 9\u00B0, even. The maximum solar inclination you can achieve by leaving Kerbin is the inclination of the upper (or lower) edge of Kerbin\u0027s spherical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E with respect to Kerbin itself. 84,159,286 meters above Kerbin\u0027s own solar orbit. You cannot go any higher without a plane change in solar orbit. And most of the time, you will be far lower than that, even when leaving Kerbin from an inclined orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means that, in order to attain even a few degrees of solar inclination through your Kerbin departure burn, you\u0027ll need a highly inclined departure orbit. And these things are... uncomfortable. For starters, doing plane changes in low Kerbin orbit is so expensive that you\u0027d be spending far more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E trying to enter that inclined orbit after launching into an equatorial one than you would save by not making a course correction in solar orbit. No, in order to make this worth the effort, most of the time you\u0027d have to launch directly into the inclined orbit. This also costs more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E than an equatorial launch, because you\u0027re not getting the full eastward rotation bonus; it\u0027s difficult to fly, since you need to actively steer rather than just letting the rocket fall over towards the east; and it\u0027s even more difficult to \u003Cem\u003Etime\u003C/em\u003E it right. In contrast to an equatorial orbit, which has most of its orbital parameters nulled out and irrelevant, an inclined orbit needs to be inclined correctly. Not just the correct amount, but also the correct direction: the so-called longitude of ascending node (LAN). To get this one right, you have an instantaneous launch window - you need to launch at exactly the right time of day, when the launch site is directly under where you want your inclined orbit to be. You may or may not have some practice with this kind of launch window through exploring Minmus, where you can launch directly into a 6\u00B0 Kerbin orbit in the moment where the launch site passes under Minmus\u0027 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E with respect to the equator, and save yourself a plane change that way. But, in contrast to Minmus, here you have Kerbin\u0027s motion around the sun to consider. That means that for any given LAN value you select, the interplanetary transfer window is strictly speaking \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E an instantaneous window. If you wait too long past your opportunity, your laboriously achieved inclined departure orbit will slowly drift out of alignment with Eve\u0027s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat, anyway, is the \u0022perfect\u0022 solution. An instantaneous launch window leading directly into an inclined departure orbit for an instantaneous transfer window that\u0027s been precalculated to represent the total trip \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E minimum for this particular, unique planetary alignment. And if you\u0027re now sitting back and going \u0022that\u0027s way too complicated\u0022, then at least 95% of the playerbase will eagerly agree with you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeck, even most third-party navigation tools agree, too \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003EEven \u003Ca href=\u0022https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlexmoon\u0027s mighty Transfer Window Planner\u003C/a\u003E, which I absolutely recommend to each and every player, makes the default assumption that your departure orbit is perfectly equatorial and perfectly circular, because deviating from that assumption makes the calculation so much more complicated and the execution ingame so much more prone to imprecision.
