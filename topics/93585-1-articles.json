The specific point of conversation was the pop-up tips displayed coming from different astronaut personas. However, this could also include named points of interest on the different bodies like how Neil Armstrong is honored on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the people I had in mind was \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/nagel.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESteve Nagel\u003C/a\u003E. We had him at our ham radio convention last year as a guest speaker. He came and talked to the children in the schools as well as giving two forum presentations during the convention. He was a professor at Columbia University here in Missouri and was a very well liked man. I really enjoyed working/talking with him and hearing the enthusiasm he had for space related endeavors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be great if we could honor people like this who spent their lives educating and promoting space flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Treldon","CreatedById":128860,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T20:40:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea. There could be an option that enables these pop-ups, so those who only want to play could opt out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut why stop with astronauts? There are lots of other people who contributed a lot and without them we couldn\u0027t do half the stuff we do.
