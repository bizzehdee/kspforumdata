Bussy people who can\u0027t play much videogames when they\u0027re out of their homes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that in mind I think it would be nice to have KSP 2 in a cloud service such as GFN who could let us play wherever and whenever we want. Plus, you have to still purchase the game in the platform you want, so its not a big inconvenience for the dev company.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrimeVest","CreatedById":225591,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T09:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact I refrained from buying KSP2 EA because my I know pc won\u0027t be able to handle it.
