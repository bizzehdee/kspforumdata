Already on the ground, or in flight? (Edit -- re-read the thread title, in flight then.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s on the ground, it\u0027s probably a landing gear issue -- something isn\u0027t quite straight, or your wings are flexing so much it makes the main gear go off straight, which then causes the craft to veer. (Why always left only Kraken knows.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s in flight, then it\u0027s possibly something that\u0027s not quite as symmetrical as you think: probably a part\u00A0that\u0027s surface attached when you think it\u0027s node attached. Enable the aerodynamic overlay (F12) and see if there\u0027s an asymmetrical drag vector somewhere; that\u0027ll give you an\u00A0idea of\u00A0what the problem part is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could also be because of a centre of pressure issue. Your tanks aren\u0027t node attached, which means the KSP aerodynamic model will treat them counterintuitively. It might be it \u0022sees\u0022 a big flat surface instead of the pointy-ish nose you\u0027re trying to make. A draggy nose has the same effect on stability as moving the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E forward.
