Both are confirmed to have a biosphere but its extent is not measurable from Kerbol. They are both slightly larger than Kerbin. Nava Ac has a kerbin-like atmophere that makes initial planetfall easier while Proxima c has a rarefied atmosphere that makes launching back into orbit easier. The proxima system contains the only known gas giant which makes an easy source of fuel, most notably He3. Nova Ac has a local system of moons that allows stocking up on metals closer to the destination while still allowing scrounging up some He3 for an eventual rise to Proxima. Nova Ac also has an easier access to the planets of its companion star. However Proxima c has the style points of being based on Proxima Centauri b. Which planet would make a better colonization target?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-27T15:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to mod discussion\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iapetus7342","CreatedById":233205,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-02T16:47:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo for Blalo.
