Stars that you\u0027ll likely able to resolve would be those very huge stars, evolved stars like RG and AGB, which means dense circumstellar dust and variability. An example of this is Betelgeuse, whose angular diameter goes around 43 to 56 miliarcsecond (ten millionth of a degree), and possibly irregular shaped. That being said, seems like our images of Betelgeuse are fairly resolved today that we can tell where the poles are located.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T11:54:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 11:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YNM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T11:54:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESuppose that proxima centauri is about the size of the sun and we want at least 10 pixels of resolution.

Interferometer telescope arrays can, in theory, image nearby stars. Quality of images such systems produce is pretty bad, but you can get some useful information out of it. I believe, prior to New Horizons, best images of Pluto were due to interferometer array. In theory, one of these arrays should be able to image Alpha Centauri stars, but there migth be some limitations I\u0027m not taking into account, such as glare or atmosphere.
