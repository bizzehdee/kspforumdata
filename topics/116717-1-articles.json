Stars that you\u0027ll likely able to resolve would be those very huge stars, evolved stars like RG and AGB, which means dense circumstellar dust and variability. An example of this is Betelgeuse, whose angular diameter goes around 43 to 56 miliarcsecond (ten millionth of a degree), and possibly irregular shaped. That being said, seems like our images of Betelgeuse are fairly resolved today that we can tell where the poles are located.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T11:54:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 11:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YNM**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T11:54:15Z","Content":"Suppose that proxima centauri is about the size of the sun and we want at least 10 pixels of resolution. This means the telescope needs an angular resolution of arctan(70e3km/4.8ly)~1.56e-9 rad.\n\nWe want to look at the star in visible light, so we have a wavelength of about 500nm. Plug these 2 numbers in the telescope equation and we find that we need a telescope with a main mirror 320 meters in diameter. The biggest telescope we have right now has a diameter of about 10 meters. The E-ELT that\u0027s in construction right now will have a diameter of almost 40 meters.\n\nSo we\u0027re about an order of magnitude short in terms of mirror diameter to see stars as anything other than point sources."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T12:40:23Z","Content":"No, stars are literally points to our optical devices.

A practical issue with optical is *seeing*. Meaning the the issues with the atmosphere which become worse when the paths for the light differ between instruments. Space-based optical interferometers have been proposed, and the Moon is a really good candidate for a VLA-like instrument (only optical, not radio)."},{"CreatedByName":"JetJaguar","CreatedById":146965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T14:20:40Z","Content":"It turns out there are a [handful of stars with images that have been resolved beyond a point source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_with_resolved_images).

Visible light is about 500nm. That means, with a 1m telescope mirror, Sun would resolve to a single point at a distance of just 0.3 light years. From 4 light years, a telescope with a 12m mirror would still see our Sun as just a single point.\n\nThis basically means that even with largest conventional telescopes, best we can do are super-giants, and even then, all we get are a few pixels like that image above.\n\nThere is one more options. Interferometer telescope arrays can, in theory, image nearby stars. Quality of images such systems produce is pretty bad, but you can get some useful information out of it. I believe, prior to New Horizons, best images of Pluto were due to interferometer array. In theory, one of these arrays should be able to image Alpha Centauri stars, but there migth be some limitations I\u0027m not taking into account, such as glare or atmosphere. Even then, you\u0027d get something even uglier than that Betelgeuse image."},{"CreatedByName":"livefree75","CreatedById":111756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T12:30:37Z","Content":"You would need a HUGE telescope, probably space based.\n\nI\u0027ve heard it said that a typical star viewed from Earth has the same angular diameter as a walnut seen from 600 km away.
