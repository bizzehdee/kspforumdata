Ganymede\u0027s atmosphere has a surface pressure of around a micropascal. Mars\u0027s atmosphere is 600 Pa and 0.145% oxygen according to Wikipedia. This means that the partial pressure of oxygen is close to a MILLION times higher on Mars than on Ganymede. Trying to compress Ganymede\u0027s atmosphere would be absurd. It would probably take many orders of magnitude less energy to electrolyze the water ice of Ganymede\u0027s regolith to produce oxygen, or to synthesize oxygen from Martian CO2.\n\n2. Ganymede\u0027s ice is FAR more water than a colony would have any use for. Mars should have enough buried ice to support a colony. Also, for the record, Ganymede\u0027s ocean is [below 150 km of ice/URL\\]. We can\u0027t drill through that with anything remotely resembling current technology. If you want to explore an ocean, going to Europa is a better bet.](http://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/nasa-s-hubble-observations-suggest-underground-ocean-on-jupiters-largest-moon/)\n\n3. As everyone else has pointed out, Ganymede\u0027s magnetic field isn\u0027t enough to protect it from Jupiter\u0027s much stronger one. Sure, you *could* shield a colony by placing it under a couple tens of meters of ice, but why bother?\n\nAside from that, there are a couple of other important points to consider:\n\nFirst, travel to/from Ganymede will take much longer than travel to/from Mars. With a hohmann transfer, I believe it\u0027s 3-5 years vs. a few months. This means that a ship would need extremely thick radiation shielding, and use an very high dV transfer.\n\nSecond, Ganymede takes a LOT of delta-V to reach compared to Mars. Assuming [this delta-V map of our solar system is anywhere near accurate, it takes about 4500 m/s to reach the Martian surface from LEO, but 9500 m/s to reach Ganymede\u0027s surface. This is assuming you Aerocapture for both Mars and Jupiter. The actual dV needs will be even higher, because again you won\u0027t be using a Hohmann transfer. Ganymede has no atmosphere for aerobraking, and is about as hard to land on as the moon. Returning will be even harder; that dV map says that you\u0027d need 6700 m/s to escape Jupiter\u0027s immense gravity well from a Ganymede transfer orbit. This is a huge requirement even for nuclear-powered spacecraft.](http://i.imgur.com/AAGJvD1.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T19:50:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Venus has 93x the pressure of Earth, and is the hottest place in the solar system not counting the Sun.

And of course \u0022transient\u0022 doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll have lakes or rives, but rather you\u0027ll have a very, very small stream which will last for a minute or two tops before it evaporates. But there\u0027s more water on Mars than you might suspect. Just not liquid."},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T13:21:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know what Neptune\u0027s atmospheric radiation levels are, but keep in mind it\u0027s still an \u0022Ice Giant\u0022 (related to gas giants), so it is basically a failed star that didn\u0027t acquire enough mass to go fully nuclear.\n\u003E It still has a good amount of fission going on in its interior and maybe some fusion too, so I can\u0027t imagine it\u0027s too safe that close to the core.\n\nNope, no appreciable amounts of fission will be going on in Neptune, you need fissile material and a moderator, neither of which it is going to have in large amounts. Perhaps there is some radioactive decay of unstable isotopes in the core, remaining from its formation, but this will have zero effect except right next to them.\n\nThere won\u0027t be any fusion either, you need a huge amount of temperature and pressure to cause *any* fusion, and the mass to cause that to happen through gravity alone is far greater than Neptune can manage.\n\nThe radiation at Jupiter is caused primarily by energetic particles trapped in its powerful magnetic field (itself caused by the quickly-rotating core of metallic hydrogen). These particles themselves, and electromagnetic waves caused by their interactions with other matter, are what makes the environment around Jupiter so high-dose. Neptune has a far weaker magnetic field, and therefore far weaker radiation belts.\n\nYou\u0027re right that it won\u0027t be safe close to the core though, the pressure would kill you instantly, it is in excess of two million atmospheres at the point where the hydrogen transitions to its metallic phase. It will also be very hot due to the residual energy from the planet\u0027s formation."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T14:09:42Z","Content":"There certainly is radioactive decay in all planets and all satellites; that\u0027s what gives their cores a great deal of heat, probably most of it in some cases, but for any seemingly controlled fission you can\u0027t have all the contents mixed and in fluid state. They will spontaneously separate.\n\nThose atoms are ancient surviving remnants of some old supernova. Uranium and thorium isotopes.\n\nThe actual rays coming from such cores are not a threat because the overall power density is **very low**. It\u0027s the sheer huge mass of the material that is responsible for the energy levels. Compare with Sun\u0027s fusion - its energy generation is lower than in a gekko, yet it is a scary ball of gas and plasma because it\u0027s so huge. Our fission reactors are ungodly powerful compared to stars. Lump of uranium the size of our Sun can\u0027t even exist. Hell, lump the size of a TV can\u0027t.\n\nAlso, satellites and planets are so large that the distance from the radioactive parts and shielding combined gives supreme protection. There simply isn\u0027t any such danger from any planet/satellite.\n\nThe only threat comes from their magnetospheres catching and concentrating solar wind. You don\u0027t need a radioactive source to get ionizing radiation."}]}
