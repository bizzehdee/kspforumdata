As everyone else has pointed out, Ganymede\u0027s magnetic field isn\u0027t enough to protect it from Jupiter\u0027s much stronger one. Sure, you \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E shield a colony by placing it under a couple tens of meters of ice, but why bother?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from that, there are a couple of other important points to consider:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, travel to/from Ganymede will take much longer than travel to/from Mars. With a hohmann transfer, I believe it\u0027s 3-5 years vs. a few months. This means that a ship would need extremely thick radiation shielding, and use an very high dV transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, Ganymede takes a LOT of delta-V to reach compared to Mars. Assuming \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AAGJvD1.png\u0022\u003Ethis delta-V map of our solar system is anywhere near accurate, it takes about 4500 m/s to reach the Martian surface from LEO, but 9500 m/s to reach Ganymede\u0027s surface. This is assuming you Aerocapture for both Mars and Jupiter. The actual dV needs will be even higher, because again you won\u0027t be using a Hohmann transfer. Ganymede has no atmosphere for aerobraking, and is about as hard to land on as the moon. Returning will be even harder; that dV map says that you\u0027d need 6700 m/s to escape Jupiter\u0027s immense gravity well from a Ganymede transfer orbit.
