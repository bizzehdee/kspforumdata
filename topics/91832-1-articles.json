As stated above, a true skycrane can\u0027t be built stock since there are no cables, etc. This one is made to land completely, then release the rover, but you can also make a disposable one like the above post and make one that can hover low over the surface, decouple the rover, then fly away to crash somewhere else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JJ70Cx7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JJ70Cx7.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R41aRjB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022R41aRjB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also made one more recently that was very nice and simple (no pictures at present).

In the middle there was a probe core, and docking port jr. where the rover attached and detached, it was a small rover similar to the one in the post above.
