We now have a good answer to the mass of a Kerbal, 0.09 tons. So including the seat, it\u0027s actually heavier to bring a Kerbal than to bring another small chute. I got a 6.61-ton SSTO out to Laythe, but turns out even 2 small chutes weren\u0027t enough to land safely without some help from the engines. And I\u0027m not sure if it was carrying enough fuel for return... I may have to try again using wings for gliding landing instead. I seem to remember some people flying fairly small 1-man ion planes to Laythe, I\u0027m personally not patient enough for ion missions but I wonder if that would actually win in weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit again: found the link to the ion Laythe plane I was thinking of, if anyone\u0027s curious: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Yu3m2#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/Yu3m2#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-26T10:52:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2013 10:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jack wooster","CreatedById":5689,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T16:44:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow! that ion plane is small, I too have trouble with ion missions as the burns take so long, or you need multiple goes at them.
