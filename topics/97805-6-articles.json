This is pretty much the *opposite* of a one-off fairing. It\u0027s the launch provider deciding, as part of a tweak to their offerings, to offer larger fairings. The *development* is what\u0027s costing 100,000,000 euros, but it\u0027s not designed for any individual payload; it\u0027s designed to offer this for future payloads. The development isn\u0027t being funded by customers, it\u0027s being funded by ESA (who have a pretty close relationship with Arianespace). The construction isn\u0027t the expensive part; the expensive part is that it costs quite a lot of money to develop and test rocket-grade parts, and quite a lot of money to set up the manufacturing process to make fairings of that size with necessary tolerances. The marginal cost of a fairing will be well under a hundred million euros, but that\u0027s because the development has already been done for that exact fairing design, so you don\u0027t need to re-pay the price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, you could design a custom fairing for a hundred million euros.

No one claims fairing design is expensive because new designs have much higher marginal costs. The issue is *development* cost, which is huge.

That price is completely disconnected from the price a customer pays for the fairings, because by the time the customer\u0027s buying them, the price is already spent, so Arianespace doesn\u0027t have to charge a ton (and so they can reasonably compete on price). The reason new designs are so rare is precisely because development costs are so high; those tend to be paid by governments or outside funding, while marginal costs are paid by customers.
