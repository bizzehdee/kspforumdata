I\u0027m a member of this forum for about 2 weeks, but I haven\u0027t been active much. I come from Slovenia (that\u0027s NOT Slovakia. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Relatively close, though.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got hold of KSP on my birthday and I must say I love every minute of it. I am pretty much a newbie into the game, but it\u0027s just so incredible and vast. I just can\u0027t get enough of it, be it watching videos or playing it myself. My achievements so far are visible below. Not much, but as I said, I\u0027m a starter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use mods. Not that I wouldn\u0027t want to, but I don\u0027t have the need at the moment. There is already so much parts and stuff to do that adding tons of new content would probably destroy me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T22:47:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you\u0027re a new player, I\u0027m going to recommend that you take a look at some of the tutorials available over on the Drawing Board, which is linked in my signature, if you ever get stuck. Feel free to ask questions around the forums as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand perfectly about not wanting to get swamped by mods; there\u0027s already tons of parts available in the stock game, so you can get a lot of mileage out of the different combinations from those alone. That said, a few of them can be quite handy indeed. I won\u0027t try to rush you to install any of them, though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove all, have fun, and hope all this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
