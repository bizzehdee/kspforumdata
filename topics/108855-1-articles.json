Yet, you can also take advantage of this by using airbrakes more or less to fine tune the landing spot. It will be fun to describe in text, but I shall try. Opposite the KSC there is a very large continent of land, and just at the end of it there is a narrowish bay and then the tip of a peninsula. I usually do my retro burns at that peninsula and set my apoapsis for 22-33 km depending on the thing I am deorbiting."},{"CreatedByName":"mdcasey","CreatedById":101731,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T03:55:56Z","Content":"Thanks for the help. I\u0027ll give it a go. I think I may have just used my airbrake a little too much."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T04:32:31Z","Content":"Here is an example of full flight for you.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
