Yet, you can also take advantage of this by using airbrakes more or less to fine tune the landing spot. It will be fun to describe in text, but I shall try. Opposite the KSC there is a very large continent of land, and just at the end of it there is a narrowish bay and then the tip of a peninsula. I usually do my retro burns at that peninsula and set my apoapsis for 22-33 km depending on the thing I am deorbiting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mdcasey","CreatedById":101731,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T03:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help. I\u0027ll give it a go.
