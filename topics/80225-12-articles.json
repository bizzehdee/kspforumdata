If they are not all available then the ship simply doesn\u0027t spawn. stuff like needing kerbals or their stats, build times, and construction consumables I would personally view as unnecessary as this idea was pitched as a simpler alternative to ExpLp. You are not building a ship from dirt here you are rearranging some space lego\u0027s you already had in orbit so its already much less powerful than ExpLp to balance out its greater convenience. Kerbals wouldn\u0027t be essential cause the full featured hangar as you explained is already packed with autonomous hardware for moving ships and their parts around all you need to do is add socket wrenches and tape dispensers, build times would be pointless because you can time warp through them, and consumables IMO should be omitted just for the sake of not cluttering the resource menu.
