It is in 2D.\n\nLet\u0027s imagine though, that we (And let\u0027s pretend we are Squad) want to design a 3D Mobile Kerbal Space Program spinoff. We have to design using the touch screen, not fighting it. This pretty much means no joysticks, at least not for normal things. Joysticks might make sense on a space game I guess.\n\nRefer to this video for designing with a touch screen.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/NBHircZu5EI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nAnd also ignore the bit about not translating an old game into a touch form, for the sake of argument.\n\nSo I would have a throttle and a mechanic where you can just drag around the navball to turn.\n\nFor features, I would limit them considerably.\n\nLess parts, no probe parts (Except perhaps 1 robotically controlled core)\n\nNo electricCharge parts. \n\nOnly have a few planets. Kerbin, Mun, Duna, Ike, Eve, Jool, Laythe, Vall, Tylo. Maybe even remove Moho.\n\nNo asteroids, you\u0027ll notice. And I mean that literally. Not just no NKOs, but also no small planetoids.\n\nNot just lower the texture quality, but remodel the parts so that they\u0027re less \u0022expensive\u0022 on the tablet.\n\nTo account for this, make the art style further stylized.\n\nFor extra features to help with the touch interface or mobile style:\n\nAbility to translate parts in placement mode.\n\nThottle Control onscreen\n\nPitchyawroll controlled by dragging the navball in the direction you want to go.\n\nTranslation is controlled separately by translation buttons in a separate control mode.\n\nSimplify Career Mode.\n\n-Merge Science and Funding.\n\n-Remove Rep.\n\n-smallify tech tree.\n\nBut could a mobile KSP work? Well, there\u0027s a mobile Space Simulator for iOS, and it\u0027s more like Orbiter. Really complex. So I think it would work.\n\nThoughts?\n\n(I hope this may have inspired someone to go out and make a mobile space simulator that involves 3D building of rockets.)"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T23:55:23Z","Content":"EC, yay!

Instead of making it into a try and control a rocket on a touch screen it should be more like how small of a rocket can I make to get to the mun. Or can I build a rocket that can reach orbit and put three different satellites in different orbits.\n\nThe problem with KSP is that all the cool things you can do with it takes time to learn. Even using a tried and true control system."},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T00:17:17Z","Content":"A KSP alike game is [Space Agency](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/space-agency/id542397575?mt=8) and Scott Manley did a video a while back, but it has been updated with a whole bunch of new features.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dt_0IpTdKvU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n is Scott Manley\u0027s video."},{"CreatedByName":"Special Agent Sigvan","CreatedById":92033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T02:28:20Z","Content":"Step 1: Think of putting KSP on mobile.\n\nStep 2: Slap yourself for thinking such a silly idea.\n\n -2.5: Gasp in horror at the lag once you do put it on mobile.\n\nStep 3: Back to playing Dying Light.\n\nStep 4: Chuckle and profit."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T16:45:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A KSP alike game is [Space Agency](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/space-agency/id542397575?mt=8) and Scott Manley did a video a while back, but it has been updated with a whole bunch of new features.\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dt_0IpTdKvU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E  is Scott Manley\u0027s video.\n\nSpace Agency is horrible.
