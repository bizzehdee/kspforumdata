Well, seven years later it\u0027s time for another one only this time Cassini will be looking up at Saturn and its rings with the Earth visible in the lower right hand corner. There was an event on July 19, Wave at Saturn, when Cassini took a series of 33 pictures to form a giant mosaic to be released at some point in the not too distant future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile we wait for that, NASA has released a sneak peek:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA17171.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PIA17171.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/20130722_annotated_earth-moon_from_saturn_1920x1080.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere is a zoomed in version of the same picture, with Earth annotated\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn this rare image taken on July 19, 2013, the wide-angle camera on NASA\u0027s Cassini spacecraft has captured Saturn\u0027s rings and our planet Earth and its moon in the same frame. It is only one footprint in a mosaic of 33 footprints covering the entire Saturn ring system (including Saturn itself). At each footprint, images were taken in different spectral filters for a total of 323 images: some were taken for scientific purposes and some to produce a natural color mosaic. This is the only wide-angle footprint that has the Earth-moon system in it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll find the full press release with more info here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/pia17171.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/pia17171.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also find close-ups of the Earth and Moon \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/pia17170.html#.Ue5B3I1blr0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E and a narrow-angle camera shot \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/N00213959.html#.Ue5DNY1blr0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T09:09:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEpic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does not looks safe, with the Earth just out there in the vast empty space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T09:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s beautiful.
