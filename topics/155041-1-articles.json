However, the craft is big yet is invisible after 4KM, and when entering the 4K radius, my game pauses to load the craft. This means I must be within 4KM to fire, and is also annoying for SAM sites. I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to bump this up to perhaps, 10KM?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-16T04:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a setting within BD armory to change physics load range.
