Another mod idea here. I think most people dislike KSC science grinding. There\u0027s so many biomes! It\u0027s not fun after a few trips.

It makes sense if you spend thousands of kerbucks to improve a building that you\u0027d learn some things along the way. I\u0027m thinking it wouldn\u0027t have to be a lot, but enough to maybe 1 science per 20k spent. Ratio could be changed in a setting. Could even be an exponential formula so that when you get the big upgrades, you get even more science for the expensive nodes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway. Is this possible?
