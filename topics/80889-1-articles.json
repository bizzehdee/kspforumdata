This was done partly for aesthetics, but also to compensate for the raised CoL caused by the high-wing design. The tail also functions slightly as a dihedral wing, due to the fact that the rudders aren\u0027t perfectly vertical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T13:13:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is an answer to my post, thank you very much. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut actually I was curious about what GoSlash27 meant with \u0022without any separation between the wings means that they will no longer self-stabilize with dihedral\u0022 - is there another bug with clipping parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T13:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf this is an answer to my post, thank you very much. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut actually I was curious about what GoSlash27 meant with \u0022without any separation between the wings means that they will no longer self-stabilize with dihedral\u0022 - is there another bug with clipping parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what Slashy was getting at, actually.
