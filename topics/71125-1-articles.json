I would like to make new parts too though, I haven\u0027t got any specific ideas in mind just yet but I wouldn\u0027t mind expanding upon rovers etc, since they often feel a bit overlooked. Perhaps attempting to add parts that allow us to do some science that\u0027s closer to real life (rock samples and such) if I were to get good enough at it. I guess for now it would probably be best to focus on one so I\u0027m not taking on more than I can handle, but I will definitely keep an eye on Blender too when I start to get to grips with programming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers for the links!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T18:59:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are plenty of coders who don\u0027t model, and plenty of artists who don\u0027t code.

Seriously, find something that you want to see in the game. That will provide the drive you need to learn the tools that will get your idea into the game. Start with something small if you can; if not, start with the smallest piece of the idea. Part of the process of modding/coding/modeling is figuring out how to break your idea down into steps that you can work on one-by-one.

I\u0027m finding coding strangely satisfying though. Of course I\u0027m only working with basic level stuff here, but it\u0027s oddly fun watching a string give the correct feedback of what primary colour combinations would make what secondaries. (I thought I\u0027d start about as easy as I could lol)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m only working with basic True/False conditions and ifs/elifs/else or whatever the non Python equivalent names would be, but I\u0027m surprised by how much I\u0027ve picked up with only an hour or two to read up so far. I\u0027ve always assumed that the complexity of it would be well beyond me, hence I\u0027ve never tried before. Of course I have a long way to go before I can do anything to KSP and even a good way until I could write an app of any form, but it\u0027s a better start than I ever expected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
