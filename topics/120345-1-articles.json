You want to send yourself in a direction opposite to the way Jool is orbiting. If your Apoapsis is in Jool\u0027s SOI, your Jool-relative velocity vector approaching Jool will be opposite to the way Jool is orbiting. Your Jool-relative speed leaving Jool\u0027s SOI will be the same as your speed entering Jool\u0027s SOI, only the direction will change. As a consequence, a slingshot cannot provide you with a Kerbol-relative boost in the same direction as your Jool-relative velocity entering Jool\u0027s SOI (conservation of momentum* is a royal pain in the neck \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E). Thus, you want to arrange your Jool encounter so that you\u0027re approaching Jool from a different direction than you want to be boosted in, and preferably for a fairly high encounter velocity. One thing that you may want to look at, time and transfer windows permitting, is one or more Eve slingshots to boost you onto an orbit that sets up your Jool encounter. Another thing to consider is that you may be able to get around the \u0022no boost in your approach direction\u0022 bit with a sling off of one of Jool\u0027s moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022 data-cite=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know, I just thought it would cost less dV starting from a Kerbin retrograde orbit?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope.
