To calculate the number of parachutes I have figured a rule that has worked well so far. Determine the mass of the stage/booster (I usually use Mechjeb\u0027s Vessel Info for that, but you can also manually add the dry mass of each part) in tons. Multiply that by 1.2 and round up to the nearest integer and you get the number of parachutes (M16 or radial) needed. M16-XL parachute counts as 2.\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage has 8.75 tons of mass. 8.75 x 1.2 = 10.5. You need 11 radial chutes or 1 M16-XL plus 9 radials. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s much simpler than replicating MCE\u0027s calculations. I don\u0027t guarantee it will work 100% of the time, but has worked for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for recycling value, you can manually multiply the current value of the vessel indicated by MCE by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EsplashedRecycle = 0.65\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ElandedRecycle = 0.85\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ErunwayRecycle = 0.95\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EautoRecycle = 0.5985 (.63 x .95)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are on MCSettings.cfg file and can be changed with txt editor like Notepad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will see what I can come up with.
