HELP!!!!!","CreatedByName":"StevenLawyer","CreatedById":78513,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-12T04:10:03Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"StevenLawyer","CreatedById":78513,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-12T04:10:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, all.\u00A0 I\u0027ve spent weeks building a beautiful reusable space plane capable of sea level landings on Eve and Laythe and descent to 0 meters (sea level) on Jool.\u00A0 After a flight, the spaceplane is refitted with jettisonable fuel tanks and jet engines/electric fan blade motors depending upon the planetary body.\u00A0 The refitting is done using clamp-o-tron docking ports--one on the spaceplane and one on the fuel tank or engine to be attached.\u00A0 I\u0027ve meticulously built a mothership with robotics to fit the parts on the spaceplane.\u00A0 Now I am finding that, even though crossfeed is enabled on both docking ports, the engines won\u0027t draw fuel from tanks across the docking ports.\u00A0 At first I thought I had done something wrong, but I have built two very simple and seemingly identical ships that demonstrate the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a look at the pictures in the links below:\u00A0 The ships are identical (other than the paint scheme), right?\u00A0 Notice that they both have an upper and lower fuel tank connected by docking ports.\u00A0 You can see that on each ship both of the docking ports have crossfeed enabled.\u00A0 And yet, while the orange ship performs as you would expect (fuel drawing evenly from both tanks), the white ship will only draw fuel from the bottom tank.\u00A0 What\u0027s the difference?\u00A0 The yellow ship was built with the docking ports connected in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E--normal top to bottom construction.\u00A0 The white ship was built with the top and bottom docking ports not connected in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but rather placed immediately adjacent to each other so that they would dock as soon as the ship loaded on the pad.\u00A0 Once on the pad, the ships are identical in apparent construction, and yet no fuel will flow across the docking ports that are docked after launch.\u00A0 Without that capability, the only option for using drop tanks attached in flight is to do manual transfers--which aren\u0027t always a viable option if fuel draw is happening quickly, such as in a return to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iAdn7XVQgtV1Dy15jj2Ub4PekmsNjCxS/view?usp=sharing\u0022
