Once they are out of fuel, they fall away and the centre engine throttles up and burns its remaining fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we can\u0027t throttle engines independently, a work around would either be to add more fuel to the centre booster, changing the rockets design significantly, or have fuel lines feeding from the side boosters to the centre. However, when the side boosters jettisoned, I wouldn\u0027t want a full centre tank, as it\u0027d weigh too much for that one engine. So if I had the ability to stop fuel flow via the fuel lines midburn of the boost stage, the centre booster would be light enough to lift once the side boosters were jettison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s just one example where this feature would come in handy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
