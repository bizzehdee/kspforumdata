I sent up 4 missions at the same time, with Jeb\u0027s being the first. Once they were all in Munar orbit, I sent Jeb down to land and get that coveted \u0022First Kerbal on the Mun\u0022 honor.

I pretend this is actually Jebediah Jr. Jr started his career riding a rocket to orbit Strangelove-style, then test-piloted space planes until he got one into orbit and docked to a station.
