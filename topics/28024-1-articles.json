Also, your idea for a second engine to slow you down is probably the best way, but I\u0027d avoid using it unless you need to stop Now, to save fuel. The brakes would slow and stop you faster than a jet engine would spoil up so the retro engine would need to be a rocket. If you want to use mods, I think there\u0027s a jet engine or turbofan with fire spitter that lets you instantly reverse its thrust? At least I think that\u0027s the pack it came with!
