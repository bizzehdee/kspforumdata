I \u003Cem\u003Every rarely\u003C/em\u003E run KSP from the program files directory - in fact, I haven\u0027t since about .19 or so. Usually, when given permissions, the saves generate in the proper place (the\u0022saves\u0022 folder) and the ships in their respective folders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I ran into a problem. I ran 23.5 without permissions. Everything saved just fine. Then I ran it WITH permissions. Some very strange things happened. It seems when you run things one way, then another, things get confused, and had elements of both save files. Not necessarily a bug report, but pertinent to the task at hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I DL\u0027ed .90 (direct from Squad, no steam) I decided to stick with no permissions. Everything ran fine, saves saved and loaded. I have since upgraded my computer to Windows 8, on a new hard drive (new motherboard, the works). My old hard drive is now my E: . The problem is, when I look at the saves folders and ship folders, they are empty! Without permissions, KSP must have used some sort of temporary folder for saves (they worked, after all) but the folders themselves are bare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know where Windows shoves my save files when KSP doesn\u0027t have admin permissions? I would very much like to play my career save with my upgraded equipment and can\u0027t until I track that file down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T05:46:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably the best way to track it down is to go looking for the \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022 file name.
