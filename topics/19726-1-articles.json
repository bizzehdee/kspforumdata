The closest I have got two ships is 50km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help me, or point me towards a mod that assists in rendezvous? I know there is mechjeb, bt it seems to me that even that assumes a certain level of knowledge that I just don\u0027t have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-21T11:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is how I do it without calculation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Get both ships into the same circular orbit. Use RCS to make the target\u0027s orbit as circular as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Match your active craft\u0027s inclination with the target by burning normal or antinormal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Lower or raise the orbit of your active craft to reach the target:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - To catch up with the target, decelerate to lower your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - To slow down, accelerate to raise your orbit.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Use warp and do several orbits if necessary. This is where you need patience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) When you get under 10km from the target, circularize your orbit again, and use RCS to translate to the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, step 3 is counter-intuitive. But remember that when you lower your orbit, you are travelling a shorter distance, therefore you will get to a specific point faster. I usually limit myself to lowering or raising only one side of the orbit, and only by 10km maximum and then using warp. With a bit of practice, you can eyeball it pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe secret is to be patient. Do not overdo any burns because you will only have to compensate later. The same goes for the final approach on RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-21T12:11:59Z\u0022 title=\u002209/21/2012 12:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 21, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
