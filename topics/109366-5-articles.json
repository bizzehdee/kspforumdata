All realistic models. It\u0027s crazy. He hasn\u0027t fixed them yet for 1.02 though. Which stinks.\n\nIt\u0027s hilarious though, when trying to take the F-117 off, the wings pop off, leaving only the fuselage. (which is an all in one cockpit/engine/intake/fuselage)\n\nIt has reaction wheels, so it flies better without wings XD\n\nThe author posted a \u0022kinda fix\u0022 config edit for them for 1.02, but I can\u0027t for the life of me figure out how to do it.
