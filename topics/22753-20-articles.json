The tanks (containing oxygen and nitrogen for the life support system) sticking out of Quest\u0027s sides should be detachable, as seen in this pic: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/STS-104_Payload_Bay_view.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/STS-104_Payload_Bay_view.jpg\u003C/a\u003E This would allow it to actually fit inside Buran\u0027s (or Shuttle\u0027s) payload bay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-30T00:18:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2013 12:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Netris","CreatedById":28791,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T00:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dragon01\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dragon01\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is an issue with balancing CBBP\u0027s part.
