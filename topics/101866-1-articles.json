The power of big numbers!\n\nI doubt that within like 50-100 AU there\u0027s enough gravitational perturbations to force many or *any* objects into retrograde orbits. I suppose it might be possible to imagine a highly unlikely scenario where such a thing happens. Also consider that the closer you are to the Sun, the wider the range of velocity at aphelion that will result in you actually *colliding* with the Sun. You have to get through that range in a single interaction. A close passage by a planet is probably enough, but that is highly, highly unlikely. You also have to go through a series of solar system encounters where you use planetary gravity to brake your orbital velocity around the Sun to near-zero. That is probably even MORE unlikely. The only retrograde solar system objects I\u0027m aware of are long-period comets, and the reason these exist is because their aphelion is so far away that they can be forced into a retrograde orbit in a single, low-delta-V encounter.\n\nI suppose we might find an example of an object in a retrograde orbit with a perhelion of only a few hundred AU, who knows, maybe less, but if so, it would probably have started out as a long-period comet that went retrograde, and then had its aphelion reduced by subsequent gravitational interactions with planets.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T14:47:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 02:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T14:56:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I doubt that within like 50-100 AU there\u0027s enough gravitational perturbations to force many or *any* objects into retrograde orbits.\n\n[A Close Encounter with a dwarf star](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-31519875)\n\nMight that do the trick?"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T15:02:27Z","Content":"Oort cloud is at roughly 1 lightyear distance.

At tens of thousands of AU, there are plenty of gravitational perturbations from things like passing stars or molecular clouds to disrupt objects into retrograde or hyperbolic orbits. My point is that interactions between objects that are relatively close to the Sun (and stay relatively close to the Sun) are unlikely to transform an objects orbit into a retrograde orbit, the delta-V change required is probably just too high.\n\nThat said, I wonder if a gas giant could modify a close passing long period comet- especially one that\u0027s already \u0022sun-grazing\u0022- into a retrograde comet in a single interaction?\n\nAnyway, I believe that the preponderance of retrograde long period comets is entirely or almost entirely explained by what the original poster believed, namely that it takes only a very small delta-V perturbation at like 10,000\u002B AU to transform your orbit into a retrograde one.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T16:08:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 04:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"Frida Space","CreatedById":60943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T16:21:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s what I\u0027ve always thought.

Which is why only a few objects will have done it, most probably in the peeble or grain size. And the probability of them doing such an unlikely thing, compared to anything else, gives us a very good estimate of how many we should expect to find with those orbital parameters. Still, there will be *some*, there is a lot of gravel out there.\n\nRune.
