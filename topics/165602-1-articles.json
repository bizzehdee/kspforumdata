I\u0027ve just come back to Kerbal Space Program after not playing it for about half a year and I\u0027m doing career mode. The only mod I have on is MechJeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to complete a contract where I have to fly two tourists to a sub-orbit and back. The problem is that, whenever I come back from the sub-orbit, the command pod and the crew cabin start going crazy at re-entry and it starts facing straight towards Kerbin, even if I try holding it at the retrograde vector, and eventually it crashes down on the ground. I\u0027ve tried doing this with a few different rockets and every time it has done the same thing. The picture shows the latest rocket, which I tried too, hoping that the two extra engines would help it stay steady and not turn, but they ended up exploding and the same thing happened again. I\u0027ve been stuck here for many hours trying to figure it out but I just can\u0027t do it. Does anyone here have any advice how to survive the re-entry and get both the command pod and the crew cabin safely down from a sub-orbit? I\u0027ve done this before, but only with a command pod.
