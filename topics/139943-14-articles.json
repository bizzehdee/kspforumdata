mostly remember airplanes being a thing, and that jet engines actually needed an intake now) and for me, flying a mission from start to finish is very satisfying.\u00A0 Flying a mission from start to near finish, leaving things in orbit, was satisfying.\u00A0 Starting a mission to orbit, having to then jump back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and pick up contracts that just unlocked, launch a towering pillar of satellites into orbit, scatter those off toward their destinations, jump back to my first mission and start the transfer burn, settle into an orbit around the Mun, jump over to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and grab a contract to deorbit a lost Kerbal, retrieve said lost Kerbal, move a satellite from the Mun to Minmus to satisfy a contract, make my Mun Landing, and then forget about the Mun mission for a while because we really need to pay attention to the probes creeping toward Jool now.\u00A0 That is not satisfying at all.\u00A0 I\u0027m not saying that Career mode isn\u0027t capable of being fun, I\u0027m just saying that I found no fun in it myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer mode, in the early game, is grindy as heck.\u00A0 Then when you think it\u0027s going to get better because you\u0027re able to go interplanetary, it\u0027s still grindy as heck.\u00A0 The only time it stops being grindy as heck is when you end up filling out the tech tree before you\u0027ve even explored more than Kerbin, Mun, Minmus, and one other planet.\u00A0 And then it\u0027s just boring because you\u0027ve got fifty-billion missions started and no desire to finish any of them because they\u0027re not worth it

to see if it\u0027s suicide to send a Kerbal there. \u00A0I think the lack of mystery just doesn\u0027t make the extra effort pay off enough. \u00A0Now, if the solar system were procedurally generated, at least outside of Kerbin itself, then people could brag about how they found something cool or interesting. \u00A0Right now, we\u0027re just limited to building awesome ships that take advantage of the fact that everything is known about the solar system from the start and that is really cool,\u00A0even though I am a terrible ship builder, making a ship that makes it\u00A0to orbit
