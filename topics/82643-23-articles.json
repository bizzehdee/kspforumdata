We\u0027ve received two donations which is awesome. Thank you donators!. But after doing the math we saw that downloading through Curse could be a way for our users to donate a tiny bit without having to open their wallet. It\u0027s not a lot, but we love making stuff and thought that it would be neat if we could show the community how their support indirectly bought us a small amount of cheer. I think the KerbalStuff link will come back eventually because it\u0027s nice to have two download links in case one is down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd finally a question: CKAN has boxsat prototype parts.
