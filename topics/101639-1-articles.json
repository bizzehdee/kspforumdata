The zombies died out eventually, though, and he was officially alone in the cosmos. He also took a lifer extension pill which would keep him alive for another 5 billion years as he resigned to exploration and cartography of the cosmos, storing his data in a vault on his home planet Earth, spreading that information to any extraterrestrial species he came across.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T22:38:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Souper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T02:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice!
