(Unlike comments on Google\u002B-shared YouTube videos, which only show up on YouTube if you\u0027re in the circle or community they were posted from.

Then they tried to add \u0022google plus hangouts\u0022 which are nothing but a disaster compared to other streaming services specifically built for streaming. Finally, they\u0027re combining the bad parts of youtube (erroneous copyright strikes, etc.) with \u0022google plus hangouts\u0022, creating a very poor quality product.
