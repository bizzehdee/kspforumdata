I haven\u0027t done much for the forums recently and I want to get back in the swing of making parts. As such, I have absolutely no idea as for what I should create. I could create some random parts and hope for the best, but that doesn\u0027t seem like much of a good idea. That\u0027s where this post comes in, I\u0027d like for you to post what I should create. As long as it doesn\u0027t require any programming (E.G. Kethane Extractors) other that the usual .cfg, i\u0027d be more than happy to work and create the part you described. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T22:11:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake a radial mount extendable plank of wood\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sethodine","CreatedById":81768,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T05:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake a biodome habitat module. Basically, something with windows on the outside and plants on the inside, that can store kerbals for moon and space bases, or long-range (interplanetary?) spacecraft.
