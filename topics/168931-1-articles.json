That\u0027s both playing on a potato as well as a high end PC. Those craft aren\u0027t actually loaded in, or being calculated in any meaningful way unless you are controlling them, or near them; so I can\u0027t see how\u00A0they would affect anything besides perhaps loading the game initially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving lot\u0027s of saves and saved craft designs can make the menus take longer to appear though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you do a lot of modding, a fresh install can clear up a lot of issues that build up over time, just back up your save and your mods and stuff first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-26T19:34:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223253267\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168931\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221514316344\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022181766\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbalfreak\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, kerbalfreak said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like to build complex satellite constellations around planets and moons, right now my vessel count is around 80, but this number can increase a lot.
