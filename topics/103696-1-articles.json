I was using about 18 of the biggest rover wheels and even got away with warping a bit at 2x while driving on dead-flat. I found that attaching the wheels directly to the body caused more breakages then when mounted to girder \u0027suspension\u0027, when you pass over folds in the ground the wheels twitch and try to reorient, but each does so as it hits the change, if you dont meet changes in slope pretty head-on then a pair of wheels flexing out of synch can cause twisting and more breakage. Regardless, I managed to get them off the runway, down the slope and off up onto the dark green grass 3km or so West. Even drove one down to the waters edge and parked it on a hill.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mapoko","CreatedById":139980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T14:00:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, basically building a frame with wheels and then putting the tank over it is the way to go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99660-0-25-Adjustable-Landing-Gear-v1-0-4%28doors-fixed%29-Nov-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[0.25] Adjustable Landing Gear v1.0.4(doors fixed) - Nov 14\u003C/a\u003E which are better looking than stock, but still feels a bit unnatural in my eyes.

It will go there empty, then possibly use landing legs as well to stabilize my rig and use the small trucks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that even the empty 5m tank seems too heavy to move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am planning to colonize Mun, Minmus, Ike and Duna and I know the gravity there is lower, so those problems will not exist, BUT when I think about Eve ...
