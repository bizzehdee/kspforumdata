Specially the \u0022resume last flight\u0022 option, everytime I save a game, exit KSP, and then get back later, I have to search for my last flight in the Tracking Station, and it\u0027s usually on the wrong place, sometimes the game thinks it\u0027s a ship, other times it assumes it\u0027s a probe, etc... And when you have 20 or more in each tab, it gets pretty annoying to search for the correct one everytime. I suggest adding this option, and also a warp to daytime option would be nice, but I\u0027m not sure it is possible to time warp from the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT] They actually added an option to warp to the next morning in 1.0!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T22:29:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iStickyDuck","CreatedById":75908,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T17:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the warp to daytime idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E it has probably been suggested before...
