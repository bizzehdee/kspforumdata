It will no doubt come back with Unity 5.\n\nIf you REALLY want 64bit you can still do the same thing that was done to make KSP 64-bit in the first place around 0.23.5. You go and download some files for 64-bit unity and replace the 32bit versions in your KSP files. I don\u0027t remember WHAT files, or where to find them, but I\u0027m sure someone will find them soon enough.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T14:48:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 02:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Navy4422**\n  \n2.2"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T02:18:35Z","Content":"Eh...never used 64 bit! too sluggish and buggy on my system... plus...I like my mods."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T02:38:57Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115139-KSP_x64-exe-missing-Re-install-won-t-solve-it](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115139-KSP_x64-exe-missing-Re-install-won-t-solve-it)\n\nWell here comes the storm. would really like a dev to hop online and explain what is going on."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T02:59:54Z","Content":"Well, MaxMaps is on, so....."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T03:05:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E People play out of their Steam install directory to begin with?
