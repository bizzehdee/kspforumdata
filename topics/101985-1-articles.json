Even its lights can spark conflict (are they red or orange? lol.) It also has a massive amount of Delta-v in orbit. This amount has not been accurately measured yet, but it is somewhere in the 3-4km/s range. It can escape kerbol, with over 1.5km/s to spare.\n\n![5EU9Wto.png](http://i.imgur.com/5EU9Wto.png)\n\nIt comes unarmed, since everyone has their own tastes for weapons. Or maybe you don\u0027t want to use it for combat. Maybe you want to launch satellites with it. Maybe you want to put a crew cabin or some seats on it and use it for a rescue mission. \n\nIf you\u0027re wondering, it\u0027s also non-airhogging. Only two intakes per engine!\n\nI\u0027ll admit, it has three flaws. 1: it has a low thrust to weight ratio, but not extremely low, and it gets better when you burn fuel. 2: its safety parachute is a bit dodgy, but should save at least some of the plane. 3: it has 65 parts, which is a tiny bit much, but come on, look how awesome and exotic it looks!\n\n![tpOhnwR.png](http://i.imgur.com/tpOhnwR.png)\n\nThat\u0027s all i have to say about this plane. I hope you like it!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T23:39:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by quasarrgames**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T02:26:59Z","Content":"I wanna craft file.
