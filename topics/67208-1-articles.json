Its one of the few areas i believe Humans just wont be able to do extremely efficiently. But there are some tips on getting close, or really close to your target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must remember a few things though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. atmospheric targets(kerbin) are MUCH harder than things in a vaccum(the mun). This is with or without parachutes, as you must take drag into account in slowing down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Design your Lander with human error in mind, such as not to little thrust where landing burns take to long. A wide base so you can land on a decent slope etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Bring enough fuel for human error. I over design a lot of my landers with extra fuel to account for my own flying errors. You can\u0027t stress this enough, as without fuel you have limited options in landing and could possible have it crash if you run out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow onto learning a method on landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how i land on the mun and its very procedural and not extremely efficient, but if you do it right you should be able to land very close to your target most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIll assume your already over the Mun, and have a target on the ground you want to land near.(such as a flag or a mun base)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIll also assume you are not in a high orbit, for instance near the edge of the Mun\u0027s SOI. I stay near 50km for my Mun orbits. Just keep a set distance with all your landings, so you don\u0027t have to account for changes when you want to land again. Ill also assume your target is close to the Equator and you don\u0027t need to change your orbit to compensate (that\u0027s another story!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.(quicksave) De-orbit around 90 degrees from your target, this should make your orbit an arc. Keep the Blue line PAST the target, so you \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ewould overshoot\u003C/span\u003E it if you did nothing else. If you haven\u0027t done so set your landing spot as a target if you can, you will use this reference later. You should have time to adjust this later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Make a node OVER your targeted landing zone. Its not an exact science, just get it close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Pull retrograde and make your orbit a near line, i try not to make it a complete line as the Retro and Pro get mixed up and it can be a pain to deal with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. \u003Cstrong\u003ETake note of your burn time, time to Node and ending altitude of the node above the target\u003C/strong\u003E. Here on out is more on the situation presented after you have completed the previous steps. If you are extremely high above the target, like 20km for example, you may want to retrograde now and lower your orbit. If its very very low, you may want to do the opposite. Its better to be safe than cutting it close, its ok if you are high up rather than lower than your target...(your dead) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Now you should be nearing the time to Node next to the NavBall. Here is where things get a little hairy. You should have enough time to node to do the burn. You have a few options, unlike a transfer or an orbital insertion burn where you try to get half the DV before and after the node, you can do it all BEFORE or BETWEEN the node. It is more upon your personal judgement. Just remember your height of the node, it should give you an idea of when the ground is coming up when your doing the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. focus your retro burn near the \u003Cstrong\u003EHORIZON\u003C/strong\u003E. You can aim directly for the retro, or the Node. But your using the Node more as a guide, not a direct path to land. Your goal here is to bring your Retrograde to the TOP of the navball (white point at the top of the blue side of the navball). Aiming for the Horizon will kill your Horizontal velocity before your vertical. So the Retrograde should move tward the top of the Navball, and you start falling straight down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. You should be going only down to the surface with time to prepare yourself for landing. Depending on how well you did the previous steps depends on how roughly close you are. If you are above the target, goodjob! If your not (your probably not on top of it lol) your going to have to do some \u0022flying\u0022 to get closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7B\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E. If your \u0022close\u0022\u003C/span\u003E(close depends on how much fuel you have left to use to get closer, if your cutting it close you may not want to do this.)but want to get closer, use your reference to the target (you selected it on step one) and point your ship toward it while firing some retrograde. You will slow down some, but want to increase your Horizontal toward the target. Think of a helicopter flying to something. Try keep your ship from descending to fast. Reference your map if you want to make a further journey and use the Blue line as a reference to where your going. This \u0022flying\u0022 part is based mainly off experience and your lander design. Just keep a safe altitude as you glide toward your target, take your time in getting closer. This is where the \u0022human error\u0022 fuel comes in, along with flying it conservatively (burst your engines enough to keep you moving, without flingin yourself around in some direction to fast.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your close enough to it, slow your horizontal(think of a helicopter stopping to hover) and prepare for vertical decent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your REALLY far off, is suggest reloading from orbit and trying again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. So you should be above where you want to land and you can take if from here. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoodluck!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-30T09:13:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2014 09:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MKI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T09:06:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eand yes, some spare fuel is always a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(and another important tip is remember to SWITCH YOUR SPEED DISPLAY TO SURFACE MODE)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daniu","CreatedById":74039,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T09:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eyekonn\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eyekonn\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.

Quicksave will save your game right where you are. Quickload will go back to where ever you last quicksaved. So if you want lots of practice landing, get your lander into a good orbit right before you\u0027re ready to practice. Then quicksave. Now you can practice multiple landings at different approach styles without having send multiple new missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-30T14:35:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2014 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T14:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy method is not the best, but you could always do it Scott Manley Style: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/38IYZUizX3E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E ~4:50\u003Cp\u003EI drop my Periapsis to 5 Km over my target on the Mun\u0027s surface by burning on the other side of the Mun. (A Maneuver node helps) You can change inclination when you are halfway to periapsis so the orbit passes over your target. Depending on your velocity and TWR, you will need to start burning earlier or later, so It\u0027s pretty much guess-and-test (at least with the first attempt on each ship). But you should be able to land withing 1000m, and within 200 if you get better.
