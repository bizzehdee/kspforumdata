Stage separation uses a series of charges and electronics that are integrated with the top of the stage. My copy of the Saturn V Flight Manual (Snowball Publishing) says this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ordnance for first plane separation consists of two exploding bridgewire (EBW) firing units, two EBW detonators, and one linear shaped charge (LSC) assembly, which includes the LSC (containing 25 grains per foot of RDX) with a detonator block on each end. The EBW firing units are installed on the S-IC/S-II interstage slightly below the S-II first separation plane. The leads of the EBW firing units are attached to the EBW detonators which are installed in the detonator blocks of the LSC assembly. The LSC detonator blocks are installed on adjustable mounts to provide for length variations of the LSC assembly and the circumferance tolerances of the interstage. The LSC is routed from the detonator blocks around the periphery of the interstage. The LSC is held in place by retaining clips and encased by covers which are secured by clips and sealed to environmentally protect the LSC.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP just lumps all this together into a single component called a decoupler, for convenience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T13:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, real rockets typically use explosive bolts, because they are the less failure-prone method of separating two parts that were previously meant to be firmy attached.
