It\u0027s a fully reusable personnel shuttle designed to take crews to and back from large Mun or Minmus bases. A small caveat: at the time of its design, I had no large Mun bases. Certainly no Minmus bases, of any size. So the ship waited, perfectly functional, but with no task at hand. Until now. After hearing that .21 would break saves, I realized I had an unprecedented tast at hand. I had 20 Kerbals scattered around the Kerbin system. 8 on or orbiting the Mun, and 12 in stations orbiting Kerbin. I had put them all there, but now I had to bring them back. What vehicle could I use for this task? I scoured my craft folder, looking for vehicles capable of performing at least some of the required rescues. Then I spotted the Munbus. I created a simple ascent stage and launched it off, after checking to make sure everything was there. Even after loosing one of its six booster columns, it made it to orbit. I set off immediately to rescue the Kerbals in my Munar research station. I had enough fuel to reach Munar orbit, dock with the station, and return to LKO. Heck, I probably could have done it five or six times before running out of fuel. After returning to LKO, I refueled, offloaded the station crew, and set off to test the Munbus\u0027s landing capabilities, rescuing the crew of my small temporary Mun base. I was able to rescue the crew and return to LKO, but by this time was running on fumes. I still need to offload the Munbus\u0027s crew and rescue the station crew, but now the hard part is done. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/zP5uO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s\u003C/a\u003E the an album of the station rescue, and I\u0027ll add a link to the Mun base rescue later tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oddbin","CreatedById":29110,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T20:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a nice munbus.
