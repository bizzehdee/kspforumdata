Meaning that once you accelerate a little, to the (apparent) max forward speed of the wheel, stepping on reverse (i.e. the S key) doesn\u0027t seem to slow down the vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Can the wheels be made only to apply force while the W/S keys are pressed, perhaps with a separate cruise control option?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think if the internal variables (the ones used in the code, I don\u0027t know, I just remember vaguely something Biotronic wrote about this) that need to scale with size can be identified, TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS definitions can be written that make various strengths scale appropriately (like suspension, motor power, etc.)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise they do actually work, though they don\u0027t seem very springy at all and their torque seems crazy, when tweakscaled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Additional thing that would be awesome, if you\u0027re happy to have suggestions, is to be able to alter the length of the gear so that tripod-style gear sticking out at an angle can be made longer, or nose gear shorter, to get level-ish footprint on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: I know.. sorry, just deal with it for now. There\u0027s not much I can do about it. Firespitter by itself automatically fixes that, but then my plugin rotates the wheel around on the other side to maintain symmetry, which negates this fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: I haven\u0027t done any intentional compatibility with Tweakscale. Attempting to scale it voids warranty. (I\u0027ll look into it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: As someone said before, that\u0027s the nature of the method used to limit max speed. Just use brakes to slow down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: I\u0027m not sure what you mean by this, but wheel motors are just intended for taxiing your plane around the landing site/ksc, not for long cruises..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tweakscale tip.
