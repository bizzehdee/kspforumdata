I ask because otherwise, the recovery value will be much lower, if it has to land on the other side of kerbin. But it looks like it certainly could SSTO... The optional docking module in the bay is a nice touch, BTW. Have you thought about changing the RCS system so you don\u0027t have low-temp parts exposed?
