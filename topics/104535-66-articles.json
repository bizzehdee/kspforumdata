I want to thank an3k and kcs123 for your help. I basically took all the mods out of my GameData folder and put in the IR 2.0.8 with the 2.0.5 parts in it. I tested it to make sure that it worked and it did. I then added my mods back two at a time. I did encounter however that the NearFutureElectrical would not load through when launching the game. It would freeze at the fissionreactors. I fixed this by removing the NearFutureElectical folder and will try to figure out what to do to fix it at a later date.
