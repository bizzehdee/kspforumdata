This combination is fairly tricky: manned craft are difficult to use for long duration missions, so you really want to get unmanned craft up into gear as soon as possible, but you also need to prepare for that by launching commsats to ensure you can control them. And launching these commsats is rather hard without fairings in the presence of both FAR and Deadly Reentry. So you have to get a lot of prerequisites checked early-on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy experiences so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It was quite a steep start.

I ended up having to scum some surface samples from KSC biomes, which I don\u0027t usually do, in order to progress thanks to the 50% science payout difficulty setting I locked in for myself. Not really a problem, just... unexpected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Took me quite a while to find and unlock fairings. They in fact too me longer than solar panels, batteries, communication antennas etc., and they were the thing that held me back from launching commsats the longest. Additionally, the prerequisites for the node with the 1.25m fairings already contains parts that require at least 2.5m fairings and rockets to launch properly, so that seems a little backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027m kind of missing small engines and tanks for my probes and commsats. I\u0027m already starting to see nodes with 3.75m parts in them, but I have not yet found any node containing any 0.625m tanks or engines. One of the early probe nodes had some tiny radial monopropellant engines from RLA, but unfortunately those are not serviceable because I only have 1.25m RCS tanks. If you attach things radially to those, they no longer fit into anything smaller than a 2.5m fairing. And considering that what I\u0027m actually trying to launch is a simple stayputnik with an antenna and some batteries and OX-STATs, a 2.5m rocket seems kind of overkill. So right now I\u0027m basically building satellites with LV-909s, where the engine weighs more than the entire rest of the satellite combined and has so much TWR that I\u0027m using the rightclick tweakable to throttle it down to 5% in order to be able to maneuver with any sort of precision. The tiniest available fuel tank still gives me more than 6 times the dV that I need, too, even with the comically overweight engine/tank, and forces me to use an expanded fairing instead of a standard one.
