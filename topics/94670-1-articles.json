R.I.P. to the many brave kerbals that perished trying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for what you originally wanted, tjsnh was right. Less is more. Duna is close enough you do not need LV-Ns to go there. Eve too. Jool is a place you may want to bring the NTRs on your return stage. The LKO departure can be done with chemical rockets if you so desire, but the nukes are generally a good idea for the return transfer. My suggestion is a) find an online transfer calculator to get the dV for the transfer, and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E grab kerbal engineer to see your dV per stage and available once you make orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding: for Duna, you need more dV than the Mun and about 3 times the TWR. LV909s and other vacuum engines work great in the rarified atmosphere. Bring lots of parachutes, especially drogues, and aim for lowlands if you can. Enough dV to go from Munar orbit to surface and back to LKO is enough dV for a Duna ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Dwarf","CreatedById":67709,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T05:28:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always found it best to keep things small and simple.

Leave during the correct window, try and get your encounter set up as early as possible, preferably while still in Kerbin orbit. I suggest setting your \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11322-Different-Conic-drawing-modes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Econic mode\u003C/a\u003E to zero in the config, so you can actually see you\u0027re encounter around the target planet. This really helps getting the encounter you want, it saves a lot of fuel adjusting the orbital plane later on, and it makes getting home easier. Burning for home from a polar orbit sucks. Once you get out there, you can save a lot of fuel by aerobraking around your target. This goes for coming home as well. You can also try using gravity assists, but they\u0027re finicky, and to be honest, I haven\u0027t mastered them yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, here are some handy tools for planning your interplanetary missions. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis one\u003C/a\u003E is an aerobraking calculator.

With these you don\u0027t have to be as exact. Once the planets are roughly in the right spot, burn when your ship is roughly where it says it should be.
