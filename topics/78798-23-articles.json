I\u0027d love to adapt some parts to act like that for my eventual bases. Where does SCANsat come in - is it just a secondary display? Are the concentration maps pngs overlaid onto the map SCANsat generates? Can the SCANsat parts scan for Karbonite as well?

I had trouble figuring out ORS when I used KSPI, I\u0027m still having trouble now. \u003Cp\u003EFrom what I understand: A planet doesn\u0027t run out of a resource, it just has different extraction rates in different places, a concentration of the resource but it\u0027s not depleted. There\u0027s a scanning dish that shows areas of high concentration as markers on the planet while in flight mode - there\u0027s aren\u0027t necessary for extraction to work, but they do speed it up. You land, you drill, you extract, you store. You can then convert it to LF/O or transport it elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy questions are - Does it follow the same fuel routing rules as Kethane (such as the direction of pipes to converters etc)? Is there a PartModule converter that I can adapt to convert Karbonite/LF/O to other things, such as to Oxygen for TAC or split it into Hydrogen and Karbon and then combine the Hydrogen and Oxygen to make Water for TAC? I\u0027d love to adapt some parts to act like that for my eventual bases. Where does SCANsat come in - is it just a secondary display? Are the concentration maps pngs overlaid onto the map SCANsat generates? Can the SCANsat parts scan for Karbonite as well? Does Karbonite even need to be scanned/mapped out or is it the concentration all over already known about from the start and the scanner just toggles the markers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking forward to trying this - I\u0027ve removed Kethane from my install (haven\u0027t reached a point where I can use it in my career mode yet) and am eagerly awaiting a usable release (I know about the dev versions, but in like two days, already the stock scanner is deprecated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a standard KSP generator with the slight change that the generators are turned off if I see you have no space for what you are about to convert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModule wise, just steal the converter and the Karbonite part module and go crazy, have fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCANSat is a secondary display - I need to set up a part to be a scanner for SCANSat.
