It should be able to land on minmus, refuel by mining, and then get to about anywhere in the solar system. All the while it should be\u00A0able to carry cargo the size/weigh of a Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tank, or about 40/45 tones, to all the science that would not need a permanent station or orbit such as asteroid spotting, the cargo is for carrying that.

Flight path is tricky, since I was struggling to get the plane over 900 m/s at 21 km. But using an ascend profile based on accelerating and rapid climbing I could still reach orbit.

I also replaced the rapiers with aero spikes but maintained the overall number of engines. The aerospikes weigh only half as much and had an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of 340 in stead of 305 in vacuum without any (closed cycle) thrust loss. RAPIERS might be good for small planes but as\u00A0soon as you go into over 8 engines it might be worth while to look into ditching them for straight up whiplashes and aero spikes. I further managed to squeeze the contents of the science cargo bay in with the contents of the refueling and refinery cargo bay, saving me a cargo bay.

I also replaced the rapiers with aero spikes but maintained the overall number of engines. The aerospikes weigh only half as much and had an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of 340 in stead of 305 in vacuum without any (closed cycle) thrust loss. RAPIERS might be good for small planes but as\u00A0soon as you go into over 8 engines it might be worth while to look into ditching them for straight up whiplashes and aero spikes. I further managed to squeeze the contents of the science cargo bay in with the contents of the refueling and refinery cargo bay, saving me a cargo bay. I could add one or two more 2.5m fuel tanks to increase he amount of delta-V once out of atmo, but I spent enough time on this already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, I am quite happy with the end result:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/ucyDEAg.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00220b7Zrzt.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/0b7Zrzt.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood to see you\u0027ve had success.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The Whiplash engine hits peak thrust at mach 3 (about 900 m/s)\u00A0 \u00A0and declines to about half that by mach 4.5.\u00A0 \u00A0 Rapier Peaks at Mach 3.7 and is still giving 80% of peak power at mach 4.5,\u00A0 then it quickly falls off the boil.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The Whiplash\u0027s altitude characteristics are also less good.\u00A0 \u00A0Speedrun altitude on Whiplashes is about 17km vs 21km for RAPIER.\u00A0 \u00A0 I\u0027d have thought you should be able to get close to 1100 m/s on Whiplash ,\u00A0 was that in level flight?\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the Aerospikes kick on, I\u0027d say just maintain a pitch angle such that the nose is not more than 5 degrees above Prograde,\u00A0 as drag builds rapidly after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see I\u0027m a fan of\u00A0 combining RAPIERs and Panthers, but the differences aren\u0027t that large i suppose.\u00A0 \u00A0Also Whiplash make blue flames which look cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yes, the good old days of fretting over how much oxidizer to bring.\u00A0 \u00A0Not enough, won\u0027t make orbit.\u00A0 Too much,\u00A0 it becomes dead weight for the NERVs to drag around.\u00A0 \u00A0I think that\u0027s one reason why I nearly always go pure \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E these days.\u00A0 \u00A0 One fuel gauge,\u00A0 you\u0027ve either got gas or you haven\u0027t,\u00A0 simples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, looks like you got -\u00A0 \u00A04 nerv\u00A0 (12t),\u00A0 8 darts (8t) and 12 Whips (22t) - for\u00A0 a total engine mass just under 42t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d probably swap the mounts to triples and try with\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6 nerv, 6 rapier,\u00A0 6 panther ,\u00A0 for a total engine mass of 36t.\u00A0 \u00A0Rotate the Rapier mount 90 degree sideways so the inboard motor is inline with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and the outers are above and below, then set an action group so you can switch the inboard to close cycle\u00A0 while the outers stay AB,\u00A0 or vice cersa.\u00A0 If you want to share the craft file i\u0027ll have a play with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, with SSTOs efficiency seems to trump \u0022moar boosters\u0022,\u00A0 though i did attempt to build something different today and just \u0022go big\u0022, trying to get as many Kerbals in orbit as possible while keeping part count down.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 So,\u00A0 \u00A0the rocket engine is a Rhino our jets are Goliaths.\u00A0 \u00A0 Actually that wasn\u0027t enough jet, so i stuck on 4 whiplashes (wasn\u0027t going to be easy finding space for another pair of Goliaths).\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 OVer 400 tons gross, more than half of it fuel (despite the apparently small size of the tanks compared to fuselage),\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0I had to deal with unfamiliar problems, namely wings snapping off due to insufficient strutting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KWXUDGv.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KWXUDGv.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-18T19:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProtip: even if you follow a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E only design paradigm, use the \u0022not enough\u0022 oxidizer for some more kick at the start of anerobic flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdapters typically have oxidizer capacity and not using it messes with dry mass ratio.
