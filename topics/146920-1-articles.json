It overheated too much and it shut down. So i downloaded a simple PC GPU temprature detection program and i researched a bit of data about my GPU. Turns out my GPU can handle 105 degrees celsius. (It also took about 20 minutes to find out all the data i got here, just saying) The Maximum temprature i recorded is 103 degrees while playing, here is some more data:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-While starting at the space center: 89C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-While in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E: 93-96C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-While flying: 100C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-In map view: 97C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Minimum outside the game: 63C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Avarage Temp inside my room: 28C (pretty hot!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Temp outside: 23C (This means that the room temp is about 5C hotter than outside)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Max: 103C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm not a temprature specialist though.

The temperature isn\u0027t rising any higher only because your graphics card is automatically taking steps such as lowering the internal clock rate to reduce power consumption and heat output. There is a second thermal limit, probably a couple of degrees hotter, that if reached should cause the GPU to immediately shut down to prevent permanent damage (this usually only happens in cases like the GPU fan failing). While running computer hardware against the thermal limit should not cause any permanent damage that would cause the hardware to malfunction, you will cause the transistors on the circuit board to degrade much faster than normal, shortening the lifespan of your computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be clear, all computer hardware will eventually fail.

Fans failed or being blocked, dust caked into the heat sinks, a bad thermal paste job, whatever. Waiting for your room to be a little cooler isn\u0027t likely to help, since you don\u0027t know what the actual equilibrium temperature is now (since your computer is throttling to artificially lower it). Even if it is maxing out naturally at 103, cooler weather is only going to bring that down to what? 98?

When you first start a demanding program like KSP, preferable from a cold boot of the PC, if the temperature rises nearly instantly to an excessive value then it\u0027s poor contact between chip and heatsink, but if it rises somewhat slowly and also falls somewhat slowly when KSP is closed then the heatsink is in good contact with the chip so it soaks up the heat at first, but can\u0027t cool itself to the air properly so eventually it gets too hot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
