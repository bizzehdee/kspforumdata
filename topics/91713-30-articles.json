I\u0027m finding that even when wings aren\u0027t attached to the tail cargo ramp, if they\u0027re just near it (specifically near the top), and the cargo ramp has been opened and then closed, the wings are occluded and produce no lift. I\u0027ve been able to reliably reproduce this with both B9 procedural wings (how I first noticed it) and stock wings. I\u0027m use stock aerodynamics. At first I thought it might be related to the weird thing where when you have a closed tail ramp, and switch focus away to something else (KSC, another craft, etc), and then switch focus back, with the craft in question leaving physics range, the tail ramp is magically open and needs to be \u0022opened\u0022 again and then closed, but I\u0027ve been able to determine that this happens even if you only open and then close the ramp, without doing anything else. And when those rear wings are occluded, they produce no lift (of course), which leads to Bad Things. Opening the ramp while in flight results in the rear wings once again producing lift. The wings in each case are not attached to the tail ramp--they\u0027re attached to vertical wing pieces that are either attached to other wings, or to the cargo section to the fore of the tail ramp. Not sure what can be done about it, or if this is something that will pretty much always be a problem and I just shouldn\u0027t have rear over-craft wings sitting so close to the fuselage.

The good news is that erroneous wing occlusion does also happen with entirely stock parts.

From what I understand of Harvester\u0027s explanation of the new cargo bay occlusion, parts whose centroids are within the spheroid enclosing the bay are considered, and if the part centroid (the visual center of the part, unrelated to part mass or density) lies within the bay (computed by raycasting--if the ray from the centroid to the cargo bay centroid hits a wall or a trigger, it\u0027s outside the bay), then it\u0027s occluded. So either somehow the tail ramp centroid is being computed in a weird way, or, more likely, the raycasting computation isn\u0027t detecting the wall of the tail ramp for parts that are close enough to the bay. With the stock parts, it seems that the centroid actually has to have a chance of ending up on the other side of the bay wall (for wings--intakes and engines don\u0027t have to be so close). Not so with the Mk IV tail ramp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI experimented a bit more (as shown below), to see at what point the occlusion goes away, and it is related to the distance from the tail ramp. If I give a bit more clearance, the wing parts on the edges are not occluded, but the central one, which is closer, is still occluded. If I give a lot more clearance, as I did with the B9 wings, then the wings work fine. So for whatever reason, the maximum distance at which a part centroid is computed to be within the cargo bay is, for this part, further than the edge of the cargo bay. So it seems that while the occlusion bug is a stock bug, there might be something wonky going on with the Mk IV tail ramp that\u0027s making the problem worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Juuuj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
