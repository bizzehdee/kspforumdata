Even when I load the craft, it starts moving backwards, but it stops when the engine starts and is put at full thrust. But when I try to land the plane and stop, it begins to go into reverse again. I turned off the reverse movement in the wheels, but it didn\u0027t stop. Starting the engine doesn\u0027t do anything, nor does braking, only an annoyingly loud noise. What could be the issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xt007","CreatedById":197003,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-24T12:32:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHad the same issue, partially solved with installing ksp recall and kspwheels.\u00A0 Of course my luck I still can\u0027t get anything but basic rovers to behave except in a bone stock install.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-24T19:11:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not post in the firespitter thread? where a lot more people who use the mod will likely see this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso you will have to provide much more information for any real help.\u00A0 Especially things like ya know, KSP version, mod version etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
