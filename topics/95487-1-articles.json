Because I am cannot rebalance the parts themselves, \u003Cstrong\u003Esome overall balance issues will exist putting them into a drastically different tree\u003C/strong\u003E. There are a number of areas of the tree that could be much improved with changes (and additions) to parts. Also, I am unable to change the money cost to get specific parts (only science cost for its node). However, I didn\u0027t want to let the perfect stand in the way of the good -- and I really believe that this tree will provide a very rewarding career option for those who chafe a bit at the stock tree\u0027s tendency to force a certain development approach. I certainly plan to update this tree with future modifications to parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECurrently it seems that the R\u0026amp;D facility\u0027s level puts a very simplistic limit on tree progress by way of thresholds on the science cost of nodes. Because my node costs are going to be drastically lower and more varied (one part per node generally rather than many), this approach is incompatible. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis means that currently the R\u0026amp;D facility level will essentially put few limitations on your tree progress. \u003C/strong\u003E(I would be very happy if TechManager or KSP itself included a way in the tech tree config file to simply specify the required R\u0026amp;D facility level in each node directly.)For now, I have put some labelled dummy nodes into the tree that will visually show you the divisions between the three R\u0026amp;D facility levels. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf you want to play honest, make sure you pay to upgrade your R\u0026amp;D facility before you unlock any parts beyond these lines.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhile I have populated real science costs for the nodes thorughout this tree, this is really only a best-effort attempt with no real playtesting. However the overall costs and scaling with tier level should be roughly sensible. But I am very open to feedback on science cost balancing (especially if your feedback is more than just \u0022this one part is way too low/high!\u0022). Currently what I do is rate each part on a 1-4 scale of relative costliness. Then I have a script that automatically applies a multiplier to R\u0026amp;D tier 1, 2, and 3 nodes to generate the actual costs. Currently the scales are 5, 25, and 200 respectively. So a part with a rating of 3 in tier 2 would have a science cost of 3*25=75. Keep this system in mind when suggesting changes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBecause the tree is so much larger than stock, it may be a little confusing when you first open it up. Zoom all the way out and scroll to the left to see the starting parts which should look like this:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ghUgwDc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ghUgwDc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason there are those dangling nodes to the right is because, again, I can\u0027t lock out parts based on R\u0026amp;D facility level and those are intended to be prerequisiteless nodes, once you\u0027ve reached tier 2 or 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you research the initial \u0022free\u0022 (in science) nodes, it should look like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rKM1eol.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rKM1eol.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, here is the complete tree (unless you want to be surprised):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rP2kaAo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rP2kaAo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, here is the diagram I put together of how the new tree would be laid out, which I have 95% stuck with in the BlueSky tree:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5PKkHI3.png\u0022 alt=\u00225PKkHI3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy and hope to hear feedback from people as they play through careers using it!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-14T04:49:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2015 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sherkaner\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETree release\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Baythan","CreatedById":18815,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T09:02:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn regards to your question on the other thread, I\u0027d say descending is a good way to set things up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T09:08:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAm I understanding correctly that the canvas is wider than it is tall?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sherkaner","CreatedById":130303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T18:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.

The perlscript I have now (which I\u0027ll post below) will let you move the whole array around pretty freely. But you will want to get the node spacing accurate by entering round numbers directly into the coordinate fields in TED once you roughly have your layout and linkages. KSP won\u0027t draw a straight horizontal line between two nodes unless their coordinates are exactly lined up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Tahoma;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#232323;\u0022\u003EWhen you\u0027re done, save the file off to a TechManager .cfg file, then open it up in a text editor where you\u0027ll need to do a few things by hand:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAt the top of the fie, change the \u0022id\u0022 and \u0022name\u0022 to something descriptive for your tree. \u0022id\u0022 is what will show up in-game via TechManager\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFor each node, change the \u0022techID\u0022 to be the same as the \u0022name\u0022 you created in TED.
