The main tri-coupler is the one in the center. In default view, it is the leftmost leg at the back. The bug is a little difficult to recreate, since the chance only presents itself for a split second. If you fail once, move the mouse cursor away then try again. You should be able to do this after a few tries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, to install tanks to the main tri-coupler, simply launch the unfinished spacecraft, abort the launch, and return to the vehicle assembly screen. You will notice that you now have the capability to add to the main tri-coupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anybody has difficulty following this guide, just download the spacecraft here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=549.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=549.0\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand modify it to your liking.
