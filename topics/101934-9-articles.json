I\u0027ve gotten wind that the stock contract progression in 1.1 is going to draw even more heavily from the ideas in this pack than 1.02 did when Squad first expanded the stock progression contracts. As a result, this pack is being re-designed to avoid duplicate contracts and overlapping objectives. I\u0027ve already started this work, and have expanded the types of contracts included (still in testing) to include unmanned missile tests, more Sun/Kerbol related contracts, rovers, and a few other things. I\u0027m also changing the prerequisites for the contracts so that they are objective/progression based instead of simply relying on earlier contracts having been completed. For example, they will require 500 science has been earned, or the player has escaped Kerbin\u0027s SOI, before being offered.\n\nThis is being done in conjunction with my Soviet and NASA career mode overhaul mods (in my sig), but there will be a stand-alone release without the Sov/US \u0022themes\u0022.  \n\nWhen released post 1.1 , the pack will be re-named to \u0022Additional Progression Contracts\u0022 and I\u0027ll be starting a new forum thread (and linking to it here)."},{"CreatedByName":"Noobton","CreatedById":114094,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-25T20:20:39Z","Content":"I had a send 2 Kerbals to orbit mission, but when I launched my space station the contract got assigned to it and it won\u0027t recognize new launches, so is asking me to launch my space station."},{"CreatedByName":"Markush100","CreatedById":159964,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T22:02:24Z","Content":"[@tjsnh](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/108021-tjsnh/)\n\n~~Please add another link.~~\n\nNevermind, installed through CKAN.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-30T22:07:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2016 10:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Markush100**"},{"CreatedByName":"Markush100","CreatedById":159964,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T21:00:07Z","Content":"[@tjsnh](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/108021-tjsnh/)\n\nIs this supposed to be a bug or not:\n\nFor example, i finished a contract to send 2 kerbals in orbit. now, i get that same contract . i really like this mod pack but its really annoying."},{"CreatedByName":"tjsnh","CreatedById":108021,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T10:55:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, Markush100 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@tjsnh](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/108021-tjsnh/)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is this supposed to be a bug or not:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For example, i finished a contract to send 2 kerbals in orbit. now, i get that same contract . i really like this mod pack but its really annoying.\n\u003E \n\nSounds like a bug, normally you should only get 1 at a time.  \n\nI\u0027ll double check that all contracts are flagged correctly for that for the next release (which I\u0027m testing out now with the 1.1 prerelease)"},{"CreatedByName":"Markush100","CreatedById":159964,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T11:46:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 57 minutes ago, tjsnh said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sounds like a bug, normally you should only get 1 at a time.  \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll double check that all contracts are flagged correctly for that for the next release (which I\u0027m testing out now with the 1.1 prerelease)\n\u003E \n\nI think it may not be a bug.
