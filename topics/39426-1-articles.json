What you need to do is go to the folder where the game is installed and right click on the folder where the game is installed and click properties, then in the security tab click edit. highlight users (yourname-PC\\Users) then check allow for all permissions for Users except the Special permissions which is greyed out. Once done click ok then delete and reinstall mods. Windows 8 is a bit clunky with default permissions compared to 7 and blocks plugins in Program Files (x86) and all its sub directories by default.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-29T07:44:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2013 07:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by grovest4life\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
