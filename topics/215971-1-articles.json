Eventually at a far enough distance from Kerbin the issue gets fixed, and the terrain appears normal, but returns when the vessel gets close again. The terrain on the light side seems to be fine, but that could be that the problem isn\u0027t very noticeable on the light side. I\u0027ll attach a screenshot later when I get the chance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere also seems to be too much ambient light on the vessel, but I\u0027m pretty sure that is a separate issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Version\u003Cspan\u003E: \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E0.1.1.0 (Build ID: 10752762)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOS: \u003C/strong\u003EWindows 10\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECPU: \u003C/strong\u003EAMD Ryzen 5 3600 (12) @ 3.600GHz\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGPU: \u003C/strong\u003EAMD Radeon RX 6800 XT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HopelessSoap","CreatedById":165959,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-01T02:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay heres a screenshot:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AC1mlkG.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AC1mlkG.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit\u0027s hard to see the problem in this screenshot, but it is much more visible in game\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
