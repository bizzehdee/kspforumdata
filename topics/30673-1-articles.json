Let the aero braking kill off speed, inflate balloon to about 1% when your speed gets low enough, then just increase it slightly as you get lower to the ground. Lower the landing struts when your low enough, then just gently place it down with fine altitude adjustment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo take off, I\u0027d recommend letting mechjeb 2 set the launch profile. Turn start 45 km, final turn 85 km , orbit altitude 110km, turn shape 36.6% works. Inflate the balloon steadily, don\u0027t let buoyancy exceed 20 000, I\u0027d suggest lower until your out of the thickest atmosphere. Once there, punch buoyancy to max and let the inertia carry you to over 30 km up. Then, start your engines and wait until your over 42 km up, then set buoyancy to 0. Use manual control to help mechjeb 2 follow the nav beacons, as it may stray slightly.

If this was a real mission I could do this with my transfer vehicle from a far and have the transfer vehicle pull back up.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using air brakes mounted on the nose to make sure i point in the right direction because other wise I would spin out because of FAR and those landing legs when deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edoing a powered landing instead of parachute, just because I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch back into orbit. With these engines you would want to do a more horizontal launch because SABRE can use the atmosphere as propellant even if not as oxidizer. It wasn\u0027t as flat as I wanted for aerodynamic reasons, I risk loosing control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnded up with less fuel to spare than I hoped, couldn\u0027t get a 1m\u002B AP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ee2q0NT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ee2q0NT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sabre has an worse exploit than the 800m/s isp in vacuum.

Doing so makes a craft lighter, but allows about half as much dV worth of fuel in the same volume of tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
