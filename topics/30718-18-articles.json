According to Ordun, his team will have have the first stage superstructure ready for mating to the thrust assembly by tomorrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Works for me,\u0022 said Jeb, \u0022 I\u0027m never that happy leaving unfinished parts in the Tent anyway. That\u0027s good work from Ordun\u0027s gang too.\u0022 He paused. \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ordun\u0027s nickname for the warehouse,\u0022 said Wernher, \u0022He seems to think \u0027Vehicle Assembly Building\u0027 sounds better.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sighed. \u0022Why call a spade a spade when you could call it a Manual Earthmoving and Manipulation Tool\u0022, he said. \u0022Still, \u0027Vehicle Assembly Building\u0027 is one of his better names.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EVertical\u003C/em\u003E Assembly Building would be even better,\u0022 said Wernher wistfully. \u0022The Tent more or less worked for Project Moho but a proper hangar to build the Eve boosters in would really help.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb dropped the cables onto the back of the truck. \u0022One day,\u0022 he said, \u0022Maybe if Rockomax take up Genie\u0027s proposal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher thumbed the tail lift button. \u0022You really think they\u0027ll go for a Munar program?\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No idea,\u0022 said Jeb frankly, \u0022CORDS is going well but whether that\u0027ll be enough for Ademone\u0027s board?\u0022\u00A0He held up his hands. \u201CI have no idea.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022CORDS was worth doing whatever happens next,\u0022 said Wernher, scrambling up into the cab after Jeb. \u201CEspecially after Bob managed to persuade them to give us a spare docking adapter to test our prototypes against.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat was Bob?\u0022 said Ornie, \u201CI figured it was Gene sweet talking Ademone.\u0022\u00A0He pressed the starter button and the truck hummed into life. Gingerly, he pushed on the accelerator, one ear alert to any unexpected noises from the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb laughed. \u201CGene\u0027s a fair diplomat too but he\u0027s got nothing on Bob. I swear you could drop that kerbal into a meeting of the Twelve Pillars and he\u0027d come out an hour later telling you all about how President Chadwick hasn\u0027t seen his youngest for two weeks because he\u0027s been working late on a new bill, that President Enemone\u0027s been at a diplomatic conference in Wakira and she couldn\u0027t tell him much about it but it sounded stressful...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201Cand that it\u0027s Ambassador Aldwell\u0027s old mum\u0027s birthday next week and maybe we could wish her happy birthday from orbit if we happened to be flying at the time...\u0022 added Wernher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie steered around a large hummock of grass and started at a sudden rattle from the trailer. The truck rolled to a stop and he hopped out. Jeb and Wernher heard the grumbling wheeze of tailgate hydraulics followed by the tapping of boots on steel and a disgusted snort. The tailgate thumped shut and Ornie clambered back into the cab clutching a handful of cables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYours I believe,\u0022\u00A0he said acidly, passing the cables over to Jeb and starting up the truck again. For a moment, there was silence apart from the whine of electric motors and the rumble of wheels over turf. Then Ornie chuckled. \u201CAmbassador Aldwell\u0027s old mum,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CMaybe the \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E crew \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E give her a wave as they fly overhead.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf Bob gets to go, he could serenade her from orbit on Beauty,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBeauty?\u0022\u00A0said Ornie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHis lucky guitar,\u0022 said Jeb, \u201CAnd don\u0027t knock her,\u00A0Wernher - it was Beauty more than Bob that got us that docking adapter.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher raised his eyebrows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep - turns out that one of the Rockomax engineers - Hanbal I think his name was - is into the same kaya-scaring racket that Bob likes. Next thing I know, he\u0027s invited along to a lunchtime jam session and it\u0027s all we can do to get them back to work in the afternoon. Even then the conversation is one part rocket engineering to one part obscure music.\u0022\u00A0He shook his head. \u201CI\u0027m positive Bob makes half of those bands up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher smiled. \u201CThat sounds like Bob,\u0022 he agreed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s not the end of it,\u0022 said Jeb, \u201CThey gave him a tour of their factory floor - which was pretty impressive by the way - and Bob spots a tank valve on a workbench. I didn\u0027t catch what he said to Hanbal but it didn\u0027t seem to go down too well. So Bob just sets to work stripping down the valve. He picks out a couple of pieces and asks if he can rework them a little. I think Hanbal is getting curious now, so he tells Bob to go ahead. By the time Bob\u0027s switched off the mill, he\u0027s starting to attract a crowd, by the time he\u0027s rebuilt the valve, every engineer in the place is standing round his bench watching.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie pulled up at an intersection and waited for the road ahead to clear. \u201CI don\u0027t get it,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CYou\u0027re not tellin\u0027 me that a factory-full of engineers hadn\u0027t seen another engineer tweak a valve before?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course not,\u0022 said Jeb, \u201Cbut you\u0027re forgetting that Bob went up on the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E, which makes him a kerbonaut too - or close enough. I didn\u0027t ask but I got the impression that the Rockomax flight crews tend to keep to themselves. Having Bob turn up and start bending metal turned out to be quite the ice breaker.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027ve known pilots like that,\u0022 said Ornie. \u201CMost of \u0027em are just regular kerbals but there\u0027s always a handful that think they\u0027re a touch above the poor greasebuckets that actually build the planes. You run this place the right way, Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shrugged. \u201CI can see some sense in having a separate kerbonaut corps,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CI bet it makes organising the training a lot easier for one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI agree with Ornie,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked uncomfortable. \u201CIt does seem like the fairest way to do things,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CAnd speaking of which, that looked like Bob\u0027s car out the front. Time to go inside and select \u003Cem\u003Eour\u003C/em\u003E next kerbonauts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb stood by his office door, waste paper basket in one hand and surveyed the warehouse floor with pride. \u003Cem\u003EMaybe Ordun has a point. A spaceship parts company \u003C/em\u003Eshould\u003Cem\u003E have a Vehicle Assembly Building, rather than a plain old warehouse.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrdrie and Adelan were busy installing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters around the base of the \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E capsule. Through the open hatch Jeb could see Edsen perched on the edge of the centre couch sorting through a tangle of multicoloured cables. Lowise stood patiently by the opening holding a tray of tools, tags, cable ties and other assorted components and Jeb recognised a half assembled evaporator resting on a nearby bench.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ELooks like the forward thrusters are finished already. And all the space inside compared to the old\u003C/em\u003E Kerbal 1!\u003Cem\u003E or a \u003C/em\u003EMoho\u003Cem\u003E. Yeah, we\u0027re finally building an honest to Kerm\u003C/em\u003E spaceship \u003Cem\u003Ehere.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShowers of sparks filled the air at the other end of the warehouse as another team of kerbals put the finishing touches on a great skeletal cylinder. Fuel tanks, photovoltaic panels and an an entire LV909 engine were stacked neatly on the equipment racks behind it. Seelan and Wilford stood behind a long workbench, each assembling an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster block under Malmy\u0027s watchful eye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe elegant, gleaming Rockomax docking adaptor on its test stand took pride of place in the middle of the warehouse floor. A pair of steel rails led away from the stand and parked on the other end of the rails was, what looked to Jeb, very much like an old camera dolly with the distinctly less elegant bulk of the \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E docking port securely fixed to it\u0027s upper platform.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EDon\u0027t remember seeing that before. Wonder where we scrounged it up from. Actually, on second thoughts, I don\u0027t want to know.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill peered into an eyepiece set into the side of the docking port and delicately adjusted a crank handle. He nodded to himself, took a firm grip on the large lever poking out of the trolley next to him and gave the two kerbals standing behind it up a thumbs up. Straining against the weight, they rolled Bill and the docking port slowly down the track towards the waiting adaptor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb held his breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill applied the brakes with a brief squeal of metal on metal. The dolly crept down the rails towards its target and then, with a whisper of highly polished surfaces sliding past each other, the tapered probe protruding from the port slid smoothly into the adaptor. The rapid fire ripple-bang of docking latches slamming shut echoed around the warehouse, completely masking the gentle thump of wheels hitting chocks. Bill jumped off and joined the other two members of his team next to the adaptor. Try as they might, the three kerbals couldn\u0027t roll the dolly back up the tracks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cheer went up as Bill retrieved a portable gas cylinder and plugged it into the back of the port. He turned the valve and Jeb jumped at the sudden angry hissing roar that rattled the office window behind him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhat the...!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wall of metal rolling past his office window brought him back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOh right; just the damn sand blaster. That\u0027s a point though; better call the tank team in too.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe strolled over to the outside door and poked his head out. The two kerbals cleaning the enormous sections of fuel tank were too intent on their work to notice him. One of the kerbals helping to wheel out the next section of tank from the main engineering shed spotted him and waved. Jeb waited for the howling din of sand against aluminium to stop and went out to join them, still clutching his wastepaper basket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou folks ready to take a break?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust getting started, Jeb,\u0022 grumbled Seelan, \u201CWe were figuring on getting both these sections finished before the weather closed in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb squinted up at the sky. \u201CLooks like it\u0027s going to stay clear for a while yet,\u0022he said. He rattled the basket and grinned. \u201CYou \u003Cem\u003Esure\u003C/em\u003E you don\u0027t want to take a quick break?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeelan glanced down at the jumbled heap of folded paper scraps and her eyes lit up. \u201CWell why didn\u0027t you say so in the first place?\u0022 she said. \u201CWouldn\u0027t want to deprive any of the boys here of a chance to actually \u003Cem\u003Efly\u003C/em\u003E this machine they\u0027re cleaning up!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWouldn\u0027t want to deprive \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E either, boss,\u0022\u00A0replied Jeb. \u201CWhy don\u0027t you stow your gear and I\u0027ll see you inside in ten minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb glanced at the pressure gauge hanging from the \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E docking port and was pleased to see that both dials appeared to be holding steady. He jumped up onto a convenient workbench and waited, one eye fixed on his office door. One by one, the members of the Kerbin Interplanetary Society broke off from their work and drifted towards him. The older ones recognised the wastepaper basket and a buzz of anticipation swiftly spread around the vehicle assembly building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt last, the office door closed behind Seelan\u0027s team. Jeb surveyed the crowd and was relieved to see Bob and Geneney standing in a huddle with Wernher and Lucan. He cleared his throat and the room fell silent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy friends, the last time I stood here, we stood on the edge of new age for kerbalkind. We had just taken the first steps into space with the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal\u003C/em\u003E sub-orbital flights and the two \u003Cem\u003EKerbin\u003C/em\u003E satellites. Looking back they were small steps indeed but they gave us the confidence to embark on bigger and better things. We built new and powerful rockets and with them we launched the first ever kerbals into space - and brought them all home. We built the first ever kerbal-made object to orbit the M\u00FCn - and kerbals across the world watched it live on television!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo where do we go now? My friends - that I cannot tell. But I do know that we won\u0027t get there in a \u003Cem\u003EMoho\u003C/em\u003E capsule. Fortunately we\u0027re building something a lot bigger.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe basket in Jeb\u0027s hand shook slightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd once again we will need brave volunteers to fly our new ships. To be pilots for Project Eve.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney stared at the half assembled capsule whilst Jeb rattled through the details. \u003Cem\u003ENot that they\u0027re anything new but Kerm do they sound impressive when they\u0027re all rolled together. A three kerbal capsule with separate service module for long duration power and life support. Built in flight computer for guidance, navigation and burn control. Separate reaction control systems for on-orbit maneuvers and re-entry stabilisation. And a proper engine in the back for \u0027advanced orbital maneuvers.\u0027 \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA faint smile tugged at his lips. \u003Cem\u003EEven if the old showman carefully avoided any mention of\u003C/em\u003E where \u003Cem\u003E we plan to be orbiting. With specs like this though, I\u0027m sure most of them have worked that out already. Dammit but I hope Ademone can convince her Board! Plan B is fine as it goes but even with paying passengers to help the cashflow it\u0027s going to take a long time to build our own Kerbin departure stage, let alone a lander.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sudden hush broke Geneney\u0027s reverie. Jeb gave the basket one last shake, dipped his hand inside and pulled out a folded scrap of paper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe first pilot for the \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E flight is....

Although he\u0027s not looking terribly happy about it.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe second pilot for \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E is....

Wernher!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe propulsion team gathered round the chief engineer to celebrate but their initial exuberance was slowly replaced by uncomfortable silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOh.. dammit no!

And we\u0027d better re-plant it well away from other Groves too; we can\u0027t risk it attacking other Kerm.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s a long way upriver then,\u0022\u00A0said Jonburry. \u201CNot the best land for planting but better than leaving it here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKirman nodded. \u201CI\u0027ll go back and get another sample from near the sapling,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CJust in case it\u0027s not the Kerm and there \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E something toxic spilt there. Either way my report to the Ambassador will recommend that we move the sapling upriver.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonburry hooked the step counter back onto her belt and shivered as the gathering wind blew around her robes. \u201CSo will my report to the Envoy,\u0022\u00A0she said. \u201CLet\u0027s hurry up with that last sample, Kirman; I can smell rain coming.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerrigh plucked the muddy, fibrous fragment out of the hole and stood up grimly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCasing. Or what\u0027s left of it. That\u0027s no cutting, Obrett - this sapling grew from a seed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett sighed. \u201CIn a strange sort of way I\u0027m glad to hear that,\u0022\u00A0she said. \u201CAt least that old Keeper wasn\u0027t foolish enough to plant another sapling in his Grove.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u0022\u00A0said Gerrigh, \u201Cbut he did manage to miss a new Kerm seed sprouting here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTo be fair, it must have been buried somehow before it would germinate,\u0022\u00A0said Obrett. \u201CI\u0027d be astonished if it was planted deliberately. What \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E surprise me is that nobody spotted the new Kerm shoot before it was too late.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerrigh began kicking soil back into the hole around the Kerm stem. \u201CSo what happened here?\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CDid you manage to find anything in the Archives?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett ran her fingers through her hair. \u201CNothing helpful,\u0022\u00A0she said at last. \u201CThe older Records are hopeless - completely illegible where they haven\u0027t faded completely. A lot of stuff about the Law of Thirty-Seven of course but nothing to explain \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E the Law was written or what happens if it\u0027s broken.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerrigh stared around at the devastated fields full of sickly, dying crops. \u201CI think we just found out \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E happens,\u0022\u00A0he said bleakly. \u201CWhat we don\u0027t know is how.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe can guess,\u0022\u00A0said Obrett. \u201CLook at the zone of dead vegetation around the sapling - it\u0027s almost perfectly circular.\u0022\u00A0She gestured at the rest of the village. \u201CBut the rest of the damage is scattered all over. Almost like something exploded.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo on,\u0022\u00A0said Gerrigh intently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think the new Kerm triggered some kind of reaction from the Grove Kerm. Something that disrupted its control over the surrounding plants and caused them to die.\u0022\u00A0She blinked. \u201CIt sounds crazy but I think this circle is a Kerm battlefield.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd the explosion?\u0022\u00A0said Gerrigh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett shivered. \u201CThat was the end of the battle,\u0022\u00A0she said. \u201CRemember what the old Keeper kept saying Gerrigh; \u201CThe sparks are coming... they\u0027re still coming... they\u0027re going to kill us all...\u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerrigh looked at her in sudden horror. \u201CI\u0027ve no idea what the sparks are,\u0022\u00A0he said \u201Cbut if you\u0027re right then it sounds like that Keeper was in communion with his Kerm at the very end.\u0022\u00A0He blinked hard, \u201Cand died trying to defend it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett nodded solemnly. \u201CI think so too,\u0022\u00A0she said. She braced herself. \u201CI also think that one of us needs to try communing with it again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wind whistled mournfully through the abandoned village, stirring the weeds that peeped between every flagstone. Away from the fields, the Grove trees swayed against a steel grey sky. Most of the hut windows around them were shuttered but apart from the occasional creaking hinge, the village was unnervingly quiet. \u003Cem\u003EOf course it is\u003C/em\u003E, thought Obrett irritably, \u003Cem\u003EIt was evacuated not abandoned. You\u0027re just walking through an empty village not a ghost town.\u003C/em\u003E. Even so, the stark silhouette of the Kerm tree growing through the centre of the Keeper\u0027s hut, looked distinctly ominous set against the scudding clouds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerrigh lifted the latch and cautiously pushed the hut door open. The two kerbals stepped inside. Obrett sniffed at the air and sighed with relief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?\u0022\u00A0said Gerrigh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt smells clean in here. A bit stale and a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of cinnamon but nothing rotten.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerrigh nodded. \u201CI guess the medical team cleaned up the poor Keeper\u0027s hut before they left. Come on - lets get this over with.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe led the way out of the kitchen towards the sleeping room. He pushed the door open, coughing as the thick, cloying smell of Kerm leaves caught unpleasantly in the back of his throat, As far as he could tell, the tree looked normal. Its leaves were still but clean, unaffected by any of the assorted blights afflicting the crops outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett eyed the bed and waiting leaf cluster with trepidation. Gerrigh gave her a sympathetic look. \u201CI hate to say it,\u0022\u00A0he said softly, \u201Cbut if ever there was a job for a Keeper...\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe nodded, swallowed hard and walked over to the bed. She brushed her hair back from her scalp, closed her eyes and lay down under the leaves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerrigh bit his lip as he watched the leaves curl around Obrett\u0027s head. \u003Cem\u003ESo far so good - I think.\u003C/em\u003E Suddenly Obrett\u0027s knuckles tightened on the bed frame. Her feet twitched and Gerrigh heard her breathing go suddenly ragged. She held still for another couple of seconds before whipping her head free of the leaves and bolting for the door. Gerrigh winced at the loud retching noises filtering through the wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Obrett came back she was pale and shaking. Gerrigh slipped off his overjacket and draped it round her shoulders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCome on,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cwe can talk about this somewhere else.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in the kitchen, Obrett poured herself a mug of water and sat down at the table. She pulled Gerrigh\u0027s overjacket tightly around herself, took a long drink and looked up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe were right.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbout the battlefield?\u0022\u00A0said Gerrigh. \u201CSo... you managed to speak to the Kerm?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett shook her head. \u201CThat wasn\u0027t a Kerm, Gerrigh. I don\u0027t know what it was but it was ruined; smashed beyond healing or repair.\u0022\u00A0Her voice rose. \u201CI held on as long as I could but the fragments, oh sweet... the poor mangled fragments. And the voices - the unending torrent of voices!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett took a deep breath. \u201CSorry. Just give me a minute.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerrigh gulped his own water. His mug rattled as he put it down. \u201CSo what do we do?\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe salvage what we can from the village. Then we burn the entire Grove to the ground; branches, trunks, stumps, roots, fibres - everything. Then we plough the ashes into the soil.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerrigh\u0027s jaw dropped. \u201CYou can\u0027t be serious,\u0022\u00A0he said weakly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett wiped her eyes. \u201CNot yet,\u0022\u00A0she said. \u201CA better Keeper than me might be able to help but I doubt it. I think the only thing we can do is put whatever\u0027s trapped inside those trees out of its misery. Come on Gerrigh - I need to get out of here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two kerbals put their mugs on the draining rack, turned around and left. Gerrigh closed the door behind them, stopped and pulled a small paper packet of his pocket. He shook it and Obrett dipped her head in understanding. \u201COf course,\u0022\u00A0she murmured.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerrigh knelt and pushed his fingers into the soil, making a row of indentations next to the hut wall. He opened the packet and then stopped dead. \u003Cem\u003ENo point really.\u003C/em\u003E He closed the packet again and went back inside, emerging a moment later to join Obrett by the gate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo point planting sweetblossom vines in this soil,\u0022\u00A0he said briefly, \u201CI\u0027ve left them on the table. Whatever happens to this village and whoever is responsible for it - hopefully they\u0027ll understand.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSilently, they turned to face the hut, folded their hands together and bowed their heads in remembrance of the departed Keeper. Over their heads, the Kerm leaves rustled in the chill wind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe performance numbers are impressive Hanbal but are they realistic?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal rolled up his diagram and tapped it on the edge of his workbench. \u201CThey are,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CThe one big unknown is the plate assembly; most of the rest are scaled up versions of our current parts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe don\u0027t have a use for anything that size,\u0022\u00A0Ademone pointed out, \u201CEven if you can get it to work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal cocked an eyebrow at her. \u201CNot yet,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CNot until anyone needs to put any serious mass beyond \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. But if...when that day comes, Rockomax will be ready for them.

Pictures of the M\u00FCn and Kerbin from space adorned the walls and two glass fronted cabinets held a selection of carefully labelled spacecraft parts and assorted tools, including a large wrench mounted in pride of place. A small display screen rested on Ademone\u0027s desk, cables snaking down to the much larger data terminal on the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe display stand of old mortars and other fireworks, each conspicuously marked with the letters SFC in a bold jagged script, made an incongruous counter to all the high technology.
