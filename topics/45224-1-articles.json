The VAB and the SPH are the same thing, essentially the same system, just with a few different settings and visuals. You will likely note that, when you load a craft you\u0027ve made in the SPH, into the VAB, then edit it and save it, it \u003Cem\u003Edoes not become loadable from the VAB\u003C/em\u003E. Not the new, updated version. It gets saved into the same place it originated from, because that \u0022type\u0022 tag, SPH or VAB, is what gets decided when the craft is first created, and never again unless you change it.\u003Cp\u003EQuite simply, I would say, it is because this is never supposed to be an issue. Never \u003Cem\u003Emeant\u003C/em\u003E to be an issue. The subassembly system that we\u0027re getting officially in 0.22, and have had for a while with the Subassembly Manager plugin, is bridging the two construction buildings enough that you never really need to move .craft files. I really suggest you try out that plugin. It\u0027s a much better way than juggling and editing .craft files in Notepad. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T23:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Erelevent to this is that it would be nice to be able to click a button to switch between the 2 buildings without going to the space center and keeping the current craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
