I don\u0027t play with MCE, so I honestly have no idea what it will do. The only cost I reference is the part cost given by the stock game, not the total MCE cost (which is based on that with additional modifiers, such as for fuel). If you notice anything particularly weird, let me know, but like I said, I don\u0027t use MCE personally so the support is only fairly minor.

It has an empty mass of 0.5 tons so that\u0027s what I used for the mass and set the touchdown speed to just under 10 m/s. That\u0027s how I came up with the 8:1 drag:mass ratio.

I haven\u0027t been able to track anything down in particular that causes it to not work. Were you warping in the space center scene or tracking station? Or was it with a flight active (and what type, like a flag/landed ship or something in orbit where max timewarp can\u0027t be reached)? I suspect it\u0027s issues with something changing the current timewarp, which I then stop controlling it if something else takes over (for KAC compatibility). Though, does RSS change the default timewarp speeds? If it did, that might be the cause. (Checking out the source on GitHub and it looks like it does change the timewarp speeds.) If it goes too fast then it will overshoot, then it will just keep going and forget to stop. I thought I had done a workaround to kill all timewarp when a ship finishes, but I may have to go back and do a bit more work with it. It should work nicely in stock KSP or at least with stock timewarp settings. I\u0027ll try to fix it for next release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t currently know a way to rewrite what appears in that screen. Though I could maybe have it open a different window that I control to launch things from the proper storage (VAb storage for launchpad, etc). At the very least, I could have it open the current build list window to the right tab. That might be an easy change. Though it might be nice to have a separate window with the finished vessels as one tab and all saved ships in another (for simulations). Also, I\u0027m glad it forces you into simulation mode, that means that\u0027s working properly. I had forgotten to account for that for a little while so there was a time when you could launch from the pad directly for free. I ended up adding some code in to make it simulate instead, but couldn\u0027t test it (my test KSP has like 4 parts in it. It makes it not let me launch by clicking the launchpad for some reason).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad you appreciate my work!

If the game crashes (which happens a bit much when using your revert button or the start simulation one), the budget resets to the correct value, without even subtracting MCE\u0027s fee of 1k.

The game shouldn\u0027t really crash any more often than normal, as the function I use to revert is the same one KSP uses, but I\u0027ve made a few changes to how simulations work that should make it so even if the game crashes, things shouldn\u0027t get totally messed up (right now you\u0027ll end up with a free ship on the launchpad.

The build list needs a bit of GUI work and looks kinda goofy for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Simulations now create a backup save which is loaded when the simulation ends. This fixes issues with resuming the game after a crash and means you don\u0027t have to revert with my buttons anymore. If you go to the Space Center or Tracking Station, the simulation ends. Should work with MCE as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fixed a bug where you couldn\u0027t exit the VAB/SPH after adding a ship to the build list and pressing the New or Load buttons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the source is no longer included in the download as I am now hosting it on GitHub!

For example, a plane that takes 72 hours to build originally will take 7.2 hours to be ready for launch again. If this is too long, you can increase the effect that the inventory has on reducing the time by setting InventoryEffect = 100 to something higher in the KCT_TimeSettings.txt file (the square root will be how much it changes, so 100 means 10 times less, 400 means 20 times less, and 10000 means 100 times less).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
