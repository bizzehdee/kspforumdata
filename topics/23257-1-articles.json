The first mission would also validate human colonization technologies, such as being able to survive on the surface of Mars without resupply.

You would also need a heavy heatshield to land straight from interplanetary orbit. For a return mission, that would be 9.2 to get off Earth, 3.8 to get on a Mars transfer orbit, 1 to land on Mars, 4.1 to get into Mars orbit, 2.3 to get on an Earth transfer orbit, and 0 to land on Earth, for a total of 20.4 km/s. There are some savings possible on a return mission, such as leaving your Earth return vehicle in Mars orbit so you don\u0027t carry it to the surface and back, and ISRU would take care of the 4.1 km/s delta-v to get to Mars orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a one-way mission would be easier and cheaper, but not by much if you use some tricks for cheap return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v_budget#Delta-vs_between_Earth.2C_Moon_and_Mars\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esource\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-22T05:20:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2013 05:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by metaphor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holo","CreatedById":39606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T05:50:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stochasty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stochasty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere\u0027s no point in going if you\u0027re only going to turn around and come right back.

That\u0027s one reason I don\u0027t like Mars One\u0027s plan for Mars settlement. We need to perfect 3D printing and other advanced manufacturing techniques before we send people on a one-way trip to Mars, so that the settlement can be self-sufficient and is not entirely dependent on resupply. Mars has an abundance of raw materials which can be used to build things with the right tools, including shelters and eventually return rockets for transport to the Earth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil we have that technology developed, we should do missions that return.

You can use the CO2 atmosphere of Mars to make liquid oxygen.

This is an actual technology that\u0027s been demonstrated (been around since the 1800s), and not new-age far-future nonsense like VASIMIR or space elevators \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Joe\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
