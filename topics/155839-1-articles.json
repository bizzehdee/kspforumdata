Do you want to flyby Jool, orbit it or crash into it? In any cases, seriously consider gravity assists, they are extremely simple in the Jool system, very satisfying to do and a lot more efficient than anything else (aerobraking usually requires you to haul a large heatshield to Jool). If you\u0027re going to dive in Jool/Laythe anyway, then just aim straight for the atmosphere (but be careful with heat on atmospheric entry).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolar panels are fine if you don\u0027t intend to use lots of electricity. As long as you don\u0027t try to run a science lab 24/7, drill, refine or have hundreds of reaction wheels on your craft, a pair of Gigantors should be more than enough for anything. RTGs are not powerful, but lighter than big panels, so if you only send a small probe, it\u0027s the best choice. Finally, fuel cells are what you need if you intend to power some big things, usually the best when paired with a refinery because you actually create the fuel they use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-31T20:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder most circumstances, a Tylo/Laythe Grav Assist (depends on which one is easier to hit) \u002B Jool Aerobrake if needed after is my preferred entry method.\u00A0 Particularly with the new overheating, it gives you more room for error during the aerobrake and you don\u0027t have to go as deep.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can get away with a decent solar panels if you\u0027re not doing anything intensive, like orbital/ground research MPLs or mining.\u00A0 Probes will be fine with a pair of 1x6\u0027s, just put them in hibernation during warp (advanced tweakables).\u00A0 If you\u0027re mining, you\u0027ll want Fuel Cells for sanity purposes, but you can get away with a monstrous solar array if you wanted to.

I\u0027m not entirely sure if that\u2019s still the case, but it used to be that even grazing Jool\u2019s atmo at interplanetary speeds would mean instant death. Plus, Tylo and Laythe have enough gravity to let you capture without the need to even touch Jool. I\u2019m sure there are fancy ways to set up your gravity assists, but honestly what I do is, once I have a Jool encounter, I set up a mid-course correction burn (at around Duna\u2019s orbit) and just fiddle around with the maneuver node until I get a Tylo or Laythe encounter that will capture me. It\u2019s fairly easy to do from far away since it takes only small burns to move around your Jool trajectory all over the system until you find a point that gives you the encounter. Just remember the rule of thumb tat passing in front = slowing down and passing behind = speeding up, and the closer your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E is the larger the effect. You\u2019ll end up with a highly eccentric orbit that will pass through most of the moons\u2019 orbits, so once you\u2019re captured its easy to set up a second assist to further lower yourself around Jool.
