I have a base set up that has light towers scattered about, but manually turning them off at sunrise, and on again at sunset is becoming a hassle. If there\u0027s a mod that can automate this for me, it would be great. I\u0027ve taken a glance at the mod list on the add on release page, and I didn\u0027t notice right off the bat one which would do something like this. If someone could point me in the right direction, I\u0027d appreciate it.
