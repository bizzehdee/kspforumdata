The black ones are better statisticswise, yes - but they are not so much my style at the moment. The point is, they are really really thin. Somehow I can\u0027t imagine them processing high amounts of cooling fluid from a big reactor through them. But this is just my inner Mister Monk in me, nothing you should care about. Somehow I feel, they could get some love graphical modellingwise, but this really really really low priority and not worth complaining. Right now they are a bit like black two-dimensional rectangular surfaces. I struggle a little bit in using them in a astetical pleasing way. But you asked for thoughts on HC. Maybe some more great shapes for the black ones (graphene) would do the trick. Maybe something curved?! In terms of great shapes I think of the great job, you did on NF solar (e.g. the sirius panel or the curved NIV-75-R (I love this shape!). This thin material of the black graphene ones whispers \u0022Do some nice shapes with us\u0022. :-) But with all that said, it\u0027s just very very low priority....\n\nJust my two cents...
