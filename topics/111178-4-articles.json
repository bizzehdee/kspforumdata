I play on a Mac (sometimes that causes problems) and I saw there was a new update to KSP, 1.0.4. I updated then installed this mod for the first time. I loaded up the game and it didn\u0027t work so I read through this forum and found what I did wrong and fixed it. I loaded the game again then went to the contract building and saw the V2 contract so I knew the mod was working. I went to the VAB to build a rocket and all the part catagories had disappeared. I tried restarting the game but still all my parts are in one long category in the VAB. I know I don\u0027t have the real solar system version installed and I know I don\u0027t have those Module Manager folders that need to be deleted. I can\u0027t think of anything else that could have caused this. The categories were working fine until I fixed my installation error which was putting the Contract_Pack_Historic_Missions-1 folder into GameData instead of the contracts pack one (which is inside the previously mentioned folder). How could this tiny change create such a large problem with something completely unrelated? If anyone has any ideas please tell me.

I think I neglected these since I personally think the reputation system is somewhat broken (I have never managed to reach 100% rep ever, being hung at 99%). But I will make the necessary edits possibly this afternoon to balance out the contracts a bit more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried to bind some contracts to specific ships (and I believe these work with the later STS missions) but some earlier and later ones may not have this in place, I will be editing the missions for Cassini, Voyager, New Horizons etc. so that these are \u0027failable\u0027: in the respect that they would only be repeatable after a LONG time once failed. I see what you mean about the Luna impacts (some contracts such as those of the Ranger program; I have excluded since their real life counterparts failed to complete their mission). The only issue here is that with the way contract configurator manages progressing contracts, to complete one the former (if stated) must be completed otherwise the contracts would appear out of order. (E.g, Although some of the Mariner missions failed I thought it easier to include all just so that you do not suddenly jump from Mariner 2 to Mariner 10). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBalancing is varied across the pack, (only with Science and Funds at the moment). I based the funds rewards on the funds cost of a vessel that would be required (e.g I based the STS fund costs and rewards on the type of missions (cargo or science) and these were done using about 1.2x the cost of the shuttle (using the CSS shuttle as a model). Of course with some Soyuz missions (since there are literally 80 of them) the funds steadily decrease as time goes on since funds will be accumulated with other active missions (Such as Venera or Vega). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did want to lock missions so that a Soviet/Russian mission must not be concurrent with a Nasa mission (especially early on) and I may well change this but for this testing stage (since I doubt anyone has even got 1/4 through the pack yet!) I did not want a bug in one mission to completely derail the whole pack preventing progression. (e.g a bug in Soyuz-21 would only cause issues for future Russian missions (Mir, Salyut), this bug would then only affect the other contract programs at for example STS-63 the first Shuttle Mir mission) This gives me time to fix the bug and allows everyone to keep playing in the meantime; although since most of the Early missions have been debugged now I will adjust the order of the Mercury and Vostoks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maculator","CreatedById":122127,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs is said before im really happy with this pack a little balancing would be nice but if not its stil one of my favorites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI disabld almost all of the stock contracts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(only one reward modified asteroid, one rescue with the exeption of solar rescue, one satelite with the exeption of solar orbit are available for me at once.
