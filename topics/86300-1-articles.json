The short cargo bay is still 2 to 3 times larger than I would need for monoprop, sas, and a battery based on existing part depths. With the existing SP\u002B I can fit all of that in the small cargo bay and still have at least half of it left, if not more since I don\u0027t add SAS to my planes unless they are huge and would have a cargo bay.
