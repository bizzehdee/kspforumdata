Well not a mod per say but it\u0027s a custom part and it has a lot of functionality. In a nutshell I am trying to create Space-X\u0027s Starship. I have created the model etc but I am stumped on the config for it and how to create the functionality I want. I want to have soundFX on a door animation, I want to have deployable landing legs from inside the spaceship(3D Model created), I want to have the wings on the side move for turning etc. And I want to add custom engines and SFX and VFX in general. This is the first time I have created a mod and I can\u0027t seem to find any more in depth documentation online so if anyone knows about the internals and how it works then please help me out. I have moderate experience with blender and C#.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-26T00:26:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your looking for documentation on the config files I haven\u0027t see any recent stuff - usually the best source is to look at Squads parts and see how they did them. I like to make a test part and copy a Squad cfg then tweak until I get what I\u0027m looking for. That\u0027s probably not the answer you were looking for but it\u0027s only way I\u0027ve found.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
