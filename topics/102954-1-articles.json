After successfully building a turret, chassis, and armoured hull, I set about configuring my control groups. It then occurred to me that it would be a heck of a lot easier (at least for the user) if BDA used IR\u0027s rotating parts to turn the turret instead of assigning clunky keybindings. I don\u0027t know if this is possible, but if somebody managed to do something like this (say, add a turret ring that turns to follow the mouse) I know of at least two people that would be very very grateful.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me during the construction of my tank was the lack of small pieces of armour (I am limited to M-beam 650\u0027s, M-beam 200\u0027s, and the two different types of panels). Due to the lack of part diversity my designs are quite a bit larger than intended and have very simple shapes (I\u0027m going for a T-90 look, but can\u0027t make the turret correctly). If someone could throw together a bunch of small (1/4 the size of the existing M-1x1 Panel) squares and rectangles and triangles that would be awesome too.\n\nSome suggested shapes (assume the M-1x1 is 1 unit by 1 unit): A 0.5x1 rectangle, a 0.5x0.5 square, a 1x1 triangle, a 1x0.5 triangle, and a 0.5x0.5 triangle.\n\nI also had some (tank themed) suggestions for BDA: \n\n**Weapons:**\n\n.50 cal M2 remote gun system\n\n.50 cal or 7.62mm coaxial MG\n\nAn ATGM style missile launcher\n\nMore \u0027Radial\u0027 cannons (Eg: 155mm smoothbore cannon, Royal Ordnance L7, the list goes on..)\n\nLighter \u0027Radial\u0027 mounted weapons, like the M242 Bushmaster\n\n**Defences:**\n\nSmoke Grenade Launchers\n\nA Trophy System (basically a really tiny CIWS with short range, capable of shooting down missiles)\n\n**Eye Candy/Utility:**\n\nCameras to be used alongside the main gun of a tank, as well as a camera for the commander\n\nAmmunition boxes for all ammunitions\n\nFake ERA panels\n\nI could go on and on.. but I won\u0027t. I think you get the idea. If someone makes this happen that would be amazing. Thanks in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T08:17:23Z","Content":"Have you looked \u0022Parts by other members\u0022 section of BDA page?
