After successfully building a turret, chassis, and armoured hull, I set about configuring my control groups. It then occurred to me that it would be a heck of a lot easier (at least for the user) if BDA used IR\u0027s rotating parts to turn the turret instead of assigning clunky keybindings. I don\u0027t know if this is possible, but if somebody managed to do something like this (say, add a turret ring that turns to follow the mouse) I know of at least two people that would be very very grateful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that bothered me during the construction of my tank was the lack of small pieces of armour (I am limited to M-beam 650\u0027s, M-beam 200\u0027s, and the two different types of panels). Due to the lack of part diversity my designs are quite a bit larger than intended and have very simple shapes (I\u0027m going for a T-90 look, but can\u0027t make the turret correctly). If someone could throw together a bunch of small (1/4 the size of the existing M-1x1 Panel) squares and rectangles and triangles that would be awesome too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome suggested shapes (assume the M-1x1 is 1 unit by 1 unit): A 0.5x1 rectangle, a 0.5x0.5 square, a 1x1 triangle, a 1x0.5 triangle, and a 0.5x0.5 triangle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had some (tank themed) suggestions for BDA: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWeapons:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.50 cal M2 remote gun system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.50 cal or 7.62mm coaxial MG\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn ATGM style missile launcher\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore \u0027Radial\u0027 cannons (Eg: 155mm smoothbore cannon, Royal Ordnance L7, the list goes on..)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELighter \u0027Radial\u0027 mounted weapons, like the M242 Bushmaster\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDefences:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmoke Grenade Launchers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Trophy System (basically a really tiny CIWS with short range, capable of shooting down missiles)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEye Candy/Utility:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECameras to be used alongside the main gun of a tank, as well as a camera for the commander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmmunition boxes for all ammunitions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFake ERA panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could go on and on.. but I won\u0027t.
