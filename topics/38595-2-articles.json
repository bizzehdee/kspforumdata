The old SAS part added additional torque and would use that torque to try and stabilize the craft, mainly stopping rotation. The old ASAS would do the same thing but used control surfaces and RCS instead of torque, so it was more effective at stabilizing the craft through pitch, yaw, and roll. But it would never hold your heading. If you disagree get in an orbit and point prograde and toggle the SAS/ASAS on, you will notice that your ship will rotate and within half an orbit or so and you will be pointing retrograde.
