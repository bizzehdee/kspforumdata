Now after a bit over a year I got a new laptop which can hopefully withstand the forces that my huge lunar bases put on it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut before that I need to be able to launch \u0026amp; get myself out of the air. Well that\u0027s not the problem, heck getting into an orbit might be doable with the basic launch pad size. But what I can\u0027t understand is the simple landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust dropping the standard mk1 command, a hammer engine \u0026amp; a simple mk16 parachute from a altitude of (say) 30km, in quite steep orbit (flight path would put me in a \u0022parabole\u0022 around 50km of kerbal base).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens each time is the same: the \u0022module\u0022 locks itself in a head-first trajectory around 10km altitude. Then when finally aerodynamics go away the part is at a height of ~5km above ground, moving at a speed of 300-400 m/s. If I then open the parachute it instantly rips off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how do you guys do this? How to successfully bring back larger craft? Is the key stability (making sure the parachute is not in the front of the aircraft), or is the key speed (making sure even non leaving/sub orbitals have a very shallow angle \u0026amp; a very low density so the drag is huge compare to the mass). I don\u0027t particularly look forward to constantly have to manage opening parachutes at exactly the right altitude and speed....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T13:28:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need a fairly shallow re entry profile. The idea is to burn off excess speed in the upper atmosphere- sounding rocket trajectories (to nip out of the atmosphere for early science) are difficult to bring back in one piece. You can\u0027t get away with deploying the parachute and letting them open whenever they want with the new aero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor larger craft, try using drogue chutes before deploying the main chutes.

You have that heavy command pod in front, whereas the booster trailing behind is super light after it\u0027s exhausted its fuel, so it acts like tailfins and keeps you pointing forwards. That\u0027s great for launch, but on re-entry it means that you get \u0022locked\u0022 nose-first, which in turn means you\u0027re too streamlined so you\u0027re still going super fast when you get down low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few ways around this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne is FlyingPete\u0027s excellent advice about following a shallower reentry curve, and also using drogue chutes. The regular chutes have to be under 250 m/s, but drogues can go up to around 500 m/s so you can use those first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to reduce the aero stability. For example, put a stack decoupler in between the command pod and the booster, so you can jettison the booster when you\u0027re done with it. That will get rid of the problem of being locked nose-first, so the pod can torque itself around to be butt-first. It will therefore be much less streamlined and will slow itself down to under 250 m/s, at which point you can use the regular Mk16.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, are you running that Hammer at full power? A Hammer with just a command pod should be able to get you up to over 60km, not just 30-- as long as you run it at lower throttle. At full power, it\u0027s way overpowered for a ship of that size, so you end up going too fast too low and waste most of your fuel fighting drag. In the VAB, you can right-click on the booster and set the thrust limiter to something lower than its default 100%.

Do you have liquid-fuel engines unlocked yet? That will make it easier to fly butt-first without getting locked nose-first on reentry, since you have that heavy engine on the back of your rocket. Plus you can save a smidgeon of reserve fuel to slow yourself down before impact, if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Do you have any reaction wheels unlocked? Adding some torque to your craft could allow you to muscle it off of that locked nose-first attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Do you have a pilot at level 1 yet? If so, you can turn on SAS to \u0022hold surface retrograde\u0022 when you\u0027re up at the peak of your trajectory. It may be able to hold you butt-first as long as the aero forces don\u0027t get too big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Do try adjusting the thrust of the Hammer down to a level appropriate for your ship mass-- you\u0027ll get a lot more bang for your buck, which means not only can you go higher, but it also gives you more wiggle room for choosing your trajectory (e.g. launching with a bigger horizontal component so you can enter at a shallower angle, as FlyingPete suggests).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Right","CreatedById":80269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T23:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having trouble replicating you\u0027re problem.
