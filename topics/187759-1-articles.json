So if you forget to move it back to 0.0, it\u0027ll start from wherever it was when you left the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. It will seem like your craft is \u0022forgetting\u0022 to perform the actions before the start point.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know, like I said, really obvious. But if you aren\u0027t thinking about it, it seems like something is wrong with the parts in the sequence rather than the sequence itself. Just wanted to share, hopefully someone else won\u0027t make the same silly mistake!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
