Since then, I have uninstalled all my mods, HyperEdit \u0026 Asteroid Day (which are both up-to-date), uninstalled KSP, cleaned up all debris and repaired all damaged buildings, and yet it still happens. Also, clicking on \u0022Space Station\u0022 does absolutely nothing. Strange thing is, I\u0027ve also tried to force it to go somewhere, I\u0027ve totally destroyed my vehicles and killed my kerbals, but nothing shows up. No report saying \u0022Catastrophic Failure!\u0022 and nothing giving me the option to revert flight or return to the space station/vab or hangar. It just stood there, the game wasn\u0027t frozen, everything was still going on as if nothing happened. Clicking also didn\u0027t force the menu to appear. Attached is a picture of the revert flight menu. Plz help\n\n![212?cb=20150807175719](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/jacob-herzog/images/b/bb/Screen_Shot_2015-08-07_at_1.46.51_PM.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/212?cb=20150807175719)\n\nIf it helps, not sure how, here is a link to the player log\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4S4W9ZdgMbPN2xrMkRtTGYxdW12QTBySnpkRFBuTzA1ZVFN/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4S4W9ZdgMbPN2xrMkRtTGYxdW12QTBySnpkRFBuTzA1ZVFN/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T20:37:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 08:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BedrockPerson**"},{"CreatedByName":"BedrockPerson","CreatedById":149448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T22:15:55Z","Content":"Starting a new save seemed to work, but still open to a solution"}]}
