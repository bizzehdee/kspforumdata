My Kerbal isn\u0027t present because... he investigated The Arch! Apparently yes there\u0027s an invisible death wall. My theory which the unmanned station is now monitoring, is that this Arch will later on be some kind of wormhole teleporter. It\u0027s big enough to fit a large craft through it and instantly kills anything that touches it currently even at low speeds. No mission is currently planned to rescue him from wherever he went.

That much leeway really helps keep me from running out or running into a big mission-ending problem. Some of it might be due to the \u0022Fuel Bug\u0022 but hopefully most of it isn\u0027t. My standard lander often has enough fuel to get to Minimus, Mun, and then back with much to spare. Payload missions generally have enough to land and leave too.

It\u0027s a little weirdness that seemed to show up in .16, and a lot of us are having trouble with it. Although I generally don\u0027t like to mess with mods, the HSTW cart is just invaluable for making rovers. Building a rocket around it can be a little tricky, but all you have to do is stick a capsule on top of it and you\u0027ve got a tough, steerable vehicle with which to explore worlds.
