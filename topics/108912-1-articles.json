What would be better is if those investigation contracts were slightly changed such that instead of four points we had a region to investigate, and there was a small part to actually find. That way we could use rovers to drive around a small distance like less than 10 km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T16:22:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cephalo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cephalo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre rovers just for fun, or are they the best way to do something?

The only way to avoid them there is if you\u0027re such a god at landing that you can drop your ship right on an up-turned docking port of the mining base. Otherwise, you need a big fuel tank on wheels to move fuel between the mining base and the thirsty ship that landed some distance away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor exploration or long-distance hauling, rovers work well at the places where it\u0027s physically very difficult or prohibitively expensive to fly around (whether with wings or rockets). IOW, places with reasonably smooth terrain, little or no atmosphere, and reasonably high gravity. So, rovers are good at Moho, Eve, Duna, Ike, Dres, Vall, Tylo, and Eeloo. Also Kerbin and Laythe but you can fly there so why bother (and Laythe\u0027s islands are so small you can\u0027t rove far anyway)? You can fly on Eve with the right mods, and Ike, Dres, and Vall are sort of borderline between using a rover or a hopper, but rovers still work reasonably well there. You can fly (after a fashion) at Duna even with stock, but it requires great ingenuity and careful execution--rovers are much easier and it\u0027s fun playing dunebuggy over an entire planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERovers are not particularly good for exploring on Mun due to all the craters causing frequent, long detours. Minmus and anything that size or smaller doesn\u0027t have enough gravity to really hold the wheels on the ground, so rovers are a pain and it\u0027s much easier just to hop around in a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T16:43:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m loving the \u0027Space Bus\u0027.

It also had engines attached (and a reaction wheel on each end for better control) which were blown off before that picture. They may not be obviously visible but it has some RCS engines pointing upwards used solely to provide some downforce while braking, it\u0027s a touch difficult to stop on Minmus otherwise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the album if you want a better look at the design.
