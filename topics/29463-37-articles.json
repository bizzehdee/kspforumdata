My build philosophy tends to be test a craft and err on the side of \u003Cem\u003Eremoving \u003C/em\u003Ethings when they fail or are struggling. So I tested this ship and its staging extensively, then not long before launching to Duna I removed a fuel tank from a lower stage without making any other changes to staging - so I didn\u0027t test that change beyond to look and make sure the engine was in the right place in the staging list. Well...apparently I \u003Cem\u003Ealso \u003C/em\u003Eremoved that fuel tank\u0027s decoupler and didn\u0027t notice it missing from the stage list.

I might not have had to use so much of my lander\u0027s fuel on orbit and landing if I\u0027d not carried so much dead weight the whole trip. I have enough fuel to enter Duna orbit easily, but not enough to return home. This knowledge disappoints me, despite the fact I was okay with possibly stranding those Kerbals.

I have never done this before, and to be honest I was nervous. I constructed an unmanned lander that would land, and have supplies for me to start linking up the pieces (I had KAS as a plugin). That went smoothly, and I landed in the southern part of the northern crater (mind=blown). Now I send up my manned lander, and it goes fine. The inclination change, blah blah. I initially landed within 1.1km of the first lander, and with plenty of fuel left, I started heading towards the other lander at a pace of about 0.4km per hop. Eventually, I had gotten within 50m of the unmanned lander and then disaster struck.
