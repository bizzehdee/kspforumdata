I was thinking of an \u0022easy\u0022 and intuitive way to do this.. despite some great efforts, the instructions out there are not friendly to the uninitiated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to see if I could mock up a part as a model in the VAB first, and then convert it to a welded part. I\u0027d like some help to understand this and develop a technique for us all to do it at our leisure. I can get models loaded in to the VAB as a single PART, but the orientation and attachment points are not correct. If this can be perfected, we would have a rather intuitive way to assemble and then weld these things!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://tny.cz/13468fe2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere is a model\u003C/a\u003E I saved that I want to fuse as one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, here is the mostly converted \u003Ca href=\u0022tny.cz/98e7dc05\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewelded part\u003C/a\u003E that has attachment point and orientation issues.
