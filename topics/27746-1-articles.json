However once the entire RTG has reached the heat of Eve which will still happen - think heat soak. You still have the radioactive source on the inside heating it, therefore the inside is still hotter than the outside. The real question though, is how much hotter can the outside be before you have to melt the inside to make any useful power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T18:20:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know the math behind this, but also consider how much less efficient the heat sinks are in a vaccume compared to inside an atmosphere, regardless of the air temperature. They don\u0027t magically make heat go away, they dissipate the heat by providing a larger surface area for outside particles to come into contact with it and absorb some of its thermal energy. In a vaccume there\u0027s nearly nothing to help with that process. A dense atmosphere like eve would be ideal for heat sink technology!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit; think of it this way.

The radioactive heat source would still maintain a temperature differential, thus an RTG would continue to function regardless of external temperatures. However, as he also said, the maximum limit will be the point where the components of the RTG start melting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd HoY. Heatsinks dissipate heat in two ways. Through convection to an outside medium(air/water etc) and radiantly. There are trade offs to both methods but I believe in space, heatsinks work better than you\u0027d think since there is nothing to insulate the IR output. Also in space, if that IR radiation isn\u0027t uniform, it will actually cause a slight propulsion to the craft.. This was finally figured out to be the cause of the anomalous slight acceleration forces that showed up in the voyager probes over time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T19:12:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI realized I forgot to mention the IR aspect but didn\u0027t bother adding that with another edit, Ty \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit, also tho it has no effect on gameplay there is sure to be air currents on eve, and wind chill factor should be counted too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-20T19:25:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2013 07:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by HoY\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
