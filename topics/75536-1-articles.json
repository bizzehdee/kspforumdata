Try googling for this stuff and it is impossible.... Looking to get some protective wall cushion padding like that in a space launch module on the walls.... even where to get the thick mesh net around it...

Help please?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T07:16:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe interior of the ISS is mostly covered with lockers and ISPR racks, plus various experiment equipment, not padding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://urbanfragment.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/interior-view-of-the-destiny-laboratory-on-the-international-space-station-iss-during-the-expedition-7-mission-nasa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022interior-view-of-the-destiny-laboratory-on-the-international-space-station-iss-during-the-expedition-7-mission-nasa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPadding is used inside Soyuz:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.capcomespace.net/dossiers/ISS/russie/soyouz%20consoles.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022soyouz%20consoles.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Apollo or the Shuttle didn\u0027t have any interior padding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
