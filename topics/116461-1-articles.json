The first one occurs when you launch a ship with a launch stability enhancer that is placed in such a way as to be off the launch pad at launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you do this, every x number of seconds, the LSE will spawn beside your ship and you will fly away from it very fast. However, if manage to keep your ship arrow straight, you will make it to orbit safely (the LSE likes to crash into your ship when it spawns, which makes the parts that contact it explode). After that, the interesting stuff starts to happen. If you switch to the LSE \u0027debris\u0027 that spawns, you will notice that it\u0027s orbital speed does not change, but it will be under constant .5g acceleration! Kerbin will slowly recede from you and you will eventually leave kerbins SOI. (good luck trying to timewarp, change vessels, or return to the space center.

I will try to mess around with the second one a little more, because mine was a bit different in that I did have a claw and I did use RCS, but the vessel that spontaneously deconstructed was the root part of the one that I undocked with, was under no more acceleration than that of the decoupling force, and the the non-physics 5x warp is what caused it to rip apart. The ship that I undocked was left intact, and it didn\u0027t matter which vessel I was flying, only the former ripped apart. A restart did fix the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn hindsight however, I do believe I used a 4x physics warp with a reusable lower stage during the same play session. That vessel did not have rcs capability or a claw. I will see if I can find a reliable way to trigger it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
