And when the risk of something happening is absolutely tiny, but the magnitude of that thing is beyond huge, the resulting product can still be something important to watch.

You know that none of the IPCC scientists believe this? It almost sounds like you are taking what you believe and making up data to agree with it.

Whether a risk is large, small or tiny is often not the most useful concept. What is useful is the concept of expected outcome, a term statisticians use. Expected outcome is the product of the magnitude of the risk multiplied by the magnitude of the outcome. And when the risk of something happening is absolutely tiny, but the magnitude of that thing is beyond huge, the resulting product can still be something important to watch.

Let me start by debunking Malthus, the person who came up with the equation that many use today to claim the world is overpopulated. Malthus never calculated into his equation a variable for technology. He did not see the use of GMOs, hydroponic farming techniques, the experimentation being done on edible lichens, plankton, and algae by American, Israeli, German and Swiss scientists, archologies, or synthetic meats. Hydroponic farming could essentially change farming landscape from its current horizontal model to a vertical one - think of a farm constructed like a parking garage with multiple levels. Archologies are self-sufficient structures which contain an entire community and because of its enclosed environment, could theoretically be constructed in any climate or on any body within the solar system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several factors that would keep humankind from achieving a billion year organism span and many of those factors is man himself. Our current use of technology has created some health obstacles - obesity, diabetes, etc., which are nature\u0027s way of trying to get our attention as a species. We also have a war-like violent tendency - and look at the number of KSP players that arm their vessels to the teeth with weaponry (not trying to offend:P). We also have the age-old problem of power - while many of us are \u0022live and let live\u0022, there are others that are not. It is for these reasons we see man\u0027s propensity for war. As a species, we would also need to have a common vision; man has the ability to do this and we have seen the results - the American space program in the 1950s through 1970s are a prime example. We would have to share the common vision of exporting humanity to the stars - space colonization - and begin within our own solar system. The Moon, larger asteroids, and Mars are just the beginning points of colonization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf humankind is going to be a species that lasts a billion years, then space colonization and the ability to create self-sustainable colonies on all types of planetary bodies are going to be two of the most important developments that will allow this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T11:48:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 11:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
