Other than that, hard surface is very likely needed, and abundances of heavier elements. While the truth today (or, as far as we can see), conditions like Earth are hard - most star systems are either lots of hot Jupiters, or lots of barren rocks and/or super-Earths ([source](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.06945v2.pdf)).

Right up until the last couple of centuries, the idea that we all had one origin would be met with a barrage of laughter, and anger.

Generations later, recorded history tells us we no longer had any idea we once had moved out. \n\nNow imagine human descendents on another planet 9,000,000,000 years from now. Any reason to think they will still remember the same way our ancestors forgot, to put it slightly Douglas Adams-y? Archaeology they can outright forget about seeing Earth ceased to exist almost 1000,000,000 years before when this one average star snuffed it, grew and evaporated Earth. What evidence will be left? Written evidence? Like Linear A, a written language noone can read anymore?

I feel like civilization is bound to collapse once industry can no longer sustain itself on a practical level. Unless we develop technology to deal with our need for our dwindling resources and deteriorating ecosystems, eventually the quality of life for a vast majority of Earth\u0027s population will be so poor that society will no longer have a need for it\u0027s government and anarchy will be the new world order. I don\u0027t think government will go away. It will operate in the backround seizing whichever it values and providing stability for the elite. But at that point corruption in the government will be unchecked and the very small percentage of people belonging to that system will be the only educated people left on earth capable of progressing humanity on a scientific level. They might be capable of colonization and planting the seeds of humanity on other planets, but seeing as the exploding population is earth\u0027s current most serious unchecked problem, there might not be a point to colonization once humanity is reduced to a state where the government no longer has omnipotent control over it\u0027s population.

Let me start by debunking Malthus, the person who came up with the equation that many use today to claim the world is overpopulated. Malthus never calculated into his equation a variable for technology. He did not see the use of GMOs, hydroponic farming techniques, the experimentation being done on edible lichens, plankton, and algae by American, Israeli, German and Swiss scientists, archologies, or synthetic meats. Hydroponic farming could essentially change farming landscape from its current horizontal model to a vertical one - think of a farm constructed like a parking garage with multiple levels. Archologies are self-sufficient structures which contain an entire community and because of its enclosed environment, could theoretically be constructed in any climate or on any body within the solar system. \n\nThere are several factors that would keep humankind from achieving a billion year organism span and many of those factors is man himself. Our current use of technology has created some health obstacles - obesity, diabetes, etc., which are nature\u0027s way of trying to get our attention as a species. We also have a war-like violent tendency - and look at the number of KSP players that arm their vessels to the teeth with weaponry (not trying to offend:P). We also have the age-old problem of power - while many of us are \u0022live and let live\u0022, there are others that are not. It is for these reasons we see man\u0027s propensity for war. As a species, we would also need to have a common vision; man has the ability to do this and we have seen the results - the American space program in the 1950s through 1970s are a prime example. We would have to share the common vision of exporting humanity to the stars - space colonization - and begin within our own solar system. The Moon, larger asteroids, and Mars are just the beginning points of colonization.\n\nIf humankind is going to be a species that lasts a billion years, then space colonization and the ability to create self-sustainable colonies on all types of planetary bodies are going to be two of the most important developments that will allow this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T11:48:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 11:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970**"}]}
