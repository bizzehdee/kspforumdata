Spending research points on specific parts can improve weight with advanced materials for example. Maybe each part has it\u0027s own tech tree that leads to advanced versions of it. Maybe you can pick a tech tree to go down, but once you start a tree for that part, you have to stick with it. So you can advance an engine to have more power, but as you increase the power it will tend to overheat more. Or a different tree for that engine, is less weight, but at the cost of slightly less power the more you advance it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of having to make a choice that will effect you down the road, and once it\u0027s made you can\u0027t undo it.
