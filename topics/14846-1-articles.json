But I was wondering what the numbers do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike \u0027dumb\u0027. Higher number = more or less dumb?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd \u0027brave\u0027: Same story. Higher is better? (Fairly certain about this one, though. Higher IS better.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, once we\\\u0027ve figured that out, is there a high cap for the numbers?
