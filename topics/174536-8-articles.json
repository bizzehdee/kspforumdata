It would be hard and expensive to do, and most certainly not in the near future, but they could theoretically reach nearly anywhere in to solar system in just 2 or more launches. Maybe its better to just stick with chemical fuels, but its just an idea, that\u0027s what this thread is for, after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s really difficult to make nuclear reactors plug-and-play, especially if we limit ourselves to those aft cargo bins. Aside from needing an angled shadow shield, you\u2019ll have major trouble disembarking if the reactor has been used recently (in the last century). Furthermore, keeping the reactor on a stick (which, BTW, is ultimately an option here) is nice because the surrounding vehicle structure would otherwise backscatter the radiation at the crew despite the\u00A0shadow shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadiators are even more of an issue, TBH, since they\u0027re another source of backscatter yet presumably they\u2019d also be mounted in the bins. A multimegawatt plant would need a whole damned lot of them, though - or operate at obscene temperatures for the entire trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBottom line is, space nuclear power and aerodynamic vehicles don\u2019t mesh well. Those huge flying girders are much handier, which makes the overall ITS concept ultimately handicapped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-14T07:59:33Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2018 07:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by DDE\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-14T09:48:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA long stick is an advantage for a military interplanetary space ship.
