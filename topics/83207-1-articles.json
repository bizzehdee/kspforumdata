The HUD is still visible but shows no information. After the screen is black I can switch back to Space Center but the display stays black. I can end the game normally via menue. Reloading the save is only possible after I have restarted KSP. Than it functions again but the affected vessel and a random number of other vessels have vanished. If I load a quicksave from before the error it is reproducible. Switching to the craft via tracking station or map mode makes no difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe output_log.txt: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://justpaste.it/gvak\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://justpaste.it/gvak\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to my search this looks like the bug described as the \u0022Hell Kraken\u0022. But as far as I found this bug normally appears during EVA operations. But I have no EVA ongoing. Probably this will be the same issue, but maybe this helps to determine the root cause, as it seems to be a slightly different situation to experience it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-29T08:14:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2014 08:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Heimdall5008\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T02:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease follow the instructions in the sticky.

I once had an install where I had to send two or three missions every time I wanted to go to another planet, since the Hell Kraken ate most of them. No, not hyperbole. And those ships had very little in common. On the other hand, I\u0027ve never had a Hell Kraken attack on my current install, so I\u0027m quite puzzled as to why it happens.
