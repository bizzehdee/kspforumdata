I don\u2019t drive for safety reasons and being on the Autism/Asperger\u2019s spectrum. I know a friend can be anyone but I really don\u2019t feel comfortable being friends with people who only date if you have a drivers license or not. I also know people don\u2019t like chauffeuring people around all the time but there\u2019 is public transportation and rideshare fo a reason. I just don\u2019t feel comfortable with people like that just want to be around real and genuine people.\u00A0Anyone have similar issues?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-29T09:16:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2023 09:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Cloakedwand72\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-29T09:39:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever had that particular issue. My advice is: if any potential partner would judge you for not having a license to drive (your reason for not having one is 100% reasonable and valid) should likely be avoided romantically as they are likely toxic. I would say they should be regarded with a healthy dose of caution if considering them for even just as friends. I hope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n033801292023\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-29T10:18:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDate the road police officers.
