RLA feels softer and a bit more cartoony than even the stock parts. Near Future Propulsion is a bit sleeker and shiny, but in a retrofuture kind of way. Atomic Age is particularly odd. The artist Porkjet made the existing stock parts to fit in with the Kerbal style, but somehow he has his own distinct style, a bit more subtle than stock parts, and with some things like 2D textures of camera-holes which might be modeled in directly by another modeler. It\u0027s in Porkjet\u0027s own style, and since his parts are in-game stock, they are by definition stockalike. Stock eXTension obviously does it quite well, because it in fact steals textures from stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I think that you lose part of the stockalike feel if you know you can group together a set of parts to a particular mod. So having just a few niche parts is more stockalike to me, simply because it doesn\u0027t really expand much upon what the game has. Small things like SXT\u0027s 2.5m Cargo Bays or the Mk3 Fuselage end cargo bay thing; or something to that end. The best ever stockalike mod was Kerbal Stock Parts eXtension. Most of it\u0027s parts were placed in stock and Claira Lyrae\u0027s work on KSPX and NovaSilisko\u0027s work on the stock parts are nearly indistiguishable. Add to that the fact that now KSPX has so few parts to add anymore, and it makes it even a bit better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact about the stock aesthetic about how SLS parts and Spaceplane parts look more advanced than the other parts makes sense when you consider tech progression.

It is defined by a few things. First, it is depicting modern pieces of technology like engines and electric equipment, built fairly competently and cleanly, with slight exaggeration of proportions. Second, it usually ignores too small high-frequency detail in favor of nice bulky minimal shapes. Third, it favors hand-painted detail and solid fills instead of gritty photo-sourced textures, and is using a particular color palette of grays, browns and whites, with occasional accents in other colors. It\u0027s a very consistent style, and it works well, fitting the characters and the world together.\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not Kerbal?\u003C/strong\u003E *shrug* For some reason some people like to think Kerbals are sloppy engineers only capable of producing inherently broken designs held together by duct tape. To them, proposing something prim and proper like a NASA VAB could be built by Kerbals is ridiculous. Well, I disagree. Take a good look at the parts: at the LV-N engine, at 3-man pod, at the landing legs, at ion engine. Those are cleanly executed pieces of impressive technology. Kerbals are indifferent to safety precautions and are very excited about explosions, yes, but they make an impression of extremely capable and very competent engineers. Sure, we know they probably turned a construction crane into a vomit carousel or raced on bulldozers in the process, but I don\u0027t doubt for one second they can build buildings similar to real ones, and I don\u0027t think it would be out of character for them. Plenty of other stuff like engines is fairly close to how our human rockets look.
