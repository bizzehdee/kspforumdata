I can\u0027t have KSP installed to my program files folder, something with permissions effects adding mods. I changed my install location for KSP and MechJeb is working.

I was in a 25km circular orbit, picked a kethane spot right round the other side of the planet to give MJ thinking time and set it to auto land. I could see it was going to plant it into the surface but in the interests of science I just sat back and watched. It crashed into the side of a hillock at 154m/s. The prediction was dancing all over the place, is it the new surface contours throwing it off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso getting to minmus is causing MJ headaches and it seems to be worse when the Mun is close to the orbital path taken. I\u0027m just plotting my own nodes and letting MJ execute them.
