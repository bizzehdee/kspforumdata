So I thought I could add some of my ideas I had about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course as one of those \u0022realism-related\u0022 suggestions there\u0027s a question if we really need increased difficulty in the form of difference between ecliptic and equatorial planes. My opinion on it is, the difference is not that big to become serious obstacle for players and it might improve on the fact that a lot of players are clearly too addicted to equatorial orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is of course the problem: current perfect alignment of Kerbin\u0027s rotational axis with Mun\u0027s orbital plane makes it easier for newbies to get to orbit and visit some other (atmosphere-free) body before they learn how to use more complex maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on the other hand, even for newbies Minmus is the easier target than Mun because of its low gravity. So for newbies it\u0027s now either go to Mun with its higher gravity and fuel demands, or go to Minmus with its inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy proposal is:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- implement support for axial tilt into the game (obviously)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- give Kerbin some axial tilt, say 10-15 degrees\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- put Minmus in orbit lying exactly in Kerbin\u0027s equatorial plane. That will give newbies their easy target, despite the fact that it is more distant\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- give Mun orbit some (slight) tilt so there\u0027s not an eclipse every few days (it is fun the first few times but then it turns to great annoyance whenever you run anything with solar cells; it will be more fun if it will be rarer)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- for simplicity, leave Sun and Jool\u0027s axial tilt at zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- change other bodies\u0027 tilt suitably\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- navball should always follow axial tilt of the SOI\u0027s central body (i.e. North should point in the body\u0027s North direction etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- map view should be always in the system\u0027s ecliptic plane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it would mean that to go interplanetary, you\u0027ll need to learn to launch to the ecliptic plane rather than to equatorial plane.

You can still launch in the equatorial plane, which would not change compared to the current game. It would be different if KSC would not be placed on the equator, but I suspect that this will still be the case. Once in Orbit, adjusting the orbit to ecliptic plane by not thrusting exactly prograde does not cost much more dV. The difficulty is not that much harder.
