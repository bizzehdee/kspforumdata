I agree it does, but it got me thinking, could I make a podracer type vehicle in KSP. So here you are, this is just my concept test, and I am going to make more I hope, I want to try and make one that at least has the pod or engines hovering, but we will see. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideo:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_KSRNDnlhrk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will travel up to about 100m/s happily, any faster, well watch the video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstructions to get it off pad:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse E to rotate it and then tap W a few times to set it down, when going down the KSP ramp, make sure you hold W while thrusting until off the ramp.
