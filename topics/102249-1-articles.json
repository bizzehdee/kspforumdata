(We can look at the way Jupiter\u0027s moons orbit it to find the mass of \u003Cem\u003EJupiter\u003C/em\u003E, but because the masses of the moons are much smaller, they don\u0027t have a big effect on Jupiter\u0027s motion...so we don\u0027t get the moons\u0027 masses that way.) You can look at the way the Jovian moons tug at each other, and the way they pull at our spacecraft during flybys of the moons, to get good measurements of the masses of the moons. We also get very accurate measures of the moons\u0027 diameters from the space probes, so we can get accurate volumes for them.
