I have no intentions of adding new parts or anything like that to the game.\n\nSo as a starter project to get a decent overview of things, I was thinking of maybe modifying the stats of Kerbals based on in-game events and parameters.\n\nNow, I\u0027ve been glancing through the community [API documentation](http://anatid.github.io/XML-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API/index.html), but so far I haven\u0027t been able to locate any direct way of accessing the Kerbals stats.\n\nGoogle have been pretty unfruitful too. \n\nIf anyone could point me in the right direction on this, that would be really nice.\n\nPs: My main bulk of programming experience comes from C\u002B\u002B, I haven\u0027t really used C# before. So if you know about any potential pitfalls I may run into in that regard I would also appreciate it if you mentioned those as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T21:11:52Z","Content":"List crew = vessel.GetVesselCrew(); // a list of all kerbals on the vessel (for the active vessel, replace  with )Debug.Log(crew[0].courage); // print the courage value of the first crew member in the list\n\nIs that what you were after?"},{"CreatedByName":"Evianil","CreatedById":146527,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T13:38:45Z","Content":"Possibly, I\u0027ll investigate that further.
