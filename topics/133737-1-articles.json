I dicided to leave this number alone for now. Also understand this value is for Hydrogen, which molecular size is small and light but as a consequence, is much less dense that KSP High Isp propellant Xenon. If you consider that Xenon only give 12.34% of the Isp of Hydrogen Isp,The\u00A011213s \u00A0 Isp actualy realy low. as using Xenon as a propellant would only produce 1383s which is is only 33% of Ksp Ion engine @ 4200s. Considering this a fair Isp should be\u00A0\u00A011213s / 0.33 = 34035s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand other soursces likw on Wikipedia mention a maximum exhaust speed of\u00A0 110 km/s which would translate in to 110.000 / 9.81 = 11213s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotie that hydrogen beside being lower density, requires bulky tanks,also require low temperature cryogenic storage, which cost a lot of power at earth distance from the sun. HYdrogen also has the nasty happit of escaping though the tank wals, precisely because of its small molecular size. Despite this, it would be usefull for long range mission past the astroid belt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of balance reason, KSPI MPD has very high power tillarance for it engine. This will allow you get get meaningfull thrust provider you have sufficient power. In relsity they are much more limited in power, causing you to crete only newtons of thrust instead of kilo newtons. Relaisitcly this would mean that any mission with such engine will require a long time. Now that doesn\u0027t mean they aren\u0027t usefull. For some mission like unmaanded tankes they are technically ideal as they can afford to spend year enroute. For Manned mission on the otherhands, MPD are often too slow. Trips longer than a 2 years are simply unacceptable due to a range of problems. So it\u0027s much more likely they use nuclear propulsion for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-09T10:13:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2016 10:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rushligh","CreatedById":31038,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T23:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSPI Ammonium seems to be the most potent propellant (at lease if you have your engines scaled up)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou\u0027ll notice however that these engines require a lot of electric charge... as in the charge of a small plant. until we master making micro-fusion power plants, that technology won\u0027t be applicable IRL any time soon.\u003Cbr\u003E\nalso, heat. all the thermals... to much heat...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
