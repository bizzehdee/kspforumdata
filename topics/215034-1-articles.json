For example, by default control pods are placed with their windows facing away from the camera in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E but when they are launched, the windows are facing towards the default launch camera.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can make building ships somewhat confusing and I need to keep remembering that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E is inverted when I am placing things like boosters on a shuttle style craft, otherwise I might place them on the wrong side. Before I realized what was happening, this also lead to me to thinking the controls were somehow inverted and accidentally launching a ship to the west rather than to the east, because I rotated the cockpit in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to face me like it does on launch, which of course resulted in the ship being turned 180 degrees when I actually launched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E should load in with the camera a the ship wall rather than the space plane wall to match the default launch camera direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
