In reality, there is ground control, and onboard computer control. Using something like KER is giving you access to info in the game that would be available to the pilots in real life.

It adds so much life to KSP! Just watched the video and I am amazed how did it fit into my vision. I guess that can even mean that it is possible to save my derelict by adding some struts and if moving the nukes around is not possible I may try some controlled collisions, removing them and replacing with the Nukex4 version ones , attaching them with magnetic connection. Just to reduce part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KAS alone opens up a whole new universe of possibilities for me.
