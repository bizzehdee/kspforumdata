I would love to do some kind of DangIt integration, I wouldn\u0027t even know where to start though.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E One thing I have noticed, and not sure if you addressed it already. Last week I noticed that Crew Rotation contracts don\u0027t actually require you to rotate any crew. I docked with the required number of Kerbals, then undocked and it was waiting on me to return them home. Not sure if that\u0027s just something that isn\u0027t possible to test for in CC, or if it\u0027s a bug you fixed recently.\n\nIt\u0027s not a bug it\u0027s a feature. It\u0027s basically a throwback to the old (non expression based) way of doing things. There is a way I can target specific kerbals to come home, but I haven\u0027t really tried it yet. I\u0027m hoping to get it working for a cool new mission. At the moment though, I just want things basically working in 2.0.\n\nOn that subject....\n\nYou may have noticed that development has been... slow to say the least recently, with not many new missions being added. The main reason for this, is that when I first started this pack, I wasn\u0027t very good at this, so basically copy/pasted most of it from the CC wiki (usage notes and all). This made it difficult to change anything as I couldn\u0027t really see what was going on at each line.\n\nTHEN I introduced Mun and Minmus stations. This tripled my workload. Mistakes happened (especially when I forgot to copy things over to all the other contracts for other bodies). the last 10 or so pages of this thread are testament to that. I\u0027d like to thank you all for bearing with me.\n\nFrom an end user point of view, not much is going to change. All the old contracts are still there, all of the features (basically) work. What you MAY notice, is that contracts will now reference your vessel by name, and that they will generate much more often. However, trust me when I say that this has been a lot of work, basically the whole system has been completely overhauled, and brought kicking and screaming up to date. It\u0027s cleaner, leaner and (hopefully) better.\n\nNew features are coming I promise, but for now I just wanted to get everything working with the new code base.\n\nWithout further ado:\n\n**Kerbin Space Station 2.0 Released!**\n\n**Make sure you have no active KSS contracts before upgrading. Do a full delete/reinstall or things will go wrong.**\n\n**Contract Changes**\n\n Each body no longer has it\u0027s own set of contracts. Instead one contract is used for all Maintenance missions. The target station will be selected based on certain criteria being met. (Usually that it has some crew).\n\n Maintenance contracts will now reference your target station by name. (this is the \u0022friendly name\u0022 you give your craft in KSP. So don\u0027t confuse yourself by calling them all \u0022Station Core\u0022 like I do.)\n\n Station Science Compatibility fixed (thanks tito13kfm and BlackSoldierB)\n\n ScienceExperimentModule now works (thanks Mister Spock)\n\n Station Core Docking Port will no longer appear in the VAB (thanks - whoever suggested it - sorry you\u0027ve dropped off my list. Let me know and I\u0027ll credit you properly).\n\n Contracts will now generate much more often.\n\n Rewards Re-Balanced\n\n Various other bugfixes/little things I\u0027ve probably forgotten about.\n\n**Dependencies**\n\nYou MUST use Contract Configurator 1.2.1 or higher. Very bad things will happen if you try earlier versions.\n\n**Known Issues**\n\nScienceExperimentModule may require a scene change before it will complete once you recover the science at KSC. This is a minor enough issue that I let it through the net. I think it\u0027s a CC bug and nightingale is investigating.\n\nLife Support checking is... sloppy to say the least. Don\u0027t rely on the pack telling you to send up a crew only when you have LS on board. Check first (working on this)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T18:33:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by severedsolo**"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T18:37:54Z","Content":"Awesome stuff!
