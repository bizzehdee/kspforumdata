Last week I noticed that Crew Rotation contracts don\u0027t actually require you to rotate any crew. I docked with the required number of Kerbals, then undocked and it was waiting on me to return them home. Not sure if that\u0027s just something that isn\u0027t possible to test for in CC, or if it\u0027s a bug you fixed recently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a bug it\u0027s a feature. It\u0027s basically a throwback to the old (non expression based) way of doing things. There is a way I can target specific kerbals to come home, but I haven\u0027t really tried it yet. I\u0027m hoping to get it working for a cool new mission. At the moment though, I just want things basically working in 2.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that subject....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have noticed that development has been... slow to say the least recently, with not many new missions being added. The main reason for this, is that when I first started this pack, I wasn\u0027t very good at this, so basically copy/pasted most of it from the CC wiki (usage notes and all). This made it difficult to change anything as I couldn\u0027t really see what was going on at each line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHEN I introduced Mun and Minmus stations. This tripled my workload. Mistakes happened (especially when I forgot to copy things over to all the other contracts for other bodies). the last 10 or so pages of this thread are testament to that. I\u0027d like to thank you all for bearing with me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom an end user point of view, not much is going to change. All the old contracts are still there, all of the features (basically) work. What you MAY notice, is that contracts will now reference your vessel by name, and that they will generate much more often. However, trust me when I say that this has been a lot of work, basically the whole system has been completely overhauled, and brought kicking and screaming up to date. It\u0027s cleaner, leaner and (hopefully) better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew features are coming I promise, but for now I just wanted to get everything working with the new code base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout further ado:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin Space Station 2.0 Released!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMake sure you have no active KSS contracts before upgrading.
