On higher (custom) difficulties, many contracts are downright impractical or uneconomical. In many circumstances, contracts need to be chosen together in order to share launch costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good example is the part test contracts. These often require construction of an extremely impractical craft to test a part, in a situation it would never be used for, for far less money than it costs to get it there.

At the moment, you have the choice of fitting your space program around the contracts on offer, or doing a lot of busywork to save up for the missions you actually want to do. Either way, your program is being driven by the random contract generator, which doesn\u0027t make for a very satisfactory game.
