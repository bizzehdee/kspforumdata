It makes the craft uncontrollable if\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eone part\u003C/em\u003E breaks, no matter how small and insignificant, and calls the mission a \u0022failure\u0022. In fact, if the failute thing wasn\u0027t there, in many cases the craft is still flyable and the entire mission salvageable!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course you all know that. And many of us have argued in the past that failure should be made less agressive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, i am here to make the case, that the concept of failure should not exist in KSP2.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat would that mean in practice? Well for starters, any and all spacecraft would remain controllable as long as there are parts that can control it. Furthermore, the \u0022mission failed\u0022 screen would never ever appear, and nowhere would it even be claimed that your mission has failed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow for some arguments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, the \u0022mission failed\u0022 screen is very annoying, and not only that, it is very frustrating. It is also kinda unrealistic- were Apollo 13, Galileo, or Hayabusa declared total losses because one thing broke? No! Apollo 13 ended up safely returning to Earth, and the probes had succesful missions! And on top of that, it also works against the kerbal spirit of not letting failure slow you down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, why not even mention the mission has failed? Well, because any claims that the mission has failed are atill the claims, no matter how small. Let the players themselves judge whether or not their missions have failed! Finally, there are also impact missions, and it would be silly to say that a mission has failed when it has done exactly what it needs to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiscuss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcdjfp","CreatedById":142713,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-06T14:08:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe screen itself (and the very useful log information) should still exist, but what is the point of improving the explosions if they are hidden behind a giant pop up? I would have a small (even the solar panels in shadow notification is too big in my opinion) notification when anything breaks giving you the chance to open the screen if you want it. KSP 1 seemed to handle it fairly well. It only popped up (for me) following complete loss of vessel, and only after I attempted to give further commands to the non-existent craft.\u00A0 And it should be a \u0022Vessel Status\u0022 screen not a \u0022Mission Failure\u0022 screen because I might want to check it at other times.

Then we would have a chance to do something after closing the window, or at least the ability to watch the fireworks at not a 1/2 screen, view obscuring, dialog box.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-07T14:56:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni think it should be more similar to ksp 1 and maybe the screen appears maybe 3 seconds after all controll points have been destroyed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-07T16:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224280558\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217065\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221683377862\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210882\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Maria Sirona\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/6/2023 at 1:57 PM, Maria Sirona said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt makes the craft uncontrollable if\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eone part\u003C/em\u003E breaks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat, like the thing that lets you control it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour entire argument for this rests on a misunderstanding of the game\u0027s mechanics.

In particular, the flight log should also be accessible with some button before destruction of the last control point. And instead of popping up in front of the explosions on destruction of any part of the craft, perhaps a UI element should light up hinting that the flight log of the finished flight is available. Only when no control points remain.
