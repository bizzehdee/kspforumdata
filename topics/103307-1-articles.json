The SAS steers the other way only when passing the target (node, direction...), not before to smooth things down. So it steers back and so on until resonating wobbling.\n\nTo stop wobbeling, I ususally deactivate SAS or use Smart ASS from MechJeb.\n\nI\u0027ve event noticed that SAS is incapable of handling high torque vessels (such as mini-tugs). It even isn\u0027t steering at the correct target, but still \u0022vibrates\u0022.\n\nHow do you handle wobbeling ?\n\nFurther more, I think that some landing tip over are liked to the SAS module, especially on low gravity moons. Do you share this thought ?"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T09:49:37Z","Content":"Unfortunately, the autopilot \u0027hold heading\u0027 buttons added in the last update don\u0027t appear to use the same algorithm or PID controller to hold a heading.\n\nThe \u0022stability assist\u0022 button (top-left) uses an improved SAS method that was developed during 0.21 thru 0.23. The other buttons appear to behave in a manner similar to the older, pre-0.21 legacy SAS method (in that the reaction wheels and engine bells constantly over correct).\n\nThis could be because the underlying maths are different between stabilising a heading and holding to an external reference, or it could be because the dev who developed the new SAS method has since left SQUAD.\n\nYou\u0027re better off using the autopilot to achieve a heading, then switching to stability assist. This will reduce the wobble."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T10:57:20Z","Content":"Yes, it over compensate, but as the ship wobble, it enters some sort of resonnance.
