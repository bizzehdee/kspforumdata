It is so beautiful to finally be able to orbit Kerbin, Moho, Gilly, Dres, Duna, Vall without them! I really hated the limitations to be honest, never quite understood the technical reasons for them. They would put me off going to places, actually. Constantly having to switch to the Tracking Station just to orbit a little faster got really old.
