I suggest dropping your periaps down to 0 and attempting a landing in one of these areas. Try to go in on a gradual descent with your orbit barely kissing the surface. Then burn to nullify your velocity quickly (requires a decent TWR to do; 2-2.5\u002B) when you see an area void of the tiny craters which do not show unless you are under 5km. You can also burn straight up relative to the surface, the radial vector (if you use enhanced navball) to nullify just vertical velocity and keep skimming the surface for longer if you don\u0027t see an area you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf these areas are not good for you, craters are your friend. They almost always have a sizable flat area in their center suitable for spread out bases and for driving around docking stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn one of the smallest craters, I built this.
