However, the SR-71 only used them to take off. Doh! It seems they are much more balanced now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Rapiers: They use much more fuel during initial ascend now, and the buff totally depends on your flight profile. I found out you have to alter your flight profile to some extent to make use of the drag changes. The same ist true for Turbojet-SSTO craft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou now can accelerate the craft to higher speeds in air breathing mode, but you also need to do so to get the most kick out of them Rapiers. Because of the heat/drag issue, i had designed my craft to make a steeper ascend and avoid the heat spike, so i had to completely change my flight profile now and rebalance the liquid fuel / oxidizer mix. Overall performance is nearly the same however.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
