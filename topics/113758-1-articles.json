Barely got it off the ground, (very) slowly climbed to 4k before going back to the hangar. The lift doesn\u0027t seem to be nearly enough to do anything either. It is also notable that it is now trying to pitch down pretty heavily.\n\n Back at the the hangar, it seems the patch has shifted the centre of lift back a lot (or CoM forward?). So I removed the payload (which brought the CoM back) and slapped a little more wing area on. Ended at 24.3 t.\n\n So the climb to 10 k was a slog. But once I was up there I accelerated so quickly to 1050 m/s that it kinda took me by surprise and I climbed too fast. I could probably have accelerated even further had I stayed around 18 km altitude for a bit longer. I got to a 80x85 orbit with quite a bit of fuel left (expected without payload). However, I used noticeably more liquid fuel than before the patch so if I use up all of the ox the rest of the lf would probably not be enough to guarantee hitting the landing strip.\n\nHere are the two ships (yeah they aren\u0027t pretty designs but everything I build with mk2 stuff doesn\u0027t make it to orbit for whatever reason):\n\n[http://imgur.com/ZCIOUjZ](http://imgur.com/ZCIOUjZ) (center of lift wasn\u0027t as far back before patch somehow, it was always a bit far back but that was so it was still stable after shedding the payload)\n\n[http://imgur.com/tlWSDGf](http://imgur.com/tlWSDGf) (no payload, a little bit more wings)\n\nSo what I\u0027ll probably try tonight is: \n\n- Even more wings!\n\n- More LF!\n\n- Possibly slightly more control surfaces\n\n- 3 Turbojets, 2 swivel engines for more aerobic TWR (better climb, higher speed before firing rockets). Possibly 3 turbojets, 1 swivel, 1 terrier if I can somehow do that without making it too unstable.\n\n-New ascent profiles! It seems getting to 10k will be a drag but once you\u0027re there it works fine.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T08:04:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 08:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rofltehcat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T08:40:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can you have an option to disable the effect?

Rapiers: They use much more fuel during initial ascend now, and the buff totally depends on your flight profile. I found out you have to alter your flight profile to some extent to make use of the drag changes. The same ist true for Turbojet-SSTO craft:\n\nYou now can accelerate the craft to higher speeds in air breathing mode, but you also need to do so to get the most kick out of them Rapiers. Because of the heat/drag issue, i had designed my craft to make a steeper ascend and avoid the heat spike, so i had to completely change my flight profile now and rebalance the liquid fuel / oxidizer mix.
