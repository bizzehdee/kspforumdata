IMO this would be a huge addition for spaceplane guys like you and myself, increasing L/D ratios to well over five at even Mach 7\u002B. As it is, we\u0027re stuck with about 2 - 2.5 L/D at higher than Mach 5 speeds. I\u0027d love to build a wave-rider in KSP, but Ferram is unfortunately\u00A0 busy IRL and there are\u00A0 no plans whatsoever to model compression lift in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E(It was too computationally expensive, the last time I asked.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) The thing in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E that is different from stock aero, is that you need to have a lot of altitude for high L/D. At 30 kms, and Mach 5, it is possible to get \u0026gt;2.5 L/D with a properly designed plane. And by properly designed I mean as close to a Sears-Hack Body as you can get. You also need tiny wings with very high sweep, and this brings along its own set of challenges like very high takeoff speed(my designs lifted off at about 150 m/s with flaps, slats, the whole shebang.).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Of course, I don\u0027t think you can get to 30 kms with the stock rapiers. I remember that I used scramjets from a mod for this very purpose, and with those, it is possible to reach ~40km(In \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E) and Mach 10 on airbreathers alone, at which point you need to switch to NTRs. No matter what you do, the highest L/D you\u0027ll get at above Mach 10 is about 2. But this doesn\u0027t really matter, as the drag is very little above 40 kms, and because you have a lot of speed(Mach 10 is still half of orbital velocity, so your ballistic trajectory greatly reduces the amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E you need), it is possible to get to orbit with roughly 0.3-0.4 rocket mode \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. This will increase your dry mass by a lot though, as you basically need 3 different engines to reach orbital speeds. So while it is possible to reach orbit, the payload fractions are almost non-existent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) KSP Interstellar is by far the the best mod for engines if you really want a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E.

At 30 kms, and Mach 5, it is possible to get \u0026gt;2.5 L/D with a properly designed plane. And by properly designed I mean as close to a Sears-Hack Body as you can get. You also need tiny wings with very high sweep, and this brings along its own set of challenges like very high takeoff speed(my designs lifted off at about 150 m/s with flaps, slats, the whole shebang.).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe design point is the transition to NERV power after the airbreathers quit..\u00A0 \u00A0so I\u0027d say mach 6 plus.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 This is where our \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E will be at its worst and so our L/D needs to be as good as it can be for us to gain energy.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Over time, we\u0027ll get lighter as propellant is used and our \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E will improve.\u00A0 \u00A0 As we start getting up past 50% of orbital velocity gravity will start to reduce from orbital freefall which again will help us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe challenge is I am targeting a higher mach number than you are,\u00A0 but on the other hand i can fly as high as i want , whereas you have to stay low enough to get air into your RAPIERs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-09-03T06:43:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m really not used to the interface of the B9 Procedural Wings mod..\u00A0 \u00A0I\u0027ve spent ages perfecting a design, only to mangle it beyond repair with a single misclick.\u00A0 \u00A0I\u0027m also at bit confused about what the \u0022leading edge\u0022 and \u0022trailing edge\u0022 sweep numbers meant.\u00A0 \u00A0Though they did make me realise i\u0027d put the wings on upside down, forcing another start over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, before i lose all sanity,\u00A0 i made a quick comparo of 3 different wing planforms.\u00A0 \u00A0Yeah unfortunately I wasn\u0027t able to change only one parameter, because i don\u0027t know what i\u0027m doing with PRocedural parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPreviously, I\u00A0 would use multiple wing parts so get an increasing sweep angle as you move outboard... since that looks like the waverider shape that keeps as much of the wing as possible inside the bow shock\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/waverider/figures/fig14.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/waverider/figures/fig14.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the above link doesn\u0027t work,\u00A0 suffice to say that planform looks a lot like a \u0022starfleet logo\u0022.\u00A0 \u00A0 Not sure it\u0027s worth the hassle though as bow shock is not modelled.\u00A0 \u00A0Arrgh..\u00A0 for science i should really build such a wing and attach it to this body and see how the numbers look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway,\u00A0 \u00A0first iteration.\u00A0 \u00A0 Apparently the \u0022mid chord sweep angle\u0022 is 73 degrees.\u00A0 \u00A0 It has a taper of 0.3 and a mass of 3.18 (tons?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis design is best for wave drag and cross sectional area.\u00A0 \u00A0Unfortunately, while i\u0027m optimising my area ruling to four decimal places, i\u0027ve failed to notice this wing doesn\u0027t hold much liquid hydrogen.\u00A0 We\u0027ve got such a good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (1.27) that the wing isn\u0027t really needed,\u00A0 but the burn time is only 3 min 41 seconds with a Vac \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of 3276\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022k6hzFQo.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/k6hzFQo.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext i tried playing with the sliders to try get a 60 degree sweep.\u00A0 I ended up with 65 degrees and a slightly\u00A0 larger wing overall.
