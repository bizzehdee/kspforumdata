Weird to me i deleted the plugin for the LH zeus and thats what fixed it. Actually any mod that used this particular plugin. In fact my LH zues has no plugin right now and works. So im guessing it is operating from another one somewhere else?

They don\u0027t have turn signals and brake lights anymore. they were last in the mod in version 0.4. I removed them because I made my own plugin, but haven\u0027t made it support brake lights yet.

The more powerful LiquidFuel engine would just be this without the catalyst packs on top of it.
