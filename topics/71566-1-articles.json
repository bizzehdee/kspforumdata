You then need some way to get fuel to KSC in order to launch ships, and if you don\u0027t have enough to fill up a ship all the way then you can\u0027t fill it up all the way. Then recovering a craft lets you put its resources back into KSC tanks.\u003Cp\u003EEven cooler would be if you had to mine ore for turning into metal for rocket parts (integration with extraplanetary launchpads); that way you have to actually supply all of the resources for every rocket you build (in career mode only?) and you can\u0027t just pump out rockets with no limit. You would have to set up a mining operation on Kerbin in order to get all types of resources for ships you build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were to implement currency (and you get money for missions, scientific discoveries, achievements, contracts, etc.), then I think you would then be able to buy fuel or rocket parts (rather then mine all of the ones you need), because I\u0027m sure not everyone wants to be required to set up a mining operation in a space game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in essence: an simplified infrastructure on Kerbin used to provide resources for a space program.
