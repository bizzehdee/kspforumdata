The main orbiter is basically a cargo bay with two short rocket fuel tanks fore and aft. The drop pods are drained of oxidiser in the hangar, and feed both their own Whiplash jet engines and the RAPIER hybrid engines on the orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p8B0niu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022p8B0niu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt about 20km, the engines engines start to die, and ideally this is where the drop pods\u0027 fuel supplies are exhausted. They are jettisoned, taking with them the two jet engines, ram air intakes and the empty tanks. Now running in closed-cycle mode, the RAPIER engines continue the ascent to orbit. The pods are equipped with parachutes, which theoretically should allow them to be recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JSlwVv9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JSlwVv9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane is by no means optimised, but it does nonetheless work.

One way to optimize it, though, would be to reduce the drag on the wings and tail section. I would recommend the larger strakes and control surfaces, to get rid of the hard edges and corners. It would probably also give you a boost in handling as well. Then again, those larger parts would add to the weight, so maybe more engines on the drop pods? Definitely do some more testing and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T16:55:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was actually quite surprised it worked at all to be honest. I completely guessed how much fuel to put in the boosters\u0027 tanks, and it worked out about right. Likewise there\u0027s enough fuel on the orbiter for completing the ascent, a bit of maneuvering to rendezvous in LKO and for a deorbit burn. For the wings I just went with what looked about right- just a large delta wing with a \u0027structural wing type A\u0027 in front of it, plus canards at the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing was \u0027interesting\u0027 as I ended up coming down in some mountains.
