So you will need to disable your service module after you set up a mun encounter and then use your lunar module to guide the crew back home all other Apollo style rules apply. You will also need to take screenshots at launch, in orbit, disabling/decoupling the service module, and re-entering the atmosphere. So good luck and I hope to see how you did I will put up my own pictures soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(If this isn\u0027t very formal sorry because its my first challenge)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T15:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EXeldrak\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/39630-Doing-it-Apollo-style\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022Doing it Apollo Style\u0022\u003C/a\u003E challenge sort of includes the main component of what the Apollo 13 challenge would be about, the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_return_trajectory\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efree return trajectory\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking the only addition would be to actually do the entire trip in IVA, after doing your kerbin exit burn (ie free return trajectory burn).
