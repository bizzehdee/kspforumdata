As large and convoluted as this seems, it\u0027s nothing compared to the last station on the list. Jeb inspects the station and science team. The team feasts on mun cake and minmus cream.

When i finally did, Jeb\u0027s jostling of the station had knocked the orbit\u0027s periapsis to just over 3000. Jeb decided the low orbit was a little too dangerous, even if it was damned cool to see mountain peaks almost upon the craft. A proficient pilot, he activated only the 2 engines in line with the docked craft, with the one farthest from it at 40% thrust for balance.\n\n![ZEBMcbr.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZEBMcbr.png)\n\nJeb left the station at a 12k circular orbit. Glancing at the tiny moon, he figured, \u0022why not\u0022?\n\n![yZABjUo.png](https://i.imgur.com/yZABjUo.png)\n\nMay as well visit minmus for the secret ingredients to \u0022Minmus cream\u0022.\n\n![FGBpHQL.png](https://i.imgur.com/FGBpHQL.png)\n\nLanded, and watching the station he just left passing overhead.\n\n![KhyWUin.png](https://i.imgur.com/KhyWUin.png)\n\nTakeoff from the flat areas in a \u0022light\u0022 spaceplane isn\u0027t bad. Retracting/extending the forward landing gear kicks up the nose a little. With the light Minmus gravity, the nuke engine easily pushes the ship to orbit.\n\n![VPk1jp3.png](https://i.imgur.com/VPk1jp3.png)\n\nAlmost 3k \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E left, time to head back to Kerbin for our last visit. An asteroid base in polar orbit.\n\n![26m5gyG.png](https://i.imgur.com/26m5gyG.png)\n\nJeb came in from above minmus, which put him on the wrong orbital direction. close to 3000m/s at periapsis, 50m/s at apoapsis. Not an expensive error.\n\n![RyRM3hI.png](https://i.imgur.com/RyRM3hI.png)\n\nJeb gets into Polar orbit, and works on the minor inclination. Next up is setting up a rendezvous.\n\n![VjmT8em.png](https://i.imgur.com/VjmT8em.png)\n\nEven small changes around Kerbin add up.\n\n![DVTX15q.png](https://i.imgur.com/DVTX15q.png)\n\nBut he makes it. A dual base asteroid. This was made long long ago, before autostrut. Thankfully the Kraken hasn\u0027t disintegrated it.\n\n![6vuQpPL.png](https://i.imgur.com/6vuQpPL.png)\n\nFrame rate is punished under the load! Almost ignored docking here.\n\n![Zqc09VN.png](https://i.imgur.com/Zqc09VN.png)\n\nJeb still manages to dock. The larger of the stations was sent up here with a few emergency escape crafts. We can see there\u0027s one left for scientists to exist the station, with enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E and a lander to get to Kerbin.  \n![7Dzn58m.png](https://i.imgur.com/7Dzn58m.png)\n\nSay cheese Jeb! That is one crazy looking amalgam...\n\n![vrSQKbo.png](https://i.imgur.com/vrSQKbo.png)\n\nHis mind back on the job, Jeb goes back to inspecting the station. This was a good opportunity to autostrut as much of these stations as possible. On docking, the stations were swaying. That stopped after most parts were autostrut, so hopefully future krakens were put to rest.\n\n![rHl5Siq.png](https://i.imgur.com/rHl5Siq.png)\n\nEven spacewalks around this monstrosity are tough with the frame rate hit. Jeb takes a look at Kerbin, knowing the last part of his journey is probably the most dangerous.\n\n![N7WWopU.png](https://i.imgur.com/N7WWopU.png)\n\nFinal beauty shot!\n\n![GgW567q.png](https://i.imgur.com/GgW567q.png)\n\nTime to land. Jeb will be coming in with an effective crosswind.

Once there, a little retrograde sets his little craft up for home. not much fuel is left.\n\n![1BfAl8o.png](https://i.imgur.com/1BfAl8o.png)\n\nJeb\u0027s curious how the air braking will work here. Effective air speed is higher coming in polar.\n\n![iPLV0v0.png](https://i.imgur.com/iPLV0v0.png)\n\nLand ho! Jeb angles the craft to get lined up with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and maintain altitude.\n\n![TGtBJ53.png](https://i.imgur.com/TGtBJ53.png)\n\n93KM from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Jeb can taste home!\n\n![rbfjOAi.png](https://i.imgur.com/rbfjOAi.png)\n\nMost of the speed bled off, but at this altitude we don\u0027t need a drop of fuel  to do a nice gentle turn, and land.\n\n![H7ok5Cp.png](https://i.imgur.com/H7ok5Cp.png)\n\nLANDED! No fuel was needed from the retrograde burn that put Jeb on the path the the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E - which is good because we had almost none left.\n\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E diary!\n\n5944 - in orbit  \n\n4336 - first station intercept point  \n\n4095 - second station (Mun orbit) intercept point  \n\n3804 - third station (Minmus orbit) intercept point  \n\n3698 - fourth staion (second Minmus orbit station) intercept point  \n\n3450 - landed on Minmus  \n\n2405 - polar orbit of Kerbin  \n\n1901 - fifth station visit intercept point  \n\n1053 - \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E  \n\n883  - setup approach to land\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-18T01:32:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2018 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by beomagi**"}]}
