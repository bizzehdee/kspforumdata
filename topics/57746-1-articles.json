Now while I could drop the mainsail, it has an almost full orange tank. If the LV-N has 60 thrust, and the mainsail has 1500, would their outputs match if I limit the mainsail to 4% thrust (60/1500), or would it be 16% as there are 4 of them? Or would either way work since at 4% would act as another LV-N, and 16% would act as the sum of the four? Or am I on the wrong track entirely?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-26T03:38:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2013 03:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ArmchairGravy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"How2FoldSoup","CreatedById":82003,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T03:24:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe 16% would work. However you should just drop the mainsail...In orbit the fuel efficiency of the LV-N is far greater and will get you a lot farther than the mainsail will. Remember, in space you can push anything but you must choose between efficiency or speed. You will get a lot more dv out of the LV-Ns than the mainsail for sure. Ideally you\u0027d only want to use the mainsail for lifting a payload and then jettison it otherwise its extra mass that you\u0027re stuck pulling around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T03:34:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, thanks for checking my thinking on this.

I\u0027m not one to waste fuel that\u0027s in orbit, though, and it IS best to ditch the mainsail if it\u0027d be sucking off of the main craft\u0027s tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"longhornchris","CreatedById":70974,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T04:18:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have to drop the fuel with the mainsail it may be better overall to disable the mainsail, burn using only the LV-Ns, and ditch the engine and tanks once you\u0027ve expended the fuel.

You will have to run a fuel line to the Mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a similar setup for my interplanetary asparagus with LV-N core.
