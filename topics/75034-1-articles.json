I think that interplanetary transfer is too obscured for new players and bar the few souls who put a physical protractor to their screens, everybody uses some kind of plugin for interplanetary travel anyway. We should have that functionality in stock, just saying when you should go but not how to get there exactly. A player should know when he should start tinkering with maneuver nodes to get to a desired planet, but how to plot his course should be left to him to figure out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T21:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, we ARE getting new tutorials in 0.24, IIRC.

Guessing transfer windows on the other hand is a bit like winning the lottery, you need an exact value and not an \u0022exact value or higher than it\u0022 so learning them by dumb luck trial and error is a lot more difficult and tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m on the fence when it comes to showing spacecraft delta-v. On one hand it does make the game easier, although without memorizing the delta-v map you still need to learn how much delta-v it takes to get/land anywhere yourself. On the other if you want to know it without mods, all you need to do is divide the fuel you have by the consumption rate per second, and set up a maneuver node with burn time as long as the time it would take to burn all the fuel you have left. So all in all hiding it away from the player is a bit pointless now that I think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could also use total thrust and mass per stage values in the VAB and the vehicle information tab.
