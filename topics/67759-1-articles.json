I have been playing for about three years now and have played and enjoyed every game in the series. The Souls community is one of my favorite favorite ones (this community is the best however), and I thought I would see how many fans are out there. Whats game is your favorite? Do you have any great experiences to share? Does anyone want to share gamertags for PvP or Jolly Co-op? The real Dark Souls forum starts here!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mordin86","CreatedById":29223,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T07:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060m in no way a veteran of Dark Souls but I really love the game. I only played first DS on steam (DSII preordered already)for about 100h so far, haven\u0027t beat it yet. But I can say that this is one of my favorites RPG games. The game looks great and the combat is just awesome. Yes, it can be very frustrating game and made me rage lots of times lol but I still enjoy it and will beat it one day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
