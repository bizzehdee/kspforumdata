I kid you not, I have only flown this \u003Cem\u003Eonce\u003C/em\u003E. And it went without a hitch! (well, I had to reload the landing because a cat screwed with it by sitting on my lap \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E) I am getting really good at this \u0022eyeballing margins\u0022 stuff. I do admit that I used KER but... how often do you get something as complicated as an Apollo replica right at first launch? Honestly, this went much better than it had any right to. Even if I had to put the Skippers at 100% rated thrust so get a S-IC tall and powerful enough \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E.

You can now get your kerbals into the capsule in a proper astrovan and everything. And the lunar stack, I\u0027m really proud at how that turned out, simple yet very accurate at the same time. And I finally have fuel cells for the CSM! The LM, of course, runs on batteries, so don\u0027t dilly-dally on the surface too long. The usual rest of accuracy details, minus the interstage ring that would have complicated the build a lot needlessly. This way, the whole thing is a mere 156 parts on the pad (5 of which are the service tower), and it is still very, \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E accurate (if you don\u0027t believe me, wait until you hear about the margins).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5h9m0hi.png\u0022 alt=\u00225h9m0hi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, a note about flying it. It\u0027s further explained in the album, but the margins on everything are really, really tight. Like, I ended TMI with something like 2m/s on the S-IVb tanks (not counting RCS). And I landed with 5m/s on the LM descent stage. About 50m/s on the ascent stage are left for rendezvous operations, too. But don\u0027t despair if you are not the best pilot out there! The CSM as a crapton of extra fuel, so it can finish off lunar insertion of the stack after taking the LM out, and not only that, the LM itself has unused tanks in every stage: fill them up before undocking with some of that extra fuel, and not only will you will also have wider margins for the descent, you still have sufficient margin on the CSM tanks for a nice margin on the margin. Also, the RCS is very excessive, so you could tap into that if push comes to shove.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with that, I leave you with the fully commented mission album, and the download, so you too can emulate the steps of the Apollo crews.
