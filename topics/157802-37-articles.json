The cost of making computer games has moved on a lot too. Comparatively speaking, computer game \u003Cem\u003Eprices\u003C/em\u003E haven\u0027t moved on much at all - and I\u0027m talking about the first day, get it without a discount, prices, not the \u0027no way am I paying for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nadded:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. 30 Years ago how many People statistically bought a Specific Game ? 100,000 ? 200,000 ?

DLC is never ever anything that could be consideren \u0027fair\u0027 or \u0027good business\u0027 This is the outcome of soul and mindless greedy and wheesly Business decisions. So are Netherland Tax models with Mexican Ghost Owners too. Its all about maximizing revenue. Nothing more. Its about grabbing the biggest possible amount of money without creating any equivalent worth of work for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe New(tm) Investor wants at least 10 Dollars back for every dollar invested. Maybe more. Selling a \u0027rocket part\u0027 1 Million times at a price of 2$ seams quite fair if editing and releasing that single part maybe cost 2 Grand this is what its all about. Nothin more. No problem, if stuff like this works, its fine, but no one should try to excuse Business behavior with \u0027oh this game costs so much in coding\u0027 If all of it got already covered by 8 to 9 digit Dollar Sales it already got. We more or less guess how many copies got sold and there IS a reason why you can not see how many copies are sold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo please line all up, its whaling time.

I\u0027m going with costs in UK sterling too, rather than dollars, just to err on the side of generosity. Compare that with my earlier R-Type example. No idea how many copies it sold - but lets go for 200,000, as the high end of my estimate for point 1. So, 200,000 copies at \u00A310 per copy - \u00A32 million\u00A0in total sales.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with my totally accurate and thoroughly researched back of the envelope calculation, I figure that a top flight, modern AAA game makes about 40 times as much as a top-flight game from 1988.

Of course - and be happy that it can, otherwise mass market computer games probably wouldn\u0027t be a thing at all.

They don\u0027t like reading reviews for a game that will be out in two years. This is places tremendous pressure on the game development team of any software company to come up with some sort of demo to get the hype train going, then release a initial release about a year or so after that. All the time, the demand from the customer goes up - so there\u0027s a rush to release an initial product. The extra DLC normally contains other features of the game but were not essential for the core release since the game\u0027s core was essentially playable when it was initially released.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf one thinks of it logically, why should a company offer DLC for free?

The same is driving the gaming industry. To be very blunt, we were lucky that Squad didn\u0027t quit development of KSP with the release of 1.0 or even 1.2. Everything that\u0027s been done since then could have been resold as KSP 2.0 or even an expansion pack. Think of the Sims franchise, SimCity, or any of the other games from the \u002790s that did just that. I think I even have two copies of Zoo Tycoon around here, somewhere... (1.0 and 2.0) and both with all the expansion packs. So why should a company release a finished product and never do anything else to it? As long as people will buy expansion packs, then the game will be further developed. It is a win-win for the consumer and the software company.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll this is fueled by our need for instant gratification.

As long as I feel the DLC (or game, for that matter) is worth the cost-benefit-analysis, then I buy it. And at least DLC is something that is re-usable, unlike alcohol or tobacco based products. I can get repetitive use out of downloaded content for a game. I only get one time use out of an amusement park ticket, a box of cigars, or a bottle of whatever adult beverage purchased. When it comes to KSP, I will probably pay for DLC, too, as long as the DLC doesn\u0027t break all the mods I use.

And for you to complain about software companies doing this, what do you think Apple does? They take money and create innovative products. But unlike games, a phone is not easily upgradable through mods.\u00A0 That\u0027s why as soon as any iPhone is released, we are only a few months away from the new model.

No idea how many copies it sold - but lets go for 200,000, as the high end of my estimate for point 1.

But again - I simply don\u0027t know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding KSP, that\u0027s a difficult question. I bought the game back in 2013 - honestly can\u0027t remember exactly when, so I may or may not be eligible for free DLC but that\u0027s not important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I think it\u0027s fair to say that KSP hasn\u0027t turned out the way I hoped it would but I liked the demo and I figured that even if all the full game (such as it was at the time)\u00A0offered was a few more parts -\u00A0which I knew it did from reading up on it - then it was worth the money.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was. I haven\u0027t played the game for ages but I feel I got my money\u0027s worth. On a very personal note, KSP inspired me to start writing, which is not something I thought I\u0027d ever take up, so for that alone I\u0027ll always have fond memories of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I\u0027d only heard about KSP when it was officially released then things might have been different. I would certainly have taken a closer look at it before plunking down my money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf in doubt I would say buy a game for what it is when you buy it. No game is perfect - the question is, are the good bits worth the money and are they good enough that you can overlook the bad bits?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my case I probably would have bought the full price version of KSP - the core gameplay probably would have been enough to make up for its other deficiencies - as I see them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re buying a game for what it \u003Ci\u003Emight\u003C/i\u003E become then you\u0027re always taking a risk and have to be comfortable taking that risk. Whatever your personal view of developers, there\u00A0are all sorts of reasons - not all of them reprehensible -\u00A0why game development doesn\u0027t go according to plan and why you might not get what you hoped for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure how much that answers your question? Anyway - here endeth the wall of text.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
