I made a new one because their data is, well, wildly inaccurate. (Example: to go from Sarnus intercept to Sarnus elliptical orbit takes about 260m/s, not 1660m/s.) My map is hand drawn and hideous, but hopefully helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple of notes: 1) All numbers are m/s. 2) The numbers given for plane changes are supposed to be maxima, so you should never need anywhere near that much. 3) The rest of the numbers have no margin of error, so you have to add one yourself. Even the old delta-v map by WAC \u0026amp; Kowgan that we\u0027ve all memorized has a few percent margin of error included (at least compared to what my program came up with when I tested it on the stock solar system). 4) Yeah, I don\u0027t know what it takes to land on/launch from Tekto. Maybe 2600m/s?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI apologize for my crap handwriting. Enjoy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://4k4.me/Vfxtd6\u0022 alt=\u0022Vfxtd6\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
