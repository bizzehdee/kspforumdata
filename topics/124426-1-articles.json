However, enough information as gathered to determine the cause and its effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApproximately two minutes after lift-off, three minutes in the time line, a meteorite impacted the aft starboard side of the spine of F-159. The impact damaged the fuel pumps for engines S-3 and S-4. The damage then caused a pressure spike with damaged the fuel pumps for Engines S-1 and S-2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSufficient fuel had been used at this point to create a gas cushion in the main fuel tanks. This gas cushion absorbed the pressure spike. This prevented the propagation to the port fuel systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe starboard engines continues operating on the remaining fuel in the lines until a lack of fuel flow caused the engines to soft scram. Debris from the damaged fuel pump entered Engine S-3. This caused the engine to hard scram during the restart attempt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpallation debris from the impact damaged the cable connection for the fuel transfer ports.

Sufficient control force be added such that in the event of a loss of half the engines the craft will be able to remain in nominal level flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Additional control lines for emergency cargo dump be added. These control lines are to be run through channels at least three metres apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. A separation system be implemented that will allow the safe separation of the cargo tanks from the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Expansion chambers be placed on the fuel lines between the fuel pumps and the engines, and the fuel pumps and main fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReview of the implementation of all recommendations will occur in six months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-18T11:28:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2016 11:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by steuben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etagging for new forum\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T22:42:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA strange little piece but very well written with exellent attention to detail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Generalstarwars333","CreatedById":151938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T19:33:23Z","Content":"\nI like it.\n"}]}
