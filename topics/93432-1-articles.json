I have a GTX 980, and the GPU model has a feature called Dynamic Super Resolution (DSR). This allows me to play the game in 4K (even though I only have a 1080p monitor) The point of this is to allow me to actually record game play footage in 4K (it also smooths out the edges of models and makes the UI hilariously small \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting with version 0.90 however, I can\u0027t seem to set the resolution above 1920x1080. I can still select 3840x2160 and both the settings and the \u0022settings.cfg\u0022 show that it\u0027s set to 4k resolution, but the game doesnt actually display in that resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know why this is? I\u0027ve tried to figure out what about the display has been changed with the new update but I couldn\u0027t find anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, the game runs just fine. It would just be nice to be able to record 2160p resolution videos.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T11:53:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo idea, it sounds like an issue with your card and driver rather than KSP though, you could try setting the resolution in KSP manually by editing the settings.cfg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDSR mode sounds like all it\u0027s doing is interpolating your screen anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CamTroid","CreatedById":132330,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T18:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, visually there isn\u0027t really a difference. It just gives me the ability to record in 4K and take higher res screenshots. I\u0027ve already looked in settings.cfg, and it shows that the game is already set to 3840x2160.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
