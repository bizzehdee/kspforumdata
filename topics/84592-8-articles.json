A lot of this is due to the fact that it is heavily oversupplied with wings, and all of those wings are still set to full default strength and weight. As above, cutting this down to 0.5 or lower would save a huge amount of weight, while not overly impacting the airframe durability.

It has a tendency to drift off line, and it is difficult to counteract this without over-correction. The extreme dihedral on the vertical stabilisers (AKA tailfins) robs them of much of their power, and the X-wing pattern canard rudders near the nose actually reduce stability rather than increase it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a general rule, stability and manoeuvrability are opposite sides of the same coin: helping one usually hurts the other. As another general rule, rear-set aerodynamic surfaces are good for stability, forward-set aerodynamic surfaces are good for manoeuvrability. Think about the position of the feathers on a dart or arrow. When the plane goes off line, rear surfaces pull it straight again, but forward surfaces pull it further off line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other main concern with this craft is the biplane design. We don\u0027t see a lot of modern biplanes, and there is a reason for that. The downsides of a biplane are extra weight and drag compared to a monoplane with equivalent lift. The main upsides of a biplane were reduced wing loading (important when wings were made of cloth and wood, less so these days) and the ability to tolerate extremely low speed (i.e. 50mph) aerobatics. Neither of these things are major priorities for a high-tech spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible to make a biplane spaceplane work, but there isn\u0027t much reason to; you\u0027d always be better off with a monoplane instead. Layered wings work well in stock aerodynamics, but not so much in FAR/NEAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill an imposing visual presence, albeit a touch more conventional than V1.

It seems that only NEAR users have trouble with PW mod. I didn\u0027t bothered to try craft with NEAR and didn\u0027t expirienced problems with PW that people describes in PW thread. I have noticed symetry problem in SPH editor sometimes - when CoL is not in symethry. I corected those by attaching a wing and grabing other one on oposite side of plane and attached them again on the same place, but from oposite side of plane.\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t have issues in flight after I once placed wings properly on hull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try to reproduce bug and update craft file just for NEAR compatibility, hopefully I could do that by the end of contest.
