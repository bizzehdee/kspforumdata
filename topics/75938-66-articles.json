I can take one of your small tracks and make them larger than 6x6 mole tracks back to back AND on top of each other. I haven\u0027t tested it yet, but I\u0027d love to know how you think it will perform at that scale?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think, however, we could make things a bit more modular if we separate your exponent controls from the part files themselves and create a custom scale type to handle your parts. I\u0027ll get to work converting that if you\u0027d like. I\u0027m also not too sure about the \u0022free\u0022 scale type as a base, since that technically allows the user to circumvent any specified scale levels and can sometimes make it hard to keep different parts scaled by the same factor. Instead, I would provide a custom scale type with tested scaling values specified directly. Also, I noticed in your code that you\u0027ve added the scaled variable to your calculations in some places. I also wonder if there are other parameters that could be scaled as well, which don\u0027t actually require making code changes, or at least not too many of them. I\u0027m thinking things like the default repulsor strength/damping and stuff. I intend to do some testing personally and see what I can come up with.

I take it you mean make one of those Module Manager patch things that TS spams the loader with that I keep having to delete? I think most stuff in the plugin is driven off the tweakScaleCorrector config node - I\u0027ve not really got round to updating the replusor TS yet, just the wheels for the moment. The variable is necessary to deal with a load of stuff that just doesn\u0027t scale when wheel colliders are scaled. It\u0027s a crazy world in there, took me a while to realise what\u0027s going on! I still need to do a lot of testing with the wheels, as I may well have broken the deploy/retract stuff, along with lots of other things, so don\u0027t be surprised if there are major gremlins.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T01:13:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I won\u0027t clutter your already cluttered workload with a ton of new stuff, but I do intend to do a little experimenting.

What I am referring to is that you can define a scale type, or the plugin variable exponents, in a separate configuration file and then simply reference them from within the tweakscale module in the part instead of having to redefine them for every part. Module Manager can also patch those definitions, but it\u0027s not actually necessary for these kinds of definitions to work. At this time, there isn\u0027t much need to modularize your implementation, but if/when you get this mod stable enough to warrant some massive content updates, it would save a lot of time and frustration to export the data into separate configs much like the official TS distribution does it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that can all wait.
