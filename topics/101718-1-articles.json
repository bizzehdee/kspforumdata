A 4-line \u0022Auto-Saved Ship.craft\u0022 file [3] is created in my \u0022saves/.../Ships/VAB\u0022 directory, and, once deleted, I can load other ships and fly them, but the situation repeats its self is I load the krane ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have re-built the ship multiple times, with minor variations, and sometimes I can \u0022fly\u0022 it right after I build it (I *almost* managed to use the krane to move a piece of kolony equipment once!); other times I can not fly it at all (the map centers around the sun, and all controls, including the escape menu, are gone). Loading never works again before I delete the above-mentioned file, and I can never fly it once loaded (see [2]).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using several addons [5], but the only extra parts used on the ship are some smkoke industries moving parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would appreciate it if someone could help, my Duna kolonization program is totally suck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[0] \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/K2wQPj9x\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/K2wQPj9x\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/77WaXKb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/77WaXKb\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[2] \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/R3FORIN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/R3FORIN\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[3] \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/j189tgJu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/j189tgJu\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[5] \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/Lhes7DCZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/Lhes7DCZ\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind regards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eentropy--\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"entropy--","CreatedById":139306,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T20:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be a good way to debug what\u0027s going on?
