In addition to a big tank of life support, the rescue craft (christened K.S.V. \u003Cem\u003EBurbles\u003C/em\u003E, of course) was designed to land on Duna and allow Haddas to strap some 24/77s onto \u003Cem\u003ELulo\u003C/em\u003E and lift her back into the correct orientation. From there Haddas took the battered cruiser back into orbit and docked with \u003Cem\u003EEdford\u003C/em\u003E again. The five Kerbals now had plenty of life support and the resources of two cruisers, as well as just enough fuel to get home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey made the transfer as planned, but I unfortunately aimed too shallow for the aerocapture and I didn\u0027t get the ships into the planned LKO. Instead, it stuck them into a Mun encounter which then dumped my Kerbin perigee below 500km. And I had 24m/s left to counter it and save the ships (still docked together).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith no other alternative, I launched a tanker to rendezvous and deliver fuel. Which it did exactly ten minutes before impact, and it wasn\u0027t enough. In the end, both \u003Cem\u003EEdford\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003ELulo\u003C/em\u003E were completely destroyed and only Sidbal survived on one of the command pods that thankfully had a parachute built in just in case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: Saved a stupidly-overcomplicated dual mission to Duna and Ike, only to lose both my ships and all but one of my Kerbals to the fiery atmosphere and the G-forces of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-14T20:51:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2015 08:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mitchz95\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T23:57:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think i just had the absoluteley worst death ever!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust finished landing a capital ship sized refueling tanker on minmus.\u00A0 i pulled the crew out, and just as i landed the last guy in front of the ship to post for a screenshot, the whole thing tipped over with over 500t of ship crushing the crew of 5!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-14T23:58:10Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2015 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T02:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy most recent hard career startup, I killed Val on reentry during her first flight.
