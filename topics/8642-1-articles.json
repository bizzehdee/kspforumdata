This is what happens when your R\u0026amp;D team runs out of ideas and starts scaleing up toys. The rover is powered by Tosh\u0027s awesome Cart plugin and features four wheel steering, six wheel drive, and has three attachment nodes on it. This version comes with just a Bigtrak model that is a Cart/Command Pod, the new Liltrak 2 Kerbal Rover and also a tweaked version of Tosh\u0027s 1.33 Cart Plugin. More will be added later as I work through the old parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncludes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBigtrak\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiltrak\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECart Plugin v1.33\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.rustedjunk.com/crap/KSP_Bigtrak_v.30.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.rustedjunk.com/crap/KSP_Bigtrak_v.30.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWant to make your own Bigtrak related parts or learn how these parts are setup in game?
