There are 2 things here that COULD be causing the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Only 1 of those cores you have is actually performing physics calculations, meaning your extra cores are essentially useless. This will be fixed in 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

The issue is completely unrelated to graphics settings and resolution but it is highly affected by part number. Using CPU-Z I monitored my cpu frequency and found that in KSP my CPU frequency doesn\u0027t scale up, it just sits at the minimum multiplier of 8 which corresponds a frequency of 800mhz. Using other applications it easily scales up to 4.2Ghz.
