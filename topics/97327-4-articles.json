The current way to build spaceplanes involves carefully placing tanks and plumbing them in such a fashion that you can control the COM as the tanks drain (stable for VTOLs, shifting for more controllable spaceplanes), then placing the wings to get the COL to where you need it. If the mass of the wings change as they drain fuel then you end up having to constantly mess around with your wings to get it to the point where the COL and COM stay where you want. It won\u0027t simplify engineering (unless the fuel is simply drained from all the wing bits), it\u0027ll actually complicate it unnecessarily as players try to figure out tricks to control when the wing tanks drain. The only way I see it not causing an issue for most spaceplane designers is if wings would be stageable for fuel flow control, or if they\u0027re going to make it so tanks can be added to action groups. Perhaps that is something the Devs intend, but I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Fuel draining from LFO tanks on spaceplanes is equally as critical since it means we\u0027re going to end up plumbing the wings with fuel lines anyways so that the rocket engines don\u0027t end up with tons of O and yet be starved for LF because of the initial ascent stage. Sometimes we build our spaceplanes specifically to drain tanks in a certain order just for that reason. Now, this might just be me thinking that wing fuel flow won\u0027t behave like a standard tank, so perhaps my concerns aren\u0027t valid, but for some reason I just can\u0027t shake the feeling that I\u0027m going to be annoyed by this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Payloads draining as the turbines fail to differentiate between payload and actual craft, thus messing with COM in addition to fuel management. This one may not bother some players (it would me, but nobody cares about me), and it isn\u0027t anywhere near an issue that points 1 and 2 are. It just means finicky preflight prep deactivating tanks so our spaceplanes don\u0027t drink the fuel intended for our refuelling stations (like RCS payloads) is mandatory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, on the whole, I\u0027m not too thrilled about this. I will, however, give the Devs the benefit of the doubt and wait and see how this gets implemented as the QA team will likely have much to say about this when they test it, so it may end up being modified by the time it gets to general release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-21T15:48:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOhoho!
