It introduces a new resource, which simulates the radioactive decay that powers the real-life version of these nuclear parts. This gives both parts a limited lifespan, which were real-life drawbacks of the technology, introducing an extra challenge to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EParts:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERTG\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike the Pioneer and Voyager probes, the RTG will now eventually run out of electricity-producing radioactivity.

Its nuclear reactor is more complex. Only when the engine is firing does the NuclearFuel start to deplete, the rate of which is based on the throttle. In return, the LV-N now outputs three times as much (15 e/s) ElectricalCharge at full throttle. The engine has enough NuclearFuel to make ten round-trips to the Mun, a performance similar to those of a planned real-life nuclear thermal rocket (the LANTR to be specific).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownload:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/1fgMtu9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDropBox mirror\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELicense:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png\u0022 alt=\u002288x31.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mwlue","CreatedById":68876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T16:06:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efirst in, and cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"czokletmuss","CreatedById":28063,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T19:29:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy no more views?
