Once that happens, I usually have enough fuel in the 2nd stage to plot a course to the Mun. And then once I get there, I can plot an intercept, still with enough fuel. Then I can use even more leftover fuel to slow down my landing rate. I usually have to drop it before it runs out of fuel because I can\u0027t land with the 2nd stage on.
