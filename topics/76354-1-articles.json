I\u0027m sure a real pilot could chime in better. Unfortunately for me, and my time playing in flight simulators, I sort of tackle planes in ksp the same way as my flight simulators. I\u0027ll do a 15-20 degree bank roll, let my prograde turn and use my rudder to try keeping my nose level to try not gaining nor loosing altitude. On stock ksp, I have severe issues trying to use rudder controls, as I usually end up loosing control. Obviously FAR fixes *most* of that. Quite honestly tho, since it is just a game, it\u0027s all a matter of preference and controls available. I use a joystick, so it\u0027s much easier for me to roll than trying to use Q or E. Also, using just your rudder to turn can lead to some proper instability. While not exactly noticed in stock, it\u0027s noticed with more realistic aerodynamics. Personally, I consider the rudder to be used for small course corrections only, not for large deviations from the current vector. But again, I guess it\u0027s all more of a personal thing.
