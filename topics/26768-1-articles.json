The reason is that by default, it shows you the path relative to the body that you\u0027ll be in the SOI of -- in this case the Mun, followed by Kerbin. However, the Mun is moving, too. It takes time to traverse the flight path, so when you change SOIs the game is showing you where you\u0027ll actually exit, based on the Mun\u0027s predicted position at that point in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same thing happens when entering an SOI, especially if it\u0027s at the end of a long flight; the target body could have moved substantially. There\u0027s a configuration file parameter somewhere (conics mode I think) that changes how this information is presented. One of them shows all the positions in your current frame of reference, which might be more intuitive even if it\u0027s not entirely accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
