But then found links, threads that told me it goes against game mechanics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main part of Kerbal that prevented it was that a simulation of a craft not under SAS or in a free rotation could not be switched or simulation speed could not be warped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in any other way Kerbal doesn\u0027t simulate the gravity and tidal force on a spacecraft. The craft itself simply isn\u0027t part of the spacematter in kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for those reasons it can\u0027t be done in 0.22. Now all my crafts in orbit are locked at a fixed position in space. This might look completely normal and expected to a space telescope but it\u0027s not what most sattelites are about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So theirfore the suggestion that if their ever comes a 0.3 or 0.4 or 1.0v of Kerbal space flight simulator. Could the mechanics of this sim be changed, overhauled (euhm whatever necessary) so that one would have the ability to tidal lock their own craft. Obviously with a necessary maneouvre node and capable thrust micro management apparatus to get it done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all real world sattelites are tidally locked to the surface that they orbit. Because for the plain and obvious reason that those antennas, cameras [fill in] have to be pointed to the surface where things are received.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be ironic if this feature had no future of implementation. And I\u0027m sure something like this is on the drawing board. I\u0027m just reminding the devs that it is a very likely new addition and I\u0027m just curious if \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou to\u003C/strong\u003E would also like this option implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T10:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I\u0027ve no doubt it\u0027ll show up in KSP \u003Cem\u003Eeventually\u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9, but the current on-rails mechanic doesn\u0027t lend itself too well to doing it, yeah. :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CodatheSpaceFox","CreatedById":73847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T10:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, at first I thought you were talking about a feature I wanted for a long time in regards to space planes and SAS in orbit to have the option to lock them to a height relative to the surface of the planet and not just a fixed direction. This though, does have an arguable point though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, your point being right that a satellite locks directionally to the surface, aka tidal locked. This point is perfectly understandable and should be considered, especially if communication arrays become necessary with things like research and probe controlling and the like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, with how the game works, it\u0027s currently difficult, if not impossible, for the rail logic to accomplish. It doesn\u0027t sound difficult in theory, since you\u0027d guess to just use the rail mechanics to respect the rotation of the object while in orbit, and the change would simply mean a few numbers were adjusted before physics took over at a later period. But I\u0027m not a developer, and I don\u0027t even know if my assumption holds any ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s really just one of the little tidbits that remind us that this game isn\u0027t a perfect space simulator. A fun one, of course, but this issue doesn\u0027t create conflicts to the game itself at this point, it\u0027s just borderline depressing to think about. It\u0027d make no difference in the game currently, it\u0027d just be more pleasant to know if you ever needed to go to your satellite, that\u0027d you\u0027d find it facing the surface and not spying through your neighbor\u0027s window on laythe somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if it were something like what I proposed, where SAS could be activated to respect the current prograde line, or lock to an altitude in atmo. I could actually see it being useful for more than just background knowledge. keeping a space plane at a specific height while it speeds up for an orbital escape can be hard to do with an occasional tap on the control surfaces. While letting the SAS make more accurate and precise adjustments would prove a bit more convenient. It\u0027s a small feature, but it could have it\u0027s use in real time gameplay, and not just with the rail logic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T10:37:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP is not a simulation, but a game\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razorforce7","CreatedById":94677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T11:06:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKSP is not a simulation, but a game\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame, simulator or w/e.
