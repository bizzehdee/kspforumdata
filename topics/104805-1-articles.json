I normally would spend ~1500 DeltaV for a Laythe encounter, but I spent 2000 for a transfer and through aerobraking and TONS of random gravity assists (just timewarp!) I managed to get an encounter for only 200. Isn\u0027t that just peachy?"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearlessjames118","CreatedById":44818,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T00:59:25Z","Content":"Hmmm,I seem to be rather fond of Eve and Gilly!
