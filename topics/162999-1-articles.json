Not based on any specific model, not a replica of any kind, just a working submarine made to look a little like a german one. I had some serious trouble with getting my computer to actually render the thing, I don\u0027t know why but it seems my pc is dying, half the time it\u0027s at 100% disk usage, no viruses or malware, and none of the tutorials online help me out with anything, but anyway, here\u0027s the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227A05CC761564EC48EAF18730A25DE6D18589110B\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/827950495764191850/7A05CC761564EC48EAF18730A25DE6D18589110B/\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing no propellor mods because they\u0027re too easy in my opinion, I made the motor of the submarine with infernal robotics and some control surfaces. This actually ran me into some problems when piloting the sub. Each rotor is set at a speed of 10 with acceleration of 2 and spins in an opposite direction to the other in order to not have the thing spinning like crazy underwater. To get the sub moving I set the speed in the RPM GUI ingame to 5, making the rotors spin at a speed of 50, any higher and the control surfaces break off. When resurfacing I have to turn off the rotors lest they break on surface, I found that going up at 10 degrees and cutting the rotors at a depth of 100 meters usually curbs the issue. At the surface I usually run it at a speed of 30. This makes it so the rotors don\u0027t break off and I can move at a steady rate over the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AF50A22AC835DE4B29E519AC0C38857DC2DC154A\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/827950495764193088/AF50A22AC835DE4B29E519AC0C38857DC2DC154A/\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave some pictures with scatterer for looks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224C0E48FB5432CDD89859FB1DC72DC69E03223AE2\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/842585341024876163/4C0E48FB5432CDD89859FB1DC72DC69E03223AE2/\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022B8EFDB65CEB636784340B66856D5F93A2B3C9744\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/842585341024874735/B8EFDB65CEB636784340B66856D5F93A2B3C9744/\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022C2D87F21D15C272078599D2B491CCBAE767EDBD4\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/764897132633783478/C2D87F21D15C272078599D2B491CCBAE767EDBD4/\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get the sub into the water using vessel mover which is why I have the struts on the side to keep it up on the launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI cannot film this or even open anything up anymore because my pc is not letting me.
