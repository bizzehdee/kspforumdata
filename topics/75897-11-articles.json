I plan on integrating more TweakScale in the future, not less. Otherwise it would become pages of essentially identical parts a different sizes. I think it\u0027s more reasonable to default at the common place step of 1.25; 2.5; 3.75; etc. and use TweakScale for intermediate steps like 1.8/2m. 2.5 is halfway, can step up or down without needing new textures or models. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou\u0027re right single IVA won\u0027t work for two sizes in KSP; But two different sized INTERNAL{}s can share same mesh and texture just like any other part.
