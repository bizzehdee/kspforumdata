Also, what mods you have installed should be taken into account.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to aim for a realistic appearance, it\u0027s generally best to construct your station out of various modules launched independently. This also means that you won\u0027t have to stuff everything inside a ghastly-looking fairing on top of a rocket that looks like something out of a sci-fi horror story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour level of advancement will determine how much stuff you can reasonably launch at once. If you don\u0027t have access to 3.75m fairings yet, for example; your payload volume will be limited, making it more difficult to launch a station in a single launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe size of your station will affect how practical it is to launch all at once. For a fairly small station (e.g. a Skylab-style one-module habitat/lab with everything attached in-line) it\u0027s best to launch it all at once. For something more on the scale of the ISS, your best bet is usually to launch it as separate modules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the mods you have installed can play a part, particularly if you have mods that add larger rockets. SpaceY Extended is probably the most extreme example; with the new 10m parts it wouldn\u0027t surprise me if one could get 10000 tonnes to orbit on a single launch with a 7-core rocket (maybe with some boosters). If you have mods that add the ability to make enormous launch vehicles, then the main limitation on a single-launch station is how much lag you are willing to deal with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-28T13:20:31Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2016 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by eloquentJane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-28T20:54:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also split the difference - I launched a nice 700 ton station in two big pieces, joined inline in orbit using\u00A0SpaceY 5m docking ports (with assistance from KJR).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
