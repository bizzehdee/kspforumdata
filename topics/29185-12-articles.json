I currently considering the addition of either pure Hydrazine H2N4, MMH, UDMH or Aerozine-50 \u002B Dinitrogene tetroxide (N2O4, NTO) as LF\u002BOX replacement. But i dont know which i should add (kinda would like MMH since the shuttle used it^^).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow the new system could look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERP-1 = plane fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELH2 = SABRE Jet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERP-1\u002BLOX = ascent stages\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELH2\u002BLOX = lighter upper stages, SABRE rocket, STS main engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELH2 \u002B Nuclear fuel = NERVAs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydrazine\u002BNTO = interstellar travels, probe fuel, STS OMS systems\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUH25 and Aerozine 50 are both different mixtures of Hydrazine and UDMH, ones 25 to 75 mix and other is 50/50, dunno if its even possible make a 3rd mixture set so you can mix hypergolic fuels to get different types of ISP/Trust types..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
