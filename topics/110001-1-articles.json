Problems with that include:\n\n1) That would be true for lakes and rivers where you don\u0027t necessarily want the sound to play.\n\n2) Ideally you would also want the sound to play while near the coastline but on land.\n\nWhat you really want is the distance between the active vessel and the nearest Water Biome/Shore Biome border. One option to get that would be to:\n\n1) Get the current biome of the active vessel\n\n2) Sample X number of points in a fixed radius around the vessel\n\n3) If the biome of the vessel is Water and the biome of one of those points is !Water or vice versa, you\u0027re on the shore.\n\nAgain, that has problem #1, but not #2"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:48:26Z","Content":"This is an odd suggestion, but maybe by calculating the difference between the ocean height and the land height.
