Not mainly for rovers, but for example for ground base construction. Then one could adapt the height of a docking port. This works at the moment a bit with the claw, as it can be used as flexible joint, but the claw is kraken bait and inferior to active moving parts for this purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T19:16:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022m3m3lja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022m3m3lja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eoh really? we have wheels so don\u0027t need motors?
