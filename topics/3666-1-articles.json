Think of it this way. When you are slingshotting around Kerbin, the force of gravity applied on your ship by Kerbin is several orders of magnitude more than the FoG applied on your ship by the sun. Essentially, the force applied by the sun is negligible compared to the force applied by Kerbin. If you get stranded in the game, you would\\\u0027ve gotten stranded in real life had the same situation occurred. Reaching stellar escape velocity is NOT an easy thing.
