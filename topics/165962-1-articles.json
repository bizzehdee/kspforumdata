So what does that name mean? Obviously, its a parody of the idea of the \u0022Right Stuff\u0022. The attitude, charisma, skill, and intelligence to be an astronaut. So when it comes to Kerbals, I imagined they have to have some kind of stuff. Hence the name!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, this series is going to be touching on the other things I build and fly in KSP, starting with the Space Shuttle, my first demonstrated launch of which is below.\u00A0 In this series we\u0027ll most likely be covering other things, and in particular I know I\u0027m eventually going to cover Apollo with this, and that\u0027ll be fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut without further ado, here\u0027s STS-1. A semi-replication of the very first Space Shuttle mission using my new Shuttle that flies like a dream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KBucbTq97E?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
