Prior to the contracts update, I was using the EVE mod with the \u0022Better Atmosphere\u0027s\u0022 but both are a bit dated/clunky as of 0.24. Is there any good 0.24 mods out there for visual enhancements? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisual mods I mean as in realistic looking kerbin, clouds for planets, skyboxes, and etc. Any tips is appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T13:18:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAstronomers pack is the best memory can buy as of now. Couple that with some 4k textures with Texture Replacer you got one good looking game. Oh and Distant Objects is a must-have. One of the best mods imo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
