(Bandicam, Fraps, etc.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there definitely is options for camera tools, with some nice options for cinematics. They will take a little getting used to, but you can use them together, even with the latest version of KSP. (1.0.2) Here\u0027s a couple of the options that seem to be the best among most people, at least to what I see. Maybe you\u0027ve seen them, or maybe not.
