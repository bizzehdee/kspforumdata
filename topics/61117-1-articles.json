No parts clipping involved. Capable of low Kerbin orbit. Can be boosted to higher orbits and is capable of Mun or Minmus missions with booster docked to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZmTsEt7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZmTsEt7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrion CSM Heavy\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design features the Orion CSM core stage with 2 strap on boosters. The boosters are inspired by the original Falcon 9 design (9 engines arranged in a square pattern). Can be used with the CSM, or you can take the rocket and put probes on top (this design has been used for taking probes to the Duna and Jool systems).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vqK7P17.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vqK7P17.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrion CSM Heavy Orange\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA revised asparagus design that is more stable and looks better because of its vibrancy.

Warranty void if used anywhere else. It has enough fuel to land on the moons and enough to reach orbit again. Features science experiments and science instruments.

Both were successfully landed on the planet and moon, respectively, with great success! Features science experiments and instruments. Ike version is quite easy too land; the Duna lander is easy to land as well and includes an Atmospheric scanner instrument.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wV6kNCo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wV6kNCo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kk6OL1a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kk6OL1a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-01T19:21:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2014 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Woopert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T00:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the fact that there\u0027s no replies because I\u0027m not popular, more people check the regular Spacecraft Exchange, or just that people don\u0027t have time?
