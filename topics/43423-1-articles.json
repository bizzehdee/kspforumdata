So I\u0027ve been having a bit of frustration getting my camera to the right spot in the VAB. I\u0027ve read that the centre mouse button is supposed to free your camera, but that doesn\u0027t seem to work for me. Middle mouse buttons and mac have never really been friends. The ship I\u0027m working on now is off-centre in the VAB, and I can\u0027t even zoom in closely now. I installed KerbCam thinking that would free my camera, but it seems that\u0027s only used in flight. Any suggestions for how to free my camera in the VAB?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moencino","CreatedById":79498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T23:41:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA followup question: I know that by selecting a part and scrolling up or down, I can move that part up and down relative to the floor. Is there a way to move a part that way, but perpendicular to the floor? That would solve most of my problems for the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T01:20:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFreeing your camera only works inflight. Even then it\u0027s not quite free but able to pan away from your center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo move your craft sideways you have to rotate your camera so that you\u0027re looking it head on and move it sideways, to move it back and forth you have to rotate your camera so you\u0027re looking at it from the side and moving it back and forth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moencino","CreatedById":79498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T05:12:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust logging back into the game. I\u0027ll give it another shot, but I think I\u0027ve tried that, Johnno. The solution that sort of worked was to attach a big girder to the ship, so it was sticking out to the side. That somehow let me move it back to the middle of the platform, where I could zoom in better. In a game I\u0027ve really fallen in love with, camera issues in the VAB are the only real complaint I have. But I know the game is in development still, so it\u0027s not really a complaint \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
