I\\\u0027m working on a three tiered project where I have need for a 1, 2 and 3 seater capsules. \n\nIs there a plugin that would allow a modder to specify the number of Kerbalnaughts in a command pod? Or would someone like to make one?"},{"CreatedByName":"Foamy","CreatedById":608,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T22:02:27Z","Content":"Not at the moment, there are parts currently that have no crew but this is unofficial and not particularly effective.
