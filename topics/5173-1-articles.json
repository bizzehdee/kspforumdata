Although I\\\u0027ve troubleshot it down to the fact that it must be a setting in autodesk 2010 when exporting. I read the guide on setting autodesk up and followed the directions to a T. The only problem though is that under the export options i was told to make sure everything is unchecked except for Triangulate and Smoothing Groups but smoothing groups doesnt seem to exist in the 2010 version and the triangulate option is under the collada tab along with single matrix ( Is that sposed to be checked? ). In fact the only selections under the Geometry tab are: Split per-vertex normals, Convert deforming dummies to bones and preserve edge orientation. im pretty sure its some sort of autodesk setting because i imported a functioning item, made no changes and immediately exported it. Now the exported item gives me an \u0027 Array index is out of range \u0027 exception in SDK. Also is there any more in depth tutorials about modding for ksp?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"C7Studios","CreatedById":3895,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-05T19:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few things to try that may help. First of all, make sure you assign a material to the part. Even if its just going to be discarded by ksp, its mandatory. Also make sure you have a secondary model named node_collider to handle the collision and interaction of your part. There are two additional considerations, convert your part to an editable mesh before export and ensure that you have applied and collapsed a Xform reset modifier to all parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other thing I can suggest is that you bring up the list of all objects in the scene, and make sure you do not have any groups, lights, cameras or extra models that make choke the importing logic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
