If you could find the magnitude of the assorted disruptions for a given orbit ( I have no idea what the magnitude of these would be ) and use that to apply a periodic random bump that your station keeping would need to counter....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Charlie the Kerbal","CreatedById":158173,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T10:15:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not sure how fun Remote Tech will be without station keeping. Then it will simply be setting up 5-6 com sats and the job will be done. I think whether it is floating point issues or something else, small drifts in the orbit helping to simulate more of a real time situation. I knew people who worked at real Com Sat tracking stations, and I remember it was one of their routine tasks to make small adjustments to orbit time to time. This was a few years ago, maybe satellites are now doing adjustments themselves, although I doubt it as a mis-calculation can easily deplete the satellite of fuel and turning it into a space junk. For me it is similar to an airplane is always taking off and landing manually although sophisticated autopilot technology is available, it is just something that requires human intervention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a real life scenario, there are so many factors impacting orbital drift, from the Earth no being perfectly spherical, to tidal forces, to solar winds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my KSP experience, I use four 24-77 Twitch engines on my Com Sats, for finer adjustments the two are shutdown (opposite diagonals), and active ones are set to 5.5% trust limit. With this setup I never managed to get an orbital period of 6:00:00.000, it is always a bit higher or lower. But at this precision, it takes weeks for a sat to drift. So it is more likely a bi-weekly maintenance tasks to go through all 5 com sats to see how they are doing. A simple approach I take is, if I found a sats orbital period is slightly over 6 hours, which means it was going slightly slower than required over the last two weeks, I make a very small burn to make it slightly less than 6 hours, so over the next two weeks it compensates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStationkeeping is one of the routine jobs I do, in addition to making sure orbital space stations have enough fuel for ships docking, kerbals on orbit or on other planets are rotated occasionally or they are fed and watered well \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0You don\u0027t leave your kerbals on orbit for 5 years, do you ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T16:24:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/158173-charlie-the-kerbal/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022158173\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/158173-charlie-the-kerbal/\u0022\u003E@Charlie the Kerbal\u003C/a\u003E I can see your point, where station keeping may add to the realism, but when you have more than just a simple network, and get into having dozens of relay sats, it DOES get kind of ridiculous... I sometimes use KerbalGPS, and I can see it being useful for those netwroks as well...
