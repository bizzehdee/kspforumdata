In the future it may be wise for humanity to put a coupled of atomic clocks in Earth-Sun L4/L5 for everyone in the solar system to synchronize their clocks too. After that each world would have their own clocks and clock system in theory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some suggested clock schemes for mars:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Use standard seconds, add a leap time after martian midnight of 39 m and 35.24 seconds. This is been proposed in several prominent science-fiction novels, the advantage is the hours and minutes are the same length as earth, the disadvantage is the dead time, especially what it would do for time zones. A midnight \u0022witch hour\u0022 on one-side of mars is would be midday on the other side. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Use the standard second, change the hour and minutes. It turns out if we make a martian minute 67 seconds long, a martian hour 53 minutes long and a Sol 25 martian hours we can use the second to count a sol with only the need of .24 leap seconds per sol. Obviously these numbers are not as nice as the Sumerian base of 6 used for 60/60/24 earth time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Change the second, keep everything else the same. By extending the second 2.7% a sol can be 60/60/24. This is what NASA presently uses to keep rover crew work schedules in sync with the rovers on mars, even to the point of having special watches with standard 12 hour dials but with clock work ticking at the slower martian seconds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Change the second, introduce new time keeping units. The sky is the limit here, for example a decimals system can be used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHypothetical Mars Units / Earth Units\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 sol = 24 hours 39.5 minutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edecisol, desol = 2 hours 27.9 minutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecentisol, centol = 14.8 minutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emillisol, milol = 1.48 minutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehectomicrosol, hectom, hectol = 8.88 seconds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edecamicrosol, decam, dekol = 0.88 seconds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see 100 dekols is a millisol, 1000 millisols is a sol. Seconds are important to many scientific units, and thus dekol or martian second (1.027 earth seconds) would not be a scientific measure. While such a system is very neat and metric it has to contend with the traditional appeal of 60/60/24 that we have all been trained with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalendar Time:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMartain weeks, months and years are different matter altogether from daytime or soltime keeping. A martian year has no formal name (I like \u0022morb\u0022 or \u0022sorb\u0022 as in \u0022Martain Solar ORBit) neither do the mouths or weeks. If made of months, it would be closes to earth months at a martian year of 24 months, 28 sols long per month, with ever 6th month 27 days long with on of those shorten months having a leap day (27 to 28) roughly every other year. Thus a 7 sol long weeks would shift roughly one day every 6 months. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively we could just count sols but a 689 sol long year might get tiresome. At present though this is what rover teams do and they don\u0027t even reset per year, hence rovers are counting out at thousands of sols now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-04T14:57:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2015 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RuBisCO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"How2FoldSoup","CreatedById":82003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T20:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEasy on the necro ReBi. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E atomic clocks in Earth-Sun L4/L5\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis wouldn\u0027t work.
