If you can make a list of the steps needed to reliably trigger the problem, that would go a long ways towards helping me track down the cause and getting it fixed. I certainly did not see anything like that during my routine testing, though it is fairly limited to build, launch, revert to launch, revert to vab; build, launch, go to space center, return to vessel, revert to vab. These steps generally catch all of the KSP loading scenarios, but there may well be something that I\u0027m missing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill open up an issue ticket and work on getting this one cleaned up for the next release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T04:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wobbling SRBs happens even when I use KJR too BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: What I mean is when I ignite the Rocket boosters, they flex forwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-02T04:50:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2015 04:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by davidy12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T07:59:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022davidy12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022davidy12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe wobbling SRBs happens even when I use KJR too BTW.\u003Cp\u003EPS: What I mean is when I ignite the Rocket boosters, they flex forwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs stated earlier this is stock behavior and even KJR cannot eliminate it entirely, you need more struts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think it\u0027s really weird try it again with a clean install.

I\u0027m not doing it for the money, nor would it be realistic for that to be any part of my motivation or reason to continue modding. The problem I ran into with MC was mostly ending up with a feeling that I was obligated to do modding work... which is not where I want to be this time; it results in sub-par work being done lots of \u0027rushed\u0027 features, and general feelings of resentment for the entire deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have nothing against letting people buy me a drink or meal once in awhile, as it were.

Powerful stuff, but I think it is likely overkill for my needs / the purposes I had intended, and would probably end up decreasing overall performance. I could likely get it implemented to be a good stand-in for the current fuel-line mechanics; but would need to implement nearly the full IK chain in order to get it looking good. Probably not worth the dev time to sort it all out and deal with the added complexities just for some minor visual improvement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill keep it in mind for the future though; it has some very interesting capabilities (and applications) that I might find myself needing elsewhere. At least it opens up new opportunities for solving some problems, and being a bit more familiar with it, I will likely run across some good uses for it before too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne decent alternative that I thought up for creating the fuel lines would be a custom procedural plugin that created each fuel line dynamically and managed updating its bones/geometry, but again it is probably not worth the work/effort to develop given how minor the feature is / how small the geometry is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill likely aim to get at least one more engine finished up this week (F1, J2, other?), along with perhaps a couple of mounts for the RS-25 (mk3/shuttle, new SLS style 2/3/4/5 engine mounts). From my initial look over things, most of the mounts will end up being at least slightly engine-specific. Many will be re-usable for other engines, but will be more \u0027optimal\u0027 for the engine they were designed for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example; the SLS style mounts won\u0027t work very well if scaled up to proper dimensions for the F1 engines (and actually have a different engine layout). Nor do the F1 style mounts scale down very well for use on an SLS inspired build (and in fact they look quite different).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.. my initial list of mounting options will probably be fairly short, something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(stack size - preferred engine layout)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.25m - 5 x F1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5m - 5 x RS-25\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5m - Tapered, round, to be used for 2/3 engine mounts (and reusable/rescalable for other stack sizes and other engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.75m - 2 x F1B (could possibly also be used for 3-inline engine configs where the outside engines slightly protrude).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk3 - 3x RS-25 (if I can find a good way to make it work/if it will all fit)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T16:20:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stratochief66\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stratochief66\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe SSTU RO configurations are now in an official release, for anybody interested.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/releases/tag/v10.5.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/releases/tag/v10.5.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landers are still WIP, but much progress has been made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you make Real Plume configs for stock?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T16:58:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI could use a F1 mount on a SLS using RS-25, but it sure would mean moar (4x) boosters like the MLV projects \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T20:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few previews of more mount geometry work; this stuff seems to be getting closer to final geometry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneric Engine Mount - 5m base size, but could be rescaled.
