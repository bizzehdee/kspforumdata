Val decided to go on strike after I asked her to land her jet on the side of a mountain to take a surface temperature reading. So, I went back to the drawing board and designed a plane with upside down cargo bays that drops science modules to the surface. It\u0027s basically just a science jr with four radially mounted landing gear, several science instruments, a drone core, and three radial parachutes (not the new drogue shoot, the old ones). Two are radially mounted, one on top. I open the door, hit the radial decoupler.. and out they go. I swap to them, hit the chutes (which open right off and slow it to like 10 m/s), take a couple flying measurements, then swap back to the plane to keep flying and deploy more drones. My plan was to go back to the drones after landing and take surface measurements, then recover them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever.. when I went to go back to them, I found that they had all been destroyed on landing.. as if they had no chutes at all. Anyone got any ideas what the problem might be? It\u0027s like anything I give chutes to and then decouple acts as if it has no chutes at all after I swap away from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlew the drone to the ground. Manually deployed chutes at 1500m traveling 200 m/s. Slowed to 15 m/s instantly. Fell to 1000m, chutes went to partially deployed mode and I dropped like a rock until the very last instant where they fully deployed (again).. but not in time to do anything. Drone splattered all over the ground. Radial chutes broken?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkona","CreatedById":99172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:17:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a known bug. After you went back to the plane, you most likely closed your cargo bay. Things inside a cargo bay are aerodynamically shielded, and they start getting forces when you open it. But once you detach them, the flag that says that they are no longer inside the cargo bay doesn\u0027t get set to false, so the game still thinks your probes are inside your plane. When you close the cargo bay, they plummet to the ground because aerodynamic forces stop acting on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this gets fixed very soon, is a very annoying bug and I find it kind of gamebreaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorkaround: don\u0027t close the cargo bay until after your probes land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T03:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup.
