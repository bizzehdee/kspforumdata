I\u0027m SuperHappySquid and I make KSP space combat videos on YouTube. My first series has just been completed and the second one is in the works. It\u0027s a little crumby and short, but it was more of a trial run for bigger things to come in the future. All of my videos use no mods of any kind and I hope that you guys can give me some feedback! I don\u0027t have a huge subscriber base so any tips for improvements would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S I hope this isn\u0027t violating any forum rules or anything, I\u0027m just looking for some honest feedback. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/strc7L65m50?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T21:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat series i love your videos!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
