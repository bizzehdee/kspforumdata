But I cannot add them here without them being somewhere else on the internet, so I uploaded them and the video to my YouTube channel. I make KSP videos and other gaming videos. The video is here:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1aNlODWzjJ4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n.\nThe photographs\u0027 descriptions are here, probably not in order:\n\nSitting on the launchpad, a symbol of remembrance of the old aero. Sorry for night launch.\n\nBurning for Kerbol orbit.\n\nA view of Kerbin as we leave it.\n\nTransfer burn to Jool.\n\nOur first look at the Jool system.\n\nOne moon has a visible atmosphere.\n\nOur first flyby of Tylo, used to collect science and lower our orbit.\n\nWe have our first clear look at the light side of the moon with an atmosphere. it appears to be completely ocean.\n\nOur second, much closer Tylo flyby, bringing our orbit to barely above Jool\u0027s atmosphere and collecting higher-quality data about the large moon.\n\nA view of the descent probe and its heat shield.\n\nOur final Tylo encounter, lowering our periapsis inside the planet.\n\nA view of a smaller moon of Jool, one I might not have seen before in this save file. The probe did not get close enough to perform experiments other than a spectrometer measurement, which shows the small moon to be covered in ice.\n\nAs we descend, the ocean moon is spotted again.\n\nThe achievements of the mission after its completion.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe probe conducted three close flybys of Tylo, the only moon of Jool known before the mission began. A small rock was spotted moderately distant from Jool; it was on a different plane than Tylo and the two new moons discovered, and it is not known if is orbiting Jool or simply flying past it. It is likely smaller than Minmus. The probe descended into Jool\u0027s atmosphere seven years after being launched, and two after entering its SOI. It recorded pressures upwards of 15.3 bars and recorded temperatures above 1000 degrees. It was crushed by the immense pressure 250 meters below the cloud bank. Slight changes in Tylo\u0027s orbit have shown that there is at least one small object orbiting Jool close enough to measurably perturb Tylo\u0027s orbit. It is probably the effects of the small rock on the inclined trajectory, although this means there is either more than one of it or it is very dense. Extensive analysis of the photographs of the ocean moon show barren islands dotted around its surface. The liquid on the ocean moon is believed to be water, however the probe\u0027s spectrometer could not reach through the thin clouds over the moon as they were opaque on its wavelengths. Kerbals were surprised and intrigued by the probe\u0027s discoveries. They say if the world does not end the next day, they will explore this system more.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T00:51:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 12:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Findthepin1**"}]}
