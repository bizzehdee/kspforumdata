Two unrecognized kerbals, Halsen Kerman and Geoford Kerman, were accepted into the new program as well as (to everyone\u0027s surprise) the Honorable William \u0027Bill\u0027 Kerman! All three were admitted into the astronaut program and became the first kerbals ever to fly a three seated rocket, much to the dismay of the fierce rival Anchronian Enterprises and Space Flight (A.E.S.F) who had had their own version of a 3 seated capsule in production. By 1988 V.B.S.P was a dominant competitor to such names as The National Space Flight Administration of Dichronia (N.S.F.A.D) and Treorgest Venhavan, the Guhansan space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAESF was back on it\u0027s heels by \u002789 with the first interconnected array of equatorial geostationary satellites, only to be beaten by the nearly complete VBSP global communication systems, which was the first to set up communication satellites into a near polar orbit. With the death of it\u0027s founder in 1991 AESF was shut down briefly before being reinstated as the Anchronian Space Exploration Program (ASEP) VBSP was sucked into the dirt as the first dunan probe was launched by ASEP followed by a jool bound probe in September 1993. Manned flight was the only place where VBSP was gaining, the first deep space selfy was taken aboard Athens VII, the first mun flyby on Novgorod III, first mun flyby on Novgorod IV, a picture was taken at a mere 8km above the surface on Novgorod VII and Novgorod IX was the first landing on the Mun. In March 1997 a statement was released from Alan Vicekerman , Chairman of ASEP ,\u0022Due to unseen circumstances the Anchronian Space Exploration Program has gone bankrupt. All shares have been sold and the vehicles auctioned. Our testbed 4 kerbal capsule, along with a variety of blueprints, have been given to the Very Big Space Program. All other files have been sold to the national governmental inquiry.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was a breakthrough! Suffering tough economic times itself the VBSP made best use of the new technology and set up for a 4 kerbal landing on Minmus. Within 2 months project Cyprus had started with the launch of the dummywieght Cyprus 0.1. By 1999 Cyprus VII had scanned the tiny moons surface and had found a suitable landing site. Cyprus IX had sent robotic probes to the surface and by Cyprus X the VBSP had been the first to land on both moons. Scan forward to the Outer Kafrican Launch Facility in may 2001. A tall rocket is sitting on the pad 1 hour from launch, up to a location which seems quit dull (130km high orbit around the equator). But, however, within 7 launches kerbals were in that location. The Faraday Space station was up and running. Now, 2014, the VBSP had kept shuttling kerbals to and from Faraday for 11 years, the Halsen and Geoford were now famous and down on kerbin there are children. Some of whom like fictional \u0027Hoomins\u0027 some like TV and some like the dream of being part of the Very Big Space Program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T03:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood short story!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
