She featured a quantum leap in armor protection, and for years the armor was unpenetratable by even Probe-Tek, Voyager Labs, and DAEcorp weaponry. She possesses a long barrel which can easily be fitted with numerous different weapons, abeit \u0022smart\u0022 (guided) or \u0022dumb\u0022 (Direct fire). She was meant to enter combat unmanned, but has a cockpit for ferrying/rescue. She sports two long range nuclear engines, One Aerospike for speed at a slight cost to efficiency, and two large radials to provide war emergency power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is nearly 1000 kerbal years later (Date 14286), the armor has lost its invulnerability, due to the introduction of \u0022Shredder\u0022 missiles, but remains in active frontline duty in many parts of the solar system, including still in Frontline Service in the Zokesian Navy, and its design has been exported to 75 different nations/institutions. Since the XIV, there have been 12 more Drekevak designs, but the most successful ones are carbon copies of the XIV\u0027s amazing armor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe XIV-I carried 2 \u0022Helos\u0022 missiles, which are very much dated. The export version (which is the one in the link) Has 4 sate of the art Quad-Engined AP missiles, which are strong enough to break through most armor and are standard carried on Modern Zokesian Ships. She also carries 2 Straight shot \u0022HV\u0022 minimissiles on the sides, to take out fighters, although these have been proven to be very difficult to aim due to the Drek\u0027s size and slow SAS control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BjkWldK.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/BjkWldK.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo zeke\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.who will you be allying with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHKA, GMI, or the highest bidder?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Halban","CreatedById":89536,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T06:10:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00222SPOOKY4U\u0022 data-cite=\u00222SPOOKY4U\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid you make sure to check the listed mods?

Any person that would want to make said impact would logically read the original post. It is unclear to me why you do not satisfy the parameters as you clearly want to make a positive impact. However it does not matter, the problem is now rectified as you know possess the required information to turn your post into a submission of quality, one worthy of praise.
