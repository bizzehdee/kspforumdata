This Chapter is the tale of the first trip to Duna, a footsteps and flag mission. While it is ongoing there will be other AARs alongside it for missions done in the Kerbin system to Mun and Minmus. The Duna mission is a little more long winded one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this AAR I\u0027m using the following mods in career mode with a custom Tech Tree. Actions on the Fly, Editor Extensions, Firespitter, KAS, Kethane, Mechjeb, Science Log, Universe Replacer, City lights and Clouds, Interstellar, and Procedural Fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also limiting the time it takes to use science points gained by exploration and experiments.

I mean Telemetry. Ha!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaldin\u0027s smile slipped a little. It wasn\u0027t even as if what Jedwig had said was mean or anything, just... something about him oozed self-importance. That was the third time Caldin had tried to greet Jedwig, the new Commander of the upcoming Duna mission, and the third time he\u0027d felt somehow snubbed... without actually anything solid he could put his finger on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You too huh?\u0022 Came a voice from beside him\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, Hi Lildel.

I was with him in school and he is a natural mathematician. Doesn\u0027t need a calculator most of the time. Sad to say he is a genius, both in maths and physics, and from what I hear a very good pilot too. Doesn\u0027t make many friends though.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thank Kod it isn\u0027t just me!\u0022 Caldin said as he heard another \u0027Ha!\u0027 from Jedwig further up the corridor \u0022He still tries to make friends though huh?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah.\u0022 Caldin said with a snort. \u0022He hasn\u0027t a clue. Genius, but... dumb.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChuckling the two Mission Control officers headed back to the break-room for some well earned snacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And he was at four o\u0027clock, buzzing down like a bat out of Heck.\u0022 Jeb said, grinning from ear to ear as he enthused in front of the recruits \u0022My prop noise cut out a lot so I didn\u0027t know his engine had cut out till he slid right past me. We were out fifty miles from shore, and when I saw him bail... well, I knew he\u0027d never make it in the drink till a rescue chopper came in.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe stood up on the bench in the lockers as the various blue shirts gathered round to hear a daring tale from fabled Jebediah Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I couldn\u0027t snatch him from the sea once he was down, so I dove down, rolled over, then pulled up, driving him into the rear seat before he even opened his chute!

This wasn\u0027t a lecture hall! But Jedwig seemed to just accept it and nodded to the guy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um, Commander? What do you mean inefficient?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If the other aircraft was coming in from a bearing 120 degrees, and descending rapidly with no engine, the best intercept would have simply been to nose down, pull left to match heading and pull up. That way you wouldn\u0027t have to do more maneuvering to survive the encounter after having retrieved the errant pilot.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the trainees were looking sort of stunned. Someone QUESTIONING the great Jeb\u0027s performance? One or two though were nodding agreement and Jeb was starting to get ticked off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh huh. And of course you\u0027d know from being in that situation before right?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Doesn\u0027t enter into it.\u0022 Jedwig said condescendingly \u0022It\u0027s all a matter of numbers, vectors and trajectories. I understand you failed vector maths, didn\u0027t you Jeb?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETeeth ground as Jeb glared at Jedwig, but before he could give a retort the offending idiot... Right, his name was Jedwig Jeb reminded himself... looked at his watch and sighed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ah well, gotta go now. Real Kerbonautics to do. I believe it\u0027s a training sim for conditions on the Duna surface. See you later Jeb.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with that the guy strode off without another word leaving Jeb seething behind him. He was just starting to see red and wondering how far he could throw his shoe when a hand descended on his shoulder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not worth it son.\u0022 Gene\u0027s calm voice said. \u0022True he\u0027s good, and a maths genius, but he\u0027s not a test pilot. He doesn\u0027t have the feel for it. There aren\u0027t enough of that breed, and sooner or later Jedwig is going to figure out that there are some problems you can\u0027t solve via mathematics.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly Jeb calmed and stared after the guy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I just hope I\u0027m there to rub his face in it when he does!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-22T04:58:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2014 04:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Patupi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eupdating chapters\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T00:11:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat does AAR even mean? i heard it said before but i thought it was only 1 person working on whatever a AAR is\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T00:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBlast off\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus thirty seconds Duna One.\u0022 Gene said into the mic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Roger Flight. Pre-flight board green. Checks complete.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least the smarminess disappeared when he was getting ready for a launch, and he really was good at his job. The guy just had no clue how to relate to people and didn\u0027t handle sudden surprises well. Odd given what he was chosen for, but the guy could usually work out what was going to happen ahead of time, and was really good at it. Thus he rarely had surprises to deal with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene sighed. He\u0027d voted against Jedwig for the Duna mission, but political and scientific heads had picked him, and the guy was good at his job. Gene just had to keep telling himself that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was just that nagging suspicion that was lurking at the back of Gene\u0027s head that something was going to go horribly wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002201-Blasting off.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Lalock%20Valley/01-Blasting%20off.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus Five... four... three... two... one... and liftoff!\u0022 Gene said as the fiery blaze came from the massive stack of solid boosters staged under the already large section above. The Duna One system seemed a bit of a kludge at first sight, but Wernher and Dunkel had gone over it carefully, both when it was being designed and as it was assembled. The ship was good, more stable than Munar One or Two by the look of it as he watched the ship rise atop it\u0027s pillar of flame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Launch clamps clear.\u0022 Jedwig\u0027s voice came over the line \u0022Lost one rear view camera in port assembly. Others are sending true.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe camera showed Jedwig\u0027s gaze flicking rapidly across the panels, but his face appeared calm as he analyzed all that data. Jeb didn\u0027t need to. Although Jeb followed the plots Mission Control worked out for him, he\u0027d proven time and again that he could fly the capsule just from feeling the vibration in his seat, watching the horizon change and gauging the constellations visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene remembered those early days lobbing rockets to orbit. Kerbal Two had gone badly, but Jeb\u0027s instincts had saved the mission, and his own life, when the nav system had shorted out. Luckily the rest of the system had been intact, but they hadn\u0027t really been sure. Before they\u0027d even been able to lock down what the problem was Jeb had started working out his course and had ignored all the controls because he didn\u0027t know which was reading right and which weren\u0027t. He\u0027d made it fine of course, and been a heck of lot less insufferable than Jedwig was on a daily basis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA smile came to Gene\u0027s face as he remembered those early days. Dangerous, yes. Sometimes they\u0027d had some spectacular failures, but no loss of life yet, right up to today. Gene knew, somewhere deep down, that that wouldn\u0027t last. Sooner or later they\u0027d have some catastrophe they couldn\u0027t fix and a brave Kerbonaut would pay the price. He hoped it wouldn\u0027t be this mission though. Gene just wanted to put it off as long as he could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jettisoning Main boosters in three... two... one...

These were the shorter \u0027Blam in a Can\u0027 garbage can solid rockets so didn\u0027t burn for long, but they pushed it higher and higher, reaching over twenty thousand meters before they cut out and were set free.

Normally Caldin was the one who told the ship when the plot looked good. Heck, even Jeb didn\u0027t do that, and he often knew when things were out of whack before the crew down here did!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission Control monitored things carefully, but this time nothing blew out, jammed or otherwise caused a problem and the Apoapsis lifted higher and higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Circularizing Flight.\u0022 Jedwig said calmly. \u0022Fourth stage is down to twenty percent fuel.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe course plotted by Deep Scan Nine was showing a smooth flight, easy even burn and an almost dead parabolic gravity turn to orbit.

Costs are high, and getting higher. This Duna mission is seen as more of a sideshow, something for the masses to goggle over. We really should have waited till we can send a bigger ship.

Have to roll with the punches, eh?\u0022 He turned to the controls and whispered something to someone else at Mission Control through his mike before turning back to Jeb. \u0022Look, I\u0027m a little busy right now. Jedwig is going to be doing EVA, some external checks and then some Kerbolar studies with the materials lab. Maybe you could come back later?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure.\u0022 Jeb said, standing up with his koffee. \u0022Say hi to junior for me will ya?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene just shook his head.

You\u0027ll have direct local control on the data feed on the primary antenna. Secondary is still relaying back to Kerbin. Please leave it alone.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Of course.\u0022 Jedwig said idly as the data started coming in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, no visual data. Who would send a satellite out here and not put a camera on it? Still the Kethane scans and the low res radar returns helped a bit. At least he had course, current altitude map to go on. The target, the entrance to the Lalock Valley, seemed fairly flat. He\u0027d be able to do some checks on the scan down the valley that they wanted (He should have brought his theodolite! Hah! Ah, he should be a comedian!), do some soil samples for hoped for trace elements of kethane, and maybe do some tests for making that concrete they wanted from Dunan materials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig frankly gave that a low chance of success. It would be very economical to build the majority of the housing on any Dunan base from the local sand, but the iron oxides estimated to be present would mean a lot of processing to get any kind of solid building blocks. They\u0027d need some hefty tools to build bricks up here! Maybe it\u0027d be better if they could just mine for metals and build true shelters? Ah, that\u0027s just a pipe dream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith half an eye he ran through the figures for the approach vector, aligned it with the Lalock Valley during the aerobrake, adjusted the altitude to get a good swing around Duna for slight inclination change, then ran some numbers on the thermal absorbtion. Well within parameters!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings were looking up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of his attention was on the view. Duna was growing behind him, slowly swelling as he got closer. It didn\u0027t look as inviting as he thought it would, being slightly... menacing somehow. Maybe it was the lack of any water? No, the Mun didn\u0027t look dangerous. He was no good at conceptual things like this, and Mission Control would think him a wimp if he asked. Maybe he could check it up when he got back?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Aerobrake and capture plotted.\u0022 He said idly into the mike while scanning the Kethane map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey already had found from the KM3 satellite that the Kethane predicted to be all along the Lalock Valley was only on the northwestern tip, thus his proposed landing in the valley mouth there. He wondered who had named the valley? It sounded vaguely familiar... something relating to Lenham Observatory he thought. Well, maybe he could look that up too when he got back?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis current data did show the Kethane at the valley mouth was richer than expected, hopefully improving the prospect of getting trace amounts in the surface sample. He didn\u0027t have much to do on this mission (Heck, he didn\u0027t even have a rover!) but at least it looked like what he did have to do would amount to something scientifically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger Duna One. We\u0027re confirming your plot now.\u0022 Gene replied, after the obligatory minute\u0027s delay. Jedwig waited a while and soon Gene was back. \u0022Plot looks good.

The samples corroborate the orbital scans, so I think we can say positively the resonance method of scanning will work well on most environments.

The projected mass for the base is huge. It\u0027s got to support fourteen Kerbals in long term habitat.

At present the stress on large engines mean we are starting with de low thrust, orbital versions first, but still, a few of these should allow us to haul the entire assembly to the Mun and land it in one piece... However...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I knew there was going to be a catch.\u0022 Jeb said, leaning over to Gene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022... HOWEVER!\u0022 Wernher repeated, staring at Jeb. \u0022It seems there is an issue with fuel for such a huge assembly. Current predictions suggest it vill need to be refueled in Kerbin orbit. And, depending on how easy zuch things are, in Munar orbit as well prior to landing.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wait, why would we need both? Surely it can have enough tankage to get there and land?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Possibly, but zis system would require a huge payload to be launched from KSC to refuel it.

I think it could fly after Jeb\u0027s next trip to the Mun. I also think he should check out our projected landing site. After that ve can attempt the test miner, then go for the full VKM zystem and use it to refuel the carrier for the Base.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene however looked increasingly worried through this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wernher.

There are plans for a one Kerbal lander on the Carrier to enable a return for data that cannot be sent... but nothing more. Vhy?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The council will not approve this until we have a way to safely get the crew of Munbase back home. I think we need to get the Rescue Project done before the Mun Mission. Perhaps even before Jeb\u0027s recon of the base site. Then he can double check the Rescue ship is functional.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher nodded, deep in thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yah, yah. Dat vould vork.

Plus you\u0027ve been in the states for decades. I\u0027m pretty sure you know the difference between \u0027Yah\u0027 and \u0027Yes\u0027.

Goodbye Jeb!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say he slammed the door.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You really know how to make friends Jeb.\u0022 Gene said, slapping him on the back, then turning back to his console.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, it\u0027s a gift.\u0022 Jeb said with a grin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig hadn\u0027t been here that long and was already exhausted. He\u0027d trekked out to the base of the rise leading to the Lalock Valley itself and taken samples. He\u0027d done spectrometry on the sun through the wispy Dunan atmosphere. He\u0027d cataloged the sand analysis results into grain sizes. There wasn\u0027t much science left to do with his limited equipment, and Mission Control was becoming rather annoying. He was making reports, then had to stop the report to report live to Mission Control! It was idiotic!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Lalock%20Valley/31%20Safety%20checks%20on%20landing%20legs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002231 Safety checks on landing legs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now he was going over the vessel with a fine tooth comb. He did not want any malfunctions or missed breakages on the ship to mess up his return to Kerbin! After finishing with the landing leg check he moved under, crouching to examine the engine nozzles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Flight, All systems report green on landing legs. Proceeding with engine checklist and physical examination.\u0022 He intoned while he got busy with the check itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Lalock%20Valley/32%20Safety%20checks%20on%20engines.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002232 Safety checks on engines.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took so long that Flight called back before he\u0027d finished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger Duna One. You\u0027ll need to hustle. Your flight plan calls for launch in fifteen minutes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJedwig snorted. Not HIS flight plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Negative Flight. Vector off orbit in.... thirty five minutes.\u0022 He said, checking his suit chronometer. \u0022Surface launch in twenty two minutes and counting. Everything is set.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHah, see? From the muttering in the background a few minutes later he knew they appreciated him lessening their load. Besides, he was sure his course was better than what they could produce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a final check complete on engine number six he started climbing up to repack the chutes (just in case he had to abort the launch part way through and attempt to re-land). He\u0027d got some serious practice in this back at KSC,and the rhythm of folding fabric, lining it up to the actuators and rams, then snapping the cover down became rather enjoyable. Finally the last parachute was sealed and he clambered back up to the capsule and hauled himself inside. With a satisfying clunk the hatch sealed and he began pressurizing the capsule. Checking again he still had over five minutes left. Plenty of time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Lalock%20Valley/33%20Repacking%20Chutes.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002233 Repacking Chutes.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m ready and standing by for launch Flight. Timer set to T minus five... now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know what\u0027s annoying?\u0022 Gene whispered to Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb jabbed a thumb at the screen where Jedwig could be seen doing his preflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Um, that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Besides that.\u0022 Gene said with a smirk. \u0022No, what\u0027s annoying is that his tendancy to try to do everything himself will become rather useful later. Out at Jool with the excessive time delays in communications... well, the crews of those ships will be effectively on their own for anything that needs an answer right now! But here at Duna it isn\u0027t neccessary and I\u0027m pretty sure he isn\u0027t even checking out our data. He just assumes his is better.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb just shook his head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022He\u0027s going to find out how that kind of thing can come back and hit you in the stomach one of these days. And if he doesn\u0027t I\u0027ll be happy to demonstrate!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a chuckle Gene went back to his console.
