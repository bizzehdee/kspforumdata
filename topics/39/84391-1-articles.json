Then taking screenshots from each, filtering the correct RGB channels than merging the images, voila old-school 3D images for red/blue glasses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest shot I managed was this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1087.photobucket.com/albums/j475/mrwoof3/KSP/Kerb3D_zps3e50cceb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Kerb3D_zps3e50cceb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the rest suffered from hyperstereopsis (effectively having your eyes too far apart).
