His idea for a card game sounded interesting and I posed a question as to how he was going about developing it, and whether he\u0027d considered using the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.vassalengine.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVASSAL Engine\u003C/a\u003E or not. I myself have had recent experience working with VASSAL; that was for a board game but it included a heavy card-playing element. Since then I\u0027ve been thinking about making a VASSAL-based Kerbal Card Game on my own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, today I\u0027m announcing the commencement of work on the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EKerbal Card Program - A KSP-inspired Card Game\u003C/span\u003E. So far it\u0027s basically the same as Atanar\u0027s game as he described it back in May, and I\u0027ve credited him in the first draft of the rules (which, incidentally, are not yet complete). I have been spending time gathering up data - some of you may have noted me asking about Knowledge Base information yesterday; this is why I was doing that. So far the game\u0027s got a lot of clunk to it - it\u0027s hard to take something like the Tsiokolvsky Rocket Equation and turn it into something usable in a card game - but I am making progress. Yesterday, I knocked together a few prototype cards; thought I\u0027d go ahead and share them with y\u0027all. Yes, they look like crap at the moment; cut me a break, I was using MS Paint. The Round-8 prototype was the very first card I tried, which is why it looks worse than the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/HNTg8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

You can tell by the color of the edges what kind of card it is (red=fuel, blue=pod, yellow=engine, green=crew/power, grey=structural). Red\u002BBlue\u002BYellow\u002BGreen=one rocket. If your total mass is less than the thrust provided by the Engine, it can take off. How much delta-V it has depends again on mass (the mass of the fuel tank itself is figured into the delta-V) as well as the Isp of the Engine. Your crew/power card will give you a certain number of six-sided dice you roll for the mission. You declare the location of your target (which has a delta-V requirement and a number of points associated with it) and attempt to beat a certain difficulty threshhold - working right now with (points - structure \u002B pilot\u0027s stupidity). Meet or exceed that number and the mission succeeds; you collect the points you shot for. Miss, and the mission fails. If your mission includes a landing and you\u0027re the first one to do it, you collect an action card; these have various effects. I\u0027m setting the point threshold for victory at 50 points for the moment but that\u0027s something that\u0027s going to take tinkering; in Atanar\u0027s original game idea, the game didn\u0027t end until all the locations had been visited - struck me as being potentially a very long game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still working through the specifics of the rules (in particular the effect of multiple fuel tanks - something absolutely essential in a real game of KSP - is giving me fits).

Figured out how to shut off the autocorrect so the red squiggly lines shouldn\u0027t be an issue. I have found that Publisher can save out images as PNGs, but my options for sizes and resolutions are fairly limited and no matter what I pick the text gets blurred quite a bit. I may have to resort to the Alt-PrintScreen method. It\u0027ll take longer but I think the images will look sharper as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T21:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, let it never be said that learning the Python programming language has never paid off for me; this afternoon I\u0027ve finished all the graphical work the project\u0027s going to need.

Good news is that it shouldn\u0027t take too long. Bad news is that finding the time to do it might be problematic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
