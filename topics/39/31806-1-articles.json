I had also hoped for a more relaxing night on design instead of working with quirks and quarks and whatever else may come my way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to set up a Twitch account, full 1080p, (I hope) and it just streams me fiddling around with my SSMET mission.

I made a mess of things on my last save, so it could be an interesting night of experimentation with fuel lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf successful, and that\u0027s a big IF, then I will be conducting further Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) with the Engine assembly, cutting the engines and hoping to Kerb that this thing glides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat in itself will take hours, however, If I manage to get through that, I\u0027m going to redesign the P2 to the much prefered P1 aesthetic.
