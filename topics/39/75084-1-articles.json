The world is on the brink of change. Two countries race to achieve a goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade. Many men have made the impossible. In the beginning of the race, Yuri Gagarin made the first steps into space... Alan Shepard soon after followed, leading America also into space. The world believes that they have made the first ever steps into space...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter One:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022That\u0027s one small step for man... One giant leap, for mankind\u0022. I stepped off the LM footpads and began to scan the foothills in front of me. It was then I realized that I had made the single largest achievement in mankind. However before I could compete that thought, Buzz called down to me, \u0022don\u0027t forget to get those lunar samples\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I look back up to him as he hands the soil collector down to me. Then I proceed to walk away from the LM before I immediately begin to trip under my own feet. So I wobble myself up and down trying to get to a safe distance from the LM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After getting to the location, I begin scooping some of the top soil into the container. \u0022Neil, how\u0027s the collection coming along? I\u0027m beginning to exit the LM now\u0022. I turn around and see Buzz beginning to get out of the LM when I asked, \u0022Did you get the flag?\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022No, I didn\u0027t. Let me grab that before I close up the LM\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Buzz, we are on a set schedule here...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Neil, did you get the 100 grams yet?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022No, not yet... I\u0027m working it\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I continue digging around, when I scoop up a thin layer of lunar dust and see a small thin paper object buried under a few more layers of soil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Buzz... I found something...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As I continued to dig deeper, I found the object was some sort of a flag... But on the moon? Impossible. There is no way that any sort of man-made material could make it\u0027s way onto the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Neil, what did you find?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Buzz... You won\u0027t believe it. I\u0027ve found some sort of a flag...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I bend down to get a closer look, and as I do so, I rise my sun visor. I pull it out the dust to see that the flag is written in a language... That is definitely not from any on earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Is a Russian flag Neil?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022No... It\u0027s something else... This flag... It\u0027s not any flag from earth\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022It\u0027s an.... Alien flag?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Can\u0027t be...

We are gonna have to process this... Are you sure that\u0027s what you see Neil?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022No doubt Houston...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Then Buzz offers a comment, \u0022Then this means...

Now, the proofread version:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine stopped burning with a few struggled sputters. The ship groaned, thankful to be released from the force of thrust. Aside from the life support, the only sound in the pod was the nervous breathing of Beck. He was the first Kerbal to orbit the Mun. He had done it, but he couldn\u0027t bring himself to look at his instrumentation. A slight mistake had taken him on an unplanned course, and he was not sure if he had enough fuel to push his perigee into the atmosphere. A few rolls of ductape and notebooks filled with frantic calculations and scribbles kept him company as they bounced between the walls. His eyes were fixed on one of the lights above the porthole, reminiscing to his childhood, pushed by fear to delay the inevitable as far as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, he knew he was being silly. It would be best to find his fate out now, and prepare accordingly, but he had time. Approximately six hours, in fact, assuming the best happens. He blinked, and felt the pain of staring into a bright light. He shifted his view below, and stared at the currently black porthole. His vision slowly returned, and he looked into the sea of stars lightyears away. It dawned on him that he could spend the rest of his life staring at them, or at Kerbin through this little window outside. It felt strange, being so close to death, knowing the irrelavent little chemical reaction that he was could end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeck found it curious, how his little pod didn\u0027t seem to be in a crisis at all. It was as bright as on launch day, and the noise of the life support comforted him in an odd way. There were no alarms, no red lights. The ship didn\u0027t realize that the safety of the living, organic being it was meant to harbor depended on a few green numbers on a little screen. It didn\u0027t see that he would slowly starve to death, and be driven mad by the instincts designed to keep him alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis eyes started to wander. First over the controls, then the engine heat gauge, the empty fuel gauge, and finally onto the black screen displaying the green numbers which commanded his fate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPe: 92,745 m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeck screamed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceJunk Corps.

Even an epic like \u003Cem\u003EThe Grand Tour\u003C/em\u003E which took a year to write, has a thread of over 245 pages and just short of 370,000 views still only has 2,448 replies and quite a few of those are updates and comments from the author.
