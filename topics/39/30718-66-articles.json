Hmmm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerm leaves have been consistently described as a being a glossy green or dark glossy green colour. That\u0027s more reminiscent of an evergreen. On the other hand, Kerm do have leaves and not needles. We\u0027ve also seen that agriculture does peter out towards the northern reaches of Kerbin, suggesting that there is a limit to where Kerm can successfully grow. As you say, frozen ground would make things difficult for Kerm fibres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBiochemically, some degree of cold resistance isn\u0027t a particular problem. Various Terran species have evolved natural antifreezes, to prevent cell disruption due to ice crystal growth so I see no problem in, in principle, with Kerm having a similar ability. The antifreezes could even be a serendipitous byproduct of different metabolic processes in Kerban species. Kerm neural activity is also (as discussed earlier) based on some kind of electrical signalling, which wouldn\u0027t be overly affected by the cold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest guess?\u00A0 They\u0027re evergreen and somewhat cold resistant although that resistance does have an upper limit. They don\u0027t go dormant but (and I rather like this so thanks for bringing this up!), fibre growth is probably inhibited by the cold, for self-protection. That implies, that if you\u0027re planting a new Kerm for Awakening, you\u0027re probably best to do it in summer so that Knitting of the individual trees can proceed as quickly as possible. In turn, that means that each tree is as young as possible (with fewer memories and life experience to integrate) when they cross the sapience threshold, thus not making the Awakening process any harder than it needs to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe haven\u0027t seen this yet because all the Kerm we\u0027ve met so far have been growing in equatorial climes or not too far removed from them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes that sound vaguely plausible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-06T12:51:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2019 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-07T04:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223682658\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002230718\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221570366246\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261025\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, KSK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes that sound vaguely plausible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait a sec, so... is THIS a proto-Kerm?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002240336977229ba2865a57b.jpg?itok=g_WvMGZ9\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022123.37\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 width=\u0022622\u0022 src=\u0022https://extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/images/2018-05/40336977229ba2865a57b.jpg?itok=g_WvMGZ9\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPacific Madrona tree, native to the mild Pacific Northwest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlossy, evergreen leaves in a cluster, sort of \u003Cem\u003Efuzzy\u003C/em\u003E underneath:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226573d58efbd201947cfc13bdd81700b7.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.pinimg.com/originals/65/73/d5/6573d58efbd201947cfc13bdd81700b7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoesn\u0027t smell of cinnamon but the bark kinda-sorta looks like it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ArbutusM5.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022127.95\u0022 height=\u0022380\u0022 width=\u0022297\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.sevenoaksnativenursery.com/files/2010/06/ArbutusM5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m told it makes a wonderful tea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAnd\u003C/em\u003E the clincher: they\u0027re nearly impossible to transplant, doing so is all but guaranteed to kill the tree.

There was indeed plenty of work to go around but the combined decades of experience from the older hands, an established network of contractors, and not having to build everything from scratch from creatively salvaged equipment, went a long way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter quiet words from Geneney and Bob, the rocket-spotters began to get over their initial awe and tendency to become tongue-tied if spoken to by one of the kerbonauts, and set to work; their unfailing good cheer and willingness to do anything and everything to help, lifting spirits around the site. After a chance conversation with Malmy, where he admitted to \u2018doing a bit of diving but only as a hobby really,\u2019 Eldrin was transferred to the kerbonaut training team, much to the unspoken envy of his friends. After helping to upgrade the training Pool, he spent long hours as a safety diver, helping the \u003Ci\u003EEve 4\u003C/i\u003E crew practice for their upcoming spacewalks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrew selection for \u003Ci\u003EEve 4\u003C/i\u003E caused a brief undercurrent of resentment amongst a number of the older volunteers who remembered the original \u2018we all build them \u2013 we all fly them\u2019 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E management philosophy. As the senior flight director, Geneney was careful to make time for everyone to air their views, whilst remaining adamant that he needed an experienced crew for the first real \u003Ci\u003ETenacity \u003C/i\u003Eassembly flight. Barrie, he noted out, had flown with both Wilford and Kerke, all of the crew apart from Bob had flown at least twice, whilst Bob himself was the senior liaison engineer with Rockomax and one of the last Munar kerbonauts aboard \u003Ci\u003EPioneer 6\u003C/i\u003E. The fact that Bob was also a founding member of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and one of the Original Three kerbonauts who\u2019d flown on \u003Ci\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/i\u003E, never needed to be mentioned. Besides, as Geneney pointed out, there would be plenty of \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u003C/i\u003E flights to go around, especially once both Bridge modules were on-orbit and the growing station could accommodate a crew of eight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSensitive to the developing mood, Jeb and Geneney quietly moved some of the most capable dissenters into the flight control or mission planning teams in the hope that training for their more demanding roles would give them less free time to complain as well as putting them closer to the flight line. Barrie and Kerke, both well used to working within the more stratified Rockomax management structure, proved to be adept at smoothing ruffled egos and pulling the support teams together around the crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomewhat to Bill\u2019s surprise, progress on the four-seat, Mark 2.5 capsule turned out to be comparatively smooth although, as anticipated, fitting in a fifth acceleration couch did prove to be unfeasible without completely reworking the entry, descent, and landing profile for the new capsule. The mission planning and flight test teams unanimously voted to put such a radical overhaul on hold although the more optimistic engineers did point out that a five-seater capsule would be useful for future Starseed flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn complete contrast to the capsule work, refurbishing the launchpad turned out to be a seemingly never-ending list of repairs and replacements. One week it would be residual hypergolics corroding a hastily decommissioned fuel line. The next week it would be a seized rotator in the crew access gantry. The week after that it would be a cracked propellant storage tank followed by stuck valves in the core stage propellant feed. After one particularly frustrating day, Geneney declared that evening to be a \u2018good old-fashioned \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E beach party\u2019 and despite a distinct shortage of food and drink, a rousing game of shepherdball followed by a bonfire and a rendition of the \u003Ci\u003EBallad of Kerbal 1\u003C/i\u003E plus assorted other pop favourites from Bob, did much to lift the Pad Team\u2019s black mood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the preparations were finished. Everyone at the Barkton Space Centre, from the flight control team to the janitors, lined the road from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launchpad to watch \u003Ci\u003EEve 4\u2019s\u003C/i\u003E rollout. To nobody\u2019s surprise, the rocket-spotters were right at the front, waving flags and sporting faded red hats emblazoned with the original tilted rocket logo from Jebediah Kerman\u2019s Junkyard and Spacecraft Parts Company.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeither was anyone surprised when a faulty Go/No Go signal caused the pad autosequencer to abort the first launch attempt. After replacing a microswitch in Decoupler A and three more days of exhaustive testing, \u003Ci\u003EEve 4\u003C/i\u003E was rolled back out to the launchpad. This time the countdown proceeded flawlessly and, right at the appointed moment, the booster thundered off the pad, sending Bob, Barrie, Wilfred and Kerke on their way to a rendezvous with \u003Ci\u003ETenacity.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt looks like you\u2019re pointing straight out but it\u2019s really hard to tell from here,\u201D Bob reported. He pulled himself over to the edge of the window and craned his head, trying to get a better view of the PAL assembly arm. \u201CCan just see past the first elbow if I squint. Yep that looks straight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther around \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u2019s\u003C/i\u003E bridge from the rear-view windows, Barrie sat in front of a row of monitors, a pair of hand controllers and a bank of toggle switches within easy reach. \u201CNot a problem, Bob \u2013 the system was never designed to be driven by eye.\u201D She flipped a switch. \u201COkay, Flight \u2013 bringing up third section. She eased back one of the controllers watching as the next part of the assembly arm unfolded. \u201CAnd the next one.\u201D A red light lit up above the main monitor, accompanied by a low buzzing noise. Barrie immediately let go of her controls and glanced at the indicator panel. \u201CHuh \u2013 current draw warning on number three elbow joint.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a pause from Mission Control. \u003Ci\u003E\u201CWe think you\u2019re getting some stiction on the bearing, Barrie. Try working it a little \u2013 no more than five-degree excursions either way.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWill do. Switching to diagnostics.\u201D Barrie touched a control and the view on one monitor flicked out, replaced by a telemetry display. \u201CRotation to FINE.\u201D The red light flickered off then lit up again. Barrie frowned and nudged her controller in the opposite direction. For a minute she thought the problem was fixed, then the buzzer sounded again and the warning light flickered erratically. \u201CNo joy, Flight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u201CUnderstood. Can you give us a close up please?\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CComing right up.\u201D Barrie pulled out a smaller control panel from under her console, touched a button and ran her thumb over a trackwheel. The view on another of her monitors zoomed in on the malfunctioning joint and she studied it for a long moment. \u201CNothing obviously wrong with it from this angle. I\u2019m going to try rotating the wrist joint.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u201CGo ahead.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u003C/i\u003E crew floated over to Barrie\u2019s console, watching over her shoulder as her largest monitor showed a view of a section of the manipulator arm turning slowly through space. Barrie kept one eye on her indicator panel, which remained resolutely free of warning lights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot getting any problems with the wrist joint, Flight, and I\u2019m still not seeing anything wrong with the elbow joint from the outside.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u201CWe concur, Barrie. I\u2019ll get the team on it down here and let you know once they\u2019ve got anything to report.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob checked the hose locks on Kerke and Wilfred\u2019s EVA suits one last time, studied the readouts on their chest units and gave his crewmates a thumbs up. He wormed his way past the fourth acceleration couch now installed in the lower equipment bay and pulled himself up the docking tunnel, through the hatch and into \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u003C/i\u003E\u2019s far roomier airlock. Double-checking that the airlock door was sealed and locked, he manoeuvred through the forward gangway before climbing along the access way to the Bridge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAll set.\u201D Bob floated over to the forward windows, listening to Wilfred and Kerke running through the capsule egress checklist as he went.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHe watched \u003Ci\u003EEve 4\u003C/i\u003E\u2019s crew hatch open and a mirrored helmet emerge, followed by the shoulders and upper torso of Kerke\u2019s spacesuit. After fumbling with the hatch rim for a moment, Kerke pulled himself up and out into open space, the stiff, fabric-wrapped cord of his safety tether flapping behind him. He swung his legs back until they were parallel with the service module hull, tucked his boots into the nearest foot restraints and stood up and waved. Bob grinned and waved back, before drifting over to Barrie\u2019s console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey watched Wilfred emerge from the capsule and secure his tether, before he and Kerke began making their methodical way over the Bridge module and across the hub, reporting each tether change and significant manoeuvre to Mission Control as they went. Aboard \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u003C/i\u003E, Barrie switched from camera to camera to keep the spacewalkers in view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, EVA-1. We\u2019re at the work site and the joint is in easy reach. Nice positioning there by Barrie.\u201D Kerke paused. \u201CThe lubrication port looks clean, no visual contamination or leakages.\u201D Bob watched him operate his helmet visors. \u201CNothing unusual through the crossed polarisers either. I think we\u2019re good.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u201CCopy EVA-1. You\u2019re clear to proceed with the interface test.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob watched Kerke set himself by the now re-folded assembly arm, the cylindrical bulk of a lubricant dispenser tethered to his waist. At the bottom of his screen, the edge of Wilford\u2019s shadow could just be seen. Kerke unhooked the grease gun and lifted it into position, lining its nozzle up with the receiver port on the arm joint, the dark grey coating applied to its oversized bayonet fitting, a stark contrast to its gleaming barrel. He moved the nozzle tip up to the port, rotated it slightly and then slid it home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, Flight. We\u2019ve got a good interface. I\u2019m locking the dispenser now.\u201D There was a long pause. \u201CDispenser locked. Felt pretty smooth.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u201CGood to hear, EVA-1. Okay, we want you to take a one-quarter turn and check for leakage.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood.\u201D Kerke shifted his grip on the dispenser and twisted its base, feeling it click into place even through his heavy suit gloves. \u201CGood tactile feedback. No obvious back pressure.\u201D He leaned forward to inspect the bayonet seal. \u201CNo leakage.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u201CCopy. Take it another quarter-turn and we\u2019ll work the joint.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood.\u201D Kerke twisted the dispenser base through another click before disconnecting it from the assembly arm and joining Wilford atop the hub. They watched the arm pivot away from them before slowly rotating about the newly lubricated elbow joint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Tenacity. Still getting a current draw warning.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u201COkay, Tenacity. EVA-2, you\u2019re up. Another half-turn of grease and we\u2019ll try this again. Barrie, please go ahead and move the arm back into range.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWill do.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother turn and a half later, Kerke and Wilford stood atop the Hub, both with arms floating free and the fingers of their gloves splayed open, listening to the running dialogue between Barrie and the flight control team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s the only thing that makes sense, Flight. I just don\u2019t think that joint was properly packed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u201CWe concur, Barrie. We\u2019ll pass the word along to the PAL team to requalify their filler. In the meantime, we\u2019ll take a look at that telemetry - best guess is that we\u2019ll need to take a second pass at this before clearing the assembly arm for construction. Right now, though, it\u2019s time to call it a day. EVA-1 and EVA-2, please ingress at the capsule.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe grainy, slightly earthy smell of reconstituted natas filled \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u2019s\u003C/i\u003E hub module. Wilford disconnected his ration pouch from the hot water spigot and kneaded it before joining it to a second pouch and squeezing its contents onto his natas. He discarded the second pouch, snipped the top off the first and enthusiastically dug into his breakfast, amidst the sudden sharp aroma of pureed pickle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke looked at him askance. \u201CWhy so complicated? Couldn\u2019t you just package\u2026 whatever that stuff is, in the same pouch as your oatmeal?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford swallowed his mouthful. \u201CThis way you get properly cold pickle on hot natas. Package them up in the same pouch and you\u2019d end up with hot pickle too.\u201D Wilford looked around the Hub in mock despair. \u201CI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re flying with a kerbal who\u2019s seriously suggesting hot pickle for breakfast.\u201D He paused. \u201CBesides, the vinegar would soak into the dry natas and that would taste vile.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke just shook his head before hunting in the breakfast locker and emerging with a pouch of scrambled egg with creva and a foil package. Wilford looked up with interest. \u201CWhat\u2019ve you got there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCrumb free flatbread, supposedly.\u201D Kerke tore open the foil and pulled out a flaccid white pancake. He bit off one corner and chewed it thoughtfully. \u201CNot bad. Bit rubbery but tastes alright.\u201D He left the flatbread floating by a window and busied himself with his eggs and creva. \u201CPity you can\u2019t make a proper breakfast roll in zero-G.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHave a word with Derny when we get home,\u201D Bob said cheerfully. \u201CHe likes a challenge. Bet your roll would be improved by some good old fashioned Kolan breakfast pickle too.\u201D Kerke gave him a look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBarrie opened her mouth to speak, when the radio crackled to life. \u003Ci\u003E\u201CMorning all. Welcome to another fine day in space!\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob raised his eyebrows. \u201CMorning, Jeb.

Go ahead, Guidance.\u201D Geneney crossed his fingers under his console, listening to the guidance and systems teams going through their checklists. Then, spots of flame flickered around the edges of the main screen. A hairline crack appeared between the PAL and the cargo pallet, slowly widening as the space tug pulled away. More puffs of flame and the interior of the pallet docking adaptor edged into sight, the view of \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u003C/i\u003E behind it beginning to recede. Unseen, Geneney clenched his fist under his console as a second, much louder, buzz of applause and conversation filled the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcellent work, everyone.

Unfolding all sections.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside, a bundle of thick, fabric-wrapped tubes, linked by solid, disc-like hubs emerged from the top of the PAL and unfolded into a straight line. Then, one section at a time, the manipulator arm twisted about itself, lining up its grapple tip with the cargo pallet docked to \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u003C/i\u003E\u2019s hub module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSwitching camera.\u201D Barrie\u2019s eyes were locked on her monitor screen, now showing a view straight down the manipulator arm towards the waiting girder section.

Extracting spoke segment.\u201D Barrie took a deep breath and pulled back on her controller. The indicator lights above her screen flickered amber as the girder tugged free of its restraining clamps and then winked out. Barrie blew out her cheeks with relief. \u201CSegment extracted, Flight.

She let go of her controls for a moment, rolling her shoulders to relieve their stiffness and smiled as Wilford handed her an icy cold squeeze bulb of water, before heading over to his own station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, Wilford.\u201D She took a long drink, before attaching the bulb to the side of her console and flexing her fingers. \u201COK, Flight.

Almost there \u2013 try backing up and taking it one notch clockwise.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClenching her jaw, Barrie worked her controls, making the minute adjustment before winding the manipulator arm towards \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u003C/i\u003E\u2019s hull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFour lights!

Barrie quietly pulled up the aft camera view on her screen, leaning back in her seat to take in the blues and greens of Kerbin shining through the new girder section attached to \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u2019\u003C/i\u003Es hub.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003EOne down, another fifteen to go.
