However, further observation revealed the Kerbals to be peaceful and primitive, and in accordance with Protocol 17, no contact was made and the system was listed a a protectorate of the United Nations Interstellar Authority, which currently defends it from anything that could hamper the natural development of Kerbals (And the approval ratings for the POTUS went downnnnn)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnatomy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals have both the genetic makeup of plants and animals, though they seem to lack a little of the latter. They have abnormally large eyes, but have poor eyesight and rely on the size of their eyes to see. Even so, their eyesight (From subjects that where taken for sampling, interrogation, and learning that where later dosed with Ammesiacs before return to Kerbin) is slightly poorer than the average human.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals are highly adjustable, and can be classified as \u0022extremophoiles\u0022 under the Interplanetary Biologists Association. Their air intake system is a mystery, as they breath both oxygen and CO2, and exhale oxygen and CO2, allowing for Kerbals to survive with a tiny amount of oxygen/CO2 for extremely long periods of time. However, restrictions by the United Nations of Earth have banned dissecting/inner exploration of Kerbals under grounds of it being \u0022inhumane to an sentient being\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals appear to have some sort of photosynthesis, but can stay in dark areas for months or more without any ill effects (This is just a assumption, as crews where not permitted to handle Kerbals for more than three hours). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey have hair, which is darkly colored and lies in a small puff above their head. They have almost no natural predators, and can survive with little food due to photosynthesis. Unlike other plants, Kerbals are less sensitive to temperature and are resistant to radiation, but have relatively shorter lifespans on average than a human. Kerbals have a very large [Word omitted by researchers], which causes them to walk awkwardly (They cannot run, and are much slower than a human). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals are also weaker than humans based on muscle composition, but are still capable of lifting large objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECulture\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal culture is rather hazardous by Terran standards. Their technology level is similar to that of 1990\u0027s America, and have the basic beginnings of a space age set up. One space station orbiting HD243c has been observed, and is of an extremely primitive design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom time to time, small spacecraft can been seen docking with the station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn occasion, a large spacecraft will approach the moon of the Kerbal home planet. It will land, and head back. The furthest Kerbals have gone from their home planet was to the distant second moon (A flyby mission), but increasing activity around the fourth planet in their system (Dubbed \u0022Mars II\u0022 by personnel stationed on HD243e, due to its resembelence) has suggested a future mission to that planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal robotic spacecraft have been spotted all over the home system, and only in rare cases are UNE officers allowed to fire on them (One probe nearly discovered the human base at HD243e. The probe was instantly vaporized by laser).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal weapons technology is the 21st century equivalent, though Kerbal armies sometimes use swords and bayonets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals also have their own space program, which currently operates at [REDACTED].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo contact with Kerbals of any kind is allowed, to prevent interference with their natural development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules for Researchers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Return Kerbals to their home planet after three hours, always.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Do not uplift the Kerbals. Do not give then FTL drives. Do not hover our dreadnoughts over Kerbal cities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Kerbals are not animals. They are to be treated with the same care and respect as a human.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddendum 1-01: Whoever is taking potshots at Kerbal Spacecraft with EMP weapons, kinetic projectiles, and old bottles of Vodka, please stop. This is starting to hamper the Kerbals progress in space due to fear of a \u0022kraken\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddendum 1-02: Please do not further instigate the fears oft the \u0022kraken\u0022 by using leftover calamari as a projectile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddendum 1-03: Due to the incident that involved a EVA pod, a Kerbal Probe, and the base commanders dish of calamari (Somehow stolen from his table when he went it the bathroom), squid related food is now banned from the base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddendum 1-04: That includes octopus\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-14T02:07:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2013 02:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NASAFanboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T01:49:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone reply?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAO","CreatedById":30795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T01:51:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewrong forum, should be under KSP Fan Works as [Writing]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T18:09:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease move this, if you are a mod\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T18:36:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis looks cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T19:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMovenated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T06:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is better than mine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"musicpenguin","CreatedById":57938,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T14:30:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T15:26:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdded a little note regarding the \u0022kraken\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T18:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh god.
