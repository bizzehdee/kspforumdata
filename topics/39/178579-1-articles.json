It will be a multiple part story, and its name is Jebediah. The story follows Jebediah Kerman as he embarks on the biggest quest he will ever take part in. Also featured are Valentina, Bill and Bob. Hope you lot are hyped, it\u0027s gonna be a pretty good story!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003EPROLOGUE\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen Wernher Von Kerman published his groundbreaking works on rocket design and orbital mechanics, did he know that he was going to become one of the worlds biggest celebrities? \u00A0No. He didn\u0027t. Did he know that his findings would create the worlds first space agency, KSA? No. He didn\u0027t. He had ideas for rockets to be used to give people a new glance at the universe. To, how would one put it? Branch out. In terms of turning Kerbalkind into a space faring civilization. As technology advanced, so did space achievements. the \u00A0Kerbin Space Race brought many accomplishments; first satellite into orbit, first man in orbit, first space station, even the first landings on the Mun and later, Minmus, Duna and Eve. After that, the public relations boom ended. No one really cared about the space programs around the world. International budgets were lowered and space travel became mostly limited to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E/KEO travel.

Of course, there was a turnout to watch the launch, but it wasn\u0027t big. Big turnouts had died off years back. Kerbmerikan Space Station crewed launch 32 was on the launchpad, preparing for takeoff. It could be the very last mission to KSS, as it was far from modern and the \u00A0alotted budget for the KSA was shrinking every year.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMC FLIGHT: \u0022Launch in T minus 5 minutes.

I think its about the heavy budget cuts last week. Half my friends have been fired.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSS Bob: \u0022Sounds about right. Anyway, the KSS awaits!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSS Val: \u0022Might be the last mission there, this one.

I BEGGED. \u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nLinus: \u0022I agree with Jeb. Do we just give up on the dream? We need to do something.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nWernher: \u0022I\u0027m sorry. My decision is final.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe room burst into outrage, people lunging at Wernher. He managed to get out, where he made a swift exit to his office in Administration.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah left the room, feeling worthless. Then, he had an idea...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003EChapter Two:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003EJebediah\u0027s Plan\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u0022Alrighty boys, docking sequence initiate!\u0022 Valentina, being a young but talented pilot, was mission commander for KSS Expedition 32. She hit a switch above her, illuminating a docking port about 75 metres away. Her displays lit up with {[Automated Docking: Engaged]}. \u0022Things are looking good!\u0022 Said Bill, the mission\u0027s engineer. As their LKOCS (Low Kerbin Orbit Crewed Spacecraft) drew closer to the space station, mission control were watching carefully from the KSS\u0027 hull cameras to ensure the docking was successful. \u0022Dock in 50 metres. 40. 30. 20. 15. 10. 5,4,3,2,1. Dock complete!\u0022 exclaimed a very happy Gene Kerman, having the first good news in days. He had attended the board meeting discussing the recent budget cuts, which would make any Kerbonaut (or retired one) pretty sad.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0* \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0*\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah Kerman was not an ordinary Kerbal. He had traits that not many kerbals have in high amounts. He was a very smart, imaginative person. The previous day, he\u0027d found out the budget cuts had the chance of dismissing multiple Kerbals, demolishing areas of the Kerbal Space Center and well, pretty much withdrawing Kerbmerika\u0027s presence in space. This had given him a very, very crazy idea. So crazy that if he was ever found out he would most certainly be arrested for high treason. His plan was, well, to start a war! \u0022What could go wrong?\u0022 He mumbled.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0His plan would be subtle at first. He would have a trained spy infiltrate the Kussian Federations rocket manufacture plant. He\u0027d have the spy drill a very small hole in one of their craft set to launch within the month. If all went well, it wouldn\u0027t be detected until it was too late; when the hole had sucked the majority of the atmosphere out of their space station \u0412\u0435\u043B\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043D\u043D\u044B\u0439 \u043E\u0440\u0435\u043B. The federation would immediately launch an investigation, being lured by a metaphorical breadcrumb trail which would lead straight to the Kerbmerikan armed forces...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003EChapter Three:\u003Cbr\u003E\nInfiltration\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Jebediah, Jebediah, old friend! How are you?\u0022 Jebediah had set up a meeting with his old friend, Phildorf Kerman. They\u0027d been friends since they were kids, growing up in the same town, near Baikerbanur Space Center. They\u0027d watch the early unmanned rockets of Kerbalkind, engines crackling as they ascended into space with awe. Of course, only one would end up in the astronaut corps; Jebediah. Phildorf was a secret agent. He\u0027d do any job flawlessly, so long as one had the money. \u0022So, what want from me, eh? You didn\u0027t call me for reunion! Tell me!\u0022 Phildorf questioned.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0* \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0*\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Infiltrate Krussian Space Agency... Very difficult. But I can do.\u0022 Phildorf gave a warm hug and a handshake to Jebediah, and he was off. How would he do this? Ah. Fake ID. He\u0027d imitate being a native Krussian, which wouldn\u0027t be too hard, considering his thick Krussian accent. He caught a flight to Krussia. The next day, he successfully entered the Krussian Space Agency, as a rocket technician. He casually went into the capsule of the Krussian P-1 Crew Transport, got out his drill, and drilled a miniscule hole, which he then glued shut. A seemingly good seal, but once it entered space, it would become brittle and shatter. If all went to plan, it would cause cracking of the hull, causing an explosive decompression. If they were lucky, they might survive. say they were close to the station when it occured, they could either use their EVA jetpacks to get to safety, or the seal might break at the final moment of docking, causing a huge chain reaction, which could blow the station up as well...\u003Cbr\u003E\nPhildorf made a swift exit after covering up his trail and laying a false one. Mission complete.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003EChapter Four:\u003Cbr\u003E\nDevastation\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was a sweltering day. Of course summer days are, when you\u0027re in a desert. The Krussian Space Agency was launching its P-1 rocket from their space center, Desert Spaceport. Jebediah Kerman was watching the launch, of course from a live broadcast at the Kerbmerikan Space Agency. As the numbers counted down, the low grumble rose to a deafening crackle and roar, as the giant rocket rose. Emblazoned with \u041A\u043E\u0441\u043C\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043A\u043E\u0435 \u0430\u0433\u0435\u043D\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043E (Krussian Space Agency), the P-1 rocket was their pride and joy. It had not experienced a major problem since Year 54. The rocket was now about 1250 m high, when something terrible happened. Something that would shape the history of Kerbals as a species. The rocket suddenly became a fireball, or was it? It seemingly hovered there, a flaming, red ball. It looked like a star, only tiny!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0Mission control was going crazy. Both. Thats how peculiar this was. Kerbmerikan and Krussian watched closely. Suddenly, a monitor in the Krussian Mission Control Room flashed with some text.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n{[WARNING: NUCLEAR RADIATION LEVELS: EXTREMELY HIGH]}\u003Cbr\u003E\n{[PLASMA LEVELS: CATASTROPHIC]}\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt exploded. All measurements were acting erratic. There seemed to be a tear. What could cause this phenomenon? Jebediah was utterly shocked. Did Phildorf do this? Was it supposed to do this? What science could this... thing hold? The tear seemed to fall down to the ground. Little did the kerbals know that someone, an intelligent species 7 billion light years away, had commenced a nuclear experiment, which so happened to coincidentally occur when the explosion happened. It caused a rift in spacetime, a wormhole...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-27T00:47:16Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2018 12:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Flightgames66\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChapter FOUR!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiriusRocketry","CreatedById":178125,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-27T08:27:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds awesome!
