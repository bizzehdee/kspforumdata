Many of you may not know this, but I AM Jebediah, and the film would be based off of true events which happened in my youth. Surprisingly, as a young pilot-in-training, I was actually quite a coward! I could barely sit in a cockpit without screaming my head off. The film would cover the story of how, when I was still in training, an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E test failed, killing most of the test pilots, and causing the rest to leave. I was the only one left, because I\u0027d never heard about the disaster. At the same time, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E workers had forgotten to put gyros onto the 50-million-fund Kerbal XXVI Mun mission, requiring a probe send them up after launch to add them to the spacecraft, piloted by Bill and Bob. However, with the munar intercept burn rapidly approaching, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E had no probe cores, and required a pilot to perform the few simple tasks that pod-mounted autopilots could not do. I, being the only pilot left, was reluctantly selected to pilot the ship. I was tricked into thinking I was testing a simulator, then beaten unconscious and put into the capsule. When I woke up I was launched kicking and screaming into space. The docking went well, but I mistakenly jettisoned my own capsule, and therefore had to go to the Mun with Bill and Bob, and out-of-control adventure that, upon landing back at Kerbin, turned me into the cold-blooded badass I am today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know what you think about the idea for a movie that tells the true story of my life!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-29T00:50:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetter to ask in the fan works section than here.

I have so far written one episode. It\u0027s about how Werner Von Kerman and his assistant Frederick were kicked out of the Kerbal Aeronautical Society for wasting money. Werner and Frederick subsequently found an old warehouse for sale on an island near the shore (today the location of the abandoned airfield), where they discovered the old, yellowed scientific papers written by Tchaikovsky Kerman more than 120\u00A0years prior. They then used the equations Tchaikovsky had written as a basis for the beginning of the Kerbal Space Program. Any ideas for episode 2?

Or if not air, then something that would do the same job. Then I realised that you could power the whole aircraft like that - and with a much simpler engine. Just a pair of turbo-pumps, a combustion chamber and a nozzle really, although getting the details right was tricky.

The Institute buildings were safely out of sight, hidden by the hillside and a small copse of trees. The ground underfoot was hard packed and rocky and Wernher was having trouble setting up his tripod.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201COoof, OK that\u0027s far enough.

Well, nothing that I can\u0027t undo anyway. Right - propellant tanks next.\u0022 He hung the gas cylinders on the makeshift test stand.

The D1 seemed to consist of an oddly shaped nozzle attached to a metal ball which was studded with bits and pieces of equipment. Two thin hoses connected the ball to the gas cylinders, and the whole unlikely contrivance hung from the tripod on a rather expensive set of strain gauges. Cables trailed from various points into the control box in Wernher\u0027s hands.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CAre you sure about this, Wernher?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CPerfectly sure.

With a steadily building roar, the gust quickly focused into a bright blue flame. Jeb laughed.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CIt even sounds like a camping stove, Wernher.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWernher\u0027s only response was to point at the strain gauge assembly.

He even put together a relatively conservative research proposal - complete with a raft of anticipated benefits for other Institute research programs - for a sounding rocket based on it. Unfortunately, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E also had a tendency to be... vocal about critics of our spaceflight ambitions, which the Institute rather took exception to. \u003Cstrong\u003EEventually of course, we were kicked out for wasting Institute time and resources on \u201Covergrown toys and ridiculous flights of fancy.\u0022 \u0027\u003C/strong\u003E (emphasis added. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut you kept going?\u0022 said Sherfel quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe did,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher. \u201CWe pooled all our money to start up the junkyard business, partly to fund our experiments, and partly to get hold of some parts and raw materials.\u0022 He grinned. \u201COnce we were established, Geneney had the bright idea of bidding on the Institute\u0027s recycling contract. I\u0027m sure at least one of the senior professors was highly amused to see us reduced to hauling Institute scrap, but most of our best early stock - including our first pressure suits - was basically recovered from Institute dumpsters.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames shook his head. \u201CAnd you managed to build a crewed sub-orbital spacecraft out of it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt took a lot longer than we expected,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher ruefully. \u201CNot surprising really, given what we had to work with. But we made it. The Kerbal 1 flight was a success, Bill had the presence of mind to take his camera, and the rest you know about.\u0022 He rolled his shoulders. \u201CAnyway, enough storytelling - we should probably check in with Mission Control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd skipping ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBefore the Space Program, before Mainsails and Mun rovers, before there was even such a thing as a probe core, there was just a group of friends with a shared dream, who refused to let that dream go.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThis is part of their story.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a bright sunlit afternoon as Geneney walked out to the launch pad. He could see the rocket in his minds eye. A gleaming tower of sculptured metal rising into the sky with a cluster of the latest generation engines at the base and the newest, most spacious capsule sitting proudly at the top. Ready to take him to the Mun, to Minmus or anywhere else he cared to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sighed. The reality of course was rather different. A rusty launch tower constructed from old scaffolding. A bunker full of worn out monitors and other abandoned electronic gear. And a last ditch attempt at a rocket that they had built from whatever junk they could scavenge up and weld together. Wernher\u0027s original LV-1 engine had proven far far more difficult to scale up than any of them had imagined. Getting the stability augmentation system to work had eventually been an exercise in stubbornness rather than elegant engineering. And as for the decouplers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney shook his head. Best not to think about the wretched decouplers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe reached the first of the launch clamps and inspected it carefully. The rocket loomed above him, a battered metal cylinder with a tangle of plumbing at the base, connected to the familiar ribbed shape of the LV-15 engine bell. Four RT-5 solid fuel boosters attached to the sides by explosive bolts and a simple capsule secured to the top with more explosive bolts completed this most unlikely looking spacecraft. In Geneney\u0027s opinion \u0027booster\u0027 was an optimistic name for a squat drum of firework propellant with a cone attached to the bottom. As for sticking them on with explosive bolts...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo - best not to think about the decouplers. Besides they had worked well enough in testing and none of them had been able to get the hydraulic pusher system to work reliably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney could hear voices far above him as Lucan helped the three cosmonauts into the capsule. An occasional mumbled comment from Bill, Bob\u0027s nervous chatter and Jeb, talking up a storm in his enthusiasm. Geneney smiled to himself. Bill was still a believer, Bob... well Bob was loyal. If his best friends were risking themselves in a home-brewed rocket, then Bob would be there alongside them. And as for Jeb, he had never given up, despite all the difficulties, frustrations and exploded prototypes. He\u0027d kept them going, with his permanent grin and irrepressible enthusiasm, even as the other members of the Kerbin Interplanetary Society had gradually drifted away. It helped that the grin hid a surprisingly competent engineer, otherwise Geneney was fairly sure that Wernher would have stuffed Jeb headfirst into the engine bell of the LV-10 test model and probably fired it too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis smile faded. The LV-10 test had been a definite low point and they still hadn\u0027t figured out exactly what went wrong. The LV-15 worked, although it wasn\u0027t close to being powerful enough and all their attempts to cluster multiple LV-15s together had failed. Eventually even Jeb had conceded that the multiple LV-15 design was just too prone to overheating and suggested using a set of RT-5 \u0027Trashcan\u0027 engines instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the launch clamps seemed to be in order and a loud clang from above announced that Lucan had finally closed the hatch of the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E. Geneney waited as Lucan clambered down the launch tower and the two kerbals hurried back to the control bunker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney tapped his microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbal 1, this is Control.

Five minutes to launch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher pressed a button on his console and grunted in satisfaction as a set of indicator lights winked out.

The image on the monitor flared brightly. Spots danced in front of Geneney\u0027s eyes as he stared at the screen trying desperately to spot the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E amongst all the static. As the image came back into focus, all Geneney could see was a badly scorched launch pad. The noise in his headphones suggested that this was due to a successful launch rather than a catastrophic explosion but the faint screams didn\u0027t sound at all good. The static on monitor 2 didn\u0027t look promising either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wernher - talk to me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022LV-15 performing well, all four RT-5s are running. All decouplers intact,\u0022\u00A0came the calm response. \u0022Capsule telemetry and sensors offline.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney gripped the arms of his chair tightly. \u0022Which means?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have no way of telling how high the capsule is travelling, how fast or at what angle.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan interrupted him \u0022If the decouplers haven\u0027t fired...I can still hear the engines in my headset, so the rocket should still be in one piece.\u0022 He snapped his fingers. \u0022The main data cable - it probably just came loose during the launch. Wernher, try SCE to Aux.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney\u0027s knuckles turned white as Wernher searched for the switch on his console. Then, with a click, monitor 2 lit up, as telemetry suddenly flooded in from the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E. A slow smile spread across Geneney\u0027s face as he got to his feet and slapped Lucan on the back. Above his head, the numbers for altitude and velocity of the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E were both steadily increasing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002210 seconds till burnout.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney kept his fingers firmly crossed as he waited for the Trashcans to shut down. Five seconds to go, two, one...\u00A0and nothing. The roar of the engines still filled his headphones. Five more seconds, ten more seconds. He was just turning towards Wernher, when everything went quiet. There was a series of muffled explosions and four lights on Wernher\u0027s console winked out. He grabbed the microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbal 1, this is Control. Come in Kerbal 1! Jeb, Bill, Bob - can you hear me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb chuckled. \u0022Hearing you loud and clear, Genie if you\u0027d let us get a word in edgewise!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb - thank the Kerm! Are you guys OK up there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Bobcat here is looking a bit blue but we\u0027re all good. Nothing but Class A Badasses on \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E rocket ship!\u0022 Jeb paused to savour the moment. \u0022Yeah, this rocket ship...\u0022, his voice trailed away. \u0022Dammit guys we did it! Faster than any kerbal has ever travelled, higher than any kerbal has ever travelled and way \u003Cem\u003Eway \u003C/em\u003Enoisier than any kerbal has ever travelled! I told you those Trashcans would do the trick!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well we\u0027ve still got a couple of things left to do, Jeb but yeah - those Trashcans definitely made it happen. Thirty seconds of fuel left for the LV-15.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan was keeping a close eye on the telemetry. The \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E was actually accelerating slightly now as the last litres of fuel drained away,\u00A0until at last the engines shut down. The last light flickered out on Wernher\u0027s console accompanied by a final muffled bang from the speakers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Shutdown and booster separation confirmed, Jeb. We figure you should top out at around thirty to thirty five thousand metres.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks, Luco. Not bad for a first flight, not bad at all! Looks like I won that bet with the Bobcat too - he reckoned we\u0027d get to twenty five thousand at best!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob laughed nervously. \u0022Are you sure they were just the standard Trashcans, Jeb? If we get down from here in one piece, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll be able to get out of this seat, I got mashed into it so hard.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Didn\u0027t touch them, Bobcat. They sure did make for one heck of a ride though. What did you think, Bill? Hey - are you OK there, Bill? That window isn\u0027t coming loose is it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh... Oh wow... Guys you need to see this.\u0022 Bill silently reached out a hand and Jeb wordlessly passed him the camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney blinked. He\u0027d never heard Jeb sound like that before. Almost awestruck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What is it, Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s Kerbin... just Kerbin. Only not quite and all of it at once. And the sky - it\u0027s full of more stars than you can believe. Greens and blues and brilliant white clouds and then black and stars.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re not making any sense, Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, no I don\u0027t think I am. You\u0027re gonna have to see this for yourself, Genie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney sighed. \u0022You know we\u0027re never going to get another shot at this. The Kerbal 1 was all we had left,\u0022 he said sadly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Actually, Genie, if even half of Bill\u0027s photos come out, I think you\u0027re going to get to see this quicker than you can imagine and in a bigger and better rocket than you can imagine too. Hey, Bill, if you\u0027re done with that camera, pass it over here. Genie, I\u0027m taking off my helmet, sticking the camera into it and wedging it under the control panel for safekeeping.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney\u0027s jaw dropped. \u0022What, why, what are you doing? What happens if you get an air leak?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s voice was uncharacteristically serious. \u0022I\u0027ll just have to hold my breath, Genie. Whatever happens to Bill, Bob and me, you \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E this camera. It\u0027s all the proof that the Kerbin Interplanetary Society needs and it\u0027s going to change everything.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo small green figures stood on the roof of a makeshift concrete bunker, anxiously peering out to sea. Geneney glanced at his watch and then scanned the horizon again, too nervous to look away for more than a moment. He knew that he probably wouldn\u0027t see the capsule from this distance but the parachute should be visible. And it should be visible any moment now. Beside him, Wernher suddenly stiffened and pointed at the sky. An orange streamer popped into view, plunged towards the ground and then fluttered skywards. Geneney\u0027s heart was in his mouth. If that was the drogue chute then...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYES! Two orange discs burst into the sky and then unfurled into the welcome, welcome sight of two fully opened parachutes. Geneney and Wernher looked at each other, grinned in triumph and then threw themselves down the stairs as fast as they could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lucan, Wernher - boat. Now! We\u0027ve got three kerbonauts to pick up!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EEpilogue - two days later\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour members of the Kerbin Interplanetary Society were lounging about at the Jebediah Kerman Junkyard and Spare Parts Company. Bill was in Jeb\u0027s office working on his camera, whilst Jeb was out with a pair of customers, helping them rummage through a pile of old engine parts. As the three of them strolled back towards the office, Geneney overhead snatches of conversation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Were you boys anything to do with a mighty lot of noise out by that old rusty tower the other day?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded, \u0022Yup, that was us, sir. Testing some bits and pieces from the junkyard.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe older of the two customers chuckled. \u0022People back in town reckon they saw one of those rockets flying into the sky.\u0022 He snorted. \u0022Load of nonsense if you ask me, never mind what those crazy interplanetary characters keep talking about. Although I have to admit, they do make some mighty fine explosions.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenneny stifled a grin as Jeb tried his best to keep a straight face. Just then Bill popped his head around the office door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey\u00A0guys - photo\u0027s came out nicely. You want to take a look?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb smiled. \u0022Love to, Bill.\u0022 He turned towards his customers politely, \u0022and would you good kerbals care to join us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney stared at Jeb\u0027s office wall. Most of Bill\u0027s photographs were blurry views of not very much, taken out of what was obviously a very small window. Several more showed what looked like maps. But none of the eight kerbals crammed into the room had eyes for anything other than the largest picture in the middle. This too was clearly a view through a window but beautifully sharp. A very obviously curved line down the middle separated inky blackness from brilliant blue, dusky brown and lush green. Far away in the distance, the familiar battered grey ball of the M\u00FCn rose over Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney blinked back tears. Jeb was right. They had really done it. They could do it again. And there would be a Space Program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really go into much detail about all the stuff that happened in between I\u0027m afraid but it sounds as though your series would!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-05T13:19:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2017 01:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JKerman","CreatedById":166532,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-06T03:30:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you know that I was born on the day Werner Von Kerman died?
