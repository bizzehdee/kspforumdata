These are ultimately dark comedy, or an attempt at it.

I had always dreamed of being an engineer, and my brother always wanted to fly rockets; I thought him foolhardy. The last Kerbal in my family to wind up in one of those death traps was my great uncle, Sidfred, who had just finished doing time for selling illegal modules on the streets of Kerbopolis. The ships were normally piloted by those who had a brain, but needed a leg up in life, or dreamers who stared too long at the Mun. Ed was a dreamer, and the first survivor to land back on earth since the \u003Cem\u003EDerpy Express\u003C/em\u003E began it\\\u0027s 28th re-invention and voyage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t know who named it that or why, but the name must have been cursed. The first time it was built, it never left the landing pad, collapsing in on itself and killing all who were on board. This has been going on for years, until two years ago on the fateful journey. No ship ever saw its brave pilots return alive, but I remember.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a frosty January, and Ed had boarded what we all thought to be his last trail in life. I watched with my mother, Edna, as the ship made it into orbit. We watched as it spiraled into the heavens, and we watched as it made four rotations around our planet; the first ship to ever make it into orbit. The Kerbopolian newscast was ecstatic! Dreams of Mun seemed to be a reality as the ship readied itself with Ed on board. For a brief period I was proud for him, and felt bad for doubting him, until a crewmate of his named Jebediah, an empty headed kerb, caused a malfunction in the couplings containing his engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship did make it back to the planet, and we waited for it to be over, but for the first time in history the survivors lived as their cabin made a water landing. I happily thought they would be rescued, but I was wrong. No one knew how to rescue them, for we Kerbs never look to the seas, and only to the skies. I knew that my days as a simple engineer were over; It was time for me to fly. Two years of training later, I Donney, and the two Kerbs Billy-Bobly and Geofrim, boarded the 40th flight of the \u003Cem\u003EDerpy Express\u003C/em\u003E to locate where he had crashed. This time, it was not simply a rocket but a new technology. I nervously glanced down the speedway as Billy-Bobly began to panic, and Geofrim let loose a smile more sinister than 39 flights of twisted metal. It was time to meet my destiny!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Next will be Chapter 2: Day 1... If anyone wished to read more) \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
