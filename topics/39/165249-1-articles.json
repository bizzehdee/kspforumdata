The crushing rumble of the rocket engines rolled through the observation room. As the rumble faded Khenry walked up and stood beside Direc. They watched as the first boosters separated from the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow fares your flock of little birds Khenry,\u201D Direc asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey fly true,\u201D Khenry said. \u201CWe\u2019ve got three stated to launch for Mun, and one for a very high molniya orbit around Kerbin.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s our second Mun lander mission,\u201D Direc said,\u00A0seeming to not\u00A0listen to the answer, or even focused on the rocket. \u201CWe should have boots on Minmus within the year, and then where?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKhenry looked at Direc. \u201CDuna, Moho, the Joolian system, Eeloo.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes.

Should there be?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKhenry shuffled to turn and face Direc. \u201DSir\u2026 Direc.

But, for a year it\u2019s a bit of a tight space. It means we\u2019re going to be pausing for a moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe probe work outside of Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E will continue. We\u2019ll pause any kerbaled programs beyond the moons. Instead we\u2019ll focus on developing orbital stations.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s a bit of a shift of direction.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s a needed shift. We are near the limit of what we can achieve with what we have available. This will let us develop the next generation of ships, and keep us going further.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
