Textures are broken, and I need to edit the model to get the shape back to normal. However, if your craft really needs the color of the fairings to be precise, I would need to create a custom model with custom/procedural textures. It can be done, if not necessarily easily.\n\nStruts, well, struts are finicky. They sometimes work just fine and dandy and on other occasions freak out and go everywhere, or sometimes not import at all.

I thought about brightening up the background a little, but the node setup wasn\u0027t perfect for that.
