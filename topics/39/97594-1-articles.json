So my wife has taken up crochet as a hobby recently.... I gave her dimensions for a full size kerbal and she\u0027s been hard at work making Jebbie during the weekends. This is last weekend\u0027s progress...What do you guys think? I helped out spray painting the hair and she did all the crocheting... We were curious, how much will you be willing to pay for a full-size kerbal desk puppet?, we were wondering what people are willing to pay for a kerbal on their office desk.... We are also designing a kerbal to hang off of the car rear-view mirror and a key-fob sized one, let us know if you would like to get one for yourself....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m attaching a few pics of our progress, will post more later this week....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3jHsFEAaiO4/VMLnx2QyL1I/AAAAAAAAWjY/fLOgZjNL-Ss/s640/20150123_162720.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150123_162720.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jpw92861FOI/VMLojzPZrZI/AAAAAAAAWkI/X_FWNL_xuvI/s640/20150123_162840.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150123_162840.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bwwc-8Mvn4E/VMLpv0W5PAI/AAAAAAAAWlI/NFEixQEJkMU/s640/20150123_163721.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150123_163721.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[First attempt at a mouth, planning to change it to make it look better]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T17:19:46Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mechie_PhD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heartstrings","CreatedById":134318,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T03:22:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m shocked nobody else has responded \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love it, it\u0027s adorable!
