The song in question was \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMorning Glory\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 by Oasis. That was the name of the rover like vehicle used at the KSC. It was created as a type of Rover but the test vehicle was commonly stolen by Jeb and used for \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CJoyriding\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 purposes. He normally did this alone, but this time he brought along a friend of his. Tom Kerman was a new recruit whose application to join the program was accepted. Jeb was excited and laughing as he normally did. Tom on the other hand was looking greener than a normal Kerbal should look like. Jeb pulled over and shut off the radio and said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNothing like a nice calming drive in the Lynx for some relaxation right?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Tom was so frozen with fear that Jeb carried him to the infirmary; \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI think he overdosed on Epicenes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he told the nurse as he laid him on the cot and left the room. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater Jeb was hanging out in the Astronaut complex chatting with his brothers Bill and Bob and his friend Merlin Kerman. Jeb was telling a story on how he nearly murdered a cat, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COk so this was back when I was still a Fighter Pilot,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAnd on the base I was on, the vets number and mine were very close. So on occasion I would get people asking about their pets. So one time, I was in a situation like this. I was really drunk I get a call from a woman saying, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153I swear I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to kill that ....ing cat!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 and I just said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6I can do that for you for free\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 and then I hear, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Oh sorry wrong number!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 and she hung up,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb was the only one in the party laughing. The others had herd that story over a million times, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CJeb you have told us that tale over a million times now. You got any new material?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bob said. After a thought Jeb said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell, there was the one time I nearly started World War III,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Everyone in the posse and in the room all got quiet, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHow did you pull that one off?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 a voice called from across the room. Jeb figured it was another new guy since he didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t recognize the voice, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell I was about 5, ok so my dad took me into his office. He was in charge of launching the Nuke in case .... went bad. So here I was and the Launch Computer was on and someone forgot to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Log Out\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 basically. So-,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as Jeb was reaching the climax of his story, a voice came on the PA system, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWill Jebediah, Bob, and Bill Kerman please report to Gene Kerman\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s office. Jebediah, Bob, and Bill Kerman please report to Gene Kerman\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s office.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The monotone voice from the speaker said. Jeb downed the last bit of his drink and said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell boys, To be continued\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 then he and his brothers walked out of the complex and to Gene\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s office located in the Research and Development Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe walk was pretty long, but such distance was nothing to the trio. They entered the building Gene\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s office was located, got on the elevator, and got off on the third floor. They then walked a few paces till they reached the door marked, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGene Kerman, Launch Director and Head of Crew Relations\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb knocked on the door and after a few seconds, they heard a voice saying, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCome in\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 It was Gene\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s. Jeb opened the door and they all walked in. Gene\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s office was a pretty simple one. A desk and some chairs, a few paintings and models of various rockets the KSC had launched into space over the years. Many of them were the ones Jeb and his brothers had flown, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHere everyone, have a seat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Gene said. Jeb could tell that he was about to say something serious. Once they were seated, Gene said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGentlemen, we need to talk. How would you guys like to go back to the Mun?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PolarBearsOnASpaceship","CreatedById":53606,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T18:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHow would you guys like to go back to the Mun?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/em\u003E The words echoed in everyone\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s heads. With those words, Jeb was taken back in time to the days of the Loki Program. The Loki Program was one of the most important undertakings of the entire KSC. It took Kerbals to the Mun and Back. Jeb was on Loki I, the very first mission to the Mun. He was the First Kerbal to walk on the Mun. Bob was with Jeb that mission as well. Bill wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t in the historic mission but he did go on a later mission. They all missed those days. The Loki Program was cut down in its prime. After roughly three to four missions, frequent malfunctions to the Celestia I, the rocket that took them to the Mun and back, caused the Kerman Government to order the program to be put on an indefinite Hiatus for, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSafety Concerns\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. The KSC tried to fight it, but the Government claimed Eminent Domain, and they were a government agency as well, they had no choice but to roll over. While the program was still technically active, no Kerbals were flying and it seemed like they wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fly again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI know what you guys are thinking, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m just as surprised as you guys are,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Gene said, breaking the silence that had fallen on the room, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CApparently, yesterday night around 22:30, I got a call from Werner Von Kerman himself. And he said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Meine Fraund Gene, Wir going back to ze Mun!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 At first I thought he was drunk or something so I said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Good one Werner! Now can I go back to sleep?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 and he said to me in his thick German accent, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153It no joke Meine kindie. I talk to the Gro\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B2en Valters as Ich calls them. And they say ze missions are back on, but ze first mission after break must be top secret\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 So after a conversation that seemed to last hours, he told me this,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Gene explained how the Kerman Government repealed the order telling the KSC to halt the Loki Program under one condition, That they get something out of it in return. They had been trying to think of new ways to dispose of Biomedical Waste in a way that would not harm Kerbals or the environment in little to no form what so ever. One of the scientists on the board suggested that the waste be sent to the Mun, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a barren, distant, and isolated place far from Kerbin. The lack of air and intense Radiation from Kerbol will kill most viruses and bacteria, and no one will come in contact with the substances except for the Astronauts,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 the scientist told the press in an interview about the purposed idea. After some debate, the Kerbin Government decided to approach the KSC with the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt will be just like all the past missions,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Gene told the group, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CExcept with a few minor changes. For one, instead of three EVA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s there will be four, but the fourth one has to be a secret. That is when you take care of business. I will tell you guys more details if you accept the mission, but if you say no, you three will half to keep what I just said to you guys a secret till the day you die or the OP is declassified and you are given the greenlight to talk about it,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he continued to say. The three men were all shocked. None of them knew what to make of all the information they had just been given. It was crazy enough that they would be going back to the Mun, but to do this sort of secret agent like stuff was way past them. After a few minutes, Jeb was the first one to break the silence, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSo we can resume the missions, after we do all of this, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153super sneaky spy stuff,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Gene looked at him and said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBasically, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s what they told me when I got the mission details,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Gene told them. Jeb stood up and said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell me and my brothers will half to think about it for a little bit,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Gene then said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSure, take all the time in the world. There not rushing the decision, I just suggested you guys since you are the most experienced Crew in the program,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb and Bill and Bob then left the room to go discuss this bold and daring mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
