Almost destroyed the enemy, but their distress signals caught them surrendering. All POW\u0027s were immediately freed, and peace has been restored. Kenner and Fern got the bugs and mechs running for their lives, as well as our Duna fleet. Good job. We head to the Laythe City for hero worship, and terrible interviews. Crew carriers. Dismessed. Kurt, you too. The strategist can be on-station.\u0022 Kater said. All of pilots and men who had duty on Laythe departed. Kurat walked up, so Kater, Kurat, and Kurt could depart to the officer\u0027s crew transporter. \u0022Kurt, I think you were the bravest in the whole battle. You get to arrest those Fed troopers that killed the civvies in the science research vehicle.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, that\u0027s that.\u0022 Kurt said. \u0022Just another exploded fleet.

The only way to strip out the things that react to it is by getting hit in a certain spot by a torpedo, then requires manual, in atmosphere work to strip it out. \u0022Bug repellent on.
