Barman says goodbye to the shuttle and closes her eyes accepting her fate, The crew watch the station vaporize followed by the earth before going back inside their cryopods for another long slumber.\n\nTen billion years later: The sun and solar system are gone except for the Mighty gas giants who survived the end, The crew wake up and look out the window to see that the cycle has repeated itself and from the ashes a new solar system has formed with a new Earth.\n\nI hope you guys like my idea for a movie plot, If anyone here is a good poet i would like it if you could post a poem based on this storyline below.\n\nThe soundtrack for such a movie would be an extended version of this:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ay3EwNGM5yw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nPlease comment i want to know you guys\u0027s opinions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T01:06:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by daniel l.**"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T01:37:04Z","Content":"Maybe someone could get a director to make this ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif) (I\u0027m serious)"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:08:39Z","Content":"This would be a great movie:).
