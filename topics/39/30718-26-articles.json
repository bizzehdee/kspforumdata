Over at the commander\u0027s station, James\u0027s face remained carefully impassive, but even in zero-gravity, the set of his shoulders told their own story. The drop in tension over the air to ground loop was palpable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s about what we\u0027re seeing too, Pioneer.\u0022 Geneney paused, and Wernher heard a mutter of background conversation. \u0022OK, team, the bad news is that CapSys isn\u0027t too happy about that leaked coolant.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And the good news, Flight?\u0022 said James quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is that the Systems team have just dropped the answer off at my console. It\u0027s a bit...homely - .but it should do the job. Wernher, I want you to head down into the lower bay and retrieve that roll of sealant tape. Jim, Sherf, we\u0027re going to need the covers from your checklists and a couple of empty ration packs - the cleaner the better.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022On it, Flight.\u0022 Wernher eased himself over the edge of his couch and swung himself gingerly into the space under the crew seating. Small and cramped back on Kerbin, the lower equipment bay felt much roomier in free fall. Wernher squeezed past the sanitation facility and twisted round to face the tool storage bin. \u003Cem\u003EContents may have shifted in transit.\u003C/em\u003E Carefully, he slid it open, retrieved a roll of silvery tape, and just as carefully, slid it closed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Got the tape, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good. Pass it up to Sherf. CapSys is coming on loop to take her and Jim through the next part. In the meantime, I want you to unscrew the main hose from the sanitation bowl. Sherf - please confirm waste valves A and B are closed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher heard shuffling overhead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Closed, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sanitation facility was designed to be repairable in flight. Wernher braced himself awkwardly against the bulkhead and fumbled with the first of two large butterfly nuts securing the outflow hose to the bowl. Above his head he could hear ripping noises and the squeaky rasp of sealant tape peeling off its roll. Grunting with effort, he leaned on the nut as best he could, and felt it shift slightly in his hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMust remember...to tell the capsule team... to grease these things before flight.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMuttering under his breath, Wernher managed to loosen the first nut. The second one was more tractable. He spun it free, carefully leaving it on its bolt and easing the two halves of the locking clamp apart. He held his breath, and carefully pulled on the outflow hose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hose is free, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good work. Now I need you to tape the nozzle to the open end.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel popped her head over the edge of her couch and passed him the roll of tape and a creased cardboard cone with a ragged fringe of plastic bag poking from one end. \u0022Tape the liner to the hose first, \u0022 she said, \u0022Then push the nozzle over the top, and tape that on too.\u0022 She watched Wernher tear off a length of tape. \u0022Here - I\u0027ll do that if you stick our space-grade vacuum cleaner together.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher and Sherfel surveyed their handiwork with pride.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Couldn\u0027t have done better if we\u0027d brought the parts with us, Flight,\u0022 Sherfel said happily. \u0022What\u0027s next?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stow the nozzle in the bowl and strap in for the ullage burns,\u0022 said Geneney. \u0022FD has the attitude numbers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded. \u0022Good,\u0022 he said. \u0022Better than chasing the stuff all over the equipment bay.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s what we thought,\u0022 said Geneney, \u0022We\u0027ll try and put it all in range of your hose too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher waited until Sherfel was back in her own couch before pulling himself into his seat and strapping in. James glanced over at them, nodded, and took hold of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yaw then roll, Flight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s affirmative, Jim. Yaw, negative-y translation pulse, roll, plus-z translation pulse.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames crisply worked the controls. Wernher felt \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E shift around him, nudged by the fleeting bursts of thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CManoeuvre completed, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher was already unbuckling his harness. \u201CAccess panel one, Flight?\u0022\u00A0he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAccess panel one,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher twisted four restraining latches out of the way, and lifted a square metal panel from its frame in the bulkhead. Working slowly in the confined space, he slipped the panel between the panel and the sanitation bowl, and peered inside the maintenance compartment. Shimmering, oily globs of coolant quivered near the bulkhead, but as far as he could see, there weren\u0027t any other spills trapped in the maze of plumbing and wiring looms. The globs quivered, rainbows of refracted light scurrying over their translucent surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe ullage manoeuvre worked, Flight,\u0022\u00A0he called. \u201CUnstowing suction nozzle.\u0022\u00A0He retrieved the hose and poked it cautiously towards the floating coolant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CReady.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel flipped a switch. \u201CWaste valve A open,\u0022\u00A0she reported.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher reached around the edge of the bulkhead, fingers probing for the waste disposal controls. The button slid into its housing with a firm clunk, followed by a whirr of fans starting up. The quivering mass of liquid trembled, stretched and ruptured into a shower of smaller globules which shot towards the makeshift suction nozzle. Most of them slipped neatly inside, others splashed off the surface, fracturing into yet smaller droplets. Patiently, Wernher chased them down, gently squeezing the cardboard cone to keep it open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last rainbow droplet disappeared up the hose. Wernher waited for thirty seconds before switching off the fans. Instantly, Sherfel toggled both switches on her console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWaste valve A closed. Venting through waste valve B.\u0022\u00A0She glanced through the side window and was rewarded by the sight of a shower of silvery droplets streaming out from \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVenting completed. Closing waste valve B.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy, Pioneer. Good work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder the couches, Wernher was busy replacing the access panel and reconnecting the suction hose. He stowed the stained and oily cardboard nozzle safely away in a waste storage bin and pulled himself back into into his couch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPioneer 1, Flight. FD advises that you may want to check your velocity.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll three kerbonauts automatically looked at the computer readout on the central control panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u0027s eyes shone. After two and half days of steady deceleration, \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E was finally beginning its long fall towards the M\u00FCn. James smiled faintly. \u201CWe see it, Flight,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CWhat\u0027s our free return status?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFree return is Go, Pioneer. Flight dynamics are running the numbers for platform realignment, star sighting checks and MOI. Guidance are prepping your burn data for midcourse correction two.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Flight. Standing by.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E valves thumped shut. James released the controls and keyed his microphone. \u201CFlight, Pioneer 1. Midcourse two executed. Board is green.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CConfirmed, Pioneer. Give us another ten for MOI burn data.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher glanced out of the rendezvous window above his head and abruptly stiffened. \u201COh my,\u0022\u00A0he said softly. Sherfel glanced at him curiously, eyebrows lifting as she followed his gaze. \u201COhhh. Jim, pull your head out of that checklist for a moment and \u003Cem\u003Elook\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames looked up irritably. Then he caught a glimpse of blue out of the corner of his eye, and snapped his head round reflexively. His frown softened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDoesn\u0027t look like much from out here, does it?\u0022\u00A0he said wonderingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLonely, and terribly, terribly fragile,\u0022\u00A0agreed Sherfel. She clicked her microphone on. \u201CFlight, Pioneer 1. Be advised that we have a visual on you - and you\u0027re looking awfully pretty, but awfully lonely out there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSay again, Pioneer?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027ve got Kerbin, Flight,\u0022\u00A0said Sherfel quietly. \u201CThe whole planet framed in one rendezvous window.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was silence from Mission Control, then Geneney pulled himself together with an audible effort. \u201CYou might want to get a picture of that, Pioneer,\u0022 he said, \u201CI think everyone back here could use a reminder of what they\u0027re squabbling over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel sighed. \u201CStill no news from the Twelve Pillars then?\u0022\u00A0she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot since their appeal for calm,\u0022\u00A0replied Geneney, \u201CBut that\u0027s not stopping every politician and pundit on Kerbin from weighing in with their opinion. The journalists are having a field day.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can imagine,\u0022\u00A0said Sherfel heavily, \u201CSome heated opinions too, I bet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust a few,\u0022 said Geneney dryly. \u201CAlthough you\u0027ll be happy to know that KBS are running stories on three kerbals who are - and I quote - \u0022a shining example of kerbalkind at its best, that should give us all confidence that we can overcome this greatest of challenges.\u0022 \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSounds like somebody is doing a decent job anyway,\u0022\u00A0said James, \u0022Who are they?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney chuckled. \u201CI\u0027m talking to them right now,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CHow does it feel to be a beacon of the kerbal spirit?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher choked. James merely blinked. \u201CSeriously?\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSeriously,\u0022 said Geneney, \u201CI\u0027m guessing Leland found a friendly ear somewhere because KBS are suddenly running a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of stuff on the space program, and especially on you three.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe right stuff, I hope?\u0022\u00A0said Sherfel lightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLet\u0027s put it this way,\u0022 said Geneney, \u201CUntil yesterday, I\u0027d never seen Jeb blush before.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat takes some doing,\u0022 laughed Wernher. \u201CHope somebody managed to record that, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe did,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney, \u201Cas well as the \u0027Engines and Engineers\u0027 interview with Hanbal and Ornie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames\u0027s\u00A0mouth twitched. He struggled for a moment and then burst out laughing too. \u201CThey managed to interview \u003Cem\u003EHanbal\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd they\u0027ll be interviewing him again if Ademone has any say in it,\u0022 said Geneney. \u201COnce somebody at KBS had the bright idea of putting him in front of a chalkboard, he stole the show! The interviewer got so caught up asking his own questions that he barely had time for his script.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAdemone had better hope the Institute doesn\u0027t try to lure him away from Rockomax,\u0022 laughed Sherfel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFunny you should say that,\u0022 Geneney replied. \u201CJeb sent them a recording of the interview, marked \u0027lecturer training material\u0027.\u201C He paused. \u201CAnyway - back to business, team. I\u0027ve got the platform realignment numbers from FD and then we have a service module engine to check over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlatform reference set for MOI. Attitude is green, SME is good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames glanced over at Wernher, who responded with a terse nod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy, Flight. Burn program loaded, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to AUTO.

Ignition at FET six eight dot two zero dash one five.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe three kerbonauts checked their instruments. Wernher wriggled his shoulders, trying to dislodge the droplets of cold sweat gathering at the base of his neck. He rolled his head to one side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey - I\u0027ve got nothing out here. No stars, just blackness!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, Pioneer,\u0022 Geneney said calmly, \u201CLooks like you found the M\u00FCn. One minute to loss of signal, all systems Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, Flight.\u0022 replied James, \u201CWe\u0027ll see you right back here in a couple of hours.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027ll hold you to that, Pioneer. Twenty seconds.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher clenched his jaw as Geneney counted down the last few seconds. He sensed Sherfel restlessly scanning the navigation panel beside him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThree...two...one...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe air to ground loop faded into static. James switched off the radio. \u201CRight on time,\u0022 he said with satisfaction. \u201CTwelve minutes to get squared away for Munar orbit insertion.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher fought to keep the impatience out of his voice as he read off the engine settings for the third time. \u003Cem\u003EHe does have a point. We only get one go at this.\u003C/em\u003E Beside him, Sherfel checked and rechecked the navigation panel, fingers shaking on the keyboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThree minutes to ignition.

The flight dynamics team were gathered around Lucan\u0027s console studying the data from the abandoned Kerbin departure stage.

He disappeared into the Press Room, returning with a steaming mug of thick, elderly coffee. Noses twitched around the room, as he carried the mug over to the flight director\u0027s console, and set it down within easy reach. Geneney gave him a grateful thumbs up and turned his attention back to the screens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne minute to prime, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, FD.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe seconds trickled away.

Unnoticed, his headset cord ripped free of the console, flapping around his neck like a high tech cravat.

Looking back on their journey, Wernher would remember their one meal break as \u0027the most surreal picnic of my life\u0027, bobbing against the capsule window, ration pack in one hand, staring out at the Munar surface. James would talk about the relief of completing every orbit with a systems check from Mission Control. Sherfel\u0027s lasting memory was of the Far Side. On one side of the M\u00FCn, three kerbals in their own tiny world. On the other, and hundreds of thousands of kilometres away, everything and everyone else that she\u0027d ever known.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut all of them spoke of the engine. As Wernher would put it many years later. \u201CNone of us ever mentioned it on the flight. Me least of all - I mean, I designed the thing, and helped to build it. What could I say after that? Besides, there wasn\u0027t any point - if it fired, it fired. If it didn\u0027t, we had our backup options, and if they failed too, then that was it. I don\u0027t think that stopped us \u003Cem\u003Ethinking\u003C/em\u003E about it though, and I know I was always pretty relieved to get a good telemetry check from Gene on each orbit. I guess I don\u0027t need to say that I was even more relieved when we didn\u0027t need the backup options on orbit six.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames squeezed the last of the creva stew out of his ration pack and chewed it thoughtfully. He glanced at the comms panel, checking that the air to ground loop with Mission Control was switched off, then turned to face his crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWernher,\u0022 he said at last. \u201CNow that we\u0027ve finally got some downtime, perhaps you could answer a question for me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher looked at him quizzically. \u201CI can try,\u0022\u00A0he replied. \u201CWhat is it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTMI,\u0022\u00A0said James slowly, \u201CI saw your face when Jeb came on-loop - it looked like you were expecting it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher shrugged. \u201CI wasn\u0027t told either,\u0022 he said, \u201Cbut Jeb\u0027s been working towards this flight since he was a student at the Institute. If he wasn\u0027t up here himself, not a single kerbal in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E would have begrudged him the flight director\u0027s seat, Gene least of all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel blinked. \u201CHow old is Jeb?\u0022 she asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe was nearly nine years out of the Institute when we launched the Kerbal 1,\u0022\u00A0Wernher said quietly, \u201Cand that wasn\u0027t yesterday.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the first time that Wernher could remember, James looked genuinely impressed. \u201CThat\u0027s a long time,\u0022\u00A0he said softly. \u201CAnd when his dream flight came up, he still didn\u0027t pull the boss slot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWe would have given it to him, but Jeb\u0027s always been scrupulous about fair crew selection. You wouldn\u0027t have guessed it from my tutorial group, but he\u0027s grown up to be one hell of a leader. I doubt anybody else could have kept us going long enough to see the Kerbal 1 fly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou were Jeb\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Etutor\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022\u00A0exclaimed Sherfel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded. \u201CAnd supervisor for his final year project.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel caught the shift in his voice. \u201CSounds like there\u0027s a story there,\u0022 she said, checking the flight clock. \u201CAnd we\u0027ve got a couple of hours before the next systems check. I could use something to pass the time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe canteen doors swung shut. Wernher looked curiously at Jeb Kerman, sitting alone at a nearby table, prodding an unappetising mush of tubers, beans and greens around his plate. He walked over and sat down by the younger kerbal.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CMind if I join you, Jeb?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EJeb laughed hollowly, \u201CSure. There might even be some stew left if you\u0027re unlucky.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWernher\u0027s face fell as he took in the empty canteen. \u201COh well,\u201C he said, \u201CLooks like sandwiches again. Anyhow - what\u0027s up, Jeb? Not like you to be sitting here on your own.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EJeb looked moodily at his tutor. \u201CFinal year project.\u0022 he said briefly, \u201CStill can\u0027t think of anything to do.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CI thought you were helping Bill with his stability augmentation system?\u0022\u00A0said Wernher.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CYeah, I thought about that,\u0022 said Jeb, \u201Cbut I want to \u003C/em\u003Ebuild\u003Cem\u003E something, Wernher. Not a mockup for a wind tunnel, not a chunk of circuitry to plug into a test sim.\u00A0I want to take something outside and see it \u003C/em\u003Efly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CAhh,\u0022 said Wernher carefully, \u201CI think I see the problem.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EJeb pushed his plate away. \u201CYeah. I don\u0027t think a hobby shop plane is really going to cut it. What about you, Wernher? How are the jet intakes working?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWernher glanced around surreptitiously. \u201CVariable geometry pre-cooling intakes,\u0022 he said absently, \u0022Theory looks sound, if I can build a light enough heat exchanger.\u0022 He looked at Jeb thoughtfully. \u201CI\u0027ve been working on a side project though.\u0022 He got to his feet. \u201CC\u0027mon. I think you need to see this.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe two kerbals crossed the main quadrangle of the Kerbin Aeronautical Research Institute and headed for the large blocky building of the Jet Propulsion Department. As they walked, Jeb tried to keep up with Wernher\u0027s muttered monologue.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CSo anyway, I figured that if you can\u0027t get enough air through the intake at that altitude, then why not store it onboard. Or if not air, then something that would do the same job. Then I realised that you could power the whole aircraft like that - and with a much simpler engine.

The Institute buildings were safely out of sight, hidden by the hillside and a small copse of trees. The ground underfoot was hard packed and rocky and Wernher was having trouble setting up his tripod.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201COoof, OK that\u0027s far enough.

Well, nothing that I can\u0027t undo anyway. Right - propellant tanks next.\u0022 He hung the gas cylinders on the makeshift test stand. Jeb raised his eyebrows as he recognised the name of a well known brand of camping gas stencilled on the side of one of them.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CStove gas, Wernher?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CYes, yes, stove gas and nitrous oxide.

The D1 seemed to consist of an oddly shaped nozzle attached to a metal ball which was studded with bits and pieces of equipment. Two thin hoses connected the ball to the gas cylinders, and the whole unlikely contrivance hung from the tripod on a rather expensive set of strain gauges. Cables trailed from various points into the control box in Wernher\u0027s hands.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CAre you sure about this, Wernher?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CPerfectly sure.

With a steadily building roar, the gust quickly focused into a bright blue flame. Jeb laughed.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CIt even sounds like a camping stove, Wernher.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWernher\u0027s only response was to point at the strain gauge assembly.

I think we need to give your camping stove a new name and I\u0027m thinking that LV-1 has a nice ring to it.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CLV-1?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CLaunch Vehicle One, Wernher. Launch. Vehicle.

He even put together a relatively conservative research proposal - complete with a raft of anticipated benefits for other Institute research programs - for a sounding rocket based on it. Unfortunately, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E also had a tendency to be... vocal about critics of our spaceflight ambitions, which the Institute rather took exception to. Eventually of course, we were kicked out for wasting Institute time and resources on \u201Covergrown toys and ridiculous flights of fancy.\u0022 \u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut you kept going?\u0022 said Sherfel quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe did,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher. \u201CWe pooled all our money to start up the junkyard business, partly to fund our experiments, and partly to get hold of some parts and raw materials.\u0022 He grinned. \u201COnce we were established, Geneney had the bright idea of bidding on the Institute\u0027s recycling contract. I\u0027m sure at least one of the senior professors was highly amused to see us reduced to hauling Institute scrap, but most of our best early stock - including our first pressure suits - was basically recovered from Institute dumpsters.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames shook his head. \u201CAnd you managed to build a crewed sub-orbital spacecraft out of it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt took a lot longer than we expected,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher ruefully. \u201CNot surprising really, given what we had to work with. But we made it. The Kerbal 1 flight was a success, Bill had the presence of mind to take his camera, and the rest you know about.\u0022 He rolled his shoulders. \u201CAnyway, enough storytelling - we should probably check in with Mission Control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u0027re flying straight through the window, Pioneer.

The booster stages which had lofted it into orbit almost seven days ago were long since gone, as was the Kerbin departure stage which had launched it towards the M\u00FCn. Now, shorn of its service module too, kerbalkind\u0027s first ever M\u00FCnship was reduced to its barest essence - a small conical capsule and its three crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside, Wernher stared back at the thin sliver of M\u00FCn still visible through the rendezvous window, the steadily increasing glow from Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere making it harder and harder to see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOdd colour though, I expected it to be bluer somehow. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel\u0027s urgent voice broke into his thoughts. \u201CJim - we\u0027re getting plasma!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlready?\u0022\u00A0James looked up from his instruments. \u201CKerm! Way earlier than normal. Hang on to your seats - this could get rough!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe glow intensified. A faint, high pitched scream at the edge of hearing, scraped across Wernher\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nerves. \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E plunged onwards, carving a luminous tunnel through the first wispy traces of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe capsule creaked and rattled, the contents of various storage lockers shifting under the building g-forces. Outside, the glowing plasma started to take on a yellowy orange tint. Wernher grunted at the unaccustomed pressure pressing him into his couch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOof - only point two gee. Remember the centrifuge, Wernher - remember the centrifuge!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter nearly a week in serene silence, the roar of capsule slamming into atmosphere was painfully loud. Wernher narrowed his eyes and focused on his breathing, shock-heated air casting a ruddy orange glare over the capsule interior. The capsule itself twisted and turned in a precise, computer controlled ballet, lifting slightly to ease the forces crushing the kerbonauts into their couches, then dipping back into the rapidly thickening air. Flames shot past the window, riven with incandescent flakes and chunks of burning heat shield. James glanced at them uneasily. \u003Cem\u003EHope those aren\u0027t as big as they look.\u003C/em\u003E Cold sweat pooled under his arms. \u003Cem\u003EHope they don\u0027t look that big for Tommal either.\u003C/em\u003E The capsule shook, blurring his view of the instrument panel, and the angry hiss of static filled his ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reentry fires began to recede, fading to a dull orange, shot through with occasional bursts of flame. Wernher watched the altimeter unwinding at tremendous speed as \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E plummeted through the sky. The static in his ears began to fade, replaced by James\u0027s voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Pioneer 1.

Come in, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPioneer 1, Flight!

Standing by for drogues.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a loud crack, the altimeter slowed its frantic spinning, the capsule twisting slowly from side to side. Then a heavy thump signalled the release of the main chutes. \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 1\u003C/em\u003E jerked and swayed, slowing to a graceful descent as the parachutes unfurled.

Sunlight stole around a gap in the curtains, casting a narrow white fan across the bed. Blinking muzzily, Lodan sat up and stared at his alarm clock in astonishment. Then he leapt out of bed and dashed for the moss room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe face peering back at him from the mirror was distinctly careworn around the edges with more new wrinkles around the eyes and corners of its mouth than he cared to contemplate.

He tapped a button on his keyboard, freezing the scrolling text on his screen, then swivelled to face Lodan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou always were a hopeless liar, Director,\u0022\u00A0he said without rancour. \u201CThat line about following instructions without asking questions was just a little too casual to be true.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan froze. \u201CYou knew?\u0022\u00A0he asked quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat you were hiding something? Yes - but I had no idea what.\u0022 Aldsen scrubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands and looked at Lodan wearily. \u201CIt \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E Capital News\u0027s little thunderbolt that you were carefully avoiding wasn\u0027t it? Please don\u0027t tell me it was anything worse.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan laughed humourlessly. \u201CIf you had anything worse in mind, I\u0027d hate to hear about it,\u0022 he said. He lifted a stack of computer printouts off the nearest chair and sat down. \u201CSo what brings you into the office this late in the evening?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFiguring out a way to fill out the missing numbers on our map data,\u0022 Aldsen replied, stifling a yawn. He waved at the gridded charts plastered across the walls of the main MIR laboratory. \u201CBottom right for current Kerm count, bottom left for additional supportable Kerm, I\u0027m guessing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat was the eventual plan,\u0022 Lodan said. He shook his head in disgust,\u00A0\u201COnce I was....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAllowed to tell everyone by the Twelve?\u0022 said Aldsen calmly. He raised his eyebrows at the look on Lodan\u0027s face. \u201CHopeless liar, remember. Only the Council could get you to even try.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan opened his mouth, then closed it again, contenting himself with a terse nod. \u003Cem\u003EKerm save me from logical subordinates. \u003C/em\u003E\u0022So, what do you have for me?\u0022 he asked at last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn reply, Aldsen tapped another key, waited a moment and then turned his monitor round. Lodan didn\u0027t recognise the section of Kerbin filling most of the screen but the terrain was rugged with the edge of a mountain range in the top right corner and a ragged spear of foothills bisecting the rest of the map. Aldsen typed in a command and a contour plot rapidly overlaid the image. Fascinated, Lodan leaned forward, finger hovering over the screen as he traced out the curve of one hilltop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CImpressive. Are they to scale?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey wouldn\u0027t be much help if they weren\u0027t,\u0022\u00A0said Aldsen. \u201CAnd to answer your next question - stereo imaging. Took a while to re-orient the satellite properly but once we had, we took a complete backsight image set. The maths isn\u0027t too bad - you just need a lot of computer time to extract the elevations - but good image alignment is challenging.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can imagine,\u0022 said Lodan. \u201CDo you have elevation data for the whole map.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot yet,\u0022 said Aldsen. \u201CKolus is finished and we did get quite a lot of Firesvar done before Germore\u0027s probe arrived at Minmus. Since then we haven\u0027t had as much free machine time, although I believe Firesvar is almost finished now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think we\u0027re going to need more computers,\u0022\u00A0muttered Lodan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldsen nodded. \u201CThat would be helpful. In the meantime.\u0022\u00A0He tapped in another command. There was a noticeable pause and then clusters of grey dots started appearing over the map. Another pause and each dot expanded, their edges bulging or withdrawing amoeba-like, as they flowed around the contour lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe used a fairly arbitrary Grove size on the original mapping project,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Aldsen. \u201CIt seemed like a reasonable short-cut at the time since we were primarily concerned with total numbers rather than area covered. I spent rather a lot of last night finding the proper size to use and calibrating the system to use that size. In the end it wasn\u0027t too bad - Groves are actually surprisingly regular.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan studied the map. \u201CThis valley here is almost all occupied but there\u0027s some space on the other side of that ridge. \u0022He looked at Aldsen hopefully. \u201CI don\u0027t\u00A0suppose...?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldsen smiled faintly and tapped a key. Immediately, a sprinkling of green blobs spattered across the map, blocking out most of the remaining space. The computer beeped and flashed up a depressingly low number in the bottom left corner of the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan looked at it thoughtfully. \u201CYou\u0027ve set it up for zero overlap between Groves?\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u0022 said Aldsen. \u201CI assumed that any new Groves will be planted to avoid further Blight - and besides, it made the fitting algorithm a lot easier to write.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut one could set it up for a limited amount of overlap?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldsen looked shocked. \u201CYes - but the Blight!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot if the overlap zones were properly placed,\u0022 said Lodan impatiently. \u201CPut them along rivers, on rocky or low grade land. \u201C He poked a finger at the blank spaces around the green blobs. \u201CWe\u0027re wasting a lot of space here, which we can scarcely afford.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldsen tipped his chair back as he considered the problem. \u201CDifficult,\u0022 he said at last. \u201CRivers wouldn\u0027t be too bad - we can do a feature recognition pass and extract those. I\u0027ve already built in a contour density filter so picking out cliffs and suchlike is doable. Recognising soil types though.\u0022 Aldsen looked dubious. \u201CNot sure if that would work. Not reliably anyway. And then cooking up a best fit algorithm to glue it all together?\u0022\u00A0He shook his head. \u201CPossible, Director but not probable I would say. And we could waste an awful lot of time trying to make it work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan nodded. \u201CWhich we may not have. I think we\u0027re going to need a lot more computers \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E a lot more kerbals to use them.\u0022 He straightened his shoulders.\u201CUntil then, the Minmus imaging program is officially on hold. All computing capacity in this lab - and any spare capacity outside the lab - will be allocated to completing the elevation map and populating it with correctly scaled Groves. From there, we\u0027ll do this the old-fashioned way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow much time do we have?\u0022 said Aldsen quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNobody knows for sure,\u0022 replied Lodan grimly. \u201CThe best guess we have from the Berelgan team is thirty-five to forty years, with new Seedings peaking at about twenty years from now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldsen\u0027s chair lurched forward with a crash. \u201CForty?!\u0022 he exclaimed. \u201CAnd \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E the Kerm are going to be Seeding?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan\u0027s eyes had lost their early morning shine. \u201CYes,\u0022 he said, \u201CAge doesn\u0027t seem to be a factor so far as we can tell from the Berelgan records. The Berelgan team are trying to find a way of close-planting new Kerm \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E triggering the Blight but until then we need to know how many new ones we can safely plant and where.\u0022 He cocked an eyebrow at Aldsen. \u201CNo pressure of course.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldsen swallowed hard. \u201CAnd what happens if the Berelgan can\u0027t find a way?\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen it\u0027s Germore\u0027s turn,\u0022 said Lodan. \u201CAnd we\u0027d better hope that our space program is up to the task of setting up another home on whichever planet she picks for us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle watched the line of villagers wind its way up the path, a grim-faced Ferry in the lead, followed by Fredlorf and a host of angry looking kerbals behind him. She stood aside, unable to meet Ferry\u0027s eye, as they marched through her front door and through to the sleep room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe door crashed open. Startled, Jonton looked up, saw the expression on Ferry\u0027s face and hung his head. The leaves swaddling his kerbal body drooped in sympathy. Fredlorf was the first to speak, his voice laced with bitterness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So yer not much of a hero after all, are yeh.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wasn\u0027t a question. Jonton shook his head mutely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sacrificin\u0027 yerself to save the village from the Blight that you started in the firs\u0027 place. That ain\u0027t heroism - that\u0027s payin\u0027 yer share.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe villagers around him muttered in angry agreement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No choice,\u0022 murmured Jonton, \u0022Couldn\u0027t leave the seed to die on stony ground.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Better if yeh had,\u0022 retorted Fredlorf. \u0022We\u0027d have our best fields still and you wouldn\u0027t be strung up agains\u0027 that damn tree!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShocked whispers broke the angry muttter. Ferry cleared his throat. \u0022No need for that, Fred,\u0022 he said. \u0022What sort of Keeper would leave a Kerm to die?\u0022 He shook his head. \u0022No - Jonton did right there - but why he didn\u0027t just plant that Kerm someplace else I\u0027ll never know.\u0022 The bitterness crept back into his voice. \u0022And why he couldn\u0027t tell his best friends the whole story? I\u0027ll never know that either.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because he - we - had orders not to,\u0022 said Gerselle quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Orders?\u0022 scoffed Fredlorf, \u0022Who\u0027d be givin\u0027 yeh orders?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Chief Ambassador Donman,\u0022 replied Gerselle. \u0022Representing all the Twelve Pillars.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry\u0027s jaw dropped. Fredlorf snorted. \u0022Right. An\u0027 how did they get to hearin\u0027 about it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerm leaves rustled. \u0022Because I told them,\u0022 said Jonton evenly. \u0022The Chief Ambassador was gracious enough to convey my request for Conclave to the Council.\u0022 He looked sadly at Ferry. \u0022Do you remember that conversation we had about memories? The one where I told you about sharing memories with the Kerm, Ferry - about \u003Cem\u003Ebeing\u003C/em\u003E the Kerm?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry nodded hesitantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I shared them with Chief Ambassador Donman too. I think the Council has been looking for an answer ever since.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe village Archivist coughed. \u0022An answer to what, Keeper?\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton opened his mouth to speak but Gerselle interrupted him. \u0022Why don\u0027t you just show them?\u0022 she said gently. \u0022The same way you showed the Ambassador - and the same way you showed me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u0027s leaves pricked up. \u0022 Why not?\u0022 he murmured. \u0022I used to commune with many kerbals at a time after all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle nodded. \u0022Somebody could use the leaf cluster over my bed and there are some low-lying clusters next door that could also be used. I think Ferry and Fred deserve to go first, but who else?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton gave her a lopsided smile. \u0022That\u0027s easy,\u0022 he said. \u0022Who better to put all this into context than an Archivist.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle turned to Jerdin. \u0022Would you be willing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdin blinked to clear his watering eyes. \u0022I\u0027m not sure what you mean, Gerselle,\u0022 he said politely. \u0022Willing to do what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022To commune with Jonton,\u0022 said Gerselle, \u0022With Ferry and Fred.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdin\u0027s brow wrinkled. \u0022I don\u0027t understand,\u0022 he said. \u0022Jonton is the Keeper surely - not the Kerm. And sharing a Kerm is...rather personal, is it not? In fact, is it even possible for a non-Keeper?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle looked at him sympathetically. \u0022It is,\u0022 she said, \u201CTrust me, it\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E long story but Jonton is the best one to tell it... and show it... and make you \u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E it. She thought for a moment then smiled mischievously at Jerdin. \u0022Besides, as an archivist and historian, wouldn\u0027t you like to be a part of something that no kerbal has experienced since before the Age of Madness?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdin polished his lorgnettes on his sleeve. \u0022The Age of Madness is a rather old-fashioned name,\u0022 he noted. \u0022Most of us refer to it as the Age of Myths, since the few remaining Records of that time are little more than a retelling of older myths and legends.\u0022 He shrugged. \u0022Although a few, otherwise quite respectable, historians \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E advanced the notion that some of the less fanciful remnants are the fragmented legal system of a long gone Empire.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s closer than you might think,\u0022 said Jonton quietly. \u0022In many ways the Age of Madness is \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E, Archivist - both the key to understanding our past and quite possibly the key to creating our future.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what are we waitin\u0027 for?\u0022 said Fredlorf, rolling his eyes. \u0022If Jonton\u0027s goin\u0027 ta show us something, lets get on with it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle plumped up the pillows on her bed and tapped the bedcovers. \u0022Come and lie down then, Fred.\u0022 She raised her eyebrows at his suddenly uncertain expression. \u0022Oh, for Kerm\u0027s sake.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFredlorf flushed dark green and lay down on the bed, flinching as the Kerm leaves brushed his forehead. Gerselle studied him for a moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lift your head up, Fred.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNervously, Fredlorf obeyed. Gerselle pulled a spare pillow out from under the bed and wedged it under his head. He lowered his head, eyes rolling back into their sockets as he tried to watch the leaves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are yeh sure about this, Gerselle? Thought this was only fer Keepers, like Jerdin was sayin\u0027.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not just for Keepers, Fred, \u0022 said Jonton. He looked at Jerdin. \u0022That \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E a myth - but one that was spread for a very good reason. Just try and relax - I\u0027ll tell you when it\u0027s all about to start.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle hauled a heap of spare bedcovers and pillows out of a cupboard. The now silent crowd parted before her as she made her way to the door, arms laden with quilts. Jerdin and Ferry followed her with the more curious villagers trailing along behind. In the living room, she piled up the covers in two rough pallets at the foot of the Kerm trunk. She placed a pillow under each leaf cluster and turned towards Jerdin and Ferry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Please - pick a place to lie. It doesn\u0027t matter which, just so long as the leaves can rest against your head.\u0022 She faced the group of kerbals behind them. \u0022It\u0027ll take a while for Jonton .to explain everything. You\u0027re all very welcome to stay but there won\u0027t be very much for the rest of us to see.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNervously, Jerdin and Ferry took their places under the Kerm leaves, Jerdin twitching as their hairs tickled his scalp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How long is this going to take, Gerselle? These things are making me itch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Depends how long Jonton takes,\u0022 replied Gerselle. \u0022Two hours maybe?\u0022 She caught the look on Jerdin\u0027s face. \u0022Don\u0027t worry, you won\u0027t notice the itch once the communion starts. I\u0027ll just let him know you\u0027re ready.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton tapped his fingers against his water bowl, one eye on the door, one eye on Fredlorf. He raised a eyebrow as Gerselle came into the room, dipping his head solemnly at her answering nod. He closed his eyes, reaching out, feeling for the kerbal flesh under his leaves. On the bed, Fredlorf shifted restlessly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry, Fred - I know it tickles but this won\u0027t take a minute. Just relax - I\u0027m starting the communion now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne by one, three clusters of leaves dipped towards three waiting kerbal heads. A swift burst of flickering images filled each waiting mind, followed by a soft white light. Jonton\u0027s head snapped back as a storm of emotions cascaded through the mental link; unease feeding on nervousness, swelling into fear, teetering on the edge of panic. Fighting down his own rising panic, he did his best to project calm reassurance, confidence and \u003Cem\u003Estillness\u003C/em\u003E. Gradually the storm steadied, quivering like a wild animal poised between fight or flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECan everybody hear me?\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFredlorf\u0027s head jerked up. \u0022How in the... Jonton?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIt\u0027s me, Fred. No need to talk, just think of whatever you need to say. I don\u0027t quite know how this works with four - Ferry, Jerdin, can you hear us?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe quivering, nascent panic began to recede. A growing wonder bloomed in Jonton\u0027s mind, spiralling upwards into delight as swiftly as the previous unease had spirallled downwards into panic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThis is Ferry. I \u003C/em\u003Ecan\u003Cem\u003E hear you Jonton - and Fred too! Are you alright, Jerdin?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMuch more than alright, Ferry! This is... Kerm, I don\u0027t have the words for this.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA ripple of relief and barely masked concern lapped over the three kerbals. Jonton sensed their reflected concern racing back towards him, magnified into a tidal wave of clumsily projected reassurance and joy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWoahhhh - steady everyone, steady! I\u0027m fine, I\u0027m fine! This is going to take some getting used to, I think. Right, pictures next. Let me know if you can see anything.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mental link fell silent. Jonton sensed eddies of expectation, then a surge of excitement followed by puzzlement. Ferry was the first to speak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI don\u0027t know about Fred or Jerdin but I can see a sapling and ... a kerbal I think. Not sure what else it could be but it\u0027s like no kerbal I\u0027ve ever seen before.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrents of agreement and confusion lapped against Jonton\u0027s mind. Slowly he blew out a gusty sigh, running through his story in his mind whilst struggling not to broadcast his every thought to the others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOh he\u0027s definitely a kerbal, Ferry.\u003C/em\u003E Jonton paused. \u003Cem\u003EOne of my first kerbals in fact. Welcome to the Kerbin of your far distant ancestors.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last image of Barkton faded back into white light. Fredlorf sat up, blinking and rubbing his head. He stared at Jonton wordlessly. Footsteps echoed outside and Ferry and Jerdin appeared in the doorway, followed by Gerselle and the few villagers who had opted to wait. Silently, Ferry and Jerdin sat down on the bed beside Fredlorf, watching as everybody else filed in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Looks like we\u0027ve got some more buildin\u0027 work to do, Jonton.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFredlorf ran his fingers through his hair. \u0022Providin\u0027 that you an Gerselle don\u0027 mind of course. If yeh can talk to three of us, reckon you could speak to as many as could fit around yer trunk. They\u0027ll be needing summat to lie on though, specially if we\u0027re goin\u0027 to be using those high-up leaves.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe villagers standing against the wall looked confused but Gerselle just nodded. \u0022Reckon you\u0027re right Fred.\u0022 She smiled at her husband. \u0022Better get used to telling that story, my love.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry raised .his head \u0022Yes. Everyone is the village needs to see this.\u0022 He lifted his hands helplessly. \u0022Everyone on \u003Cem\u003EKerbin\u003C/em\u003E needs to see this for that matter, although I have no idea how.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But what are we going to do, Jonton?\u0022 said Jerdin, wide-eyed. \u201CThe Blight, the Seeding... what are we going to do?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton stirred. \u0022I\u0027ve finally got half an idea about that,\u0022 he said. Gerselle looked at him in surprise. \u0022The easy half I would think but it\u0027s a start. Jerdin - I\u0027m going to need a map that you don\u0027t mind me drawing on - plus one of your folding tables from the Records hall. Oh - and a pair of compasses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdin nodded jerkily. \u0022I\u0027ll be right back, Jonton.\u0022 He jumped to his feet and dashed out of the room. One of the villagers chuckled to see the normally unflappable Archivist scuttling away like an overenthusiastic kerblet but his laughter petered out in the silence. He stared at Ferry and Fredlorf, both leaning against the wall, eyes distant and unfocused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what did you see?\u0022 he asked. \u0022What was the big explanation, the long story?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry looked at him blankly. Fredlorf shook his head. \u0022Reckon Gerselle had that part right,\u0022 he said quietly. \u0022You\u0027d need to ask Jonton - wouldn\u0027t sound right comin\u0027 from me and most of it\u0027s in the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eshowing\u003C/em\u003E anyways. But if I told yeh it was the best thing in the world bein\u0027 used to show yeh the worst things in the world, that would start to get there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a long, awkward silence, punctuated by the rustle of ponchos and shuffling feet and the occasional cough. Then, the silence was broken by clattering and the rapid slap-slap-slap of sandalled feet. Jerdin burst into the room, robes flapping about his ankles, laden with map and table. Panting, he unfolded the table, unrolled the map over it and set both down within easy reach of Jonton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Got...the rest... here too, Keeper.\u0022 Jerdin fumbled in his pocket, nearly dropping the drawing instruments in his haste. \u0022Think... that was everything?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton studied the map for a moment. \u0022That\u0027s perfect, Jerdin - thank you. If everyone could gather round?\u0022 He waited until all the villagers found a space around the map, before unfolding the compasses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. As best I can tell, we planted Gerselle\u0027s Grove here.\u0022 Jonton pointed at the map. \u0022Her Kerm\u0027s territory extends to the sunfruit fields...here, so it\u0027s total range isn\u0027t far off this.\u0022 He drew a circle on the map. \u0022Now \u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E territory covers the rest of our fields - obviously - but also the surrounding woodlands. There\u0027s no Grove yet on the other side of the woods but if there was, its Kerm\u0027s territory would cover \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E ground here.\u0022 Jonton drew another circle on the map and looked up expectantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerry saw it immediately. \u0022What about the overlap? We don\u0027t want Blight in the woods.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Better the woods than the fields,\u0022 answered Jonton, \u0022but you\u0027re right - we don\u0027t want more Blight if we can help it - and I believe we \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E help it.
