That was a lot of fun.\n\nThis time, I wanted to make a bit of more general space-faring music inspired by my love of KSP.\n\n[KS1 Launch](https://supersaturn.bandcamp.com/track/ks1-launch) is meant to be an inspiring track about leaving the surface of Kerbin. (In my punk rock cover, I make reference to a vessel \u0022KS1\u0022 which is the name I always give my starting vessels on a new campaign ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) the acronym is not that difficult to figure out lol) [The rest of the EP](https://supersaturn.bandcamp.com/album/albiorix-ep) is all quite lovely and spacey too, so maybe throw some of these tunes on while you fly!\n\nHope this makes some pilots happy ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Fly safe!"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T16:24:01Z","Content":"Awesome!
