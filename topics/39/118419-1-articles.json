For the next stream I do (Likely tomorrow) I will need someone with good knowledge of KSP\u0027s aerodynamics system. The new Banshee variant is suffering from \u0022overyaw,\u0022 and I want to know if I am using too large of a control surface for yaw or if there is an inherent design flaw causing the issue."},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T19:14:38Z","Content":"Starting up a new stream to continue to modify some of my NAFA aircraft up to the latest version, if anyone wants to join."},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T21:46:16Z","Content":"I think it is time to do a nice photoshoot for my new aircraft.

The low flying can be a bit nerve-racking sometimes.
