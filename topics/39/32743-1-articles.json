KHI owes no small part of its success to the Courage and Stupidity of many loyal employees who have spent their lives, quite literally, in service to KHI. Unfortunatly, due to a recent lab accident, all previous employee records have been sucked through a TurboJet engine, and so we are unable to publicly honour their sacrifice. Henceforth, all posthumous honour shall be listed here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E::Honour Roll::\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo deaths recorded\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, on to better news. KHI is please to announce the successful launch of our new Space Station, [KHI SS] High Angel. High Angel has already proven to be a superb base for orbital craft, having acted as a fuel depo and staging post for smaller craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere it is, sedately holding a 275,000m orbit around Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r103/dented_head/HighAngel-Kazi-Stanger_zpsa21e4854.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HighAngel-Kazi-Stanger_zpsa21e4854.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently docked in the above image is the first of the new model fighters, the [KHI LF] Stanger. The Stanger class light fighter features a small dock on the front, as well as a standard dock on the rear. KHI are currently developing a range of re-armable torpedoes to equip them with, though this is proving more complex than initially planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso docked is High Angels own defense system, the [KHI SM] Kazi smart missile. This missile has proven an effective deterrent, and since the implementation of what is now come to be called \u0022The Big Stick\u0022 policy, KHI has detected no credible threat to our assets to date.

Proto 1 de-coupled the PBM, with the intent to at least resupply Rogue 1, but lacked the fuel, having expended it attempting to halt the PBMs drift relative to High Angel. Rogue 1 figured he may as well go get his own damn torpedoes, and rescue Proto while he was at it. Well... strange things happen when you try to fly two craft, facing each other, joined by 4 torpedoes. Rogue 1 described it as \u0022trying to push a Dartmouth* up a cliff\u0022. Long story short, he got stranded with no thruster fuel too. He has about 1/3 of a tank of rocket fuel, but will need resupply before he can dock. Rogue 1 is, however, currently combat effective.
