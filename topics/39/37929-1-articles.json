Globally, you can consider that any game containing any kind of \u0022violence\u0022 will be 12\u002B. If the violence involved is more or less \u0022realistic\u0022, if improper language is used, you can play it online or if there is any \u0022horrific\u0022 content, it will be at least 16\u002B. If there\u0027s any evocation of sexuality, drugs or money games, it will likely be rated as 18\u002B but it can still be 16\u002B in some cases. But if there\u0027s any \u0022crude violence\u0022 (understand blood, on-screen deaths, etc.) it\u0027s automatically a 18\u002B game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT : in my opinion, testing a game in alpha (alpha clearly meaning \u0022the game is not feature complete, some core mechanics aren\u0027t in yet\u0022) is flat-out dumb.

Rating seperate elements on a x/20 scale doesn\u0027t convey much to begin with, and this is why more established critics like film reviews don\u0027t even bother with this nonsense. Applying this system on a game in development is even more stupid. Just look at the sound, i think their rating there is actually understandable. However that\u0027s just because the sounds aren\u0027t made yet, so rating it in the first place isn\u0027t really possible.\u003Cp\u003EThis should have been a solely text-based preview without any rating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the few general reactions of journalists to ksp i\u0027ve read until now were usually surprisingly positive, considering it\u0027s such an unusual, complex and hard game without direct rewards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are entirely right, that\u0027s also what I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"glacierre","CreatedById":63209,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T18:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Themohawkninja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Themohawkninja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESquad is a company with people that need an income, so the game needs to cost money so he company can live, which is nearly regardless of the development state of the game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFine, but has nothing to do with what I said.
