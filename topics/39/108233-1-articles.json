It\u0027s ongoing, so...\n\nKSP: From Humble Beginnings\n\nThe year: 2015 K.E.\n\nAfter millennia of strife which saw the Kerbal race brought to the brink of annihilation, peace reigns. The Kerbal race retreated underground following a disastrous nuclear exchange, but whilst living primarily in the vast series of caverns under Kerbin, something extraordinary happened.\n\nThe Unification of Kerbalkind. It began as a sect of peace-loving hippies, the Kermen, whose message of universal tolerance and acceptance was ignored by most before the Fall, but was now taken seriously. Those leaders and power blocs who wanted to perpetuate the fighting and acrimony were voted out, shunned, and in some ironic cases forcibly overthrown, and to commemorate the unification, family surnames have been replaced with the surname \u0022Kerman.\u0022\n\nThe surface fallout has receded, but with most of the hearty Kerbal race well-adapted to life underground, few care to venture aboveground anymore.\n\nSome few, however, still venture to the surface; some wish to rebuild the surface\u0027s ruined cities, others yearn to soar through the blue skies again.\n\nAnd some Kerbals think those Kerbals don\u0027t aim high enough. Some know that before the Fall, Kerbalkind had mastery of the skies, and the blackness beyond had been encroached upon. Of course, those industries were largely lost, but not entirely.\n\nThe Grassland Downs Amateur Rocketry Society consisted of four Kerbals but it started with three: Jebediah Kerman, the oldest (by five minutes) and hence, the inheritor of their mother\u0027s junkyard and the money man, and his brothers Bill and Bob, the brawn and brains, respectively. They were joined by their fourth rocketeer when one of their model rocket launches was interrupted with explosive results when another model rocket soared out from behind a nearby hill and intercepted theirs. Valentina Kerman had joined the gang.\n\nValentina, however, had bigger ambitions than just launching toys into the sky. In her own travels on the surface, she had uncovered an old airport with a VAB and launch pad a mere fifty miles or so from Grassland Downs. It was very old, with an unpaved runway and a rough circle of concrete for a launch pad, corrugated iron airplane hangar, a few rough outbuildings and a small science lab. It predated the time of the Fall by about a century, give or take a few-three decades, and had apparently been unused at the time, and thus spared the devastation.\n\nUpon seeing the old test facility, the brothers knew their calling had come, especially when they discovered the famed Dr. Wernher von Kerman, one of the loudest and most respected voices advocating for the Kerbal return to space, tinkering in the old lab, having been sacked from his previous post as a parts designer for the Rockomax Corp after he had massively over-engineered several types of fuel storage tanks and then revealed to the company directors how their tanks would be ideal rocket fuel tanks.\n\nThe seeds were set in motion, and more recruits were located:\n\nJebediah\u0027s accountant Mortimer Kerman was quickly brought aboard to see to the financial feasibility of the project, as part of his normal duties with the hastily-renamed Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Space Program. His wise suggestion that Jebediah incorporate his spaceflight endeavours separately from his junkyard led to the final name of Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Company, and to the Kerbal Space Program, which Mortimer secured public funding for and thus became not a company, but an NGO agency.\n\nLinus Kerman, Wernher\u0027s former assistant, was easily recruited from his high-paying job as Wernher\u0027s replacement at Rockomax as he too shared the good doctor\u0027s passion for rocketry, and the prospect of actually launching a Kerbal above the atmosphere was far more exciting to him than a good 401(k) or job security.\n\nBob knew a Kerbal spin-doctor, late of the Probodobodyne company. His efforts pitching their latest series of deep-earth drill probes had been a dismal failure, largely because the new series was in every way inferior to the previous series, but the company sacked him rather than their designers, and bad-mouthed him so he wouldn\u0027t land another job. Walt Kerman joined as soon as the offer of a hammock, indoor plumbing and sandwiches were extended.\n\nBill\u0027s best friend, other than his brothers and Valentina, was the extremely capable construction foreman Gus Kerman; a Kerbal with nerves quite possibly more steady than Jebediah\u0027s, Gus was well-used to extinguishing fires on the job, and could build anything from a custom industrial park to cavern-ceiling scraper high-rises. Bill got him to join by suggesting that he take a half-year sabbatical to try the space program, and see how he liked it; if the Kerbal Space Program really took off, eventually they\u0027d build a space elevator, and Gus\u0027s name would go down in history as the man who got it built. (Bill was genuinely surprised to later learn from Linus that space elevators were a real concept and it might actually be possible.)\n\nThe last of the founding group approached them; Gene Kerman had heard through a friend of a friend of a friend of Wernher von Kerman about the founding space agency. A former administrator and mission controller for one of the Grassland Downs Aviation Society, Gene always wanted to go to space, but the directors always shot it down as being too risky and offering no prospects.\n\nKSP: The Early Days\n\nThe early life of the Kerbal Space Program marked by amateur endeavours and fiscal mishap, with vast sums of the Space Program\u0027s starting budget, which consisted mostly of Jebediah Kerman\u0027s personal fortune, invested for good or for ill in facility upgrades, while the crew launched larger and larger model rockets from a real launch pad. Although this made Mortimer very unhappy, the tiny sensors they were affixing to those probes was enough to get a trickle of data coming in, with which Wernher worked near-miracles... Although Linus would say that most of the early advances were not so much the result of the data from the sounding rockets\u0027 college-level toy sensors processed by Wernher von Kerman as the data he was digging out of the antiquated, paper archives that were in the stacks.\n\nThings came to a head when Mortimer and Gene stormed into the VAB one day and threw down a file folder, right under the engine of a gigantic, four-meter tall sounding rocket.\n\n\u0022What\u0027s this,\u0022 Valentina was the first to ask, and Gene crossed his arms.\n\n\u0022This, gentlemen, lady, is your last launch,\u0022 was the irate reply. \u0022After this, we\u0027re broke. Done for. After your stunt upgrading the VAB,\u0022 he said, gesturing around to the newly-modernized building, \u0022we are out of funds. We have maybe enough money to pay for taxis to drive everybody home. Less than three grand.\u0022\n\nThe four rocketeers and the assorted launch crew standing around turned a pale shade of lime. \u0022Broke?\u0022 Jebediah asked, his mental gears already turning.\n\n\u0022Yes, Jeb. Broke. And I\u0027ve already crunched the numbers. Even if you sell the junkyard outright, we\u0027re so heavily leveraged into spaceship parts production that any fiscally-responsible buyer would only give us scraps.\u0022\n\n\u0022My mother left me that junkyard - us,\u0022 Jeb clarified, drawing his brothers to him, \u0022and she got it from her mother, who got it from her father, who got it from his father, who won it from a friend in a game of poker. It\u0027s not for sale.\u0022\n\n\u0022Then we\u0027d better make this last launch a good one,\u0022 Gene said, \u0022because after this, we\u0027re kaput, unless someone bails us out.\u0022\n\n\u0022Um... That might be possible.\u0022\n\nAll heads involved turned to look at the Kerbal wearing the hazmat suit. Mortimer blinked. \u0022Walter, what are you doing wearing a hazmat suit?\u0022\n\nWalt shifted. \u0022I, uh... I found it in an old locker and I thought it looked good. I was going to wear it to the next strat meeting as a joke on the toxic environment that is P.R... But anyway, that\u0027s not the point.\u0022\n\n\u0022You have a plan,\u0022 Gene asked, and Walt nodded.\n\n\u0022Yes I do! We get bailed out.\u0022 Walt enthusiastically clapped his hands together, once, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.\n\nSilence reigned for a moment, then Gene asked \u0022Okay, smart guy, how do you plan to do that?\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s simple,\u0022 Gus said. \u0022I remind the public grants agencies how much money they\u0027ve already invested in us, and convince them we\u0027re too big to fall, so they can\u0027t just let us close shop for good because of a lack of money. They\u0027ll \\*have\\* to pay out!\u0022\n\n\u0022Uh... Won\u0027t like, everyone hate us if we do that,\u0022 Bob asked, and Walt nodded.\n\n\u0022Absolutely!\u0022 Walt clapped his hands together again, the hollow sound of his hazmat mittens reverberating through the VAB. \u0022Nothing the public hates more than hearing that a fiscally-irresponsible boondoggle wasted a ton of public cash and was then given more of their tax money!\u0022\n\nSilence reigned for a few more moments, and then Gene asked, at a volume usually reserved for shouting from the upper catwalks to someone below the lowest catwalk on the far side of the VAB, \u0022How in the hell does that make anything better!?\u0022\n\n\u0022No, he\u0027s right! By Kott, he\u0027s right!\u0022 All eyes swiveled to see the new joiner to the conversation, though the thick accent and foreign loanword could only herald the arrival of Dr. Wernher von Kerman. \u0022It doesn\u0027t matter vhat the public zhinks, zo long as zhey don\u0027t hate us so badly zhey burn ze place to ze ground. Bad reputation can be fixed; if ve deliver zome spectacular rezults, everyone vill have forgotten about how ve vent around, hat-in-hand, to get ze money to deliver zhem!\u0022\n\nGene snapped his fingers. \u0022Yeah... Yeah! Damnit, you\u0027re right, Doc, Walt. Mortimer, what do you think?\u0022\n\nWith an ambivalent shrug, Mortimer nodded. \u0022Fiscally speaking, getting a bail-out grant is feasible. If we were incorporated, they\u0027d probably attach strings and conditions to it. As we\u0027re a public agency, they might demand some kind of restructuring...\u0022\n\n\u0022Alright. Then we\u0027ll beat them to the punch,\u0022 Gene said. He pointed to the four rocketeers. \u0022From now on until we have more than a million in the bank, you four don\u0027t get to make any budgetary decisions. Gus!\u0022\n\nGus Kerman had been listening in, but hadn\u0027t chimed up. He raised his wrench. \u0022Yeah, Gene?\u0022\n\nGene pointed at the stacks of brightly-colored sounding rocket parts. \u0022It\u0027s time to hike up our britches and put on the big-boy pants. Throw away or sell off all the model rocket parts. Starting today, all our effort is focused on getting a Kerbal into space, so we can actually call ourselves a Space Program.\u0022\n\nValentina, Bill, Bob, and Jebediah shot Gene a nasty look, and Gene sighed, rolling his eyes. \u0022Okay, you can launch that one on schedule,\u0022 he said, gesturing to the vividly-colored, red-and-orange monster sounding rocket. \u0022But that\u0027s the last of them. We\u0027re probably gonna go broke anyway, so we may as well go big doing it. Cheer up,\u0022 he said, with a smug grin. \u0022We\u0027re gonna make real astronauts out of you kids.\u0022\n\nKSP: The flight of Salvation 0.5\n\n\u0022So, Doc... Is this going to work?\u0022\n\n\u0022All my calculations indicate zhat it vill.\u0022\n\n\u0022Doc, I\u0027m not asking for calculations here. I\u0027m asking, will this work?\u0022\n\nDoctor Wernher von Kerman shrugged at Gene Kerman\u0027s question. \u0022Zhere are no guarantees in life, except death... Und I have colleagues working on zhat problem as ve speak.\u0022\n\nGene raised an eyebrow at the good Doctor. \u0022What do you mean?\u0022\n\n\u0022Transkerbalism, my friend! Zhat is a long und fascinating subject, but zhis may not be ze time,\u0022 the Doctor replied, and Linus stepped up around him.\n\n\u0022Gene, what Herr Doktor is trying to say is that, unless something goes catastrophically wrong, this \\*will\\* work.\u0022\n\nGene rubbed his hand through his hair, and sat on the chair behind him, stroking his hand over the vest his wife had knit him. KSP had yet to pay its employees in anything except food and board, and when he\u0027d written his wife about the accident in the lab last month that had resulted in most of his wardrobe dissolving, she\u0027d sent him handmade replacements.\n\nAt least there\u0027d been no complaining about favoritism or embezzlement. All of the top participants in the program were heavily leveraged into it themselves, and Jebediah and his brothers were practically all-in, having underwritten a large loan for the program with the junkyard as collateral. If this didn\u0027t work, everyone was going to lose their shirts, and Jeb might pay a considerably higher price than that.\n\n\u0022So, what kind of catastrophes could we see here?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, something might go wrong in one of the engines. We don\u0027t have a launch escape system in place, so getting Jeb out of there will be tricky to impossible if something were to be going wrong on launch, or in flight,\u0022 Linus suggested. \u0022Or the heat shield might fail.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ve still are not convinced zhat a heat shield is necessary for a straight up und down like zhis,\u0022 Doctor von Kerman added, and Gene shrugged.\n\n\u0022Yeah, but if we tell Jeb he can get away without a heat shield now, he\u0027ll insist on leaving them off on all of these trips, and that will lead to a disaster sooner or later,\u0022 Linus said. \u0022And, of course, the parachute might malfunction.\u0022\n\nGene rubbed his eyes. \u0022Okay. So, a lot could go wrong. I got it.\u0022 He turned his chair to the desk, looking up at the big screen. Cameras focused on the launch pad from some ways away showed the rocket - a tall, slender, almost phallic thing, with only the sharply tapered nose of the capsule and the fins on the bottom to make it not look like a gigantic ink-pen. A second camera showed Jebediah Kerman wearing his spacesuit, in the capsule, his helmet was off.\n\n\u0022Hey, Val,\u0022 he asked into the microphone. \u0022Why is your lunch in my capsule?\u0022\n\nAt the far side of mission control, Valentina Kerman stood with Jebediah\u0027s two brothers. Gene facepalmed, as Valentina leaned into the desk, speaking into her microphone. \u0022Because it should have been my capsule, Jeb, and I put my lunch in it last night.\u0022\n\nRubbing his eyelids, Gene keyed his mic. \u0022Okay, guys, no more arguing. You lost the poker game fair and square, Val.\u0022 Getting the two pilots, though the phrase was best used euphemistically when discussing Jebediah and Valentina, to agree to a way to decide on which of them got to go had not been easy.\n\n\u0022I wouldn\u0027t have if you\u0027d let me bet my bra,\u0022 Valentina muttered, but then she brightened up. \u0022Anyway, I put my lunch in before the poker game, when it was still my flight, and I forgot to take it out, okay?\u0022\n\nJebediah held up a bag of popular, super-spicy tortilla snacks. \u0022That\u0027s okay. I\u0027m going to eat your lunch.\u0022\n\nValentina snickered, and placed at her desk a big blue toolbox with \u0027Jeb\u0027s Lunch\u0027 sticky-labeled on the side. \u0022Then I\u0027m going to eat yours. This had better be tavern ham.\u0022\n\n\u0022Er... It\u0027s... Mushroom Forest Ham?\u0022\n\nAfter a moment, Valentina shrugged. \u0022This is acceptable. Don\u0027t you dare die out there, Jebediah Kerman.\u0022\n\n\u0022Right. Can the chatter, kids,\u0022 Gene said, into his microphone. \u0022We\u0027re at T-5:00 to launch. Eat fast, Jeb.\u0022\n\nOn the screen, Jebediah quickly improvised, setting Valentina\u0027s sandwich on his chest and opening it up, adding the eye-wateringly hot tightly-rolled tortillas to it, before crunching down on the enhanced sandwich. Gene couldn\u0027t even stand to look at something so spicy without cringing, but the test pilot was chowing down with unmasked enthusiasm. With the flight crews\u0027 mouths full, Gene had bought himself the precious time he needed to check with the far-more-professional mission control staff; a huge checklist of things which could have gone wrong, scrubbed their launch, rolled by without a single fault, as Jeb scarfed his sandwich and put his helmet back on.\n\n\u0022I hope his stomach is as ironclad as he claims,\u0022 Linus murmured at his side. \u0022We don\u0027t have any provision for vacuuming vomit out of a space helmet.\u0022\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t worry about zhat,\u0022 Wernher advised his intern. \u0022Jebediah Kerman has the second strongest stomach ve haff tested.\u0022\n\n\u0022Sure, in a centrifuge,\u0022 Linus said. \u0022We don\u0027t have any live action test data, though.\u0022\n\n\u0022Zhen pay attention and take notes,\u0022 Doctor von Kerman ordered him, \u0022and ve vill get zome data vun vay or anozer.\u0022\n\n\u0022Can it, docs,\u0022 Gene said, leaning up in his chair as the countdown clock hit 0:15, and the mission timer started the countdown.\n\n\u0022We are at T-10; 9; 8; 7; 6; 5; 4; 3; 2; 1; ignition!\u0022\n\nSalvation 0.5 was a simple rocket, all told- an FL-T400 with a Swivel engine, both manufactured by Jeb\u0027s Junkyard, above a Rockomax BACC Thumper, with an attached Quadcore service module from New Horizons and Nox Industrial, above it a standard service bay, and a decoupler. Above that was the simplest imaginable flight stage; an O.M.B. Demolitions heat shield, a Mk 1 Command Pod produced by Kerlington, and a Mk. 16 parachute nose-cone that had been found lying by the side of an old dirt track which Jebediah swore the junkyard boys had refurbished to perfectly working order.\n\nThe big Rockomax engine ignited, and Jebediah got a giddy grin on his face as the rocket shot skyward. Gene glanced down at the contracts in his hand; an observer from the Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society was on-hand to record what the KSP had promised would be the first flight into space. That was worth a lot of money to the program, not to mention the potential outstanding bounties for highest velocity and longest flight from the vehicle departure point. They were competing with the aviation societies for that one after Kerbin World-Firsts had declared that rocket-powered craft were in fact eligible for those prizes.\n\nGene didn\u0027t feel even a slight pang of guilt over that. He\u0027d been arguing for ages that the Grassland Downs Aviation Society should become the Grassland Downs Aerospace Society, and that they should stop trying to literally reinvent aviation whilst ignoring the techniques, data, and technologies already pioneered by pre-Fall Kerbalkind. On-screen, Jebediah looked absolutely thrilled, and Gene blinked as he saw that in the span of a few moments\u0027 introspection, Jeb was already six kilometers up.\n\n\u0022Hey,\u0022 Bill said, into his microphone. \u0022Did anybody remember to remove the thrust limiter on that middle BACC?\u0022 Gene blinked; originally as-designed, Salvation 1 had been a four-stage rocket, with two full-thrust BACCs on the side of the main, middle BACC, which had been limited at 90%. Gene shrugged, and looked at Gus, who also shrugged, and looked at Doctor Wernher von Kerman, who was sharing a mutual glare with his assistant.\n\n\u0022You mean I could be going even faster,\u0022 Jeb asked with a disappointed look on his face, and Gene snorted. \u0022You\u0027re already goin\u0027 up at over mach one, Jeb. You\u0027re the fastest Kerbal since the Fall, so be happy.\u0022\n\n\u0022Waitaminute, forget the thrust limiter,\u0022 Bob said. \u0022When we switched from those two FL-T200s to the FL-T400, did anyone remember to reattach the parachutes?!\u0022\n\nAnother round of guilty looks went around, and Mortimer facepalmed. \u0022Does anyone but me have any idea how much that middle stage costs?\u0022 Gene grimaced; he had a rough idea that it was A Lot, but he didn\u0027t have the exact figures on hand.\n\n\u0022Fifteen-thousand, three hundred seventy K-Bux,\u0022 Mortimer said. \u0022The whole rocket only costs twenty-thousand, nine-hundred one!\u0022\n\nGene grimaced, reaching for his box of antacids, as Mortimer did likewise, but Doctor von Kerman shrugged. \u0022Vell, a small sacrifice for ze data ve vill get out of zhis flight - look, he\u0027s already in ze upper atmosphere!\u0022 Gene looked back up, his antacid chewables forgotten, to see something amazing; Jebediah Kerman was busily taking notes on his smartphone with one hand, while the other was flipping through the read-outs of his onboard instruments, and the control stick was carefully balanced between his knees, keping the rocket perfectly level.\n\nGene put his hand over his microphone. \u0022Doc, uh... I just realized something. how are we going to recover the data if it\u0027s in the stage that\u0027s gonna burn up?\u0022 Doctor von Kerman smiled at him. \u0022Ze zhanks for zhat go to Gus and my assistant Linus. Linus noted that it was possible to manually remove ze data drives from ze experiments, und asked Gus to run ze cables through ze decoupler stage to record ze data on ze capsule\u0027s hard drives. Ve expect quite ze bounty! Both in data, und in ze funding from ze prizes.\u0022\n\nGus beamed at the praise from Doctor von Kerman, while Gene let out a sigh of relief. He was about to say something, when a loud \u0022Yahooo!\u0022 caught everyone\u0027s eyes, and he looked back to the main screen.\n\nA chorous of gasps and shrieks filled mission control, as Jebediah\u0027s feet were the only part of him in the camera frame. He had opened the capsule and climbed out of it.\n\n\u0022Jebediah Kerman, are you insane,\u0022 Valentina demanded, almost at a shriek, as Jeb pulled himself all the way out. No sooner had he done so, however, than he slammed himself back in, slamming the capsule closed. \u0022You\u0027re not in space yet, dummy,\u0022 she chastised him, and Jeb laughed.\n\n\u0022Yeah, but the air pressure up here\u0027s so thin, and I\u0027m out of fuel, that holding on isn\u0027t hard,\u0022 Jeb said, pointing to his altimeter, which had just passed 62Km. \u0022And I got an amazing selfie!\u0022\n\nGene tipped four antacid chewables into his hand, as Linus said \u0022Ooooh, we\u0027ll want a copy of that, Jeb,\u0022 he said, and Jebediah nodded. \u0022Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s already queued up.\u0022 He started quickly dictating notes about his upper-atmospheric EVA to his phone, and finished up just before he hit 70Km, the accepted definition of the boundary of space.\n\nGene glanced to the front of the mission control center, where the observer from the Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society very visibly made a huge check-mark on his clipboard, and Mortimer let out a sigh of relief. Jeb was still ascending, and scribbling notes, while working the controls for his scientific instrument cluster.\n\n\u0022Okay, Jeb, you\u0027re in space. You ready for another EVA? One that was planned this time,\u0022 his brother Bill asked, and Jeb laughed.\n\n\u0022You betcha. Just give me a minute...\u0022 Jeb finished scribbling notes, as the radar altimiter indicated his ascending speed had begun to fall. Jebediah popped out, and stayed out until the capsule hit and then blew past 0 m/s ascent speed. He popped back in, laughing. \u0022Floating up here is incredible, guys!\u0022 He navigated himself back into his seat with ease like he was born to do it, strapped in, reached up and plucked his phone from outside the capsule, then closed the hatch.\n\n\u0022Time to come home now,\u0022 Jebediah said. \u0022I\u0027ll see y\u0027all in a few minutes.\u0022 He then cranked his control stick hard over.\n\nGene felt his throat tighten, and he crushed the box of antacid pills in his hand. \u0022Jeb, what the hell are you doing,\u0022 he asked, as he watched the big representation of the craft\u0027s navball spin on-screen in mission control.\n\n\u0022I\u0027m gettin\u0027 rid of the stage below me, what\u0027d you think I was doing?\u0022 With the ball spinning, Jebediah hit the stage button on his console one more time, and the the spinning suddenly accelerated rapidly, then stablized with surprising ease, facing the sky.\n\n\u0022What... I... What?\u0022 Gene stammered, and Valentina let out a laugh.\n\n\u0022Well, if he comes straight down and he just stages with the rocket below him, he\u0027s gonna hit it,\u0022 Valentina said into her microphone. \u0022By spinning real hard and letting it go when he was facing down, he flung it away from the capsule.\u0022\n\n\u0022It is not incorrect to zay he also flung himzelf away from ze upper rocket stage,\u0022 Doctor von Kerman added, \u0022But yes, ze principle vorks! It gets ze rocket stage out of ze way, with no need for ze seperation rockets ve have yet to procure. It is clever, and costs us nothing but ze electricity in ze batteries to run ze reaction veels!\u0022\n\nGene swallowed his mouthful of antacid with a swig of coffee, and just settled back to watch, as Jeb hurtled down through the atmosphere. Numbers ticked down, while Jeb had a surprisingly serene look on his face. He still hadn\u0027t triggered his parachute by the time he passed 5,000m, and Gene sat up, starting to worry. \u0022Jeb? Jeb, you need to fire your chutes.\u0022\n\nThe rocket had drifted west - or the planet had rotated under it, either was fair to say - and Jeb was going to come down in the grassy hills west of the spaceport\u0027s mostly-level coastal plain. \u0022Jeb? The chutes,\u0022 he prompted again at 3Km, and Jeb remained silent.\n\n\u0022Jeb! Now!\u0022 Valentina urged into her microphone just as Jeb passed 2Km, and he reached out, flicking the switch when he hit 1,500m. The parachute deployed, and his vertical descent speed dropped rapidly. Gene gulped, watching the numbers tick down; all of the nmbers, then when the chute fully deployed, Jeb\u0027s descent drastically slowed, and he drifted to the ground calmly from 200m.\n\nEverybody in mission control breathed a collective sigh of relief, as Jebediah reached up, opening his capsule. \u0022Jeb, it\u0027s okay,\u0022 Gene said. \u0022We\u0027ve got some boys in a truck heading out to get you now. You don\u0027t have to walk home.\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027m not going to walk home,\u0022 Jebediah said. \u0022But we don\u0027t have an EVA report from the grasslands, and I want to plant a flag. I figure I\u0027ve got some time before the truck gets here.\u0022\n\nGene laughed at him, shaking his head. \u0022Yeah, all right, smart-ass. Get yourself another selfie, and come on home.\u0022 He cut his microphone. \u0022How long can you guys justify quarantining him? We all owe Jeb some payback for those stunts.\u0022\n\n\u0022Perhaps a veek,\u0022 Doctor von Kerman suggested, \u0022und I\u0027ll be sure to schedule him for zome very unpleasant, very thorough physical examinations.\u0022\n\nThe doctor had a bright grin on his face. \u0022But look at all zis vundebah data! Ve vill be busy for ages!\u0022 He was poking a checklist of the conditions and experiments Jeb had brought back experiment data for, and Gene laughed.\n\n\u0022Yeah, yeah. Go, then. Go, laugh it up. I\u0027m going to crawl into my hammock and collapse after that.\u0022 Gene slumped back in his chair, breathing a sigh of relief."},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowDragon8685","CreatedById":65374,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T18:46:08Z","Content":"KSP: The First Flight of Excursion 1\n\n\u0022So, what\u0027s the point of this again,\u0022 Bob asked, standing on the catwalk mid-way up the VAB, looking at the rocket under construction.\n\n\u0022Simple, Bob.\u0022 Bill held up his hands, sawing his thumb and two fingers together.\n\n\u0022The world\u0027s smalled violin? What does that have to do with that,\u0022 Bob asked, pointing at the rocket under construction, and Valentina rolled her eyes.\n\n\u0022Money, dear boy! Money!\u0022 She laughed, reaching up and smacking Bob on the back of the head. \u0022Since Jeb\u0027s suborbital flight, rich idiots and CEOs have been clamouring for a taste. So we\u0027re building this thing to send three kerbals up at once.\u0022\n\nBob shrugged. \u0022Okay, but none of us are rich idiots, and while Jeb might be something like a CEO because he owns the junkyard, he\u0027s a KSP pilot, he can go whenever he wants to. What does that have to do with sending us up?\u0022\n\nBill sighed, rolling his eyes. \u0022Think about it, Bob. Are they gonna send up two tourists on an untested rocket that might fail to deliver a suborbital trajectory - or worse, smash into the ground at twice the speed of sound and kill them all? It would be a charlie foxtrot. Walt would have to commit ritual suicide, we might have to close the doors for good.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh... OH!\u0022 Bob bit his lip. \u0022So they\u0027re sendin\u0027 you and me up with Val to play the part of the rich idiots and test it.\u0022\n\n\u0022Bingo,\u0022 Valentina said with a grin. \u0022Hey, cheer up. This\u0027ll get you two non-pilots some cockpit time and an EVA.\u0022\n\nBill bit his lip at that, shaking his head. \u0022I\u0027m not sure I want to climb out of a moving space ship.\u0022\n\nBob laughed, wrapping his arm around his brother\u0027s shoulder. \u0022We\u0027ll be fine. Jeb can do it, and anything Jeb can do -\u0022\n\n\u0022-We can do, too,\u0022 Bill finished, and sighed. \u0022All right.\u0022\n\nThey gazed out at the rocket ship again; a big, BIG FL-T1200 tank, four times the size of the ones Jeb flew into orbit (albiet only twice as large as his total fuel capacity on that ride) was the sole lift engine of the rocket. Above it was a stage with a service bay that had two small in-line gyroscopes bodged together into one, with a cluster of batteries and the new flight data and autopilot system, which had been termed Mechanical Jebediah, or MechJeb for short, and above that were simply three inline cockpits with a ringle of solar panels, a new RealChute company parachute nosecone and two radials.\n\n\u0022I still think it\u0027s not right it gets named after him,\u0022 Val said, with a snort. \u0022Sure, first Kerbal in space in the new era, but why does that mean they name the flight computer after him?\u0022\n\n\u0022Marketing! Or so zay Mortimer and Valt, anyvay,\u0022 the thick accent from behind interrupted the trio of to-be astronauts\u0027 ruminations. Doctor Wernher von Kerman joined them, leaning on the railing. \u0022I do not pay zo much attention to ze money, but zhey zay zhat ze licensing fees from ze \u0027MechJeb\u0027 vill be keeping ze Kerbal Spaze Program in ze black; operationally, at least. Since ze launch, ze narrow-minded companies vhich fired ze likes of yours truely, and ze flatlanded aviation societies, are all clamouring to go to space, and have not ze know-how to do zo! Largely becauze zey vere being ze narrow-minded flatlanders and zo every Kerbal who vants to go to ze space is already verking with us, and zo zhey have to pay for our autopilot! It is wundebah, ja?!\u0022\n\nBill, Bob, and Valentina turned to the Doctor, blinking at him. \u0022So... What does that mean for us,\u0022 Valentina asked.\n\nWernher laughed. \u0022It means ve all get paid, ze facilities get maintained und all, vhich is nice, ja?\u0022\n\nThe trio nodded at him in agreement. \u0022Getting paid is nice,\u0022 Valentina agreed. \u0022Only so long you can live your life scavenging from the ruins and salvaging old trucks, and while a warm bed and cold sandwiches were nice, having so much cash I actually needed to open a bank account was nicer.\u0022\n\n\u0022Speaking of cold sandwiches,\u0022 Bob said, and Valentina rolled her eyes. She reached into the cargo pockets of the thick, brown scavenger vest she wore over her KSP jumpsuit, and distributed sealed snack bags to the two next to her.\n\n\u0022You two should learn to carry your own snacks,\u0022 she said, as Bill and Bob tore open the bags.\n\n\u0022But why, when you carry so many to spare,\u0022 Bill asked, and Valentina rolled her eyes, opening her own bag. She crunched into one of the hot rolled-up tortillas, and grinned as the sweet, piercing spicy taste spread through her mouth.\n\n\u0022May I?\u0022 Valentina put one of the bright red, hot-spice-coated totillas in Doctor von Kerman\u0027s hand, and he ate it, his eyes going wide and watering slightly. \u0022It iz quite... Quite ze piquant snack, iz it not?\u0022\n\nValentina shrugged. \u0022I like \u0027em. Seems Jeb, Bill and Bob do, too.\u0022\n\nThe Doctor stroked his moustache, blinking his eyes. \u0022Perhaps zere is zome kind of ze correlation between ze enjoying of extra zpicy foods und ze talent und ze desire to go to ze space. Zis may bear some investigation, but zhat is for later. zhat rocket needs alterations.\u0022\n\n\u0022What\u0027s wrong with it,\u0022 Bill asked him.\n\n\u0022Nozing, assuming you don\u0027t vant to go to spaze. Linus und I have been doing zome calculations, und zhat rocket\u0027s apoapsis vill not break 55 kilometers on it\u0027s best day!\u0022\n\n\u0022Really?\u0022 Bob blinked. \u0022What\u0027s the problem - speed off the pad?\u0022\n\n\u0022Precizely, herr Bob! Ze rocket vill spend too much of its fuel getting up to zpeed, and vill not break ze atmosphere. Fortunately, herr Gene already haz ze solution, und he does not know it yet.\u0022\n\n\u0022Gene has the solution? I didn\u0027t think he was a rocket engineer,\u0022 Valentina asked, and the Doctor nodded.\n\n\u0022He is not, but he and Mortimer have been looking at ze offers ve have, and ze chief refurbishment engineer at Jebediah\u0027s has offered us ze money to test ze RT-10 solid boosters they\u0027ve been bringing up from ze old bombed spaceport at ze island off ze coast. Zo, ze RT-10s vill be attached for ze money. I just haff to arrange for zem to be fueled and for ze decouplers to fire in ze proper point of ze staging, und you are going to spaze!\u0022\n\nThe trio of crew clapped at him, and Doctor von Kerman grinned. \u0022I thought you would be ze appreciating of zhat news. Now, I must go!\u0022 He slipped away, and the trio looked back over the rails, as Gus was gesturing with his wrench and a glow-stick, while a Kerbal with a forklift carefully manoeuvred an RT-10 into position.\n\nThe next morning, all was going well in the launch center. Valentina, Bill and Bob were in the Excursion 1, the launch crew and chief scientists were in mission control, and Jebediah was telepresent via video conference from the hotel suite that Anatid Robotics had provided for him near their corporate headquarters at Undermountain North for the duration of his stay as the spokesman for the MechJeb unit.\n\n\u0022Hey, guys. Sorry I couldn\u0027t, you know, be there in person,\u0022 Jeb said from the screen, and Bill laughed. \u0022I\u0027ll take a picture for you,\u0022 he promised, holding up his smartphone. Jeb smiled.\n\n\u0022Thanks. By the way, everything\u0027s done here. Mort\u0027s getting the paperwork in order. They like it so much just for the sensor package and information display that Doc Wernher put into it that they\u0027re buying off on it without even seeing the flight performance.\u0022\n\n\u0022It is gratifying to hear of my contributions to ze aerospace sciences appreciated at long last,\u0022 Doctor von Kerman replied, and Jeb laughed. \u0022Yeah, well, they\u0027re mainly thinking of using it as a subterranean positioning system, Doc. But I believe in you.\u0022\n\nThe lab-coated doctor rolled his eyes. \u0022Vell, I suppose if it brings in ze money, zat iz enough. Zey vill zee in time.\u0022\n\n\u0022Right. Anyway, we\u0027re due for launch. This should be an easy trip, right? Up and back, and no ridiculous stunts like Jeb\u0027s, right kids?\u0022\n\nValentina laughed. \u0022Okay, okay, I won\u0027t jump out of the cockpit in the upper atmosphere,\u0022 she promised, with Bill and Bob vigorously concurring via head-nods. \u0022Okay then. Here we go.\u0022\n\nThe countdown came, and Valentina strapped herself tightly into her seat, having finished her sandwich a minute ago. \u0022Everybody ready,\u0022 she asked into her mic, and Bill and Bob both concurred their readiness. She put her hand on the throttle in the inline cockpit, bemoaned the lack of a glass display in it unlike the other cockpits presently available, but pushed the throttle forward anyway. The analog controls would do for now.\n\nThe countdown ticked, and she grinned when it reached one. As the mission controller said \u0022Ignition,\u0022 she let out a laugh as glorious acceleration pushed her seat up into her, pushing her forward with it, as the rocket clawed its way to the skies.\n\nThe acceleration boost provided by those three Hammers was intense, and by the time they were out of fuel and she flicked the switch to drop them, they may not have been very high above KSP, but they got to not-very-high very, very swiftly.\n\nShe glanced down at her tablet, in the holder adapted from commercial automotive holders, linked into the readings from the prototype MechJeb unit in the back. The only ones she really cared about were the remaining delta-V and apoapsis. Jebediah had barely grazed space. She was going to go farther.\n\nThe apoapsis broke 70 Km with lots of fuel left in the tank, and she grinned. It hit eighty and she smiled; by one hundred, she was giddily rubbing her hands together.\n\n\u0022Okay, Val? That\u0027s, uh, that\u0027s high enough. You can cut your engines now,\u0022 Gene said in her ear, and Valentina laughed.\n\n\u0022The mission plan says we ride it all the way up,\u0022 she countered.\n\n\u0022Yeah, the mission plan was written before those boosters were added, so throttle it down,\u0022 Gene demanded.\n\nValentina sighed, as she felt the acceleration from the rocket die.\n\nShe pulled her throttle all the way back. \u0022Okay, Gene,\u0022 she sarcastically said. \u0022Throttle\u0027s all the way back, and we just ran out of fuel anyway. We\u0027re going up to a hundred and, uh, thirty three.\u0022\n\n\u0022Vun thirty-three?!\u0022 Doctor von Kerman sounded alarmed. \u0022Uh... Standby. Linus, get ze notepad! Ze green one! No, ze uzzer green one!\u0022\n\nValentina shook her head, murmuring \u0022worryworts\u0022 to herself. \u0022So, who wants to get a higher altitude EVA report than Jeb did, huh? Bill, you want to go first?\u0022 She glanced at the camera display from their cockpits; with the throttle cut back, Bill and Bob were looking reasonably calm, so she assumed they were fine.\n\n\u0022Hold on, boys. We\u0027re going to do the Jebediah Toss.\u0022 She pointed the nose at the horizon, and began to yaw the craft. Once they were spinning at a good clip, she hit the stage button, and stabilized the craft, looking to the side to see the empty rocket stage sailing away.\n\nOnce they hit 120Km, Bill went on his EVA as planned, recorded observational details. Then Bob went EVA, and as they were hitting apoapsis, Valentina took in a breath, grinning. Her suit helmet\u0027s seal was good, so she pushed the button to open her cockpit.\n\nClimbing out was glorious, and Valentina laughed to herself as she saw Kerbin curve away below her. \u0022Wow, it looks so small. I\u0027ve got to get a picture of this.\u0022 Her smartphone came out of her pocket, and she took a picture, then another, and another, then swivelled the camera around, grinning and taking a picture of herself, huge helmet and all. \u0022I make this look good,\u0022 she decided, and glanced at the altitude display; they\u0027d hit 100 and dropping, so she sighed.\n\n\u0022Time to go home,\u0022 she said, pulling herself back into the cockpit, closing the canopy and strapping in. \u0022Here we go. Ready, boys??\n\n\u0022Yeah. That\u0027s enough space exploration for one day, Val,\u0022 Bill said, and Valentina laughed. She rotated the ship, pulling the nose back so she was aligned with her retrograde marker, and waited.\n\n\u0022Valentina? Ve haff a problem,\u0022 Doctor von Kerman said, and she blinked.\n\n\u0022Problem? All my systems are nominal,\u0022 she reported.\n\n\u0022No, not vith your systems, vith your trajectory.\u0022\n\nValentina blinked. \u0022Straight up and back again. What\u0027s wrong with that?\u0022\n\n\u0022Zhat iz ze problem. You vill be coming in much, much faster zhan Jebediah, and no less steeply. In other vords, you\u0027re going to fall out of ze sky like a meteor!\u0022\n\nValentina blinked. Maybe fifty kilometers really did make that much of a difference. \u0022What do I do about it?\u0022\n\n\u0022I don\u0027t know, zhat is ze problem! You vill still be on ------\u0022\n\n\u0022What the hell was that?\u0022 She glanced to her side, and gulped. A corona of flame was shooting past her, from back to front.\n\n\u0022That was radio being cut off, Val! Do something!\u0022 Bill yelled at her, sounding on the edge of panic, and Bob looked only slightly less worried.\n\nYelping, Valentina\u0027s eyes scanned her cockpit. She looked at the data she\u0027d been ignoring, specifically the true altitude (which was dropping very, very rapidly,) and her speed (which was slowing, but not as much as she\u0027d like.) worried, she put her hand near the stage button, when Bill yelped \u0022Stop!\u0022\n\n\u0022What? Bill, we\u0027re gonna be a crater,\u0022 Bob complained.\n\n\u0022And we will be, she you fires those parachutes while we\u0027re hypersonic, Bob! She\u0027s gotta wait.\u0022\n\nValentina bit her lip, then closed her eyes. Her heart was beating rapidly, and she listened to the craft, to the rush of air and crackle of heat around it as they plowed a path through the air, making a corona of plasma with their heat shield. The numbers wouldn\u0027t help her now.\n\nNow.\n\nValentina\u0027s thumb pushed the button, and Bill and Bob both screamed, as an intense G-Force slammed all three of them back into their seats. She opened her eyes, and saw that they were still barely supersonic, and were less than 3Km up, She struggled to suck in a calm breath, as the force pressing her into the seat lessened, and numbers zipped by. The craft was slowing, rapidly, and then they got to 500m up.\n\nThe parachutes deployed fully, and the brothers in the cockpit below her yelped as they were slammed into the seat again. They were still descending far too rapidly, but when she looked forward, Valentina saw the chutes fully deployed and fully intact.\n\nSpeed and altitude diminished in equal measure, and their actual touch-down down was gentle. She breathed a sigh of relief, then let out a giddy laugh. \u0022Hell yeah!\u0022\n\nThe cameras showed the two brothers were recovering from what appeared to be mortal terror, and Valentina grinned, opening her cockpit hatch. She took her helmet off, breathing in the sweet air of the grasslands, and pulled her can of lemon-lime soft drink from under her seat, as she climbed out, hopping down and sitting on the grass. \u0022Time to celebrate.\u0022\n\nThe trucks were already beginning to pull up as she pulled the tab, and got a faceful of highly-shaken carbonated soft drink in the face for her troubles."}]}
