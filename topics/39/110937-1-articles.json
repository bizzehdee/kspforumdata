Kerbin..) does one even get a remote satellite to Mars (sandbox mode), never mind a ***manned***.. mission.\n\nActually a manned mission is easy... the satellite bit is a problem.\n\nTo get anything to fit into a decent compact rocket is a headache beyond normality... what do we do ??\n\nWe need to scan Mars and its moons for resources, before we send settlement rockets..!!\n\nWell... ***KlonkWorks*** made a plan... they just made the ship bigger, a combined manned/satellite delivery test platform...\n\nand platform it is... It\u0027s just a big disc with attachments... Testing is going well.\n\nThe Disc encompasses a smaller fuel tank and TAC tanks.\n\nBelow the disc (naturally) engines and main fuel tank, plus heat shield for aero-braking\n\n![XzyJ64w.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XzyJ64w.jpg)\n\nAbove the disc is everything else, Satellites(with big blerry aerials), Living 1/4s, Alcor, TAC, Scoop, Batteries...etc.\n\nI was thinking of a deckchair or two so the crew can \u0027sun\u0027 themselves..\n\n![o2sNeb8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/o2sNeb8.jpg)\n\nOrbit testing...

What\u0027s with the intake scoop?\n\nBussard Scoops (fuel converter ?)... yeah! I know they\u0027re horizontal, but that\u0027s because our engineers have managed to bend the electro-magnetic field upwards (company top secret ![:sealed:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif)).\n\nNot only that, they managed to combine the whole fuel conversion system into the Scoop.. but they couldn\u0027t reduce the mass of the combined system - pity, but you can\u0027t win them all. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI\u0027ll try later with no fancy fuels system, and the ProcCom mod (this has tickled my fancy ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif))\n\n![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"}]}
