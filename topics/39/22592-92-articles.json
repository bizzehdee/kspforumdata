I can\u0027t even start to imagine how much work would it require to put it all together considering that for several hours of work you get maybe a minute or two of animation. And I\u0027m not talking about brand new animation, rather about playing and recording everything in KSP - doing the models and so on would be an immensely challenging thing. The adaptation would have to be much shorter than the story obviously and a lot of subplots would have to be cut out along with some characters. All in all, it sounds great and if there\u0027s someone who would like to do something like this he can take my blessing and cooperation for granted. BUT make no mistake, it would mean dozens of hours of work and it would be ready probably in September/October at its earliest.
