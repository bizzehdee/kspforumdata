We need new ballast... er pilots,\u0022 explained Professor Gene kerman, \u0022Duna! Ever heard of it? You will soon, now if you\u0027d kindly put on these luminous puffy pants, yes...and that pink bow-tie... and follow me, no questions please! All will be revealed soon enough!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so it was that Orwig and Egbert Kerman undertook a whole two weeks of training with the intended goal of reaching the planet Duna, a feat hitherto unheard of and guaranteed to bring them fame and alleged fortune, it involved long amounts of time sitting, some ejecting and a lot of falling, and although there was no real, right way to do these things Professor Gene assured them they had done stupendously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Everything alright Orwig?\u0022 Egbert\u0027s voice snapped him out of his thoughts, \u0022What?\u0022 Oh yes, yes of course, fine and dandy!\u0022 Orwig smiled unconvincingly, he had learned very quickly not to make Egbert unduly anxious, he was jumpy to say the least and had gone through far more pairs of puffy pants than Orwig had during training.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s going to be great isn\u0027t it? Egbert smiled happily, \u0022we\u0027re going to be heroes aren\u0027t we?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquashed heroes, thought Orwig, \u0022Oh yes!\u0022 he said, \u0022absolutely.\u0022 I just wish i\u0027d watched those Scott Kerbley tutorials the Professor gave us earlier, he looked over at the small, unopened pack of digi-cassetes and grimaced, i can always watch them on the way he thought, the steady hum in their small command module had a soothing effect, Egbert twiddled his thumbs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Orwig, why did we have to wear the pink bow ties during training? \u0022Well we didn\u0027t have clearance to know that Egbert,\u0022 replied Orwig, \u0022i suspect it was for a good reas... he was interrupted by the voice of ground control crackling through the speakers, salutations kerbonauts! Prepare for launch in ten, nine, eight, Orwig and Egbert braced themselves, this was the culmination of a whole fortnight\u0027s training, three, two... one!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-25T17:24:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2013 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Custard Donut (In Space)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
