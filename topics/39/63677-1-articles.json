The president should have his old 1840\u0027s-like parade uniform with lots of medals but there also should be a general reporting to him (who also wears a pickelhaube) in an olive green uniform with a sam browne belt. The office is the same, but in the background the trees of the forest are being sawn down by workers and buildings being assembled. It should also be set on a cloudy day. The president should have a moustache with sideburns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet another request, set at the KSC (which is occupied by Medwedia), in the office of the KSC director who wears a olive green Marshal\u0027s uniform with sam browne belt and lots of medals. The office should be 1930\u0027s style (the time when the KSC was built), with the window showing a view of many soldiers in pickelhaubes marching in formation, with rifles, guarding a KSC facility. The KSC director should have a moustache.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain another request, this time a street in a rural mountainous town with people in pilgrim hats which are brimmed up on the right side, watching strange lights in the sky, which are from the reentry of a spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if i\u0027m overloading you, but you can take your time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-20T19:13:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2014 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MedwedianPresident\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiaK","CreatedById":80590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T09:19:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*BZZT* OVERLOAD ALARM.
