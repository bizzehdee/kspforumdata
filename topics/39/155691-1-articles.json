What he expects of the followers of his doctrine is unclear but he claims there exists an \u0022interface\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022, whatever that may be, with a sort of heavenly \u0022button\u0022 to magically convert the power of our Universe into the power the booster would need. I hope that booster doesn\u0027t use too much fuel! Hu. Huhuhuhu.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah. *cough*.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPilots and tourists have been polled and 77% of them want to go to the opening. Apparently not expecting this, the CEO of the church quadrupled the ticket prices overnight, creating an outrage which dropped the percentage of interested people to 76.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScientists have yet to figure out why the giant booster is floating above its pedestal. Believers say it\u0027s the work of the \u0022God of No-Offset Limits\u0022 but that idea is ridiculed by many.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile the first visitor has arrived and immediately he started complaining about the size of the parking lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s it for now, back to you, Iridium.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uLeXrEQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uLeXrEQ.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QVBtH9m.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QVBtH9m.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224d8UERx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4d8UERx.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
