Starting \u003Cem\u003Epossibly\u003C/em\u003E this week, and most definitely by next week, I will begin a bold new idea for a let\u0027s play series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy format will include a timeline of events, a list of special activities, and a narrated summary (myself doing the voiceover, of course), followed by the mission footage itself. I\u0027ll be recording just as I play it normally, and present it as true mission footage. Perhaps with some careful editing I can make some authentic-looking films!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be using ONLY TWO MODS for this series: Engineer to handle the calculations for Delta-V and the like, and Chatterer for immersion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope to have a lot of fun, and hope you all support me!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
