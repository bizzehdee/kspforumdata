The rear undercarriage skimmed delicately over the tarmac, settling onto the ground with only the faintest puff of smoke. The nose wheel dipped in a smooth, precise motion, touching down squarely on the centre line with plenty of room to spare for a leisurely rollout. The noise of the jet engine had barely died away before a fuel cart raced into view and pulled up smartly behind one wing. Two kerbals leapt off and set to work chocking the aircraft wheels. The fueling point cover flipped open and the cart driver set to work, plugging in an earthing wire and unreeling the fuel hose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rear door of the aircraft swung open with a hiss and a complicated set of steps unfolded onto the runway. A darkly clad kerbal strode down the aircraft steps and took up a position to one side, before a second, dressed in a grey suit, appeared in the doorway and gingerly descended. Lodan gulped as he recognised the shock of black wavy hair and jutting chin. He straightened his tie and briskly strode towards the waiting party.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPresident Obrick - this is an unexpected honor, sir.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick looked at the kerbal bowing in front of him, taking in the unassuming suit and slightly balding head. \u003Cem\u003ENot much to this one\u003C/em\u003E, he thought, \u003Cem\u003Elooks like a typical payroll watcher\u003C/em\u003E. He glanced down. \u003Cem\u003EHmmm. Not afraid to get his shoes... boots dirty though and too busy for spit and polish \u003C/em\u003E. Then Lodan straightened up and Obrick saw a rather lined face and a pair of sharp grey eyes, gazing steadily back at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMuch better. Not too overawed and not letting his mouth run away with him either.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe steps clattered as another kerbal hurried down them, clutching a briefcase in each hand. Obrick dipped his head politely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPleased to meet you Director Lodan. This is Sambus, my aide.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSambus shook his hand. \u201CGreat to be here, Director,\u0022\u00A0he said,\u00A0\u201Cbut please - just call me Sam.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPleased to meet you Sam,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan. His nose twitched at the sudden pungent smell of aviation fuel. \u201COur ground crew will have your aircraft turned around within the half hour Mr President. Shall we visit the main building?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick nodded and Lodan led the way across the tarmac towards a small electric cart. Two small pennants fluttered in the breeze: on one, the familiar flag of all Kerbin and on the other, a stylised design of Kerbol rising over the horizon with six smaller stars scattered across the sky. A shiver ran down Sam\u0027s back as he saw the letters KSA stenciled on the gleaming white door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan opened the door and gestured for Obrick and Sam to get in. He surreptitiously checked Obrick\u0027s seatbelt, handed the two briefcases to Sam and climbed into the front seat. The cart rocked on its suspension as Obrick\u0027s bodyguard swung himself up onto the bench beside him. Lodan stared straight ahead through the windscreen as he buckled himself in and took a grip on the steering wheel. The purr of the motor shifted up a tone, as he wheeled the cart around and drove off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam stared out of his window, as the cart rolled steadily along. In the distance, a skeletal web of girders stood boldly against the skyline. A spindly crane stooped low over the framework with a spiderweb array of struts suspended precariously from one end. As the cart drove around a bend, Sam\u0027s view shifted with it, flattening the spider web into a a great latticework bowl. A team of kerbals swarmed over it like tiny green ants, some of them hauling new struts into place, others hanging in space over the edges of the bowl, working away on what appeared to be large square panels stuck here and there to the latticework.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam lurched sideways in his seat as the cart came to a sudden halt. Spinning orange lights cast luminous streaks across the window as a large tractor rumbled across the road in front of them, towing a flatbed trailer loaded with cable drums. Two kerbals wearing bright yellow hats were perched on top of the drums and waved cheerfully at him as they went past. Further away, a pair of excavators pecked at the ground, scooping out a ragged trench that stretched away in a perfectly straight line towards the structure on the skyline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam\u0027s head swivelled as he followed the trench line back towards an elegant, cream coloured building. Two gracefully curved wings, swept out from an imposing main entrance, their roofs studded at regular intervals with domed skylights. Large arched windows were picked out in a slightly darker grey stone, giving the whole building a rather geometric look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHmmm,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick, \u201CIt\u0027s certainly eye-catching but it\u0027s a little too... angular for my taste.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt is a bit minimal looking,\u0022\u00A0said Sam, \u201Calthough I think it goes rather well with whatever they\u0027re building out over there.\u0022\u00A0He waved vaguely towards the rear window. \u201CIt\u0027ll probably look better once the rest of the site is grassed over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cart stopped and Lodan hopped down to open the passenger door. Obrick climbed out, looking impassively at the expanse of churned up mud between the road and the building entrance. A walkway of wooden planks was kept out of the mire by a stepping stone arrangement of concrete slabs, although even this token effort at a path was generously decorated with muddy bootprints. Several workers were gesturing emphatically at a large pit near the front entrance, although Obrick couldn\u0027t hear them over the noise of the excavators behind him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan dipped his head. \u201CI\u0027m afraid it\u0027s a little rough and ready, Mr President,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CWe weren\u0027t really expecting visitors for several weeks yet, let alone one of the Twelve Pillars.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cart springs creaked as Obrick\u0027s bodyguard climbed out and then Sam jumped down, wincing as the mud spattered over his shoes. \u201CPlease tell me the inside is finished,\u0022\u00A0he muttered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan coughed. \u201CMostly,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CWe\u0027re still furnishing the north wing and moving equipment into the south wing. Anyway - welcome to the Kerbin Space Agency.

Obrick and Sam followed him cautiously, keeping carefully to the middle of path. Lodan crossed his fingers behind his back and set off after them. As they approached the group of kerbals near the entrance, one of them glanced around casually at the sound of footsteps. His eyes widened and he frantically elbowed one of his companions in the ribs. By the time Obrick stepped off the walkway, a ragged honour guard was ready to greet him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMr. President!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWelcome to the Kerbin Space Agency,\u00A0Mr President!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam smiled to himself as Obrick strode over to the line of kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you...\u0022Obrick peered at the name plate attached to one battered yellow hard hat. \u201CMs Fercan. It\u0027s all most impressive I have to say.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFercan beamed. \u201CIt\u0027ll be a lot more impressive once we get the dish working, Mr President.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick nodded and pointed towards the hole. \u201CThat\u0027s all for the dish then I presume. What have you got in there - power, servo feeds and main co-ax?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the other kerbals in the line burst out laughing at the expression on Fercan\u0027s face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUhh no co-ax, Mr. President. Primary signal processing is handled out at the dish itself but the data is piped back here for analysis.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027d like to see that,\u0022\u00A0Obrick said, leaning over to peer into the hole. \u201CWhat kind of pointing accuracy are you getting?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CToo early to tell yet, sir, as we havn\u0027t tried moving it yet. We were getting around eight mdeg in testing but we\u0027re not expecting a that in practice, probably more like ten to eleven.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick whistled. \u201CThat\u0027s still mighty impressive for something the size of that dish,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CI\u0027d love to see \u003Cem\u003Ethose\u003C/em\u003E bearings but... ah, Director Lodan.\u0022He reached out to shake Fercan\u0027s hand. \u201CI have to go I fear but good luck with the cabling and please - let me know how the pointing does work out in practice.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027d be honoured, Mr President!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs he led his guests into the main building, Lodan glanced at Obrick from the corner of his eye. \u201CI\u0027m flattered Mr President,\u0022\u00A0he said,\u00A0\u201CI didn\u0027t expect my report to be read quite so thoroughly - and I\u0027m fairly sure I didn\u0027t include anything about the finer points of control or rf feeds.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick shrugged. \u201CI like to keep up. Besides, knowing about the latest space news is the only way to get an intelligent conversation out of half the office staff these days. Which reminds me - is there any news from the latest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E flight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam\u0027s head snapped round but Lodan was looking apologetic. \u201CNothing since the last KBS broadcast I\u0027m afraid,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CWe had rather hoped to use the Muna 2 flight to test the antenna but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E were quicker off the mark than we expected. The last we heard, they\u0027d made a successful mid-course correction and everything was looking good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick nodded. \u201CEncouraging, but that doesn\u0027t mean too much,\u0022\u00A0he said,\u201CThe Rockomax flight looked good too, right up to the point when they had their thruster problem.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s what I\u0027m worried about,\u0022\u00A0said Sam, \u201CThe main reason that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E were so quick to launch is that they pulled the Kerbin 2 probe out of their museum and used it as the core of the Muna 2.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKerbin 2?\u0022\u00A0said Lodan, \u201CWasn\u0027t that the one they brought back from orbit?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u0022\u00A0said Sam glumly, \u201Cso who knows what condition it was in.\u0022\u00A0He shivered and looked around at the plain white walls around him. Apart from a row of doors there was very little to see. The overhead strip lights cast a stark but pallid light over everything, and their footsteps echoed on the polished concrete floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan\u0027s office door was indistinguishable from all the rest, at least to Sam\u0027s eyes. Inside, the office was surprisingly modest. A large, plain desk divided the room in two, although at the moment it was less a desk than a holding area for mounds of papers, a large globe and an eclectic collection of cardboard boxes, desk toys and assorted pens. A drift of paper clips spilled over one corner and onto the floor and the opposite wall was entirely devoted to shelving, which was already cluttered with files of all sizes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other half of the room was more homely. A coffee table was placed in front of an electric fire, which glowed cheerfully under the little mantelpiece. Four chairs were set out around the table, although Sam wasn\u0027t particularly surprised to see that the chairs were also stacked high with files. A jug of water and a state of the art coffee pot sat on their own table in one corner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick stood by the window gazing out high over the grounds towards the antenna dish, as Lodan fussed around, clearing papers out of the way, making coffee and rummaging around in various boxes. \u003Cem\u003EThe director of the Kerbin Space Agency does get one perk \u003C/em\u003E, he thought, \u003Cem\u003E This has to be the best view in the building.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a sudden rattle of crockery and a satisfied grunt from Lodan as he unearthed three mugs from the depths of his desk. \u201CI do apologise, Mr President,\u0022\u00A0he said ruefully, \u201CI haven\u0027t had much of a chance to get everything squared away yet. May I pour you a coffee?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick, Lodan and Sam took their places in front of the fire. Harsen accepted a mug of coffee but insisted on standing guard by the door. Lodan blew on his drink and took a cautious sip before perching himself on the edge of his chair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo if I may ask, Mr President,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cwhat brings you out to the KSA? Our reports were...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCommendably thorough,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick. \u201Cand I understand that your last budget report found it\u0027s way onto a memo of best practice from the Finance Committee. Rumour has it that the chairman of the Committee has even been known to smile when a KSA report arrives, although personally I have my doubts. Relax Director, I\u0027m not here on a cross-checking visit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan\u0027s shoulders relaxed and he sat back in his chair as Obrick continued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHowever, as you\u0027ll appreciate, the recent KSA budget requests have been... substantial, and so I thought a quiet visit and discussion of future plans was in order.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan took another sip of coffee. \u201CWe appreciate that, Mr President and rest assured that we don\u0027t anticipate any further capital expenditure on that scale for quite some time. There will be ongoing expenses of course, staff costs, keeping the library up to date and so forth but nothing outside of our allocated budget.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam leaned forward. \u201CA library?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u0022 said Lodan, \u201CAs I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be aware, our initial mandate was to \u0027find the questions that need to be asked\u0027 and then, if required, find ways to answer them. Some of the questions were fairly obvious as you might expect. For example, there is a great deal of basic aeronautical research we might usefully undertake. However, it quickly became obvious that the most important question of all to address was \u003Cem\u003E which questions have already been answered?\u0022 \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan raised an eyebrow. \u201CWe trust the Finance Committee will agree that we should have no particular interest in duplicating well established results. However, spaceflight on any meaningful scale is going to involve a whole host of rather disparate engineering and scientific disciplines. So much so, that we decided that the most efficient way to access the information we need is to build our own library.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick glanced at Sam. \u201CThat seems logical, Director, although it doesn\u0027t explain the extra construction work going on outside.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan coughed. \u201CForgive me,\u00A0Mr President,\u0022\u00A0he said,\u00A0\u201Cbut could I be so bold as to suggest that we dispense with \u003Cem\u003E some \u003C/em\u003E of the formalities?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick dipped his head. \u201CBy all means Lodan,\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Mr President. The dish was my idea. In fact all three of them were.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam frowned. \u201CThree dishes?\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CI only saw one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan walked over to his desk and returned with his globe under one arm. He put it down on the table and spun it round. \u201CWe are here,\u0022\u00A0he said to Sam, prodding a finger at the Koluclaw mountains. \u201CKSA headquarters, research facilities and tracking site Alpha. In the foothills so we get some elevation without having to haul all the building supplies halfway up a mountain. Also we\u0027re roughly equidistant from from Barkton and Foxham, which are of course the launch sites for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and Rockomax respectively.\u0022He spun the globe again. \u201CHowever we are also building tracking sites Beta and Gamma here... and here. Not particularly original names I must admit but they\u0027ll do for now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKerbin wide coverage,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan. \u201CWe see Alpha, Beta and Gamma as the anchors of a global tracking network. By themselves they should be suitable for interplanetary or perhaps Minmus bound spacecraft. Full coverage for Munar or Kerbin orbital operations will require more tracking stations of course.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam studied the globe. \u201CWell \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and Rockomax have at least one site each,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CPlus I\u0027m fairly sure that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E have a secondary site in Wakira and Rockomax probably have a second site too. That\u0027s not a bad start.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CProvided that they both decide to cooperate,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan shrugged. \u201CI\u0027d be surprised if they turn down a free expansion to their systems,\u0022he said. \u201CThe difficult bit is going to be getting three sets of equipment working well together but we\u0027re working on a set of common data and communication protocols to get around that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick nodded slowly. \u003Cem\u003ELooks like you could do with a few more psychology books in that library, Director Lodan. Still - it\u0027s a good idea in principle.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo the KSA end up paying for a piece of global infrastructure for anyone to use,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CThat would seem to overstep your mandate Director.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe corner of Lodan\u0027s eye twitched. \u201CI\u0027m well aware of our mandate, Mr President,\u0022\u00A0he replied, \u201Cand with all respect, I believe we met it. We identified a serious problem that would hinder the future development of spaceflight and we devised a solution to that problem.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd then you took it upon yourself to implement that solution?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan didn\u0027t flinch. \u201CYes I did,\u00A0Mr President. Right now we have two main players in the spaceflight business - and they have been set up as competitors. In the long run I trust to the wisdom of the Twelve Pillars. But in the short term I believe that policy will be a disaster.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a sudden sharp hiss as Sam sucked air through his teeth. Obrick kept his face carefully impassive. \u003Cem\u003EIt seems I was right about you Lodan.\u003C/em\u003E \u201CGo on,\u0022\u00A0he said quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRockomax and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan, \u201Care both building their launch infrastructure from scratch and to a large extent they are duplicating each other\u0027s work. Sometimes, this is unavoidable - they are for example unlikely to share manufacturing or testing facilities.\u0022\u00A0He gestured at the globe. \u201CHowever, in other cases it is extremely wasteful. Brute necessity will eventually drive both companies to develop a Kerbin wide communication network. Cooperation in that venture seems unlikely so we will most probably end up with two separate networks. Similarly, any new company wishing to compete will also need to waste time and money building their own communication network.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan took a swallow of coffee. \u201CBy acting now, Mr President,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cwe can prevent this stupidity before it even gets started. Both companies have approximately equivalent communication networks, so we avoid favouring one company over the other. It is true that any new companies will gain an advantage by immediately having access to a global network and perhaps that is slightly unfair. However, I believe that that is an acceptable price to pay for a piece of global infrastructure that will speed the progress of established companies and newcomers alike.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt should be a significant boost to crew safety too,\u0022\u00A0said Sam, \u201CI can think of at least one of the Twelve Pillars who would be very much in favour of that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can see the advantages thank you,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick, \u201CVery well - construction of Alpha, Beta and Gamma stations is approved. Full expansion of the KSA mandate will require authorisation from the Twelve Pillars but as Sam has pointed out, there is already some support for that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan kept his face carefully neutral, \u201CThank you, Mr President.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHowever,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick, \u201Cfor the moment, I \u003Cem\u003Estrongly\u003C/em\u003E advise against any further unplanned expansions of that mandate. I trust we understand each other, Director Lodan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan bowed his head. \u201CYes, Mr President.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam\u0027s mug rattled as he put it down on the table. \u201CTime\u0027s moving on sir,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CLodan - I believe that your itinerary included a tour of the building?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan pushed his chair back. \u201CAbsolutely, Sam. And you\u0027re very welcome to join the team for lunch afterwards if you have time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe four kerbals emerged from the corridor into the main foyer. Watery sunlight poured in through the skylights overhead, giving the whole room a faintly abandoned air. Outside, Sam could see Fercan and the others still hard at work. He couldn\u0027t imagine how they\u0027d managed to haul the drum over the walkway but as he watched, one of the engineers unwound a length of bright blue cable and tossed it down into the pit. A yellow hat popped into view as it\u0027s owner reached out to grab something from a large toolbox resting in the mud. As Sam walked past the window, the hat disappeared out of sight again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan led his guests into the north wing. Compared to the starkly undecorated office block, the corridor was almost cosy and Sam\u0027s nose twitched at the scents of fresh paint and newly laid carpet. Even though both carpet and walls were the same institutional shades of green as a hundred other government offices across Kerbin, they were a welcome break from bleached white walls and concrete. Thick blinds over the skylights blocked out the cold winter sun and even the strip lights overhead didn\u0027t seem quite as bleak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan pushed through a pair of double doors and held one of them open for everyone else. \u201CWelcome to the library,\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick looked around. To his left the library was partitioned up into cubicles, each with its own desk and chair in front of a window. Obrick squinted at the row of data terminals standing against the far wall, their screens staring blankly back at him. \u003Cem\u003ENot too much of a curve to the walls though, \u003C/em\u003E he thought, \u003Cem\u003E so there must be something else behind this library. Probably whatever computer they\u0027ve got those terminals plugged into.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo his right were row after row of tall shelves, with carts of books parked haphazardly amongst them. At least three kerbals were busily unloading them as another one prowled up and down making notes on an overstuffed clipboard. Lodan gestured towards the shelving. \u201CPlenty of space for expansion,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CArchives and microfilm room are through at the far end and behind that we\u0027re setting up the mainframe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam shuffled his feet. \u201CAm I seeing things, Lodan, \u201COr is that shelf really marked off for Xenobiology?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan laughed, \u201CYou\u0027re not seeing things Sam. I suspect the xenobiology shelf was added as a little joke but we \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E tried to leave room for new fields of study. We\u0027ve got shelves marked out for Munar geology, extraplanetary cartography, all sorts of things. Kerbolar magnetodynamics of course after Professor Kelvey\u0027s discovery of the radiation belts around Kerbin. Actually, we have our own plans for studying the Kelvey Belts but more on that later.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam blinked, \u201CI suppose that makes sense,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cbut \u003Cem\u003Exenobiology\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy not?\u0022\u00A0said Lodan. \u201CWe known for years that there\u0027s water on Duna. Mainly as ice around the poles but what of that? There\u0027s plenty of life at Kerbin\u0027s poles and they\u0027re not exactly hospitable either. Then there are the latest results from the LOST team...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLost?\u0022\u00A0said Sam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLaythe Observation and SpecTroscopy,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan, \u201CThe data is a bit tentative to my mind but they\u0027re claiming evidence for water vapour and carbon dioxide in Laythe\u0027s atmosphere. I doubt it\u0027s the warmest place to visit but it might be just warm enough for life!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick shook his head. \u201CLife beyond Kerbin,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CI don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to find anything to put on that shelf for a while.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan smiled, \u201CNot until we get close enough to have a really good look, Mr President,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cand even then, if we find anything, it\u0027ll probably be simple plants, bacteria, maybe insects if we\u0027re very lucky. Certainly not the pink skinned aliens of popular fiction.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEven so,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick soberly, \u201Cone single paper on that shelf would change the world.\u0022\u00A0He looked at the lined face of the KSA Director.\u201CI admire your optimism, Lodan but I\u0027d take that label off the shelf for now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan nodded. \u201COh indeed, Mr President. Apart from anything else, I hardly think that letting the world know that we\u0027re searching for extraplanetary life is the best way to establish a reputation for the Kerbin Space Agency.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut you\u0027ll be doing it anyway?\u0022\u00A0said Obrick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course. Quietly and indirectly to begin with - and please rest assured that it is firmly at the bottom of our priority list. But as you pointed out yourself, a single paper on that shelf would change the world.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan pushed the library door open. \u201CIn any case gentlemen, it\u0027s time you saw some of our less... speculative research. Please follow me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the almost completed north wing, the south wing was a shock. Wheel tracks and footprints snaked through the layers of dust on the floor, stacks of panels leaned against the raw concrete walls and the ceiling appeared to be very much a work in progress. Here and there, stepladders led up into the maze of ducts and cable runs and Sam could hear snatches of conversation from above, interspersed with the high pitched squeals of assorted power tools and the strains of a particularly enthusiastic Spearkan country band.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam looked pained. \u201CDear Kerm but that\u0027s awful,\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COy - I heard that Kelney!\u0022\u00A0A grimy head poked out from the ceiling. \u201CThis is quality music this is, which is more than I can say for the crap you...\u0022\u00A0The engineer spotted Obrick staring at him curiously and went pale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh no,\u0022\u00A0he said in a very small voice and shot back into the crawlway, knocking his head against a duct with a loud clang and a burst of colourful but hastily sanitised oaths.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan sighed and pointed towards a row of hard hats and laboratory coats hanging on pegs by the door. \u201CEveryone take a hat please,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CThe lab coats are optional but recommended. Welcome to our research and development wing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll three kerbals put on their hats and lab coats without comment. Lodan left his jacket on a peg, pulled on a hat and led the way down the corridor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust like the library and archive rooms, the lab block was designed for expansion. We originally intended to run a single lab to begin with but recent developments prompted us to start a second research program.\u0022 Lodan gestured towards a closed door. Sam saw a large photograph of the M\u00FCn stuck to it, together with a crude sign reading \u0027MIR\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMir?\u0022 he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COur first program,\u0022said Lodan, \u201CMunar Imaging and Reconnaissance.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat makes sense,\u0022\u00A0said Sam, \u0022I bet they can\u0027t wait to see the results from the Probodyne Prize!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe first images of the Far side will certainly be interesting,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan, \u201Cand if we\u0027re lucky, some of them may even be good enough to work with. To be honest though, we\u0027re more interested in the spacecraft than the science at this point.\u0022He opened the door and poked his head inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAhh yes. Power is off for the moment whilst the engineers are working on the new gas lines. Come on in, good kerbals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe laboratory was gloomy inside but Sam could still make out a set of workbenches with a bewildering array of tools and half assembled pieces of electronic equipment scattered over them. A pair of cameras stood on tripods in the middle of the room and what appeared to be the innards of a third camera were mounted on a a set of stands fixed to a very heavy looking stone table. A number of cabinets and larger pieces of equipment stood around the edges of the room, although Sam couldn\u0027t begin to guess what they were for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is our optics lab,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan. \u201CDesign, prototyping and calibration in here, flight qualification and testing a couple of rooms back. We\u0027ve just started phase three of the project, so we don\u0027t actually have a working model to show you I\u0027m afraid.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPhase three?\u0022\u00A0said Sam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan nodded. \u201CPhase one was a review of the available literature on Munar astronomy, phase two was mission definition and hardware specification. Phase three is prototyping and development.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam wandered between the workbenches staring in fascination at the camera parts. \u201CSome of these look so delicate,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CI can\u0027t quite believe you plan to put them on top of a rocket and fire them off to the M\u00FCn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey\u0027re sturdier than they look,\u0022 said Lodan, \u201Cbut yes, we\u0027ve had to rethink some of our ideas already. The current model is looking promising however.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou mentioned a second research program,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI did,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan, \u201CWe\u0027re not even out of phase one for that yet and we\u0027ve only barely cleared out the lab space. You\u0027re welcome to see it of course but there\u0027s really not a lot to look at apart from a large collection of packing crates. We have big plans for the Space Radiation Laboratory though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSpace Radiation,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick, \u201CI presume this has something to do with the Kelvey Belts?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMapping the Belts is our highest priority at the moment,\u00A0Mr President. Distribution, radiation intensity, particle density, energy spectra - we urgently need this data before planning any other missions. The radiation was strong enough to affect the cameras aboard Satellite Four, so goodness only knows what it might do to a crewed ship.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAgreed,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick, \u201CHave you chosen a launcher yet?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot yet,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan, \u201Cbut my preference would be Rockomax.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam frowned. \u201CWhy not offer it as a competition again?\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMainly because Rockomax already have the experience with satellite operations,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan. He raised an eyebrow at Sam\u0027s expression. \u201CDon\u0027t worry - there\u0027ll be plenty of launches once MIR starts flying and even more once the Space Radiation Laboratory is finished with the Belts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSam bit back his first response.\u00A0\u201CWhy - what happens then?\u0022\u00A0he said\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe go back to the M\u00FCn with radiation detectors,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan calmly, \u201CGamma ray spectrometers to be precise.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t follow you,\u0022\u00A0said Sam. \u201CAre we expecting Kelvey Belts around the M\u00FCn too?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u0022\u00A0said Lodan, \u201Cbut Kelvey Belts aren\u0027t the only source of radiation in space. We\u0027ve studied cosmic rays for decades - high energy particles in Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere. Those same particles will also be hitting the M\u00FCn and...look the physics gets complicated but we think we can make a chemical map of the Munar surface.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick looked at him intently. \u201CWhat sort of chemicals?\u0022\u00A0he asked\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIndustrially useful metals,\u0022 said Lodan. \u201CLighter elements too and possibly even water, although we think we might need another sort of detector for that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWater and metals,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick to himself. \u201CExcellent work, Lodan - excellent. I presume you were planning to mention this in your next report?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan caught the look on Obrick\u0027s face and smiled inwardly. \u003Cem\u003EGotcha.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNaturally, Mr President. Fully planned out and costed as always.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick rubbed his hands together briskly. \u201CWell I\u0027ve seen everything I need to see here, Director Lodan. How are we doing for time Sam?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust over an hour before we need to leave, sir,\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn that case, good kerbals, I suggest we finish with a tour of the canteen. Please lead the way, Director.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they approached the main foyer, Lodan was astonished to find it full to bursting with kerbals. He was about to clap his hands for attention when he heard a familiar voice echoing tinnily from a speaker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI repeat, loss of signal from the Muna 2 occurred precisely on schedule. All we can do now is watch, wait and hope that the engine fires as planned. If all goes well, Mission Control should reestablish contact with the spacecraft in exactly one hour and forty seven minutes. This is KBS News reporting from the Barkton Space Centre.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton smiled as he accepted a mug of cocoa from a tired looking kermol. A pair of small green hands appeared over the lip of her pouch followed, after much squirming, by a pair of very wide eyes, looking solemnly back at him. The tiny kerblet chirped happily as Jonton gently ruffled its silky black hair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCongratulations,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Chow old is...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe\u0027s just under three months old Keeper. Have you got a smile for the Keeper, Jebediah?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton reached out with one finger and stroked one of Jebediah\u0027s hands. \u201CYou\u0027re too busy taking everything in to bother with smiling aren\u0027t you, little guy,\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah squeaked and disappeared again. The pouch rippled and bulged and Jonton winced in sympathy as he saw a foot and then what looked like an elbow pushing out against its confining wall. He got to his feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHere - take my seat,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CI\u0027ll lend a hand with the cocoa.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kermol looked at him gratefully. \u201CThank you Keeper,\u0022\u00A0she said, sinking onto Jonton\u0027s cushion and cupping her hands under her pouch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton smiled. \u201CMy pleasure,\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe village hall was full to bursting. A group of older kerblets were huddled together in one corner, safely out of earshot of their parents and ignoring two of their younger siblings who were busy squabbling over a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E hat. Another pair of youngsters hurtled past, indulgently watched by the adults as they careered around the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton blew on his cocoa and turned his attention to the television cabinet at the far end of the room. The black and white picture showed a studio, with two presenters sitting behind a table and talking. Jonton was too far away to hear what they were saying but from the sudden shushing from the cluster of kerbals sitting around the television, he assumed that it was something important. There was a call from the back of the room to turn the volume up as one of the presenters turned to face the camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe are now going live to the Barkton Space Centre where we rejoin Leland Kerman outside Mission Control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you Milfrid. If you are just joining us now, this is KBS news reporting from the Kerbin Interplanetary Society launch bunker and we are now in the final moments of the Muna 2 mission. A little over one hour and thirty minutes ago, the launch controllers lost contact with the Muna 2 as it swept around behind the M\u00FCn. By now, if all has gone to plan, the probe will have fired its rocket engine and slowed down just enough to be pulled into Munar orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland\u0027s voice dropped to a whisper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027re now going down into the control bunker itself to join the flight control team as they wait for a signal from the Muna 2. As our regular viewers will know, data from the probe is being relayed through the new KBS communication satellite which was designed and launched by the Rockomax Corporation.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe image on the television screen blurred and tilted as Leland and his cameraman climbed down into the bunker. As it steadied, the watching kermol could see a group of flight controllers hunched over their consoles and a countdown clock ticking away on a big screen behind them. As the camera panned around, they saw a row of kerbals standing quietly against the wall. One of them looked up, nodded and then walked towards the camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m now talking to Bill Kerman, one of the flight dynamics officers at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and of course, one of the Original 3 kerbonauts who flew on the Kerbal 1. Bill - what\u0027s the latest news from the Muna 2?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAt the moment we\u0027re just watching and waiting with everyone else, Leland. We do know that the Muna 2 fired its engine but obviously we don\u0027t yet know whether the burn was successful.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know I\u0027ve got my fingers crossed, Bill and I\u0027m sure that everyone watching at home has as well. I do have a question though - how do you know that the engine has fired if you\u0027re out of contact with the spacecraft?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s a little complicated Leland. We launched the Muna 2 towards the M\u00FCn on what we call a free return trajectory. If you picture a big figure-of-eight with Kerbin in one loop and the M\u00FCn in the other, you\u0027ll have the right idea. Now the big advantage of a free return is that once the spacecraft is on the right course it will fly around the M\u00FCn and back to Kerbin without us having to do anything else at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWasn\u0027t that the same trajectory that Rockomax used for their Satellite 4, Bill?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbsolutely, Leland and we used it for the same reason. If anything had gone wrong with the Muna 2 before it reached the M\u00FCn, we might still have had one chance to get some pictures and send them back to Kerbin. As it happened, everything looked fine so just before loss of signal we commanded the spacecraft to start the timer for Munar orbit insertion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat makes sense so far, Bill.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay. Now if the spacecraft was still on a free return trajectory, then we should have picked up a signal about thirteen minutes ago. So we know that the engine fired but as I said - we have no way of telling whether it fired for the right amount of time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe burn time is quite important isn\u0027t it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt certainly is,\u00A0Leland. If the engine doesn\u0027t fire for long enough then the spacecraft will just fly round the M\u00FCn and off into space. If it fires just a little too long, then the spacecraft will crash into the M\u00FCn instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, I guess I\u0027ll just keep those fingers crossed a bit longer then, Bill. Thank you for talking to KBS News.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy pleasure, Leland.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland turned back to the camera. \u201CFor those of you who are just joining us, that was kerbonaut Bill Kerman, talking to us about the art and science of cosmic navigation. I am Leland Kerman at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E Mission Control at a little under three minutes to go before we regain contact with the Muna 2 spacecraft on it\u0027s voyage around the M\u00FCn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe village hall fell silent as the clock ticked downwards. The squabbling kerblets seemed to sense that something was happening and scampered back to sit down beside their parents. Even the KBS news team was quiet, content to simply record the moment and listen to the flight control team. Jonton paused in mid sip as the last digit flipped over from one to zero\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m picking up a signal, Flight. Downlink established... and we have telemetry!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow\u0027s she looking Joemy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooking good, Flight. Power systems are nominal and... one moment.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe camera zoomed in on one kerbal, working away at his console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCamera deployment confirmed, Flight. We\u0027re picking up...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of Joemy\u0027s report was drowned out as the clock disappeared from the main screen and was replaced by a complicated looking set of figures. They didn\u0027t mean a thing to Jonton but from the sheer volume of celebration in Mission Control, he assumed they meant good news.

After a leisurely roll-out, the pilot cut the engines--hardly had they fallen to whine when a fuel cart smartly raced behind one wing. Two kerbals leapt off and chocked the aircraft wheels. The fueling point cover flipped open, and the cart driver plugged an earthing wire and unreeled the fuel hose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rear door of the aircraft hissed open, and onto the runway unfolded a complicated staircase. A darkly clad kerbal strode down and stood beside them ere a second, dressed in a grey suit, appeared in the doorway and gingerly descended.

Not much to this one, he thought, looks like a typical payroll watcher. He glanced down. Hmmm. Not afraid to get his shoes... boots dirty though and too busy for spit and polish . Lodan straightened up, sharp grey eyes from a lined face steadily returning Obrick\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s gaze.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch better.

Lodan led them across the tarmac towards a small electric cart whereupon fluttered two small pennants:the familiar Kerbin flag and a stylised design of Kerbol rising over the horizon with six smaller stars scattered across the sky. A shiver ran down Sam\u0027s back when he saw that the white, gleaming door bore three stenciled letters: KSA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELodan opened the door and gestured for Obrick and Sam to enter. He surreptitiously checked Obrick\u0027s seatbelt, handed Sam the two briefcases, and climbed into the front seat. The cart rocked on its suspension when Obrick\u0027s bodyguard swung himself onto the bench. Lodan through the windscreen stared straight ahead while buckling in and gripping the steering wheel. The purr of the motor shifted up a tone, and he wheeled the cart around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESam stared through his window while the cart steadily rolled. Against the distant skyline boldly stood a skeleton of girders whereover lowly stooped a crane, a spiderweb of struts precariously suspended from one end. The cart drove around a bend, shifting Sam\u0027s view: the spider web flattened into a great latticework bowl. A team of kerbals over it swarmed like tiny green ants, some hauling struts, others hanging over the edges of the bowl and working a patchwork of large square panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cart suddenly halted! Sam lurched sideways in his seat: spinning orange lights luminously streaking the window while a large tractor rumbled before them, towing a flatbed trailer of cable drums whereupon in bright yellow hats sat two kerbals who at him waved while they passed. Sam blinked and groaned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough his shifting eyelids he glimpsed a pair of excavators that so pecked at the ground as to carve a ragged trench that stretched to an elegant, cream coloured building: two gracefully curved wings, swept from an imposing main entrance, their roofs studded at regular intervals with domed skylights, large arched windows of slightly darker stone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHmmm,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Obrick, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u0027s certainly eye-catching, but it\u0027s a little too... angular for my taste.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt is a bit minimal looking,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Sam, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Calthough I think it goes rather well with whatever they\u0027re building out over there.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He waved vaguely towards the rear window. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u0027ll probably look better with grass.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cart stopped, and Lodan hopped down to open the passenger door. Obrick climbed out, impassively beholding the expanse of churned mud that between the road and building entrance lay. Like stepping stones before him stretched concrete slabs that bore a walkway of wooden planks--generously decorated with muddy bootprints. Several workers were emphatically gesturing to a pit near the front entrance, although Obrick couldn\u0027t hear them over the the excavators that behind him roared and whined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELodan dipped his head. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI\u0027m afraid it\u0027s a little rough and ready Mr President,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWe weren\u0027t really expecting visitors for several weeks yet, let alone one of the Twelve Pillars\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cart springs creaked when Obrick\u0027s bodyguard climbed out.
