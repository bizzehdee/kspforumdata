I had a hand in writing the current throttle code for KSPSerialIO, updating it so that the controller throttle and keyboard controls will (kind of) play along. In general the controller\u0027s idea of throttle control is king, unless something like RemoteTech or kOS (I\u0027ve never tried Mechjeb) overrides throttle control entirely. At any rate, KSPSerialIO does not yet send the final throttle level back to the controller, so any more fine-grained control isn\u0027t really an option at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo cool pictures of current progress, but I\u0027ve sorted out one of the programming challenges I was very nervous about.

First, it\u0027s synchronous, so calls to send data using it block until the data has all been sent. This strikes me as an incredible waste of the nice interrupt-driven hardware TWI module on Atmel chips. Second, it uses a maximum 32 byte buffer, and allocates quite a few of them internally. Increasing that to cope with the 190 byte VesselData packet KSPSerialIO uses would chew up almost all of the RAM on a Uno or Leonardo processor. I\u0027d have to juggle looping through and manually blatting 32 byte chunks on to the I2C bus, along with sending and receiving through the UART and a fair amount of button handling. It was looking grim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried a few different approaches. There\u0027s some alternative I2C drivers around for Arduino, but the all work on the assumption that they\u0027ll only be running on master devices, fetching data from peripheral slaves. Nobody seems to have done much work on optimising Arduino I2C slave drivers. My solution eventually came from reading Atmel\u0027s TWI application notes, AVR311 and AVR315, and adapting their sample master and slave drivers to run in the arduino environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETook a couple of evenings work, but I\u0027ve updated the Arduino Mega in my controller to also broadcast VesselData packages on to an I2C bus as soon as they\u0027re received. That happens asynchronously - I just make a function call and pass it a pointer to my data, and the driver uses an interrupt handler to marshall data in to the TWI module while my code carries on doing other stuff. Looks like that\u0027s happening without slowing anything else down so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wrote a quick test sketch on a slave arduino that receives VesselData packets from I2C and writes data from it to the serial console. Enough of a proof of concept that I\u0027ll be able to start writing code for my displays immediately when they\u0027re up and running. Pretty happy with how that panned out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T15:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe printed circuit boards I had made for the displays and the display controller arrived.
