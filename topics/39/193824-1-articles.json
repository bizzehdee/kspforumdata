I loved it, it was truly great. Unfortunately the company went broke and they no longer offer the service. One of my two models got stolen (long story), and I\u0027d love to replace it. My intention is to use a service like shapeways or similar, but I can\u0027t figure out how to create a 3D file from a craft, I can\u0027t get blender plugins to work. Anyone know anything I could do, or better yet, help if you can get the plugins working?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks! any help much appreciated\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"usfreitas","CreatedById":204608,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-13T14:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am also looking at printing some of my ships.
