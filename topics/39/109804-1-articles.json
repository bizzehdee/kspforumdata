I\u0027ve done some in the past, but they were just fun little projects, nothing quite as daunting as a tutorial series.\n\nI just wanted to ask for input on how best I could cover it. Of course, things can be rearranged, but here are some basic notes I\u0027ve compiled:\n\n**Topics**\n\n- Basic Construction (what rockets need, the extreme basic to land Kerbals alive)\n- Terminology (Delta-V, TWR, orbital mechanics lingo)\n- How to Pilot Crafts (using hotkeys for thrust, how pitch/yaw/roll work)\n- How to Pilot Spacecrafts/ Orbital Mechanics (same as above, but in space)\n- Advanced Construction (Fuel lines, struts, difference of engines)\n- Advanced Advanced Construction (Root/offset/angle buttons, fairings)\n- How to Land Stuff (Landing on the Mun, primarily)\n\nSo this is the list I have so far, and I do plan on adding variants on these videos to make rovers and spaceplanes and stuff like that. Maybe even SSTOs once I figure the blasted things out.\n\nWhat do you think so far? I\u0027m aiming to have videos under 15 minutes in length so people aren\u0027t watching them forever. Should some of the list be compressed, broken apart? What things do you want me to cover?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T23:59:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 11:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Maximus97**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Tiddles","CreatedById":124560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T14:28:50Z","Content":"To me, you seem to cover most of the basic things a new player would need to learn the game.

I see an entire episode on contracts and how that works...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - Stability, why it makes sense to be heavy up top vs heavy at the bottom. \n\u003E - The Pendulum Fallacy. \n\u003E \n\u003E - Gravity turning.
