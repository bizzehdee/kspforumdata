Sorry, I\u0027ve only just seen this comment for some reason. First off, I\u0027m glad you like my videos - it really means a lot. Just to clarify, there will be (on the whole) a new craft for each episode since each cargo requires specific transportation so there will be will be plenty to decide which one you prefer most. I\u0027ve recently moved into university which his why there hasn\u0027t been an upload for a while (although the second part is very nearly done!) so sorry about that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I\u0027m not that happy with the craft. It\u0027s over 700 parts and really began to slow down my laptop once I was having to load the aerodynamic forces (the final reentry procedure took over an hour from the moment I hit the atmosphere to touching down) so I\u0027d be surprised if you wanted to use it.
