If it had came to fruition, I think it would have likely been one of the best things I\u0027d ever written, because unlike all of my other stories, it had themes and questions and plots planned out from the beginning, and aims to say something deeper about the world we live in (then admittedly goes against it?

The first would be the quote from the Reddit thread, which is, IIRC, \u0022We can\u0027t all be Kerbonauts, can we?\u0022 The second was\u00A0the idea that, for most of us, there is a day where we have to give up on our dreams. Especially amongst the members of the KSP forums, there is a sizable proportion of people who dream or have dreamed\u00A0of becoming astronauts. However, as we mature we realize that the odds of us actually going to space are very close to zero, unless some huge revolution occurs in the space industry...

He had been lucky enough to win a small lottery and live out his dreams of exploration and adventure. A similar dream is born in Daniel, as he asks to go to the Mun. Everett tells Daniel that it will be very difficult, but one day it could be possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile growing up, Daniel is diagnosed with extremely mild color blindness. This, while having little effect on his day-to-day life, disqualifies him from being an astronaut under the current rules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to his outstanding academic ability, he is selected for a KASA internship while still relatively young, along with Lloyd and Tracy, who he quickly befriends. Lloyd is good with computers but is the most immature of the three. Tracy is very smart and the most extroverted of the three.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this universe, there are large parallels to our universe, but in this reality, the SLS/Orion project, dubbed Odyssey, is far ahead of schedule and cheaper than expected but never really had a true \u0022purpose,\u0022\u00A0beyond space station crew rotations and cargo deliveries. The notional \u0022Block II\u0022 of the Odyssey system, which is theoretically capable of\u00A0lunar landing missions will make a debut, but there are still no very clear plans for a landing, much like our reality pre-Artemis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is not mentioned in the chapter, but commercial space companies are far behind in this reality, with it unclear how far ahead the SpaceX analogue has made it. The Falcon 9 analogue likely exists but did not gain reuse capability after several failed tests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace Tourism is also far behind, somehow delayed even more than it is in our reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaniel wakes up after a dream about flying to the Mun on Odyssey 18, which is the next Odyssey mission but will only go to the ISS analogue and not the Mun. The three friends drive to work, with Daniel at the wheel. At work, his main co-worker, Calvin, and Daniel work on tests for a component of Odyssey 23, which will sport the first Block II service module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 2 - No concrete name, possibly \u0022Rocket Road\u0022 or \u0022Road to The Stars\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably not the same day as Chapter 1, Daniel gets to work with Lloyd and Tracy on some sort of machining test for a future rocket component (according to my notes, possibly a custom fairing), giving us a deeper insight into how they fit together as a friend group. During the test, Daniel briefly looks away to watch a livestream of a foreign rocket launch, something he does often and will continue doing throughout the story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShortly afterwards, he is asked to drive a vehicle pulling a core tank for an Odyssey rocket (potentially Odyssey 19, or maybe it is another Atlas-V esque rocket and not an Odyssey as the Odyssey would be too important) from one building to another, because the normal driver was currently unavailable and Daniel had some experience with driving lower value supplies around the complex. He accepts. While carefully navigating the tank through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E complex, some sort of antenna or power tower collapses, falling on a course to hit and destroy the tank, but thanks to a quick reaction and his superb driving skills, Daniel manages to save the tank. However, the tower falls over onto the van that Daniel uses to drive the trio to work one day, yet the van sustains little damage. Someone remarks that maybe they should build rockets out of the stuff they build the van out of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaniel is congratulated for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 3 - The Driver\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trio are driving down the road blasting music in the van on a day off, on the way too or from a social outing, generally having fun. This lets us explore more of the friend dynamic and also offers insight into the family situation of all three. Some of this is kind of important, but the story would work without it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen they show up to work the next day, the preparations for the launch of Odyssey 18 are well underway, with the rocket undergoing late-stage preparations in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. The backup crew will arrive by airplane to little fanfare (as they are the backup crew and the primary crew has two very famous astronauts on board), for final training and mission prep.\u00A0After hearing about his skillful driving, an official semi-jokingly asks Daniel if he wants to drive the stair truck\u00A0for when the crew gets off of the plane. Daniel semi-jokingly accepts, but stuff plays out so that he actually gets to do that later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile unloading the backup crew, Daniel briefly meets one of them, and he talks briefly about his dream. The astronaut tells him that he thinks he will make a good astronaut someday. Daniel\u0027s heart sinks, but he doesn\u0027t have the heart to tell him that he can\u0027t be an astronaut because of his slight color blindness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 4 - Final Integration\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trio are allowed to observe and help a little bit with the integration of Odyssey 18. Daniel helps load some semi-late-load payloads into the resupply module (a-la Space Shuttle MPLM), as packing arrangements is something he has helped with on paper for a while. This is the first time he\u0027s been this involved with a launch campaign. Daniel being \u0022the official space program driver\u0022 is the meme-of-the-week basically around the space center, and due to schedule conflicts on behalf of the actual operator, Daniel is asked to drive the crawler-transporter, with the Odyssey 18 on top, to the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe gets to do this, but, at least in the outline, it is between chapters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 5 - Launch Day\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trio drive to work once more, IIRC Tracy gets to be a backup mission controller or something so she gets dropped off at control. The media shows up in droves. Daniel\u0027s fame as \u0022The Driver\u0022 and someone getting sick leads to Daniel getting to drive the astronaut van, with the astronauts inside, to the launch pad. On the mission are Sandy Wright Kerman, Lofase Kerman, and Jebediah. Sandy and Jeb are two of the most famous Kerbonauts ever. On the way to a pad, Jeb strikes up a conversation with Daniel and takes a liking to him. When at the launch pad, Jeb invites Daniel to come up the elevator with him. The present official protests, but gives in at Jeb\u0027s insistence. Jeb, who displays a casual yet epic attitude about the whole thing, jokingly asks Daniel if he\u0027s like to come with him. Daniel laughs it off, and while he is honored, he is saddened by the fact that he can\u0027t. The two bid farewell, both wishing each other luck. On the way down the elevator, Daniel has a talk with the official who didn\u0027t want him up there in the first place, but he isn\u0027t angry any more, instead surprised and kinda proud (probably the not right word, maybe in awe?) of his sudden bond to Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking for a viewing area to see the launch at, Daniel spots his grandpa\u0027s plane, the Summer Dance, at the airport. After a while, he finds him and the two have a happy reunion, having not seen each other for a few months. They watch the launch together, and it goes off without a hitch, the three astronauts safely reaching the ISS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 6 - A Shining Beacon (?

His mom (Francine) lives in Kerbin City, the under-construction futuristic city of tomorrow, designed by Kerbin\u0027s greatest minds with the intent to be a shining technological beacon to provide optimism for the future. Living there is kinda expensive, but again, Everett is mildly rich and will provide what Francine can\u0027t. During his visit, he takes a Hyperloop-esque transport, one of the only ones existing so far, to the extremely prestigious Kerbin Institute of Technology, where he plans to go to college at, to check up on a few things and solidify his academic plan. His education is being paid for mainly by Everett, but also by the scholarships he managed to get and his night job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen he gets back, Daniel has dinner with his sister and mom, and the family has happy discussions. All of a sudden, a loud noise was heard. Daniel pokes his head out of the door just in time to see Everett impressively land the Summer Dance in Francine\u0027s smallish backyard. Dinner continues with Everett joining. It is obvious that Everett is getting old, but he still acts as young and enthusiastic as ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 7 - The Cliff\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would have been mainly a filler chapter with more of business as usual for Daniel\u0027s KASA internship. That day, however, a SpaceX analogue launch is happening at a different launch site, and Daniel takes a break to watch the livestream. This is the maiden flight of the (non-reusable) Falcon Heavy analogue (far closer to V1.0 than Block 5 as most of that progression never happened). It promises to begin lowering the cost of access to space, and generally offers hope for the future, especially a small amount of hope for Daniel\u0027s dream. However, it explodes several seconds after liftoff, much to the disappointment of almost everyone. The failure hits the SpaceX analogue, not very hardly because it was a test flight, but they have already been struggling as of recent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 8 - The Fall\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA month or two has passed. The trio are preparing for the launch of Odyssey 19 (mission unspecified in the outline), but Tracy has drifted slightly apart from the other two as she has gotten closer with her boyfriend. Not much, but a noticeable amount. Odyssey 19 will launch in just a few days. However, part of the way through the day, he receives news that Everett has suffered a severe stroke with essentially zero chance of recovery. He rushes to the hospital that he is at, and after a while they have to turn his life support off. Deep in mourning, he receives news that night that he has been laid off from his night job due to the business\u0027s financial difficulties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 9 - The Winds of Time\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaniel attends Everett\u0027s funeral. His mom and sister are there, as is Lloyd, but Tracy, who really wanted to be there, unfortunately couldn\u0027t. Daniel\u0027s dad is also notably absent. Many of Everett\u0027s old friends, including many pilots, who do a flyover in Everett\u0027s honor, are present, and they reminisce and share old stories about the adventures they went on with Everett.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaniel, still deeply saddened, returns to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E in time for the launch of Odyssey 19. It is scrubbed, likely for something mundane like a mechanical issue. A minor hurricane is on its way, prompting concern, but a launch is attempted the following day. Throughout the launch window, issues push the launch further back, and the hurricane begins to intensify far faster than expected. At the very end of the window, the launch is scrubbed due to high winds. The hurricane was arriving far faster than expected. The rocket is detanked and preparations begin to roll it back into the Vehicle Assembly Building. However, the accelerating and intensifying hurricane slams into the coast, with one alarmingly fast gust toppling Odyssey 19 as it rolls back, reducing it to a crumpled heap of scrap metal. An evacuation order is given for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E without much regard for active projects as this intensity and speed was not expected. Daniel escapes in his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E van, noting how remarkably resilient it is to the elements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 10 - The Waters of Fate\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hurricane took a turn south, slamming into Kerbin City. The anti-flood systems had not been fully built yet and failed accordingly, leading to a city-wide flood. The city is evacuated. Daniel\u0027s sister is moderately injured in a car wreck escaping the city. The family home is seriously damaged, and the place where Francine works is destroyed. Tracy\u0027s family offers Daniel\u0027s family their house to stay at for the time being.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 11 - The Death of a Dream\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few days later, after the dust settles, the family discovers that Everett\u0027s will had been lost in the hurricane. Due to local inheritance laws taking effect, the system decides that the majority of Everett\u0027s estate will go to Daniel\u0027s dad, Everett\u0027s first born son. There is a legal protest but it fails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe implications of this set in - Francine cannot afford her home in Kerbin City any more, although it doesn\u0027t really exist any more. Daniel\u0027s sister is recovering and the hospital bills will be fairly substantial. The biggest casualty story-wise, however, is Daniel\u0027s tuition to Kerlington Institute of Technology. He is left unable to afford his planned education, and he is past pretty much all application deadlines so he must wait another semester or year to go anywhere else... And everywhere is a step down from KIT prestige-wise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon arriving back at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, he finds that the damage was substantial and it will set the space program back months, if not a year or two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaniel\u0027s present and future have collapsed, and he begins snapping at people frequently, even Lloyd and Tracy. He immediately apologizes, but despite his friend\u0027s best efforts he remains an emotional wreck for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the Solid Rocket Boosters from Odyssey 19 is remarkably intact. It should be noted that Odyssey, especially its SRBs, are far smaller than those on the SLS, as this universe is still Kerbal-sized. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E is deemed not safe enough to be used on an operational mission, but nobody knows how to dispose of it. Daniel is tasked with, along with a transport team, transporting this booster to a warehouse where it would await its fate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile on the way, an idea pops into his head - building a makeshift space capsule, stealing the booster, and launching himself into suborbital space. He briefly dwells on the idea, as it gives him some hope for his dream, but quickly dismisses it as it would be dangerous and impractical, not to mention illegal. Besides, he thought, he wasn\u0027t that desperate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 12 - Hope\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe family makes a visit to Everett\u0027s storage facility, which is a hangar at an airport, to try to plead their case to Daniel\u0027s father, who is generally a selfish uncaring jerk, and who divorced Francine for a richer woman. He and his wife are going through the storage unit, mainly with an eye for value. Francine tries to talk to him but it doesn\u0027t work. He is being unreasonable and selfish as per usual, obviously enjoying watching Francine beg and suffer. When that fails, Francine at least asks him if she can recover a few precious family heirlooms. Daniel\u0027s dad retrieves them but burns them in front of her, laughing cruelly. The family leaves, exhausted and disappointed. As he is leaving, Daniel notices Everett\u0027s plane, the Summer Dance, in his dad\u0027s \u0022throw-away\u0022 pile. He doesn\u0027t say anything for fear that it would be destroyed like Francine\u0027s heirlooms were.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater, in the middle of the night, he sneaks into the airport and steals the Summer Dance using a key that Everett had given to him many years prior. He flies it hopefully away, finally joyful he managed to save one of the defining elements of his past long enough to bring it into his present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, during the flight, Daniel\u00A0spots the Mun. He recalls his first ever flight with Everett in which his dream of space was born. He recalls the whole mindset of \u0022You\u0027re so smart and talented - You can do anything if you put your mind to it!\u0022 that he was told his whole life and the backup astronaut\u0027s assessment that he would make a good astronaut, and Jebediah\u0027s in-jest invitation to join him on his journey to space on Odyssey 18. Lies and unrealistic expectations. Toxic Optimism. And it would have made some sense, too, if it weren\u0027t for the stupid defect in his eyes that made the greens slightly grey, his curse at birth that made his dream impossible. Why couldn\u0027t he choose his dream? Why did whatever diety or process of randomness that existed or didn\u0027t exist curse him with an ambitious and impossible dream? Why couldn\u0027t his dream have been to be a janitor? Something easy, something he could accomplish and be happy for the rest of his life! Why? WHY???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a fit of rage, Daniel sends the Summer Dance into a nosedive, screaming all the way down. He then realizes that, even if just for the sake of the plane, this is not what Everett would have wanted. He pulls out of the dive, kind of close but not hollywood-stereotypically-last-second close to the ground, crying, and flies around a little bit before flying to and landing at Lloyd\u0027s dad\u0027s house.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe doesn\u0027t know Lloyd\u0027s dad that well, but well enough that he can show up unannounced. However, he is gone, and will be for a while. He works in construction (possibly as an architect) and will be working on a project for a while. Daniel parks the Summer Dance in Lloyd\u0027s dad\u0027s garage, utterly defeated and drained. He felt like he needed some hope, even just any at all, in order to continue on. Then, he remembers that he has hope - the Odyssey 19 Solid Rocket Booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe quickly sets to work calculating what he would need to to build a minimalist one man space capsule using only readily\u00A0available materials. He quickly realized it will be incredibly unsafe, and if he applied the usual safety requirements to it, it would never fly. He still cares about his life, despite his earlier outburst, so he sets his sights on a 1 in 5 loss-of-crew number for the capsule only. The booster was something he couldn\u0027t control, who knows how damaged it was. He felt like these odds were an okayish balance between his hopes for the rest of his life and his hopes for his dream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stays up nearly all night working on this, falling asleep in the morning for only 1-2 hours. When he wakes up he feels a little bit better, and almost laughs at himself for his outburst and optimism towards his deathtrap rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, he is late to his internship. He flies the Summer Dance to the space center, but due to his haste, lands hard, severely damaging the plane\u0027s landing gear, rendering it unable to fly until after repairs could take place, repairs which he didn\u0027t have the money for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 13 - Descent Into Madness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaniel\u0027s\u00A0internship, while still the best part of his day, goes downhill tremendously. Calvin has been laid off as his job is not necessary to the current KASA operations, which is picking up the pieces from the hurricane. This leaves Daniel without Calvin as a mentor figure. He didn\u0027t even get to say goodbye in person.\u00A0The hurricane has sent a cascade of delays through the space program. The second test flight of the Falcon-Heavy analogue fails, and financial troubles lead to the SpaceX analogue undergoing a change of leadership and scope, meaning they will never really go beyond their Falcon 9 analogue for the foreseeable future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaniel\u0027s mom is working as a waitress for low pay. Daniel\u0027s sister is still not in the best condition to work. Daniel has been looking for work, and the only jobs he can find are those that would require him to give up his internship, and he would rather stick around as long as he can as it is the highlight of his life and the only place he has regular contact with friends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore the launch of Odyssey 18, Jebediah had agreed (although maybe he had forgotten) to hand out with Daniel for a bit when he came back to Kerbin. However, his mission in space had been extended due to the lack of crew launches. A Russian-analogue Soyuz-analogue spacecraft is being prepared for launch earlier than usual with a relief crew. Both Lloyd and Tracy are selected to go to Russia-analogue to help with the launch, but not Daniel.\u00A0Due to Daniel trying to keep the pain to himself, trying not to burden his friends (which is, most of the time, a toxic mindset), he hasn\u0027t confided the full extent of his struggles in them. While video chat is a thing, Daniel\u0027s damaged mindset leads to him not wanting to inconvenience them with his nagging, although they do talk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe events of this chapter are spread out over the course of a few weeks. Each one pushes Daniel closer to his breaking point. He goes back to his tiny capsule and works on it first out of whimsical imagination, then semi-ironically, then, as a \u0022what-if.\u0022 He slowly transitions to truly believing that this is his only way out - that he\u0027ll either die in a blaze of burning rocket fuel and be relieved of all of his struggles, or launch and witness the sunrise from suborbital space, accomplishing his dream and reinvigorating his optimism and happiness. Slowly he blocks out all other thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe date for the booster transport has been set, it will be taken to a test range to be fired in order to simulate what would happen on an actual Odyssey mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next Odyssey mission, Odyssey 20, will be an unmanned space station module, although they are considering launching Odyssey 21 first to alleviate the crew situation on the ISS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 14 - The Penultimate Day\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe day before the day of the booster heist. Daniel\u0027s capsule lies half completed in Lloyd\u0027s Dad\u0027s garage. Daniel knows that it is practically impossible to finish it in time. Financial conditions are now as such\u00A0that he needs to withdraw from his internship soon, but currently, the family makes enough to care for 2 of the 3 of them...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThroughout the story, there have been references towards Daniel\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E van being oddly indestructible and nearly airtight. In an act of desperation, after not nearly enough calculation,\u00A0Daniel hastily converts the van into a space capsule, using sealant on the inside, finishing the capsule\u0027s SCUBA-based oxygen system and transferring it over, attaches the parachute he made to the roof, and wires the basic control circuit to the dashboard. He also removes the seat belt and installs a harness. At the end of the day, the fins, ballast section (the booster is waaaay too powerful), igniter, launch rail,\u00A0and \u0022capsule\u0022 are ready, but Daniel has second thoughts, briefly having a moment of clarity - This contraption was madness and had an unreasonably low chance for success. Sure, his dream might be dead, but there is so much more to life than whimsical childhood fantasies, even if it REALLY sucks to lose them. His family had been through as much as he had been through, adding his death would not be fair in the slightest. However, this thought is quickly dismissed due to Daniel\u0027s separation, anger, insanity, and tunnel vision, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaniel does, however, write goodbye letters, leaving them in the garage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 15 - For The Colors of The Sunrise\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDaniel goes to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E for his internship, and although his reputation as \u0022The Official KASA Driver\u0022 has worn off, he still got them to let him co-drive the booster. Arriving nervous, determined, and disheveled, multiple people ask him if he is okay, but he responds with the short lie of \u0022yes.\u0022 After driving in the correct direction for a while, the police escort returns home as the booster is now out of their jurisdiction and relatively without threat. He spikes the other driver\u0027s drink with sleeping medicine (not like anything harmful or malicious, just like an appropriate amount of Z-quil or something), smashes the vehicle\u0027s tracking device, and turns back towards Lloyd\u0027s dad\u0027s house.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce there, he used Lloyd\u0027s Dad\u0027s small shop crane to hoist the ballast tank and the van onto the front end of the booster, then bolts the rudimentary fin control system to the bottom of the booster. After some tests, he is satisfied, and then sets about his modification of the trailer into a launch rail, welding brackets onto the booster and the rail onto the trailer. There are many delays throughout this process, and he is running substantially behind schedule for the sunrise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, all the way over in the Russia-analogue, Lloyd and Tracy are at an alcohol-filled party celebrating the successful launch of crew to space on that Soyuz-analogue. Lloyd gets into a skill/ego contest with one of the coders there and drunkenly yet expertly hacks his way into deducing Daniel\u0027s location, although is initially worried that he had lost the competition as he didn\u0027t think Daniel would be at his dad\u0027s garage. Daniel was supposed to be at the booster test range by now! However, he was a bit suspicious, but then, after conversing with Tracy, they put the pieces together. A call to the test site reveals that the booster had not arrived yet and was hours late, and they had lost track of the truck. They were sending search vehicles out at this moment.\u00A0Lloyd accesses the house\u0027s security cameras long enough to confirm what Daniel is doing, albeit through a very poor quality and questionable video feed. The two are shocked that he was willing to go to these lengths, and try to call him, but he does not answer. The two call the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E explaining the situation but are laughed away at the utter ridiculousness, thinking its just drunken ramblings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, one of the Russian-analogue guys at the party, an older man (potentially the same one that Lloyd was having an ego competition with), overhears them talking and asks if the Daniel they were talking about was the same Daniel as Everett\u0027s grandson Daniel. When they answer yes, the guy asks if he is in danger. They say yes. He says that many, many years ago, Everett and him were comrades, and that Everett had saved his life. He had never been able to repay him. He offers whatever he can do to help Daniel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe three take a fast training jet and leave to help rescue Daniel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the time it takes them to fly, and then drive the rest of the way, Daniel had finished the launch rail and gently backed the trailer, with the booster on it, off of the edge of a carefully measured cliff, so it rested at a near-vertical angle. He sets up the ignition system and tests the controls, before boarding the van and using sealant to seal the final door shut. The launch window for being able to see a sunrise while in space begins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, at that moment, Lloyd and Tracy come racing down the road in their car, stopping and racing towards the rocket. Daniel finally picks up his phone, advising the duo to back up as it was going to get very loud very soon. Lloyd and Tracy do not oblige, and attempt to talk Daniel down. All of Daniel\u0027s struggles come pouring out, emphasizing how he didn\u0027t see a probable reality where his life gets back to the quality it was before it went downhill.\u00A0This way at least gave him a chance at having his dream come true - It wouldn\u0027t otherwise, with the way the space industry was headed, and with his color blindness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLloyd and Tracy emphasized how they cared deeply for him, even though they hadn\u0027t been doing the best job of showing it recently. They talked about how his family cared for him, about how much Everett believed in his potential, about hope and joy and love and loss and luck and unfairness... All the while, Daniel has his finger on the launch button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen they ask Daniel if he cares about them. He says yes. Tracy, followed by Lloyd, sits down directly underneath the booster\u0027s nozzle.\u00A0Daniel breaks down crying, and, after breaking the door seal, exists the craft and goes down to meet the two. They all hug it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EChapter 16 - What Next?\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trio (mostly just the Lloyd and Tracy as Daniel is an emotional wreck at this point) quickly convert the trailer and booster back to what they were like before, or at least as close as they can get it. The trailer was kind of bent but mostly okay after being backed down a near-cliff for use as a launch pad. They managed to slip it the rest of the way back down, and hooked the truck back up, before driving it further into the middle of nowhere. Lloyd fixes the tracking device and Tracy tells Daniel to tell control that their electronics (including GPS) cut out and they got lost. Tracy and Lloyd leave to relieve suspicion, and Daniel arrives at the test site. The damage on the booster and trailer is largely overlooked as while they got \u0022lost\u0022 they went on at least one gravel road, with the dust covering up the imperfections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater that day, or potentially a few days later, the trio go on a walk, admiring the sunset. The question \u0022What Next?\u0022 comes up. Tracy and Lloyd have semi-concrete plans, but Daniel reveals that he will submit his papers of internship resignation the next day. He\u0027ll move the family to someplace short of labor, and go work a job, potentially general manufacturing for a while, to provide for his family, and maybe pursue college a few years down the line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile on the walk, the Russian-analogue man who flew the two back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was driving around sightseeing and says hi. He asks if the Summer Dance was still in the family. Daniel answers to the affirmative, and he agrees to show him later. He joins the conversation and reveals that he has connections with a semi-obscure Russian-analogue aerospace school, and that he might be able to pull some strings scholarship-wise if Daniel would be willing to learn the language.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the sun sets, Daniel\u0027s mom calls him with the news that she has found a better job, and that his sister is making good progress towards her recovery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe four watch a livestream of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E test firing.

This flight is his grandson\u0027s first flight. The scene and the conversations greatly parallel those of the first chapter. The two take off from the large, sandy beaches, with the grandson enjoying it tremendously much in the same way that Daniel did when he first flew with Everett. The grandson\u00A0points towards the disc in the sky and tells Daniel that he wants to go there someday. Daniel smiles, telling his grandson with unwavering certainty and confidence that he will be able to go there someday very soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe camera view changes to reveal that the Summer Dance has been flying on Laythe, and that the grandson had been pointing towards Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^^^The most probable ending.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAlternate Ending 1 - The Abrupt Reversal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second half of chapter 16 is skipped, leaving all of the final sense hope and optimism until the final few sentences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAlternate Ending 2 - The \u0022Nothing Changed\u0022 Ending\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo chapter 17, or an altered chapter 17 taking place on Kerbin.

He would get into severe legal trouble for doing all of this, though, and the story could still easily end sad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAlternate Ending 6\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is some sort of time sensitive event that required the attention of the Trio, which was built up earlier in the story. Right after convincing Daniel not to launch and hugging it out, the three get notice of this event, which is happening very far away, and all pile into the van and launch towards this in a dangerous and thrilling race against time, landing in the beat up, charred van just in time to save the day. This doesn\u0027t fit in with the tone of the story at all, and is pretty improbable. I have no idea what this event would have been, I only thought this ending up because it was an excuse to fly a booster-van across the planet to save the day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah.
