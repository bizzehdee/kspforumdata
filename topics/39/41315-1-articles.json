I\u0027m sure the folks here could give you a thousand great ideas but in my (admittedly limited) experience, the hard part comes when you\u0027ve written about that one great idea - and then need to figure what to write about next to continue the story! If you\u0027re planning to make this a long tale it needs to be one that you can get stuck into personally - which probably means planning it out yourself, even in rough. If the story deviates from the plan, just roll with it - it doesn\u0027t really matter. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E The plan is just something to give you a start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, I\u0027m talking from limited experience so take all this with a large bucket of salt.
