Here it goes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrologue, part 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur story begins 10,000 years ago, when the first kerbals evolved. They had adapted for living in underground caves, in extremely dark environments, thus their lack of an iris. For hundreds of years, kerbals dreamed of new worlds, but no one could find the mythical lands spoke of legends. then, rumors began spreading of a place they called the \u0027surface.\u0027 And thus, it was the end of an era on Kerbin, and the beginning of a brand new one. They quickly evolved covers over their pupils to protect them from the sunlight, and soon great bands of pioneers would set forth from their caves to explore the unknown. Then, about 200 years ago, during one of the greatest journeys of all time, stars where discovered. These pinpoints of light where given special interest by kerbals. They began mapping them, naming them, writing stories about their epic battles in space against mythical beasts called \u0027krakens.\u0027 Many of these \u0027starologists\u0027 noticed something odd: all of the brightest ones, a few of the faint ones, and the big grey circle they dubbed \u0027Mun\u0027 we\u0027re moving in their own seperate patterns, different than the other stars perfect movement in a circle around Kerbin. A very important kerbal whose name has long since been forgotten discovered that two pieces of curved glass made far away things bigger. He quickly patented his idea and sold it as the \u0027telescope.\u0027 And so, the Space Rennaisance began.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
