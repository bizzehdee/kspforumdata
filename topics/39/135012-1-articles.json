Here it is.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thread will chronicle the stories of many kerbals, and will hopefully combine them into one plot line. So, let\u0027s begin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart one: Gregler\u0027s story:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter I: Duna:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay 1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027m heading to Duna. Not exactly what I expected when I signed up for the commercial crew and specialist program. I probably shouldn\u0027t have signed that \u0022Interplanetary work form\u0022 thingamajig. Oh well, at least I\u0027m making 50% more than those saps back in LKO. So, anyways, the \u003Cem\u003ELux\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewill take at least a few Munths to get there, which means I get three Munths of paid vacation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay 2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it turns out, I do not, actually, get several Munths of paid vacation. Instead, I have to help maintain the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ELux\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s engine. Why? Because I\u0027m a fusion reactor tech, and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eof course\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EI end up on the maiden voyage of a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efusion powered megaship.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EDarn, those mining technicians and whatever are LUCKY. They don\u0027t have to do anything until we reach Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay 7:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I already have to service the engine. Not very reliable, apparently. Unfortunately, StarTech, the company that built the ship, signed a waiver that prevents them from suing WBI. Fortunately for me, the engine isn\u0027t spinning, like the hab is, so I don\u0027t have to worry about flying off into space. And of course it\u0027ll be off. Hopefully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay 8:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was off. Fortunately. Also, I did nothing. There was a short circuit, so it was up to the electrician guy to fix it. After we spent three hours on EVA, I went back in, showered, and went to bed. The ship was still on Kerbin time, although it would gradually adjust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay 10: I was informed that we would be burning again today so that we could reach Duna in 60 days. Wow, this ting is fast. Then again, it is a fusion-powered torchship. And now the gravity\u0027s gone. They must be spinning down the centrifuge. Okay, yeah. We\u0027ve stopped spinning. And now the hab\u0027s pivoting back. And the gravity\u0027s back... And it\u0027s quite a bit more now. And now it\u0027s gone again. We\u0027re pivoting back... And now we\u0027re spinning again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
