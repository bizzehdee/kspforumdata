We have to trust progress, \u0027cause without it, we\u0027e doomed. Look at the world around you, old man - look what your people have done to Kerbin. It\u0027s a wasteland, damn it - the only planet we are sure to be habitable is a relic of the past glory, because your generations refused to see what their way of life did to it - that\u0027s why the frak we have to rely on the planets we only speculate an replace our home.
