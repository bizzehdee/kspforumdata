I\u0027m sure the Russians didn\u0027t see themselves as the bad guys. Anyway, him having a communist country does not mean he\u0027s portraying Russia. Communism is a viable political strategy and if you can find a way to make it work, it is one of the best. The problem is that most political structures work in theory. It\u0027s when practice comes to play that things fall apart. Secondly, there never really was any competition in any kind of space race. Russia kicked our butts in every aspect of space flight (speed-wise at least, I feel we won in safety standards).

In general, they are confrontations between moral grey and moral grey. However, one can not ignore the gulags, political repression, purges, and genocide that occurred under their rule.
