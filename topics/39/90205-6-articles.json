A Kerbal is dragging a sledge through the Artic. The Kerbal has been colored with Texture Replacer. The sledge is made with some Firespitter parts, Tweakscaled down to the proper size, and the connection between the Kerbal and the sledge is with KAS. For a uniform look in the cinematic quality, EVA Follower and Camera Tools have to be downloaded as well. That\u0027s six necessary mods, in total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what would happen if you took out any of the mods? A lack of consistency, that\u0027s what. Taking out any of the structural mods would make the sledge cease to work, or at least look very different. Taking out any of the Kerbal retexturing mods would make the Kerbals look dramatically different from shot to shot. Taking out any of the camera mods would make the camerawork very different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods aren\u0027t just for bells and whistles, they make up an integral part of the footage.

I understand that you want to showcase the community as well, but keep in mind, this film is \u003Cem\u003Emade\u003C/em\u003E by the community. It was started by a community member, and then other community members joined in. The plot, the screenplay, the voice acting, and even the music will be created by community members. And yet you make the statement that the film \u003Cem\u003Ehas to use mods to reflect the community\u003C/em\u003E.
