I know you often help out your fans and i hope you can help me out. I have mirrored your mods but i can\u0027t get the pack stable after about 10 times entering /leaving the world (stearing a rocket) my game crashes does this happen to you allso? or do you have an idea im using active texture management normal. If you have no idea could you then maybe put all your mods and setups into a zip file and then maybe upload it to some place like dropbox or email them to me so i can see if it will run stable then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope you have an idea and thank you for the great positive adventures you take me on every week it helps entertain a handicapped guy like me so i can get my mind of the pain so you make a difference atleast for me thank you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest Regards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArnold\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003Eo/ TSSA \u0026amp; Gaarde,\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@TSSA\u003C/strong\u003E: I am using the RP-0 part mods \u002B Infernal Robotics. So SXT, IR, FASA, Ven\u0027s and the proc wings, parts \u0026amp; fairings. There really aren\u0027t to many parts mods in what I am using, rather I use Proc Parts for most things. Parts just take up to much RAM in my experience and force me to use OpenGL which is really bad for FPS when trying to record. In the future I will likely add a part from random part mods here or there. Like I love Lax\u0027s SpaceX pack, and the Near Future packs. But those are way down the road. In those instances however, I just add the parts I want and not the entire packs so that I can save on memory.

That is what viewers prefer (as opposed to normal players). When doing like YT I often get asked to upload what I have set up, which is a collection of many parts of mods as opposed to just a lot of mods. I\u0027ve found using all of all of the mods just isn\u0027t possible on Windows, and sometimes it is nice to tweak a config here or there too. That is kinda what viewers prefer so they can have the same sort of experience the YouTuber they are watching is having.
