He stared at the Kerbal standing in the doorway of his office without a word or a smile, and motioned for him to come in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m Jebediah Kerman. And you are Dr. Wernher, I suppose.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah figeted nervously. Wernher stared at him coldly, and looked back down at the paper he was reading. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022From the looks of it, you are one of my new interns, or atleast one who\u0027s trying to apply for a position as one.\u0022 He continued. \u0022I have no need for interns here. There is no purpose. Now go home and leave, find yourself a better job. You aren\u0027t going to get much of a future here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah didn\u0027t move. He had been warned by several \u0022old salts\u0022 that Wernher was mostly an unforgiving, cold man on the outside, and actively tried to willow down the amount of interns he recieved to make sure only the most loyal and motivated would remain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe stood his ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Go, go. What makes you think you can do it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I-uh, I read your papers, sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What papers?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The one about manned spaceflight sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That one?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You predicted that politics would be a barrier to space exploration, and actively fought back against research on an hypersonic military jet plane, saying something along the lines of \u0027Spend it on a space capsule instead\u0027\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I sail against the wind and fight the tides.\u0022 He said gruffly. \u0022Not a good path for career advancement, never is, never will be. Every darned knocker at Vesria got something \u0027gainst me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah stood still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Come in, take a seat.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a deep sigh of relief; Jeb sat down. He had passed the first test; many interns had never made it this far. Wernher looked at him with an mix of respect and distaste, and lit a small cigar. There was a no-smoking rule in the facility, but noone ever said a word about his habits. Atleast for now. The interns at the Ballistic Rocketry office were unoffically dubbed the \u0022Spacenuts\u0022, and very few were taken seriously, an fact that frustrated Wernher. Quite often, they were written off as a unoffical government fan club for an popular science fiction movie like \u0022Creatures from Eve\u0022 and the \u0022Kerbal Who Conquered Duna\u0022, an stigma that the researchers tried their best to avoid. Jebediah himself was a fan of the \u0022Kerbal who Conquered Duna\u0022, though he tried his best to hide this fact from his close peers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing that Jebediah had settled down, Wernher went into his usual grilling in a thick Germanic accent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why do you want to get into aerospace engineering? What the bloody hell compelled you? Its not a profitable industry, and the pay\u0027s on the lower end of the scale\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question caught Jebediah by surprise. He quickly tried to stagger out a answer, but it was too late. Wernher was on the next one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why are you here in my office? Why do you want to work here? This division has no real future for the next ten years. You are a smart young Kerbal, your 4.1 GPA shows that. Why are you wasting your potinetal in this..in this underfunded joke of an agency?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I, uh, want to go to space.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher sighed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You are not going to space anytime soon.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But your work is interesting.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Because Kerbalkind needs to spread into space to survive the next century.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ha! You are a funny one. I doubt I\u0027ll make it to retirement, and you\u0027re talking about the next century.\u0022 Wernher paused to look at his intern, then continued. \u0022I\u0027ve seen enough in my bloody life to compensate for an full millenia. And I\u0027m not even that old!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t care about myself, sir. I want my children too, and if not, my grandchildren. I want them to look back, and say \u0022My ancestors conquered the stars\u0022.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And whats the chance of that? Considering the current political atomsphere, NEVER. NEVER. NEVER.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The competition with the Red\u0027s, that could be a lucky brea-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nope. Not gonna happen. We just got sidelined by several million, and we only got enough to run one more rocket test launch this year.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But I still want them to have a chance of living in a spacefaring future. Its not for me, or for you, but for them. My great-grandfather came to the Provineces fifty years ago. He was doing well in his homeland, but here, he struggled with poverty. But before he died, he told me that he did this for me, and that made it all worth it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with that, Wernher fell silent. Jebediah knew it had pulled a heartstring or two with him, and so, he waited. There was a deep sigh coming out of Wernher, and he got up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re in. Report to the Assembly Hangar tomorrow at nine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And get yourself a cup of coffee on the way out. Hall 4, Room 12, make a left turn at the emergency exit near the enterance corridor.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And one more thing. Were do you see yourself in ten years?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah grinned, and pointed at the ceiling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Up there.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-12T13:27:17Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2014 01:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NASAFanboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spiritplumber","CreatedById":84232,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T13:23:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOoooh This looks interesting!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
