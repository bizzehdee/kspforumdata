BAM the ship lands, a bit too hard, knocking one of the landing legs off the ship. it comes crashing down to the surface of minmus. door blocked towards the floor, my only escape now the blowtorch i sued to seal myself up. i look around to see the only viewing window smashed. worried i run over and see the blowtorch sitting just out of reach on the outside of the craft. realising my fate i quickly out on my helmet and attach the zo2 system directly to me suit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter 3: accidental rescue is the option that is picked\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith nothing to do, no point in living as my life is hanging on the cord that runs into my suit keeping me alive i look at the cyanide pill in the pak i was given, i think about it and accept that im going to die, so i take it. crunch, wait a sec this isnt cyanide, its a red jellybean. it looks exactly like the one they are using for that matrix movie. i feel sorry for the actor who got my proper pill. i collapse to sleep, not dead, but im in shock of the situation im in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eupon waking i hear footsteps outside and then \u0027hey, is anyone alive in there?\u0027 a voice calls\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein a hurried celebration i quickly disconect myself from the zo2 system i run over \u0027yes im alive, please help, im stuck in here the door is on the ground\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enext thing i hear is the blowtorch cutting through the window it smashed. then another kerbal falls through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027hello, im commander dornom kerman the leader of the first minmus spacestation.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027thank you for rescuing me commander\u0027 i reply happily.\u0027i was acepting my death till you came, i was lucky that cyanide pill was mixed up i guese.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehe takes me out and walks us both over to his ship sitting about 200 metres away from my crashed lander. as we head back up to the spacestation he informs me of what happened. as i had made my orbit i had set it on the same altitude level as the first minmus spacestation. my craft had hit the research lab section and destroyed everything but the lander stage. this is where i currently am. writing this story. i am on the minmus spacestation waiting for a rescue ship to come and take me back to kerbin. i will infrom you of the next adventures i have returning and beyond. so until then salute!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei hope you enjoyed story 1 of this adventure, this is all i can think of for now. it is my first story written. well apart from the terrible english class ones but they dont count =P hope you enjoyed it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Millst0ne MK II","CreatedById":13384,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-23T10:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease, Please, PLEASE fix up the grammar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat writing though, keep it up!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Charzy","CreatedById":440,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-23T11:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s \u0027Astronaut\u0027, not \u0027Astronaught\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-23T11:07:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBe nice people, everyone makes mistakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI invite you all to check out the new \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=14875.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGood Conduct Guide.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Charzy","CreatedById":440,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-23T11:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\\\u0027re just giving him tips to improve his writing in future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anomalous_Matter","CreatedById":24939,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-23T11:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI, for one, enjoyed reading it.
