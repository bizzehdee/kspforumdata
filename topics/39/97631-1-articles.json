This star, known to its planetary inhabitants as Kerbol, is, by almost all measurements, too small to exist. Its size, coupled with its extremely small density, render it a tiny little glowing ember compared to the vast galactic fire that surrounds it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And yet it exists. The little star, the impossible star, still burns brightly. Its light shines in the face of adversity, disputing the unlikelihood of its own existence. This star gives light to its companions, the tiny bundles of rock and gas that are its planets, its children. Moho, Eve, Duna, Jool, and, perhaps the most important out of the bunch, Kerbin- a tiny planet orbiting in a perfect circle around its mother star. By all accounts, Kerbin was impossibly small as well, but Kerbin had one special something that comes along in perhaps one planet out of a galaxy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Kerbin was in the right place at the right time when, millions of years prior to this story, a colossal asteroid impact rocked the planet to its core, leaving a crater still visible on the equator. It was this asteroid that seeded Kerbin with life. The microbes that traveled on this stone spaceship soon spread, covering far and wide, bringing the gift of wonderful green grasses and trees to all of Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s continents. The tiny world was alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But more magnificently still was the path that these microbes took on- Scientists today speculate that memories can be carried through genetic material, the DNA that provides the blueprints for life\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s twists and turns. The DNA carried on the brave spacefaring bacterium retained the memory of their long, cold journey through the void. It was this memory, the darkness and the vacuum of space, which shaped the pathways of Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s new denizens. DNA does not forget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And so, over the eons, the continents shifted, the climates changed, swinging wildly from freezing colds to baking heats, and life spread across the planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface. And then, at some point- the exact occurrence has been lost to time- A variety of grass took its genetic memories and decided to do something about it. Evolution split, and a new kind of life was born- the Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Kerbals took many, many hundreds of thousands of years before they became of anything. Limbs formed, then crude phalanges. Their legs grew stout and short, and eventually they developed bipedal motion to support heads that made up half of their total height. More revolutionary, however, was their evolved intelligence. Or rather, they developed just enough intelligence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Kerbals developed their sentience over time, and learned the tools of a cooperative society. They had no natural predators, and so were fortunate enough to be able to spread their influence far and wide, growing in knowledge and custom. By the time our story begins, the great Kerbal civilization covered the very face of Kerbin, pole to pole. Their electric lights brought the stars down to them as they gazed up in wonder at the night sky, their genetic memories inspiring them to reach out for the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E However, trouble began when experience and reason began to take hold. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153If we Kerbals were meant to roam the stars, then why can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t we get up there?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 Kerbals could not leave the bounds of their tiny homeworld. Kerbals were inventive, however. They used their collaborative effort to study how things were able to fly, and they developed wings to allow their machines to take them up into the sky. It turned out that Kerbals loved to fly- They flew every chance they got. There were no shortage of flying clubs and associations, and scientific laboratories were always sure to have a hangar on hand to send up research aircraft. But not matter how much they tried, how powerful they made their primitive fossil-fueled engines, they could not escape Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere. Every attempt resulted in stalls and the planes tumbling out of the sky. The technology to get up there simply didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t exist; space became an inherently unreachable thing. It seemed that Kerbals were doomed to life on the ground, forced to be content with looking through their telescopes when the night was clear and the sky full of stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Until Wernher von Kerman came along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Von Kerman was an astronomer, like a large number of genetically reminiscent Kerbals before him. While others eventually outgrew their fascination with the heavens, von Kerman\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fascination only grew. Of course, his field of study was to look into the night sky, classifying and studying the twinkling lights, but it was simply never enough. Von Kerman was determined; he was obsessed with finding a way to fulfill his deep, inset yearning for space travel. He believed that it was possible that Kerbals would find their place in the stars, and so he went to work in his spare time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Von Kerman had perhaps the greatest intellect on the planet. He was respected in his field for his discoveries, but he always reigned himself in, never allowing too much of his genius to show at one time. However, when it came to this obsession, he unleashed himself, studying textbooks and ancient cave art, scanning his collections of notes and charts and sky maps, he attended conferences and endless book signings, all in search for a breakthrough. It finally came when he, growing desperate, decided to start over. He gathered his notes and old equipment and made for the junkyard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E He arrived at the junkyard, a crate of his old materials in his arms, and passed underneath the rusted sign. Jebediah Kerman\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Junkyard, the sign read. In reality, the owner\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s name was Geoffry Kerman, and nobody really knew why the sign said what it said. Wondering idly about it as he walked along the dirt path, he soon came to a fenced area, and another Kerbal was waddling out to meet him. His hair was iron-gray, his face wrinkled and dirty, nearly the opposite to Wernher\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s neat, thin mustache and black slicked-back hair. Von Kerman was a Kerbal who had an image to uphold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGot some junk?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The older Kerbal called out, his voice harsh and loud from years of shouting across his junkyard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYees,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 von Kerman replied, heavily accented. Von Kerman came from an area of the planet where the Kerbals developed hard, unique vocal patterns. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI haff some junk to deespose of.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAlrighty then, lemme see watcha got,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Geoffry replied, peering through the chain-link fence. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAh, office supplies? You wanna take \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153em right over that wa-\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C He began to point, but just then, he was interrupted by a particularly loud explosion from behind a large wall of metal scraps. Both he and Wernher both started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COh, don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mind that, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just my son, Jebediah,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Geoffry said, waving the explosion off with a hand and a scowl. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBoy can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t resist lighting old fuel on fire when it comes in. Scares the geep outta everybody that comes through here.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Von Kerman nodded, finally understanding the name on the sign. Jebediah did sound a bit more appealing a name to put on a sign than Geoffry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CEesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t eet a problem? Explosions are dangerous,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 von Kerman said, turning a skeptical face towards Geoffry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s why I make \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153im do it behind those walls a\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 scrap- If there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a big \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153un, then it won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t hurt nothin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Von Kerman nodded, looking back towards the wall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDo you mind eef I haff a vord veeth him?

Halfway there, he set the crate down beside a large pile of similar discarded office supplies as he looked over the piles of junk. He could hear some scuffling from behind the nearby scrap metal pile, and assumed it must be Jebediah. He started off, but just then Jebediah himself came scrambling over the pile of rusted metal, then promptly slipped on the way down, tumbling down the pile until he landed in a heap on the dirt ground. Before von Kerman could do more than blink and surprise, extending a hand to help him up, Jebediah jumped up himself and stepped back, turning to face where he just came from, looking past the junk and into the sky expectantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CShh, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m fine, just look, wait-\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C He said excitedly, his eyes fixed at a low angle above the scrap pile. Von Kerman was quite taken aback as he stepped back with Jebediah, and looked towards the same area, unsure of what he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E With an enormous BANG, an entire garbage can rocketed towards the sky, rising up nearly twenty meters before falling back to the ground, the metal can clattering as it smashed, out of sight, back behind the pile of scrap. Jebediah was ecstatic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAw, YES!

Wernher walked after him, intrigued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CJust\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Zat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s eet? Just to see?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He replied, following Jebediah as he began to scale the mound of junk. Von Kerman eyed the scrap heap with wary eyes, not wanting to get his smock dirty. Finally deciding to press on, he also began climbing. Jebediah was already at the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYeah! Blowing stuff up is fun! Light a fuse, wait a bit- then BOOM!

Wernher nodded as he reached the top, dusting himself off. Then he cast an eye over the hole in the middle of the scrap pile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It was plain to see Jebediah had been working on the site for quite some time. It was simply a hole pushed out of the large scrap metal pile, revealing the ground underneath. The hole was littered with black char from Jebediah\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s past experiments, and there were several containers that either used to hold or still held recovered fuel from scrapped vehicles. There were bits of metal that came off of old barrels and other scrap metal chunks that had been blown apart by Jebediah\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s explosive tests, and indeed the trash can he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d just sent flying was still on fire. Several meters away was apparently the launching platform, several cinderblocks with a large flowery char mark from where the explosion occurred. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 you just come here and blow stuff up?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 von Kerman inquired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYep!
