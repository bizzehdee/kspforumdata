In smaller terms... a Rover. The Lifter I used for it was my \u0022PEGASUS II\u0022 Lifter... one of the most unstable launchers I have ever built. In total it took 27 Launches to exit the Atmosphere, an EXTRA 12 Launches to get into orbit and out of Kerbins\u0027 orbit. Yes, every other time, it blew up. So I decided to make a little video about this tale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh did I also forget to mention, It took 3 attempts to land it too?
