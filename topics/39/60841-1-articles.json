We have the option of significantly transforming designs into original work but this is not as desirable as finding partial or final draft designs already posted on the KSP forums. When making a catalogue entry, for a design that may end up in the index after we secure permission from the model creator, the following information must be collected in the following order: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Exact User Name and Profile Link - It is critically important that we are able to contact KSP forum users for each entry in the catalogue. Record the exact KSP user name and a link to their KSP profile next to the name. Make the entry under the appropriate category heading of the index listing format above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Forum Page Link - This link must take a user to the forum page where the posted design is most directly found (images, download links). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Design Description - Include a short note on why the design, or portion of the design, is suitable for the ship or station type category. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Craft File - Download the .craft file if it is available.

Do not leave a topic thread incompletely reviewed. This is important because multiple Devs will be cataloguing designs and must coordinate efforts to avoid duplication of work. This thread list should have the name of the thread and a link to its first page. Include the list at the bottom of the word document (.docx) containing the entry listings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Catalogue Submission - All of the information for each entry listed in this section should be complied into the thread index format listed above. This should be a .docx type word file. File names for the listed entries must exactly match the .craft files in a single zipped folder (no sub folders for submissions please). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB.2 - Suitable Designs: The design index above needs to collect ships that can be loaded into a standard KSP game install with a standard set of plugins (mods). If the project cannot use the design there is no point in collecting it. Stock designs created with no mods are always useful so even a stock design that is of lo w quality should be catalogued if the .craft file can be downloaded - to reiterate: please download and catalogue all the stock designs you find.

Driver pods tend to use either reusable or cheap thrusters for course adjustment but computing and station based sensors have long since reached the level where mass driver loads can be safely coordinated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mass drivers also deliver sail-net pods which carry more desorption fluid - more reaction mass - to ships while in flight. There resuable sail-net pods and the network itself make incredibly fast transit times routine. These sail-pods are often stowed fore on a ship in order to provide a little bit of extra transit shielding - at the speeds ships can travel in XM2070 a forward transit impact can wreck a vessel. Pods provide a little extra bit of protection. The shallow cone of the sail in front of the ship also provides a certain amount of deflection for small objects like dust grains and the sails are intended to operate with many punctures - which are mended while the sail is furled and re-layered with desorption fluid. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShips are still legally required to keep a primary (non-maneuvering) drive with a delta-V budget of 1.5 times the regular Hohman transit rating of the ship (delta-V for the regular route a ship is inteded to fly). This law is enforced at the time of ship desgin by AOAN safety certificatin and also enforced by a culture of spacers who would not fly an uncertified desgin except in the most desperate circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDESIGN NOTES - We are still working on a sail mod part for KSP and it will be a bit yet.

You still need to put lots of radiators on your designs ... but in this case the system doesn\u0027t need its own. Sails are often furled so even without the mod go ahead and build.

The actual version is under construction now. Link in sig. That command pod up front doubles as an RCS runabout and has a docking bay at rear to stow in during aerobrake so it isn\u0027t torched. Runs on 12 nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the utility section in the rear is far from final. I may add a giant truss-like bay for my landers between the SSTO bay and the kethane refinery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll get you a craft file for that specific version, which I have saved in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo launch it, hack gravity before physics loads (so it won\u0027t break on pad), hyperedit to orbit, unhack gravity, use hyperedit again (to ensure stable orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: In that configuration, it needs the following mods: KSPX, Kethane, Near Future, 6S service compartments, 1 custom part (welded heat shield)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll include the heat shield part in the DL as a .rar. OR I can modify to not use welded parts or as many mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT II: NFP does actually have dedicated radiator parts which even have emmisives when attached to a reactor and deployed. The other option for radiators is to use KSP Interstellar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for a sail, mind if I give it a try? I suck at doing textures, so I might not be able to get a good specular texture done, but what the heck. I\u0027ll see if I can do something, if purely for visual effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-30T14:59:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2014 02:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Top8","CreatedById":79933,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T17:31:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Cap Sierra - Just finished work and need some sleep - should be easy to remove a few mod parts from the ship yes? I may not be thinking clearly at the moment however so if no then of course leave in the vital parts. So long as the list of mods I need for a \u0022universal\u0022 KSP install does not swell beyond feasability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease do give the sail a try. I have a standard Benford Desorption sail extrapolated from Dr. Benford\u0027s papers as circular with a 1 km diameter, very slight conical angle (somthing like 5-10 degrees). Furling mechanism and tow-line anchor point in a central donglly gadget bit. No need to specifically simulate the loop of structral ribbon on the outside as it is only slightly thicker than the sail - sail is un-furled and kept expanded by rotation. No need to show animations or anything at this stage ... just giving you an idea of the standard sail engineering. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EColor aand texture of the sail should probably indicate reflectvity ... and the sail will likely glow bright-hot under full power. You have as much artistic liscence for this as you like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also hybrid Benford and Magnetic sails .... but they are 10 km in diameter and not used nearly as much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a guy working on a sail mod part, Grove, and it will be good to see the differences in desgin aestthetic. It is a good thing to have a few different part types. If you take a look at the Research Matrix the game includes 3 products for every technology application in the game. These three product each correspond to a Porter busoness strategy (cost, differentiation, segmentation ...\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porters_generic_strategies\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter\u0027s_generic_strategies\u003C/a\u003E). This is one example of how we weave a business lesson into the software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat shield - I was thinking that an aerobraking heat / transit shield mod part would be a snap to belnderize for someone with that skill. Certainly some way of avoiding all those parts would be good and again an opportunity for an easy but distinctive new style element. I, however, have very weak blender-fu.
