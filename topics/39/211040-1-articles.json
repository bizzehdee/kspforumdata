And when I learned that Kerbal Space Program had no set lore or background information or anything, it felt like a heyday of creativity. I\u2019ve essentially thought of Kerbin\u2019s governmental structure, and Kerbalkinds history until space travel. Here\u2019s my take on it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin is run by a global government, called the United Kerbin Administration. Instead of something like states in the name, it implies Kerbin is United, and they just administrate stuff. Presidents are elected every 10 years (unless impeached), and to make things easier to control, Kerbin is divided into little regions. This sounds like a dystopia, but I promise it\u2019s not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I want to know, how do you imagine Kerbin\u2018s government(s) are like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-12-14T02:57:08Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2022 02:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbalsaurus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"2009Tartigrade","CreatedById":224001,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-14T13:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI imagine that they are run by a similar system although the name of the government changes dependant on the save.
