He also knew that these LV-9\u0027s were not much better than the SRBM\u0027s, either. But, he knew it was a start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The engine sputtered, and a piece of nozzle extension fell off. Flaming through the sky, the metal sheet disintegrated before it hit anything. Everyone in the observation bunker gasped. They knew that if this happened during a real launch, the Kerbalnauts on board the rocket would be doomed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E John F. Kerman had only recently announced that we would land a Kerbal on the Mun in the next decade, but it\u0027s been almost a year now, and things were not looking good. The Krussians were probably developing a lander already, and they knew not to brag, everyone at the Kerbal Space Center assumed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The observers headed back to the vehicle assembly building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It was a warm summer day when a happy Kerbal mother held the baby she had just seen hatch. \u0022It\u0027s a boy,\u0022 she said with a smile on her face and tears in her eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022What\u0027s his name?\u0022 her husband queried, also crying tears of joy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Jebediah,\u0022 she replied, grinning as happily as a Kerbal mother is whenever her babies hatch and crawl out of their nests.

Jebediah seemed excited. He was only 1 year old, [about, er, I\u0027d say about 4 Earth years.] but he was developing a huge interest in rocketry already. Jebediah immediately began asking questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Can I ride on the rocket?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not yet, son,\u0022 his father answered with a smile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Will it kill me when I do?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, we hope.

They walked into the mission controlling main room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is where we control the rockets,\u0022 his father told Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Cool!\u0022 Jeb said. He ran up to one of the Kerbals at their respective seat. \u0022What do you do?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I make sure the Kerbalnauts follow their instructions,\u0022 the KSC staff member told him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Wow,\u0022 Jeb said. He soon ran up to another desk, and another, and another, until his father told him to look at the big television screen on the wall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Look, son! They\u0027re launching a rocket now!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb was watching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The bottom of the rocket is the only functional part.

But then, later on, make your father proud and go there!\u0022 his father enthusiastically told his son.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb looked at the screen as the rocket took off and soared into the sky.

In preparation for the first Kerpollo launch, Kerpollo 1, a test rehearsal was held on the launchpad. A spark inside the capsule lit the highly flammable oxium gas inside on fire, burning the 3 brave Kerbalnauts, who quickly died. They respawned soon after, though. Still, respawning costs money, and KASA was not happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Kerman!

It had a dog inside. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe camera switched to the window. Outside, the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So, they weren\u0027t bluffing!,\u0022 his father yelled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Correct.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Let\u0027s get to work.

Maybe not with Kerbalnauts so we don\u0027t lose any more and have \u003Cem\u003ETHIS\u003C/em\u003E happen again, and maybe without them! Like the Kerblets\u0027 remote-control toy rockets, but now on a huge scale!
