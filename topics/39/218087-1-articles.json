Well, close to a hundred times\u2026\u201D He closed the door and quickly ran down the hallway, opening another, equally grand door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWoah,\u201D Audrae gasped, in awe at the massive focusing lens in the ceiling of the ornately decorated lecture hall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey use this place to teach Stonewielding when the Mun is high,\u201D Keenan said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Mun isn\u2019t there, though!\u201D Audrae responded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, I was thinking we did something else,\u201D Keenan responded as he stepped out into the middle of the room beneath the lens. Minmus glittered, so far away, but the lens allowed its light to illuminate the focal area as bright as the full Mun. Keenan raised his hands, absorbing the essence from Minmus above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2026 You are a friction wielder?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI prefer the term Minmar,\u201D Keenan admitted. \u201CFriction wielder, you know, sounds like a supider version of friction stir welding, so uh\u2026 Come!\u201D Audrae walked forward, and then promptly slipped around, nearly falling, before Keenan steadied her. \u201CWatch!\u201D Keenan took a step and glided smoothly across the floor with ease, coming to a stop near the middle of the illuminated area. \u201CIt\u2019s easy!\u201D Audrae stepped into the light, nervous, and took a step.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWoah!\u201D she said, as she slipped and fell, but Keenan caught her. \u201CYou said you were taking me ice skating!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, it sort of is, just without the ice!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery different feel, though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTake my hands, I want to show you something.\u201D They took each others hands and began spinning around in a circle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWoah, too fast!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry.\u201D Keenan turned on friction again gradually and they stopped. \u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s just\u2026 I feel so overwhelmed\u2026 That was fun, I\u2019m just\u2026 Keenan, we aren\u2019t supposed to be here!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s not like we are stealing Bop essence, or anything! It\u2019s everyone\u2019s moonlight, we are just making use of an\u2026 underutilized facility!\u201D There was a sudden sound of footsteps from the hall. Keenan\u2019s face froze in panic. \u201CHide!\u201D He took Audrae\u2019s hand and pulled her behind one of the rows of seats. Two men entered the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI told you they would find us!\u201D said Audrae.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHold on, is that Larenco Kerman, the head of the Airwielding department?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes\u2026 And is that\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C2,000 tons of Gilly rock,\u201D spoke the other man, \u201CDistilled into four grams of the finest Gilly essence available.\u201D He held up a small vial of glowing brown liquid.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGilly essence?\u201D whispered Audrae. \u201CHow could he?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat hasn\u2019t been legal here since before the Jool war!\u201D said Keenan as he maneuvered to get a better look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMagnificent,\u201D replied Larenco as he held up the vial in the dim light of Minmus. \u201CThe usual payment, I assume?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, that will suffice, but next time, it will be more\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can\u2019t keep doing this, Larry, they are tightening their security every day.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThose selfish pricks. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to bleed Gilly dry like they say we will.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe money, Larenco.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, of course. Let me test it, first\u2026\u201D Larenco slotted the vial into position on his custom essence gauntlet, briefly focused, and leapt to the top of the high ceiling, nearly hitting the lens in the process, and landing gracefully. \u201CPhenomenal\u2026 You will find seven million credits have been transferred to your account, as per our agreement.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSeven million credits!\u201D Keenan gasped. \u201CAudrae, we can\u2019t stand for this!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust let it go, Keenan,\u201D pleaded Audrae.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGilly is losing millions of tons a year!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeenan!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got to report this!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike the authorities will do anything!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell then, I\u2019ll take matters into my own hands!\u201D Larenco once again held out the vial of Gilly essence. Keenan felt the desks\u2026 Made of wood. Perfect. He wielded the wood, and used it to forcibly launch himself across the room. Both men turned to look, but before they could do much, Keenan shot into the light of Minmus and dropped the friction of Larenco\u2019s hands to zero. The vial fell out of his hands, and into Keenan\u2019s as he slid across the now frictionless floor. In a fraction of a second, he bent the wood of another desk into handcuffs, binding the arms of the two men, at the same time, reducing the friction of the ground beneath them to zero so they could not escape. One of them immediately fell over, but Larenco retained his balance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcuse me?\u201D asked Larenco.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSomething tells me this wasn\u2019t obtained legitimately,\u201D remarked Keenan as he held up the vial of Gilly essence. \u201CYou have ten seconds to tell me where you got this from.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh\u2026 Gilly?\u201D replied the shadowy figure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLarenco stood, almost as if he was amused. \u201CYou would dare challenge a quadruple master?\u201D Larenco began to Lifewield, mangling his handcuffs into daggers, which he levitated in front of him, pointed at Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou would dare steal Essence from Gilly?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLook\u2026 I was like you, once, all righteous and what not, but the real world doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLarenco, think about how many people look up to you\u2026 I looked up to you!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re a fine Lifewielder and an even finer Minmar, it would be a shame for you to meet your end, so young, as a bloodstain on the floor. Now give me the vial, and you can walk away, and we can forget this all happened. I\u2019ll even throw in a scholarship, how about that?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeenan froze for a second, and hesitated, before stepping forwards, holding out the vial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, Keenan lunged forward, conjuring up fists of wood, propelled by perfect grip, before being struck backwards by a blast of air from Larenco, as his gauntlet glowed purple. Keenan fell onto the ground, now out of the light of Minmus, desperately trying to get to his feet, only to find out that Larenco had de-frictioned the surface, and now it was he that could not move. Larenco\u2019s gauntlet flashed gray as the stone floor curled up around Keenan, fixing him in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLarenco stepped closer, towering over him. Keenan tried to form a wooden shield, but Larenco effortlessly shattered it. \u201CYou would throw away your life,\u201D proclaimed Larenco as he seized the essence vial from Keenan, \u201CFor this?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s all you are doing, isn\u2019t it??? The people of Gilly won\u2019t stand for this!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, please, a thousand square miles and they don\u2019t even bother slowing the smugglers down.\u201D Larenco popped the vial into his gauntlet before destroying the other man\u2019s handcuffs without even turning around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLarenco, I looked up to you! How could you!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNow as much as I don\u2019t want to do this\u2026 We can\u2019t have any loose lips laying around, can we? Arthur?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, sir, loose lips sink spaceships\u2026\u201D said the other man as he approached, unholstering a revolver. \u201CLoose hips need replacing, and, uh, what was the other one?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh for Pol\u2019s sake, just shoot him already!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlease! Help! Anyone! I don\u2019t want to die!\u201D shouted Keenan as he struggled, to no avail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s nothing personal,\u201D Arthur said as he took aim at Keenan\u2019s head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDad, don\u2019t!\u201D shouted Audrae as she ran out from behind the front row of desks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAudrae?\u201D he asked. \u201CWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t kill him, dad! Please! We were just here to skate, that\u2019s all!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI swear to Pol, if the janitors forget to lock these doors ONE more time!\u201D scoffed Larenco, annoyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is the guy you\u2019re seeing?\u201D asked Arthur. Audrae nodded in tears. \u201C...Well I can\u2019t say I see why. Larry, I can\u2019t kill him. Not in front of my daughter.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLarenco sighed. \u201CWhy can\u2019t it ever be simple for once? Okay, look. You. Get out of here. I better not see you again. Ever. Don\u2019t apply here. If you mention any of this to anyone - no matter who - I will not hesitate to wield you to the Mun and back eight different ways. If I catch a glimpse of your face ever again, you are dead. Do you understand?\u201D Keenan nodded, in terror.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd one more thing,\u201D began Arthur, \u201CI may not be a fancy-pants wielder like the rest of you, but you will eat lead if I catch you anywhere near my daughter again.

Nothing happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI told you you needed glasses,\u201D Mia said as she prodded Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI do not!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s, uh, my first time trying this,\u201D Keenan said. \u201CI wasn\u2019t able to do it, I can\u2019t do it\u2026 And then he threw a rock at me and I\u2026 I did it! But I don\u2019t know how.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s so cool!\u201D said Lawrece.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBig deal, you hallucinated him levitating a rock.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, uh, by the way, I got you a Mun rock.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...Thank you, Lawrence, that is very much appreciated.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere did you get the money for that, the ones at the visitor center are super expensive!\u201D demanded Mia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait, you mean we can\u2019t just pick them up off the ground? I thought only Gilly was strict about that!\u201D said Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLawrence, you have had this job for, what, two years now?\u201D said Mia. \u201CYou should know that by now! This is like that time you tried to lick the Minmus flats!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI mean, no big deal, I can put it back!\u201D Keenan said. \u201CIf it\u2019s illegal, I want no part in it. Wait, we get to go to Minmus?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh, we\u2019ve got company,\u201D said Lawrence. Mia looked out the window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s the Mun Brigade,\u201D she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMan, looks like they take rock theft seriously. Let\u2019s get out of here!\u201D said Lawrence as he pivoted to the intercom. \u201CLllllladies and gentlemen, plants, animals, plantimals, pals, gals, and - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFor Pol, just skip it!\u201D Mia demanded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPrepare for liftoff in three! Two! One!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLiftoff!\u201D shouted Keenan enthusiastically as he gripped the back of Lawrence\u2019s seat. Nothing happened for a few awkward seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re not even on the launch pad yet, you doofuses,\u201D Mia said. There was a knock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can\u2019t go back to jail!\u201D shouted Lawrence as he hid behind a chair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CListen, Keeny-Weeny, you\u2019re taking the fall for this, I\u2019m gonna go make the engines look like they are in spec.

Keenan stood alone for a few seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight. Here goes.\u201D Keenan walked into the passenger compartment, took a deep breath, and re-opened the passenger door, coming face to face with two Mun Brigade officials. \u201CGood evening, officers.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAfternoon, actually,\u201D spoke the taller one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight. Mun time, I forgot.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell isn\u2019t it evening somewhere?\u201D asked the shorter one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShut up. Anyway, sir, I\u2019m afraid we must be short - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll shut up if you shut up about my height!\u201D shouted the shorter one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh for Bop, not again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes again!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnyway, we\u2019ve been tracking a dangerous Tylan Pentaloger by the name of Sylvus Kerman.\u201D he gave Keenan a photograph of a dark silhouette of a Kerbal holding a gravity scepter. \u201CIt\u2019s a long shot, but we were wondering if you had any information.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight then. If you do run into him, do not engage.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat is he doing?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe is going around killing allied masters, he\u2019s up to five now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKilling masters? But like\u2026 Only masters can kill masters!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCorrection. Master pentaloger.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA Master pentaloger? Aren\u2019t there only a few of those?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCorrect.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy would he do anything like that?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBeats me,\u201D said the taller one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell it is obviously the Joolian radiation!\u201D said the short one. \u201CThose Joolians are off their rocker, they have been since long before the war.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStop spreading that nonsense, please\u2026 Anyways, we should go.

Have a great day.\u201D The two officers turned their backs and Keenan closed the door, then walked back to the cockpit. The Cassandra was now rolling out to the takeoff pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, we are going to need a new flight attendant,\u201D said Mia. \u201CAgain.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIs that a new record for the shortest lived one?\u201D asked Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, there was Frank,\u201D replied Mia. \u201CHe only lasted under a half of one trip.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGuys, I\u2019m right here,\u201D Keenan announced. They both jumped and turned around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeenan! I thought you got arrested?\u201D Mia exclaimed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNah, they just wanted to know if we had seen a wanted criminal.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA known rock thief?\u201D snickered Mia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, actually.\u201D Keenan presented the wanted flyer. \u201CThis Sylvus dude, a master Pentaloger.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou mean \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E Sylvus Kerman?\u201D Lawrence said in fear and awe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019ve heard of him?\u201D Keenan asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, please, he won\u2019t shut up about wielding this, wielding that, day in and day out, every single trip to the Mun and back,\u201D Mia stated as she rolled her eyes. \u201CIt gets really, really old, really, really, fast.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe only things that don\u0027t get old are the Gillians!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re not funny, Lawrence.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou probably don\u2019t even know what a Pentaloger is, Mia! Anyway, Sylvus is one of the top fifty or so most powerful wielders ever, master of five bodies and practitioner of several more, at least four, possibly as many as seven, but nobody knows because he is so mysterious, and - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLawrence. The takeoff.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight.\u201D Lawrence pivoted to the intercom and began his long spiel as Mia talked to ground control. The \u003Cem\u003ECassandra\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was effortlessly lifted off of the ground by the team of Munar stonewielders and propelled faster and faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeenan, check the back, see if they have those chicken sandwich things, I\u2019m hungry\u201D asked Mia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd honey mustard,\u201D said Lawrence, \u201CLots of it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe really likes his honey mustard,\u201D added Mia. \u201CLike, take the maximum sane amount, and triple it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRoger.\u201D Keenan left the cockpit, climbing down the floor mounted ladder due to the odd acceleration, towards the rear cargo hold. On the way he surveyed the passengers. Only about \u2155 of the seats were full. As he climbed, he noticed a man in a flannel jacket, sleeping, a young Kerbal reading comic books, and a nervous looking man carrying a briefcase chained to his arm, among others. They made eye contact and he clutched the suitcase harder. Before Keenan could ponder this further, he was suddenly forcibly grabbed by the shoulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcuse me!\u201D shouted a well dressed woman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEasy there, you almost knocked me off the ladder!\u201D retorted Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBack talk! I\u2019ll have you fired! Don\u2019t you know who I am?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf I knew who you were, you probably wouldn\u2019t be flying Grey Dwarf, would you?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow dare you! I\u2019ll say, this place is disgusting, the service is awful, and there is no atmosphere!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, the \u003Cem\u003ECassandra\u003C/em\u003E rapidly decompressed with a loud bang as the port side wall was ripped to shreds. Keenan gripped the wall in terror, screaming. Had the maintenance gotten that bad? This couldn\u2019t be the end already!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, it wasn\u2019t the maintenance! A dark, shadowy figure levitated through the hole in the hull, beams of light radiating from his fingertips, brandishing an ornate, jagged scepter - with a miniature black hole at its tip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbruptly, the hull breach sealed and the atmosphere returned. \u201CSYLVUS!\u201D shouted the suitcase man, who had brandished a gauntlet, glowing purple and gray.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNothing personal, old friend, but you have some information I need.\u201D Sylvus brandished his scepter, and a roar of energy reverberated around the ship. One Kerbal tried to jump him, but was instantly devoured into the singularity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMia had turned the evacuation lights on, but nobody moved for the emergency helmets - they were all screaming, frozen in fear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe suitcase man\u2019s gauntlet lit up in a rainbow as he attempted to defend the Pentaloger\u2019s onslaught, but it was not enough. \u201CYou will never take me alive, Sylvus!\u201D he shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat was never the idea, Master.\u201D Sylvus unleashed a massive blast of light from his right hand, blowing a hole in the Master, tearing his suitcase away, and causing a massive hull breach on the other side of the ship, sucking everyone out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeenan floated through the void, spinning, helpless, suffocating, but after a few seconds, strangely calm. \u201CSo this is the end, I guess\u2026\u201D he thought. \u201CI always wanted to go to the Mun, I guess it will just be a little bit faster than expected.\u201D The edges of his vision faded to black.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n===\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey, Keenan! Wake up!\u201D shouted Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUgh\u2026 I had such a bad dream\u2026 AHAHHAHAHHAH WHERE IS MY HELMET?!?!?!?\u201D panicked Keenan as he sat up, covered in dust, on the Munar surface\u2026 Indeed without a helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COk, calm down.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLIKE THAT EVER HELPED ANYONE CALM DOWN!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe\u2019s right,\u201D said Mia, \u201CWe\u2019re, like, totally screwed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COk, so, uh, this is Samantha Rae, Evian Poet, practitioner of Gaseous Wielding.\u201D Lawrence gestured to a Kerbal a few meters away, both arms extended, eyes shut, deep in concentration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHi, Sam-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDON\u2019T! She needs to concentrate. She\u2019s gathering all of the oxygen that spilled out from the ship and putting it into spheres around our heads so we can breathe.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh is that how we can talk too? Is she making air tunnels between us too?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMan, that\u2019s got to require some serious concentration.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhich is why you should not wave at her, touch her, or talk to her, she\u2019ll lose concentration and we\u2019ll all depressurize, and it has happened five times already and it\u0027s just not fun, alright?\u201D Lawrence pleaded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s busted!\u201D shouted Mia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s busted?\u201D asked Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis distress beacon. The oxygen equipment, the whole lot. I\u2019m going to kill my boss if I don\u2019t die first\u2026 Unlikely, as Sammy here only has about twenty minutes of Eve essence left.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo uh\u2026 How did we, you know, live?\u201D asked Keenan. Lawrence\u2019s eyes lit up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo like that master guy, master Mkar, after he was hit by the Joolian radiation beam, he used his last bit of energy to completely blast us with life energy, rendering us temporarily invulnerable! Unfortunately, only about half of us made it. But you should have seen it, it was so cool!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMaster Mkar? That looked nothing like him\u2026 How do you know it was him?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis.\u201D Lawrence held up a half destroyed suitcase. \u201CLooks like Sylvus found what he wanted and left the rest. Had his name on it. Most of its contents are gone, but we were able to recover some letters and a lot, and I mean a LOT, of essence vials, hence why Sam here can keep us alive.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh yay, we have enough Eeloo juice to freeze a star, the only problem is that NOBODY HERE KNOWS HOW TO FROSTWIELD!\u201D shouted Mia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMia, shouting won\u2019t get us anywhere.

Nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe tried harder, pumped his entire being into the ice as the vial glowed ever brighter.

This story has been in the works for a long time, just over a year and a half if I remember correctly, things just kept getting in the way. This was originally inspired by two things. One, I had recently seen some of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and two, I was wondering how the Kerbals would handle magic, in particular how they would balance using Magic or technology, as in most stories, one tends to dominate, you rarely see both being used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith those inspirations in mind, I set out to create my own twist on the traditional elemental magic system, set in the Kerbal universe. I came up with this, a slightly dystopian arrangement, where technology and magic are balanced twofold. First, Kerbalkind didn\u0027t discover anything was amiss until they reached the Mun, at which point they already had some technology. Second, due to the inverse square nature of said magic, you cannot make general purpose or deep space vehicles using magic and have it still be cost effective, necessitating magic-tech hybrids for specialized purposes, and technology only ships for general purpose use. I hope that I can deliver installments in a timely manner (which, given my track record, is, well...), and I hope that you enjoy the story!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-19T15:34:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2023 03:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 19\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Ultimate Steve\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-02T18:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s been ages since I read any Kerbal stories - looks like this is a good time to remedy that!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the magic system, and I really liked the \u003Cem\u003ECassandra \u003C/em\u003Elanding scene.

The nefarious spaceship was now mere kilometers from the Mohian surface, close enough to effectively wield. She watched as the slaves placed their hands against the expansion tubes. The central chambers began to glow a dull red, and water was pumped through them, boiling to steam, heating, and being expelled out of the nozzle at the rear of the ship. The wielders, lacking any proper staging setup, had arranged themselves so that the weakest ones were closest to the front of the engine, providing some small amount of mercy to those unable to handle the temperatures the engine demanded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone on board felt the acceleration as the abhorrent ship surged into Moho orbit on the wings of magical steam. A few minutes later, the ship began its final descent to the Mohian surface, steering slightly to one side or the other to account for inconsistent temperatures across the chamber\u0027s width, before deploying its landing gear and gently touching down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo sooner had the ship touched down than a tunnel was connected to the airlock, and everyone on board was prodded up the ladder, through the airlock, through the tunnel, and into the connected building. One by one they were given a quick, fairly dehumanizing once over as armed guards watched, were given a form and a pen, and were crammed shoulder width apart into a rickety elevator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMia?\u201D asked Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re going to get out of this, right?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course we are!\u201D said Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wasn\u2019t asking you, Keenan, you have no idea how this world works.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, we\u2019re screwed,\u201D said Mia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t be so negative!\u201D snapped Sam. \u201CI for one am going to see Eve, my home again, if it is the last thing I do!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe forms,\u201D said Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey want to know our skills,\u201D said Mia. \u201CLie your socks off.

The windowless vehicle drove ever deeper into the crust of Moho, through several elevators, further and further away from the sunlight. The drive felt like hours, and very well may have been. Keenan attempted to memorize the route inertially, but gave up after the fifth - or was it the sixth elevator?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re mad at me for the spelling error,\u201D whispered Mia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m not mad at you at all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou wanted to use me to get out of the mines and I dragged you down deeper.

I\u2019ve been down here ten years. If you want a shot at living that long, listen up!\u201D The new miners looked up attentively. \u201COur rockhead, for some inexplicable reason, has been obsessed with digging as deep as possible and won\u2019t tell us why. We\u2019re getting close though, we\u2019re a hundred kilometers down. Most of us think it\u2019s about the money. Moho\u2019s core is expected to be one of the greatest deposits of iron known to Kerbalkind. Whoever reaches that molten layer first will be the richest man in the Kerbolar system. Well, not us. Whoever reaches that molten layer first will probably burn alive.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf we are a hundred kilometers down, and the core is within spitting distance, why are we not, well, burning alive already?\u201D asked Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSpeak for yourself,\u201D said one Kerbal, who was obviously going crazy from the heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe main vertical elevator shaft also serves as a massive geothermal power plant. That single artery is responsible for removing heat from the air of the mine, powering all of the mine\u2019s equipment, and extracting rock from the mine, which we think is refined into pure essence topside, but nobody here has ever seen it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNobody?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNobody. Only other thing we know about the top of that hundred kilometer long shaft is that it\u2019s incredibly prone to breaking. Whenever we break into a new cavern, which is inevitably a vacuum, of course, the pressure differential breaks something in the airlock, which causes all of the air to rush out into space, until, of course, the emergency shutoff is closed after an hour or so.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo everyone here suffocates every few weeks?\u201D panicked one Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, we are hooked, very loosely, into the main reservoir of Thermis Colania. It would take weeks to completely deplete it. The worst we get is a lot of wind and some ear popping. Besides, the rocks here are really close to liquid, so we don\u2019t tend to get voids this low.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPhew\u2026 Wait - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCause of death number one. Heat exhaustion and dehydration. Those of you doing the high temperature work will get suits, which, well, sometimes work. Everyone else, drink as much water as you can before leaving for the day. The canteens they give you are not enough. Scavenge any other containers you can find, and on your break, be sure to stock up.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCause of death number two. Rocks. When working on the elevator face, keep your hard hat on and keep yourself under the roof. There\u2019s a hundred kilometers of largely unclad rock above us, and although the rocks will be at terminal velocity by then, that is still fast. With how badly we are messing with Moho\u2019s thermal gradient, all that expansion and contraction, rocks fall often. Don\u2019t be the next one to get hit by one.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCause of death number three. Rocklung. Always wear your mask. Rock dust in your lungs is a horrible, slow way to go. Some places have the heart to ship you off on a Kerbin flyby every few years to patch you up\u2026 Not this place. Those of you who came from Kerbin. You\u2019re a lot more mortal than you were before. Act like it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHas anyone ever escaped from here?\u201D Mia asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHaha, that\u2019s a good one! I\u2019ve seen dozens try, not a single one has. When I\u2019m mining, I think about it. Haven\u2019t thought of a single thing that would work yet. I\u2019m convinced it is impossible.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNothing is impossible,\u201D said Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTell that to the rock! Think about it. We\u2019re a hundred kilometers underground. First of all you have to ride the elevator back to camp, get past all of the check ins, gates, guards, and guns. If you manage that, you have to get into the guard\u2019s elevator and go up through the dozens of abandoned camps before this. That elevator is controlled from up top, there\u2019s checkpoints, and it\u2019s small, there\u2019s no way you are getting up there unnoticed. If you do manage to get out of this rockhead\u2019s compound and into Moho proper, a few hundred kilometers of passage, cavern, and elevator separate us from any large spaces we could blend in with the freefolk in. Dozens of choke points, checkpoints, and gunpoints. Moho\u2019s economy is built on one thing, metal, and that\u2019s what you will be full of if you get in its way.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat about the main rock elevator?\u201D Keenan asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey control it, not us. You can sneak onto it, I guess. Several have tried, but then what? You\u2019re tossed straight into the essence machine, in the topside vacuum, with no spacesuit. Dead. Anyway, enough rambling. You start now, pulling down loose rocks as the main drill descends. The roof doesn\u2019t extend that far, so keep your head up.

Expensive ways.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat about the wielding?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, I dabbled in the Duniks, but nothing really caught on, you know? I can do a little bit of Thermonics, watch this!\u201D The guard pulled out a paper clip and held it between his fingertips and focused very hard for a few seconds. Nothing visually appeared to happen. \u201CTake this!\u201D he said. Lawrence grabbed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COw!\u201D he instantly dropped it. \u201CThat\u2019s pretty hot!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIndeed. Not enough to be useful, but it is pretty warm. I was never the greatest in wielding, so I\u0027m not exactly great at it... But hey, it\u0027s something! What about you? How did you get here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike you, I wanted to see the worlds\u2026 I was a starship pilot\u2026 Well, calling it a starship is a bit of a stretch\u2026 And saying I piloted it is also a bit of a stretch... I got stuck going to and from the Mun, occasionally Minmus, in this deathtrap called the \u003Cem\u003ECassandra\u003C/em\u003E\u2026 Mia, the engineer, and I, pulled so many shenanigans trying to keep that hunk of metal operational.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMia? Were you two\u2026?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, not at all\u2026 I think she bounces between hating my guts and secretly being glad I was there. As much as I hate to admit it sometimes, She\u2019s a good teammate.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow did you go from starship pilot to here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe ship blew up, like eight people saved my life, and next thing I know, I\u2019m here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo why don\u2019t you go back?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...I\u2019m sorry?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe pay here sucks, you have the qualifications.

From one guard to another, I don\u0027t actually like this job at all, but, well... What am I supposed to do?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo you get paid pennies to keep slaves in an underground trauma sauna, and you spend those pennies on illegally imported wine from a planet that banned most trade specifically because of their stances on slavery?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSame as you, down to the wine. I\u2019m not proud of it, but if I think about it too much I get too sad to do anything at all.\u201D Lawrence stood there doing his best to contain his rage\u2026 He had a choice between maintaining his accidental perfect cover, and possibly helping a lot of people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey\u2026 What\u2019s your name?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRitani, of Laythe.

No war, much wine. No slaves, much serenity. No poverty, much peace\u2026 It\u2019s a shame it can\u2019t happen everywhere.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy not?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know why. You\u2019ve been talking my ears off about everything this entire elevator ride down\u2026 You can\u2019t not know why.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSome have it easier, yeah. That\u2019s not a reason not to try. Some of the people who try the hardest aren\u2019t the ones at the top. Their efforts may not get them as far\u2026 But nobody\u2019s going anywhere without trying.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...I suppose you\u2019re right about that\u2026 And I suppose it is about time I cut down a little bit on the wine.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright well, this is my stop.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re mistaken, this is the old base camp, not base camp, I\u2019m pretty sure this is off limits.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe archivists asked me to clear up some discrepancies in the records. Not sure why it matters, frankly, it\u2019s not like anyone uses this place anyways, I\u2019m just as confused as you are.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey\u2019re crazy, that\u2019s what they are\u2026 Anyway, see you Lawrence.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSee you, Ritani.\u201D The door to the elevator opened and a blast of hot air rushed in. \u201CWow, that\u2019s hot.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd the sky is black.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight. Goodbye.\u201D Lawrence stepped out of the guard elevator into the massive chasm that formerly housed the second base camp. The elevator door closed behind him and Ritani descended further into the lower crust of Moho. Lawrence, sweating profusely, began walking through the abandoned camp, searching for one specific building - the guard complex, the one so much air was being pumped into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe picked the lock (To someone with a fraction of Lawrence\u2019s downtime, all locks are but an inconvenience), and let himself in\u2026 Strange. Fortunately, the air conditioning was still functional\u2026 He was about to leave it at that, disappointed, just someone leaving the air conditioning on, but then he realized there was no rock dust on the ground. He cautiously crept through the rest of the building, armed only with a flashlight, checking every nook and cranny specified on the diagrams he had memorized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere! That wasn\u2019t on the diagrams! A strong, reinforced door, cutting off the recreation cavern from the rest of the building\u2026 Normally that would be a normal door\u2026 But why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot wanting to alert anyone on the other side, Lawrence instead brought over a chair and entered one of the ventilation ducts, this particular set having been carved out of solid rock, and would not make extreme amounts of noise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter crawling for far longer than indicated by the diagrams, Lawrence neared a half opened vent, and cautiously peered over the edge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe gasped at the sight of a thermon unlike any other he had seen before\u2026 It was not unheard of for thermons to become altered after years of their craft, to grow impervious to the heat and have their skin turn half to stone\u2026 But this, was something more. Easily four times the size of a normal Kerbal, with muscles of rock, hunched up inside a cage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd just beyond the thermon was a gigantic lens, a narrow walkway leading to its focus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a clang as a door opened and five Kerbals walked out. Two scientists, two guards, and one man in chains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLet me go!\u201D shouted the man in chains. \u201CYou\u2019re this close to the core, why bother? You already know what will happen!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell it\u2019s not proper science if you can\u2019t replicate the results!\u201D chirped one of the scientist. \u201CBesides, you know too much. Sorry about this.\u201D The two guards forced the prisoner onto a platform and began strapping his arms and legs in with multi layered heavy metal cuffs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re going to make me into one of THOSE THINGS and all you can do is offer a \u201CSorry?!?!?!?\u201D\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s not like I can change the boss\u2019s mission, only complete it, and you have been standing in the way for far too long.\u201D She fiddled with a control panel and the platform the man was strapped to began moving slowly towards the focal point of the lens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou are standing with one hand on Pandora\u2019s box, you know,\u201D he said. \u201CYou can still stop it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA new age of magic awaits us, we can\u2019t let Jool get there first.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, we\u2019ve got to get nukes before they do! Where have I heard that before? What good have nukes done for us? Such secrets are better left undiscovered. If what we\u2019ve theorized is correct\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen we will win the coming war.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe loser dies on the street, the winner dies in the ambulance.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy do you even bother talking to the test subjects?\u201D said the other scientist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMonologuing is fun, you know,\u201D she responded. Lawrence stared wide eyed in fright as the moving platform stopped in the middle of the lens\u2026 And nothing happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow long did you put the last guy in for?\u201D the prisoner asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, three weeks, give or take.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a tremendous crash as the western wall of the compound erupted and collapsed. The room filled with dust, and the scientists and guards all screamed and ran. Lawrence gasped, and very nearly screamed, when several of what appeared to be - Lava monsters??? - burst through the opening in the wall, and marched towards the caged thermon. One of the guards emptied their machine gun into the lead monster, but it just uttered a battlecry marched forward, undeterred. The frightened guard ran away, through the blast doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe monsters grabbed hold of the bars of the cage, nearly instantly heated them until they glowed orange, and shoved them out of the way, freeing the caged thermon, and as soon as they had arrived, they had disappeared back through the wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLawrence, seeing his chance to learn the answers he sought, kicked open the vent, and due to the low gravity, was able to jump down onto the lens, and up to the shackled man. Lawrence began undoing the buckles that held him in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, thank you, I thought I was toast!\u201D he said, breathing a massive sigh of relief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWho are you and what to you know about these things?\u201D Lawrence asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI am Doctor Tiberius Kerman, and we are here researching the singularity.\u201D Lawrence stopped, shocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe singularity? That\u2019s what this is about?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t stop, the guards may come back!\u201D Lawrence quickly continued undoing the man\u2019s restraints. \u201CMany have long wondered about the inverse square law of nature of magic, and whether the magic is an inherent property of the rocks, or if it exists as a point source at the center of the planet. Based on our research, it seems to be the latter.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo what happens if you reach the center?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s what we are trying to find out\u2026 But those\u2026 rock things\u2026 happen the closer we get. I decided what lies below is too much for Kerbalkind to handle.\u201D Dr. Tiberius stood up and jumped upwards towards the vent, but fell several feet short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI may not have thought the escape plan through,\u201D Lawrence said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen we follow them,\u201D he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait, so that thing in the cage was a Kerbal?\u201D Lawrence said as he began leaping towards the hole in the wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u201D he said. \u201CAt first they experimented with volunteers, then prisoners, and now, dissidents. Rapid permanent adoption of - \u201C There was a loud bang. Tiberius stumbled and fell just around the corner after the rock tunnel began. \u201COh no,\u201D whispered Tiberius.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne bullet isn\u2019t going to stop us,\u201D Lawrence said as he carried the Doctor deeper into the freshly blasted series of tunnels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey went this way!\u201D shouted a guard as he gave chase down the tunnel. Lawrence, who had long since dropped his flashlight in panic, ran as fast as he could down the tunnel. It got darker and darker, and soon he was feeling his way by his hand on the walls alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHere,\u201D weakly said Tiberius as he held up a strip of metal between his two fingers, heating it up, it began to dimly glow orange, providing not much light, but enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnwards they ran for several minutes until they emerged into a large cavern they could not see the other end of. They scrambled down a slope and hid behind a rock. They heard the guards emerge into the cavern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere did they go?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t know, but wherever they are, no way they\u2019d be able to find their way back in these mazes. If anyone asks, they\u2019re dead, got it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDeal.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs I was saying, those sandwiches you were talking about, in my opinion, are significantly overrated! Mayonnaise quality? Bop level. Those tomatoes are as bland as\u2026\u201D About thirty seconds passed as the guards\u0027 voices faded away into the darkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think they\u2019re gone,\u201D Lawrence whispered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood,\u201D said Tiberius. \u201CI, however, am unfortunately on my way,\u201D he said, gesturing to his gunshot wound. \u201CYou are from Kerbin, no?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u201D Lawrence said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAh, it\u2019s the face, isn\u2019t it?\u201D Tiberius smiled. \u201CHere,\u201D he said, \u201CHelp me out a little bit,\u201D and he held out a Kerbin essence ring. \u201CI can\u2019t lifewield myself, but you never know when such things come in handy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTiberius, I\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo on, do it!\u201D Tiberius weakly placed the ring directly onto Lawrence\u2019s right ring finger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTiberius, I\u2019m so sorry, I can\u2019t lifewield.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re from Kerbin and you can\u2019t lifewield?\u201D Tiberius said, puzzled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, only like a fifth of us do, and much fewer professionally!

If we can just find the mineshaft again, I can get you all fixed up!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have much time left. You must try.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut I - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLawrence, you must try.\u201D Lawrence gasped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow - How do you know my name?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou have a nametag, you nincompoop!\u201D Lawrence assumed the stance of the most popular lifewielding form and touched Tiberius\u2019 chest. The essence ring began to glow green.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing happened. Lawrence tried another stance, also nothing. He desperately cycled through every single stance and form he knew with increasing frustration until the green light from the ring winked out and died.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTiberius, I\u2019m sorry,\u201D Lawrence said. \u201CIt\u2019s all gone.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAt least I\u2019m dying as me and not an accelerated thermon,\u201D Tiberius responded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI tried so hard, but - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou did want it that badly,\u201D Tiberius whispered. \u201CBadly enough to learn every single lifewielding stance in the books, and even some that aren\u2019t.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd nothing comes out.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy do you want to?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy do you want to be a wielder?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI grew up hearing stories of all of the things people do with their powers. I thought with powers like that I could make a difference in the world. I could make people happy, or at least less sad.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe all think we\u2019d be the good guy,\u201D Tiberius coughed. \u201CI certainly did... And in desperation you learned everything you could.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut no amount of \u00A0knowledge can make up for a lack of talent.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust as no knowledge can make up for a lack of wisdom. Unfortunately I learned that lesson much too late, and my colleagues did not appreciate that. So please, do me a favor, and be wise.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTiberius, you can\u2019t be\u2026 You are. Bop, you are. You can\u2019t be! I get all the way here, I want to know, please, Tiberius, tell me everything you know!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd all Tiberius did was hold up his necklace. Then his arm went limp, his thermonic lamp went dim, and his breathing ceased.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI just want to know what\u2019s going on,\u201D Lawrence cried. For a few minutes, he sat there, utterly confused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy should I waste tears over this guy\u2026 He\u2019s the one that turned people into lava monsters after all\u2026 I just wanted some answers.\u201D Lawrence reached out and felt the man\u2019s necklace that he had held up in his last moments. It had a chain and a spherical trinket at the end. He took it, and the empty essence ring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLawrence stood up and realized how dark it was. He had lost his bearings and couldn\u2019t figure out which way he had come from\u2026 Not that he would want to go back that way anyway\u2026 But he might have to given how if he did nothing, he would die of heat exhaustion in perhaps as little as a half hour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarting to panic, he looked around for any light source he could see. In the distance he saw a cluster of slowly moving dull red dots and began to run after them, stopping after only a few feet when he realized he could fall into a pit. He shuffled across the ground trying to catch up to the dots, carefully probing the ground for holes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some time he peered over one ledge, and there they were - the five lava monsters, and one artificially accelerated thermon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey!\u201D he shouted. The beings all turned around, as if startled. The largest one clenched its fists, and marched menacingly towards him, uttering a battlecry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, wait, please, I\u2019m not here to hurt you, I\u2019m just lost!\u201D The large one halted for a second, fist high in the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI just came down here to find the truth and rescue my friends.\u201D The large one cocked his head to the side. \u201CThey are slaves in Frannor\u2019s mine.\u201D All six of them recoiled at the sound of Frannor\u2019s name. \u201CI assume you guys hate him too. We were captured on the Mun, and they were sold to Frannor, and I was sold to Perrei.\u201D The second large one let out a guttural cry at the sound of Perrei\u2019s name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI was going to sneak them up the staff elevator and then escort a ransom to a passing ship to escape, but that isn\u2019t exactly going to plan\u2026 You guys wouldn\u2019t happen to know a way to a cooler place, would you?\u201D Two of the lava monsters looked at each other, then at the others. One of the smaller ones shrugged their shoulders. The largest one pondered for a moment and then made some gestures. The Thermon and the two dimmer lava monsters resumed their course, and the brightest two beckoned for Lawrence to join them and began walking another direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you so much,\u201D Lawrence said. \u201CHey, can I ask you a bunch of yes or no questions? I\u0027ve never met an accelerated thermon before, and I\u0027ve definitely never met a lava monster before, but I\u2019d be very interested in learning, and\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a loud explosion as a giant hole was blown in the wall of the lowest base camp. Slaves and guards alike turned to face the chaos. Most ran away, but the armed ones ran towards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, guys, but did you really have to do such a dramatic entrance, I just wanted cool air but - Oh. This is base camp. Well nice meeting you, are - Uh - \u201C The lava monsters began menacingly walking forwards into the base camp as the guards began firing on them. Their magmatic skin absorbed the blows almost effortlessly. They raised their arms and yelled as the guards began to grow fearful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CControl! There\u2019s a bunch of lava monsters here! Several times our heights! Yes, you heard me! LAVA MONSTERS! Everyone, fall back to the guard shack!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLawrence, get down!\u201D shouted Ritani as he pulled Lawrence back. \u201CWe need to get to the shack! What are these monsters?!?!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, this is awkward\u2026 Ritani, I need you to trust me, alright? Just stay with me and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere are LAVA MONSTERS!\u201D panicked Ritani as he raised his gun. Lawrence yanked it out of his shaking hands and ran forth alongside the creatures as the last few guards scurried into the fortress that was the guard shack. The doors sealed shut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, we\u2019re good, now let\u2019s - \u201C There was a loud thud as the creatures smashed the fists into the blast doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo! Stop! Bad lava dudes!\u201D shouted Lawrence. The bigger of the two creatures turned to face him and raised his hands in frustration and confusion. \u201CThey\u2019re a bunch of stonebrains, but at least some of them have been mislead! Not all of them are guilty enough to warrant death!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe smaller of the two reached out his arm and heated up the door until it was red hot, melting the locking mechanism and sealing it in place. He gave a nod, as if to say \u201CThey won\u2019t be a problem any more.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLawrence, what is the meaning of this?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m not a guard, I\u2019m a slave. I\u2019m here to break my friends out, and if you don\u2019t want to die, I\u2019d suggest that you - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m in, bro.\u201D Ritani tore the guard insignia from his uniform and threw his cap on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, that was easy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust take me with you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLawrence!\u201D shouted a familiar voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMia!\u201D Lawrence shouted as the two ran towards each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt took you long enough!\u201D Mia cackled with craziness, exhaustion, and poorly hidden joy. \u201CIt\u2019s hell down here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere\u2019s Lawrence?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn the core cavern, he was assigned an exploration shift in a heat suit.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got to find him.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow do you plan on getting out?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe staff elev\u2026 Oh. Well, we lost that option exactly when we lost our stealth. Good question.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou came all this way down here without a plan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI had a plan, but, well\u2026\u201D Lawrence broadly gestured to the lava monsters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh yeah, they seem metal as Bop, what\u2019s their deal?\u201D Mia asked nonchalantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI thought you didn\u2019t like my long stories about magic?\u201D Lawrence smirked. Mia was about to respond when there was a loud whooshing sound. They all looked to the shaft, and all of the dust from the explosion was now being sucked towards it at a rapid rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh no,\u201D said Ritani.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe shaft broke again,\u201D said Mia. \u201CThey\u2019ll have it back online in half an hour.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D Ritani\u2019s face went pale. \u201CThis is the plan for a large scale uprising. Open the shaft, close the vents, seal off every other exit, and drain all of the oxygen out.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat won\u2019t work,\u201D scoffed Lawrence. \u201CWe\u2019re a hundred kilometers underground, there would still be residual pressure from the gravity alone.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot enough of a pressure drop to take us to near vacuum, but enough to knock most of us out, give us brain damage, and they can take the rest of us with spacesuits.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut you guys hit the core!\u201D said Lawrence. \u201CThat massive reservoir I heard about!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey airlocked it,\u201D said Mia. \u201CAnd we didn\u2019t hit the core, just a cavern that is probably near lava.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo the only air coming in is from the hole we made,\u201D said Lawrence. \u201CThat\u2019s not wide enough, we need to widen it.\u201D The two lava monsters nodded and bounded off towards the hole in the wall in an attempt to widen it, but when they got close, the huge rush of air began sapping away their heat, and their lava began to dim. They both turned back. Their bodies twitched and their heads shook.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere\u2019s no getting close to that,\u201D said Mia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait a second\u2026 Are they\u2026 Never mind. What are we going to do, Mia?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell let\u2019s get to air. You hear that, all of you?\u201D she shouted to the miners surrounding them. \u201CEveryone, to the cavern!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTo the shaft!\u201D said Ritani. Ritani, Mia, Lawrence, and the two lava monsters all ran towards the main shaft, followed rapidly by the rest of the miners. A minute later, as the air thinned, they were there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow do we get down?\u201D shouted Mia over the roaring wind. \u201CWe can\u2019t jump, it is a full kilometer!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUse whatever you can as gloves,\u201D shouted Ritani, \u201CAnd we can slide down one of the thinner cables!\u201D The Kerbals did that, but the lava monsters instead just leapt straight over the edge, wall jumping off of the sides of the shaft, shaking loose cladding and rocks as they went.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI guess that\u2019s one way to do it, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to try that,\u201D Lawrence said as he stepped off the edge with his hands around a piece of cloth, around the cable. They slid down, and within a few minutes, they had reached a section of the shaft with all metal walls, where the cavern had been blocked off, with a door at the bottom. The drill was stopped shortly below this level. In small groups, all of the Kerbals cycled through the airlock, and emerged into the oxygenated, but extremely warm cavern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re safe,\u201D said Lawrence. \u201CUntil we cook alive, at least.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe still have no plan,\u201D Mia said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeenan will, he always does.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlways is just one time so far!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBetter than our track record. Does anyone here know where Keenan went?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey were exploring the east passage, they think the magma starts there!\u201D shouted one Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCan you lead me there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWithout a heat suit? Suicide!\u201D One of the lava - rock? Creatures roared and began bounding down the cave, gesturing for Lawrence to follow him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo you know these caves?\u201D Lawrence asked. The creature nodded. \u201CAlright.\u201D Lawrence began bounding after the monster, deeper and deeper into the lowest layers of Moho\u2019s crust. Onwards they bounded for minutes as the heat grew ever warmer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou,\u201D gasped Lawrence. \u201CYou\u2019re not a lava monster.\u201D The creature froze and turned around. \u201CSorry I thought that you were\u2026 You\u2019re also an accelerated thermon like the other one.\u201D The thermon nodded. \u201CAs you become more and more skilled with that, you become less and less sensitive to the heat, and this must be freezing for you\u2026 But that\u2019s no matter, you can just make heat yourself, right? No! You can\u2019t! You\u2019re not actually a thermon! You were just aged as one!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe creature bowed their head down in sadness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAll the visual effects of it, none of the actual magic\u2026 You can\u0027t wield! You know I can relate to that... I\u0027ve tried my whole life and I can\u0027t wield... That must be awful. A body forced upon you designed for ultimate magic, unable to be used.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe creature bowed their head even further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So you are using lava as a store of heat. That\u2019s why you looked like a lava monster, and that\u2019s how you are able to break into places! That\u0027s very noble of you, escaping and breaking all of the others out.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother nod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s your name?\u201D The creature knelt down and traced some letters out on the ground. D-A-I-S-E-Y.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDaisey Kerman. I\u2019m Lawrence, thank you for your help and it has been a pleasure to meet you.\u201D Daisy cried out in triumph, and beckoned Lawrence to follow her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re right, we don\u2019t have much time left!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA minute later, both of them rounded a corner and were met by a massive blast of heat. Lawrence shielded his eyes and breathed through his damp shirt as he saw it - a figure silhouetted against a dim orange river of lava.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot lava - the uppermost layer of Moho\u0027s outer core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeenan!\u201D shouted Lawrence. The figure turned around and jumped back in surprise. \u201CCareful, you\u2019re on a cliff!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLawrence!\u201D shouted Keenan\u2019s muffled voice from inside the suit. \u201CAnd company?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is Daisey, my friend. Long story.\u201D Daisey jogged past both of them and waded into the Magma, yelling out a cry of relief, swimming across the river, eventually disappearing into another cave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLawrence, what are you doing here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTrying to rescue you. Samantha\u2019s being ransomed in as little as half an hour, but things went badly and they have vented the main shaft, it is probably inhospitable by now. Everyone is trapped in this cavern, slowly overheating, but nobody is suffocating. We don\u2019t know what to do. You\u2019re clever, you can think of something!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can try. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201D Both Lawrence and Keenan turned back the way they came, but were stopped by a cry from Daisey. They turned around just in time to see her throw something across the lava river.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLawrence went back to pick it up, but dropped it after a second as it was really hot. \u201COw! Keenan, can you?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSure.\u0022 Keenan took the object in his gloved hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre you coming with us, Daisey?\u201D Daisey shook her head no, waved goodbye, and ran back into the cave she had come out of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLawrence, you\u2019re not in good shape, we need to run.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight,\u201D coughed Lawrence. He began bounding along. Keenan led with his flashlight, and Lawrence followed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeenan, what is that thing?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt looks like a ring\u2026 Very crudely forged. Probably made of iron or an iron alloy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAn essence ring?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, those have linear holders usually, as per the standard\u2026 If this one has anything, they are internal. It\u2019s just a ring.\u201D A few minutes later, the two arrived back at the base, finding everyone there in rough shape, and the other accelerated thermon missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeenan!\u201D shouted Mia. \u201CWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh, let me see\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe\u2019s been talking up your skills this whole time!\u201D said another Kerbal. \u201CYou got this!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, Keenan, you\u2019ve got this!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHold on, I\u2019m thinking\u2026\u201D Keenan thought long and hard for the next minute or two. \u201CThe only way out of here is the guard elevator. That\u2019s melted shut, and all of the thermons are gone, and there\u2019s not enough oxygen anyway\u2026 I\u2019ve got nothing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo!\u201D shouted Ritani. \u201CDon\u2019t give up!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGreat words from one of the guys who kept me enslaved down here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeenan, he\u2019s cool, he\u2019s on our side now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey beat me, Lawrence, and while he wasn\u2019t one of the ones to do it, he was perfectly fine standing there watching.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat could I have done?\u201D snapped Ritani. \u201CTaken down the entire class system by myself? I can\u2019t even guard properly, I didn\u2019t even question whether or not Lawrence was a guard and just let him waltz down here!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLook, everyone here hates your guts, Ritz Crackers,\u201D said Mia, \u201CBut we can do apologies and revenge later, do you have any ideas?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CQuestion your beliefs, question the axioms,\u201D Ritani said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou decided to not question your role in this slavery because, quote, it made you too sad!\u201D protested Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI did question it, and society wouldn\u0027t humor my answer,\u0022 Ritani snapped. \u0022So please, just humor me this once.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAxiom: The door has melted shut. They specifically don\u2019t let thermons down here, so no getting through that, and our friends are gone!\u201D shouted Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeep going.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAxiom: There is not enough air out there to breathe for long durations. We have no oxygen equipment, and we can\u2019t hold our breath for a kilometer of climbing. I\u2019m not sure if anyone here is an airwielder, but either way we have no Eve essence.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI knew I should have asked Sam for her ring.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeep on.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAxiom: We can\u2019t survive here for very long in this heat. We have a frostwielder to help, but no essence.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTrue.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAxiom: The guard elevator is the only way out.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere\u2019s also the hundred and one kilometer shaft,\u201D said Mia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CClimbing would be impossible,\u201D said Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut we could fly,\u201D whispered the foreman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo we have any way to destroy this metal segment of the shaft so air can flow freely from this cavern?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe ring!\u201D said Keenan and Lawrence simultaneously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe what?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDaisey, well, the lava not-monster, gave us a really weird essence ring,\u201D said Lawrence. \u201CIt might not be an essence ring, but what else could it be but a Moho essence ring?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA normal ring,\u201D said one of the Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022An engagement ring?\u0022 teased Mia. \u0022Did you get proposed to by a lava monster? Hey, I\u0027m not gonna judge!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe isn\u0027t a lava monster, Mia, she is a victim of a twisted experiment! Is anyone here a thermon?\u201D asked Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLarry the cucumber, they don\u2019t let thermons down here precisely because they would escape!\u201D shouted Mia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI am a thermon,\u201D said Ritani timidly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou could barely heat up a paper clip!\u0022 attacked Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, but it\u2019s worth a shot,\u201D Keenan ventured. He paused for a few seconds, and extended his gloved hand with the ring in it. Ritani put it on and walked towards the door. \u201CForeman, you want this entire shaft gone?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCome to think of it, try to get it to match the area of the rock part of the shaft.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI hope you know what you are doing,\u201D Ritani said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStand back, everyone!\u201D shouted the foreman. Everyone shrunk deeper into the cave as Ritani approached the airlock, and carefully set his hand on the door. He took a deep breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA blinding white light erupted from the ring. Ritani screamed as he jumped backwards. A small hole the size of a fist was now in the wall and air rushed through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat was that?\u201D shouted Keenan in amazement and trepidation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis\u2026 I don\u2019t know what this is,\u201D said Ritani. \u201CBut this\u2026 This is no ordinary essence ring.\u201D He stood back up, placed his hands on the wall, and took another deep breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was an even brighter flash, and one section of the shaft gave away. Due to the now massive pressure differential, the entire shaft imploded and collapsed, falling away to reveal just the shaft\u2019s opening in the ceiling, through which a wind stronger than any storm now roared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo!\u201D shouted the Foreman over the now intense winds. \u201CThe high velocity flow is all the way up there! We need a way to get up there!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey will have cut power to the elevator,\u201D said Ritani.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe can climb the cables,\u201D said Keenan. \u201CThe gravity is low enough, the wind will help us.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSpoken like someone whose bones have not atrophied from years of spaceflight!\u201D said Lawrence. \u201CMy arms would sooner snap!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSnap\u2026 Wait\u2026 That\u2019s it!\u201D said Mia. \u201CEveryone, jump down onto the drill! Get on the rock hopper!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat are you thinking?\u201D said Keenan as everyone made their way onto the top of the drill, just below cavern level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEveryone onto the roof of the rock basket! You see, this thing is under a decent amount of tension, carrying hundreds of tons of rocks. The roof is connected to the base through four supports. Ritani, I need you to snap or melt those supports.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre you crazy? The forces could kill us!\u201D said Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, the tension isn\u2019t actually that much, it isn\u2019t supporting the whole drill, just the thing that brings the rocks to the surface,\u201D said Lawrence. \u201CEveryone lie down. Keep your head back, arms laid down. This is going to be quite the jolt.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSnapping support one,\u201D said Ritani. There was a pulse of white light as the first of four connections to the rock hopper were severed. The platform shifted slightly and everyone panicked a bit. Ritani ran to the opposite corner and pulsed again. \u201CSupport two snapped!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAttention everyone!\u201D barked Mia. \u201CWe are about to be yeeted at quite high velocity towards the high wind portion of the shaft! Once there, position yourself like a skydiver, and do NOT touch the sides! If you must, clip yourself into one of the main cables to stay on course, but don\u2019t get grinded by it!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSupport three!\u201D there was another flash and the platform lurched and shifted, now at an appreciable diagonal angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLawrence?\u201D whispered Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, Keenan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf this doesn\u2019t work, and we\u2019re turned to paste in a few seconds\u2026 Thank you for rescuing me.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt means we\u2019re even.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEveryone ready?\u201D Ritani asked. \u201COkay, good. Releasing in Five. Four.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeenan put his head back and looked at the shaft above. He then saw an explosion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh no,\u201D he whispered. Doing some quick mental math, he was able to determine that, given the local speed of sound, the amount of time between the first wind and the explosion was likely because the entire roof of the shaft had been blown off by the air hammer effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last support was melted away and the entire platform shot into the air like a gigantic catapult. It found its mark, and everyone successfully reached the intact portion of the shaft, and were now riding the tornado force winds up and out of Moho, with nothing but open void on the other end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAAAAAHHH!\u201D shouted everyone as they reverse skydived around the open shaft, which was fortunately wide enough that running into the walls was scarcely a concern. Keenan was completely and utterly terrified for the first few minutes, but then found himself beginning to enjoy the sensation of flight, risking a few backflips. He looked over with a crazy grin on his face to Lawrence, whose expression was a mix of complete terror and childlike wonder. He looked for Mia, but she wasn\u2019t there, they were probably separated by hundreds of meters by this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral minutes passed, and the thought of what to do when they reached the top occurred to him. They were getting close, he could see the distant black sky by now, but there was nothing really to do except try to float on the edge of the breathable atmosphere by initiating a nosedive. He attempted to do so, and many people shot by him, but he could not bring his velocity down to zero no matter how aerodynamic he tried to make himself. He desperately looked for any way out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cables were whipping about, no longer attached to anything, half falling, half flailing. There was nothing to grab onto on the walls, not that he was going slow enough to survive contact. He looked up as the square of darkness drew ever closer, and once more, he prepared for his death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeenan shot out of the mineshaft, and saw the stars once more as the air pressure around him faded, and faded, and\u2026 Rose?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe let out a yelp as he was yanked backwards by a new breeze away from the air column, into a vortex, spinning, and then being thrown against a wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNice seeing you again!\u201D cheerfully chirped a familiar voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSamantha Rae!\u201D shouted Keenan as he stood up and dodged another incoming Kerbal. They were in a ship hovering above the surface, and he could see a team of several Evian airwielders twisting the exiting air into a cyclone, extracting each Kerbal, and placing them, mostly gently, on an exterior balcony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...aaaaAAAAAAOOF!\u201D shouted Lawrence as he faceplanted onto the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWelcome aboard the EGT \u003Cem\u003EAlbatross!\u003C/em\u003E\u201D said Sam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI thought we were dead there!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI told you I\u2019d have your back! I was beginning to worry you wouldn\u2019t show up!\u201D grinned Sam. \u201CI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be this flashy though!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat,\u201D said Ritani, \u201CWas exhilarating!

This was sprung on us kind of last minute, so we do not have full details, but rest assured that once we reach Eve, we will provide free transportation to any planet you wish to travel to. If you are not sure where to go, Eve will welcome you for as long as you wish to stay for.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can go home now,\u201D said one Kerbal. \u201CAll the way to Duna.

I don\u2019t know,\u201D she said. \u201CI\u2019m sure there\u2019s got to be a bunch of spacecraft that need fixing over at Eve. Lawrence?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2026 I have too many questions I need to answer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCan you give us a summary?\u201D Keenan asked. \u201CYou kinda brushed over lava monsters in like five seconds.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLawrence lowered his voice to a whisper and leaned in to the others. \u201CI overheard our former owners talking about the core, and about that suitcase on the man Sylvus killed - Master Tyronus.. I think there was a gauntlet inside, but not just any gauntlet\u2026 Some sort of superweapon, one that is worth killing over.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat would explain all the dead masters you mentioned,\u201D said Mia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd then I snuck around and found a secret laboratory with a lens. They were trying to solve singularity problems. Is magic a gradient or a singularity? They seem to think it is a singularity, and they were trying to figure ut what happens as you got close. They found that a hundred kilometers down, prolonged exposure to a focal point appears to rapidly thermonize you\u2026 Well, rapidly being weeks instead of years. A bunch of the lava monsters, which are actually just accelerated thermons, broke in to rescue one of their own, and I saved a doctor who the team had turned against, who was one of the masterminds of the whole thing, but\u2026 He died before he could tell me all of his secrets. He gave me this,\u201D he said, holding the strange necklace. \u0022The, well, accelerated thermons, that\u2019s a stupid name, how about Gigathermons, heard about my situation, and broke into the base camp to help rescue everyone.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo they\u2019re just Kerbals?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes. One of them was named Daisey\u2026 She gave me the ring before disappearing into the caves.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou can take this back,\u201D said Ritani. \u201CThat is too much power for one man. I can barely soften a paper clip, imagine what someone who knew what they were doing got their hands on this. I trust you with it, Lawrence, you can\u2019t wield at all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COuch.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLawrence took the ring back. \u201CDead masters, thermons with power far beyond known science, a super gauntlet, and now this,\u201D he said holding the ring. \u201CCould it be a new type of essence? Could it be micro receivers?\u00A0 Ley line absorption? I don\u2019t know. And you know me. If it is related to wielding, I want to know.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis could be an entirely new level of Magic,\u201D said Keenan, \u201CAnd we could have stumbled right into it by accident.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m not worried about the magic,\u201D said Mia. \u201CI\u2019m worried about the people that also know about this, and are willing to kill to prevent the secret from escaping.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey, Sam!\u201D said Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou wouldn\u2019t happen to know anyone who can non destructively evaluate a small object?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat might be up Professor Neeson\u2019s alley. I\u2019ll let him know we\u2019ll be up in a few weeks and I\u2019ll see if he\u2019s available.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks. He lives on Eve?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIndeed!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI guess that means I\u2019ll be staying around Eve for a while, then,\u201D Lawrence said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFantastic, I\u2019ve got a few spare rooms if you all want to stay with me for a bit!\u201D Sam said. \u201CI\u2019ll be awfully busy writing about all that\u2019s happened these past few months, but I\u2019ll surely have time to show you guys around the planet!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat do you say, Mia?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m in, I\u2019m going to need some time to process all of this.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDitto on both accounts,\u201D said Keenan. \u0022I might have to go see the ship\u0027s therapist.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey, Keenan\u2026\u0022 began Ritani. \u0022I know I haven\u2019t exactly been the greatest person, - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStop right there,\u201D Keenan said. \u201CYou helped save us back there. While personally I\u2019m going to be subconsciously angry at you for a while, no matter how hard I try, you saved us back there, and you changed your ways. I can respect that. I just need some time for the gut reactions to fade away.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks,\u201D said Ritani. \u201CI always wanted to see the worlds.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re just in it for the Evian wine!\u201D said Lawrence. Most everyone laughed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNow if only I could get my hands on those at the top,\u201D muttered Mia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLeave that to me,\u201D said Samantha Rae. \u201CI\u2019ve been known to be\u2026 Fairly influential. Nothing of this scale, of course, but if my words can end this wretched system one day sooner, it will be more than worth it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDid we really do a good thing here, though?\u201D asked Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D asked Sam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou got ransomed for ten million funds,\u201D Lawrence said. \u201CYou could replace everyone we saved today ten times over with that kind of money.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd if I can change enough minds, ten million will be pennies next to what the rockheads will lose, and grams compared to the weight of the chains that will fall.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWith words like that, I\u2019d almost believe you!\u201D said Ritani. \u201CActually the way you talk kind of reminds me of Grey Lilac\u2019s stuff. Funny, she hasn\u2019t actually released anything in several months, and\u2026 Oh. OH.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t tell anyone!\u201D said Samantha with a smile. \u201CNot knowing who lies behind the pen name is adds to the mystique, and the impact.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy lips are sealed\u2026 But\u2026 YOU are Grey Lilac!

Understanding the causes of thoughts that may appear random can often help a great deal.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s just that\u2026 I was always the clever kid growing up. If there was injustice, I was taught to stand up to it, and I\u2019d often pull a solution out of nowhere.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat is very honorable.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, but - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo buts. Nothing inside you can take that away.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s just given me this unhealthy mentality, you know\u2026 That I feel like I have to be the person to do it. That I have to be the person to take center stage and save the day\u2026 Mia and Lawrence were hyping me up. They were looking to me to find a way to save everyone, and break out of that horrible place. I spent weeks and weeks trying to figure out a way out of that mine, and in the end, I contributed practically nothing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnyone could have thought up the solution, not everyone does all of the time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201DIt was the Foreman who came up with the escape plan, Mia who came up with the slingshot idea, Ritani, a \u003Cem\u003Eguard\u003C/em\u003E, who was able to do the wielding, and Samantha\u2019s status that actually got us off of the planet. In the meantime, Lawrence stumbles upon, well\u2026 Let\u2019s just say some stuff that\u2019s a pretty big deal, and I just sat there digging at some rocks. And I know that it shouldn\u2019t bother me, I shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for trying and not accomplishing anything\u2026 But I do. I am quite frankly starting to hate myself for it. I should be the one standing up to all of this, and I didn\u2019t. Instead of celebrating that we freed like 80 people, instead of relaxing because I don\u2019t have to spend endless hours swinging a pickaxe, and instead of, well, anything\u2026 I just direct it all inward.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDoes the rook lose all its value because the bishop performed the checkmate?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, of course not, it is good to have just in case, but what if the rook didn\u2019t move all game?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe opponent still has to account for the rook. Its mere presence deters attacks, intimidates the enemy, and renders many strategies foolish.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEven though it stands around and does nothing?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes. Is the extra card in your hand worthless because you won with other cards? No. Is the safety margin worthless because the stress can be taken by less metal? Of course not! Are missiles worthless because they are not fired? No. You are a part of a team, Keenan. When you face a problem, you want as many assets as possible. A carpenter will not use all of his tools on one project, but that does not mean he should rid himself of the other tools.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI guess that makes sense.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou look tired.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt has been a long month!\u201D chuckled Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, get some sleep tonight, alright?\u201D asked the therapist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI will do my best.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeeks later, back on Moho, ten figures stood at the control panel of the heavily modified drill hovering just over the dully glowing core of Moho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Main drill?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Secondary drill?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Drill heaters?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Drill coolers?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Main lens?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Secondary lens?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Reversers?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Reactor?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Robotics?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Air conditioning?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Backup air conditioning?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Backup backup air conditioning?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Also go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Backup backup backup - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Perrei, all seventeen of the air conditioners are go, and even all the Eeloo essence we have just in case.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright then, by Kerbol, I just wanted to sound cool.

The journey was bumpy, shaking the ship back and forth, much to the discomfort of its occupants, but the discomfort turned into wonder as ship broke through the thin Evian clouds at subsonic speeds, bringing the shining plateau city of Avalon into full view. The Albatross half glided, half plummeted out of the sky and opened its engine bay doors, firing up its Vector-derivative landing thrusters, and coming to a shaky stop on one of Avalon\u2019s many landing pads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat was so cool!\u201D shouted Lawrence. \u201CHow does that work?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe gas separation plants leave a lot of high velocity gas in the system, so they shoot it upwards and sideways to launch ships most of the way into orbit!\u201D Mia beamed. \u201CAnd returning ships use that massive plume of fast but not orbital gas to slow down without as much re entry heating!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COnly on Eve,\u201D said Keenan. \u201CWait\u2026 We\u2019re on - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait until we\u2019re outside, please!\u201D said Sam. \u201CUnfortunately we\u2019ve lost enough ships that way.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry.\u201D Everyone got up and out of their seats, and were distributed breathing masks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright, for everyone who has never been on Eve before, listen up!\u201D shouted one of the ship\u2019s officers. \u201CEve orientation time! As you hopefully know, Eve is in the middle of a terraforming procedure. We aim to convert our mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere into oxygen, reduce the pressure to a bit more than Kerbin\u2019s at sea level, purify the oceans, and remove most contaminant gasses.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo Eve doesn\u2019t smell any more?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCorrect! We got rid of almost all of the sulfur dioxide ages ago. As of a few years ago, there is now a habitable band at medium elevations where the oxygen concentration is high enough to breathe, and the pressure is low enough to survive long term, disregarding the effects of carbon dioxide... Avalon is not in this range. You cannot survive in this atmosphere for very long. If you see people walking around without a mask, though, do not be alarmed, as many airwielders increase the pressure close to their mouths and disperse the carbon dioxide to facilitate breathing. If your mask stops working, activate the distress beacon on its side and head for the nearest building. Three people can safely alternate the same mask and survive at these altitudes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDave, if you want me to share my mask with you if you are dying, you really need to start brushing your teeth.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnfortunately, the atmosphere here is roughly 9 percent oxygen, 27% nitrogen, 1% other, and 63% carbon dioxide. In addition to providing oxygen, the masks also have a button that will disperse chemicals that neutralize the effects of that much carbon dioxide on the lungs. You can, for example, press the button, remove the mask, breathe for a minute or two, and replace the mask, and survive without permanent damage to the lungs.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat sounds like a bad idea,\u201D someone whispered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhile you can do this, be aware that inhaling more than a few percent carbon dioxide is a deeply unpleasant experience as it triggers our \u201CI\u2019m suffocating!\u201D reaction. This reflex can be suppressed given enough time, but it has been known to be traumatic. The mask should filter the carbon dioxide out, though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShould?\u201D said Lawrence, a little troubled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNow how on Kerbin did they make a molecular sieve that could be mass produced?\u201D Keenan wondered out loud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMask refill stations are denoted by a blue circle inside a slightly larger red circle. And lastly, as you probably all know by now, Eve has a notoriously strict immigration system. You will all be classified as class 2 refugees, and have a shot at Evian citizenship if you wish. For now you are generally entitled to most of the rights of an Evian citizen, mainly excluding voting and such, for however long you wish to stay. Hotels are subsidized and obligated to house you, you get a decent chunk of free food, etcetera, please consult any public official if you have any questions.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone put on their masks and stepped through the airlock of the Albatross, emerging onto the slightly deadly purple plateau.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLook at it!\u201D excitedly shouted Mia, slightly muffled through the mask. \u201CGuys, we\u2019re on Eve!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know, it is really wonderful seeing her happy for a change,\u201D remarked Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYo, Lawrence, want to find a bar?\u201D asked Ritani, jogging past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t recommend it,\u201D said Sam. \u201CAlcohol here is generally culturally viewed as a means to an end to be used in moderation.

Centuries ago, we pointed the first chordonic telescope towards the sky, and in the chordonic field, we found a never ending song emanating from across the universe that has perplexed scientists ever since. Some think it is the sound of stellar fusion. Some think it is miniature black holes banging against the chordonic field. Others still attribute it to angels painting the skies with music.

No plates, no instruments, no attachments\u2026 Just Alexandra Elaine Kerman and her two hands, back turned to the audience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe raised her arms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbxgYlcNxE8)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral emulations of string instruments, indistinguishable from the real thing, emanated from the stage, the tune instantly recognizable as Tchaikerbsy\u2019s 1812 Overture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlawless woodwinds joined in, somehow from the left side of the stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust past the two minute mark, the strings swelled, and Alexandra rapidly turned around to face the audience, abruptly transitioning into the oboe feature. She moved around, almost dancing as if she herself were the oboe. The low strings and the high strings battled each other, and the brass instruments one by one roared to life, all panned to one side or the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe snare drum, a notoriously hard instrument to wield, popped in, as the familiar battle theme of the overture began, staying around for a mere seconds, before giving away to slow strings and then fast strings, growing angrier and angrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe french horns began their triumphant calls, the trumpets echoing them, the violins arpeggiating, the timpanis, also difficult, as are most percussion instruments, calling in between the strings, and then the strings rose and fell as the main melody slowly faded out, echoed by different instruments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next section, mostly slow strings, punctuated by strikes of the triangle, was a short rest for Alexandra - multi instrument emulation was a very taxing affair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe strings gave way to another soft woodwind and percussion feature. Alexandra rook a deep breath as it drew to a close. The strings sped up, and she conjured the brass back into existence, several parts playing louder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe strings and horns grew in desperation, punctuated by blasts of percussion, growing angrier and angrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe music climbed a mountain, and at the top, the strings slowly fell in pitch and the brass slowly fell in volume, transitioning back to another triangle and woodwind rest period, though this would not last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone could tell Alexandra was getting tired, now eleven minutes into emulating an entire orchestra, with the hardest part still to come. Her face grew pale, the glint of sweat visible. She took one more deep breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe French horns returned, fighting with the shy strings, The trumpets and trombones joined, and the song crescendoed. She took a deep breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe entire orchestra grew louder than it had ever before as five cannon shots, each localized to a different side of the building, rang out, causing many to cover their ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlexandra reeled back in shock, breathing heavily while granted just one more final rest period as the strings spiraled downwards once more, growing ever and ever slower and louder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd she rose her hands to the sky, and the brass screamed out, and the church bells rang brightly throughout the hall. The brass grew louder and louder, the woodwinds and strings, trading the spotlight every now and then, a wall of sound assaulting the ears of the audience with a vigor never heard since.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the battle theme returned, the brass and cymbals trading off. The low brass and high brass split into their separate melodies as the cannons once again rang out, even louder than before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe church bells returned for the finale, the tempo picking up once more, as the infamous battle theme returned in its full form, Alexandra going all out, emulating the sounds of fireworks, as the brass grew for the final moments of the piece.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe timpani grew ever louder, and the final chord sounded. Alexandra dropped to the floor, completely exhausted, after over fifteen minutes straight of expert level musical performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLadies and gentlemen, Master Alexandra Elaine Kerman!\u201D said the conductor as he moved to help Alexandra back to her feet. She smiled and waved to the audience, infinitely proud of a job well done, even more glad the audience enjoyed it just as much, if not more, than she did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd I heard she\u2019s working up to performing the entirety of Holst\u2019s \u003Cem\u003EThe Planets!\u003C/em\u003E Excitedly raved Mia as the trio exited the theater. \u201CThat\u2019s, like, three times as long! I don\u2019t think anyone has ever performed it by themselves before! Master Relan Tan did it in two sittings, but that was with plates and walls for assistance.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe is on another level!\u201D proclaimed Lawrence. \u201CIt\u2019s hard enough to wield two instruments at once, here she is with dozens. I tried to learn physical piano a while back, left hand and right hand independence is hard enough, even just thinking several parts at once is crazy. Playing even a quartet is almost enough to be called a master. She\u2019s over here pulling off one of the most over the top bombastic pieces ever, without any assistance of any kind!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow does she even do that?\u201D said Keenan. \u201CLike, she only has ten fingers, there were way more than ten instruments playing for large parts of that!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBeyond a certain skill level, you tend to start thinking in combined waveforms rather than discrete parts,\u201D replied Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, like, the opposite of a fourier transform, combining each instrument\u2019s harmonics into a new overall pattern, which changes every time even one instrument changes pitch?\u201D Keenan asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSort of, not exactly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Planets by Holst,\u201D said Keenan. \u201CThat might just warrant a level beyond Master.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMost people try to master something else once they\u2019ve mastered one thing,\u201D said Lawrence. \u201CNot her\u2026 Although to be honest, putting my music hat on, I\u2019m not sure why she chose \u003Cem\u003EThe Planets\u003C/em\u003E. Assuming that rumor is correct, of course. It\u2019s got that weird tonal shift in the middle. Kinda ruins the whole thing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think it\u2019s brilliant,\u201D said Mia. \u201CAlmost like Holst was emphasizing the rift between the Joolian alliance and the Kerbian alliance, but that can\u2019t be, the war was centuries after his time. Either way, it fits.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI disagree, but how much of a banger \u003Cem\u003EDuna\u003C/em\u003E is almost makes up for it in my opinion.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, hold on,\u201D said Keenan. \u201CIn the one astronomy class I took back in college, they briefly touched on the Chordonic field and that the signals kinda sounded like music. Otherwise, I\u2019m kind of out of the loop on the whole \u003Cem\u003ESong of The Stars\u003C/em\u003E thing. Care to explain?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course!\u201D said Mia. \u201CAll the physics stuff, I can\u2019t explain, but, in the sky, some of the stars are making weird sounds. Well, not in the audible domain, exactly. The performance version takes a lot of creative liberties, speeds it up, translates the frequencies so we can hear them, adds some flavor here and there, adds contemporary percussion, you know\u2026 But every so often, a star will start playing a chord with various overtones that seem to chaotically bounce around, speeding up, then there\u2019s a tension chord, and then a loud kaboom as it transitions back to the main chord, and either slowly raises in pitch or slowly lowers in pitch and slowly fades out. The chords aren\u2019t exactly I and V7, they vary a lot, sometimes there\u2019s multiple steps, sometimes they can barely be called chords, but we settled on the coolest version that could reasonably claim to be a derivative of the original. Basically, strange space signals that Eve decided to dress up.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd we don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing it?\u201D Lawrence asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf I remember right,\u201D began Keenan, \u201CThe best theory we currently have is this is kind of like what pulsars do, but instead of neutron stars and radio waves, it works with ordinary stars and chordons due to the internal convection patterns within the star. Based on what we know about the Chordonic field, it is possible for these patterns to emerge, but it is weird that they would all be so similar yet so different.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSimilar yet different? You are sounding like those shop signs that say \u201CUp to and including or more!\u201D\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe would have to study our own sun more to figure out why this happens,\u201D says Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhich is why we should wield the sun!\u201D proclaimed Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou can\u2019t just wield the sun!\u201D said Keenan. \u201CThat\u2019s like the fifth rule of wielding! It\u2019s a bad idea!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI want to know what happens,\u201D said Lawrence. \u201CI believe it is worth the risk. And besides, you aren\u2019t going to get funding to study the sun otherwise.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know what happened the last time someone tried to wield the sun.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CImagine what we could learn!\u201D said Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI am\u2026 And it is tempting, but\u2026 I wish there was a safer way to learn. Anyway, this is a conversation for another day. We\u2019ve still got a few days until that professor gets back. What are your plans?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m quite frankly having trouble waiting,\u201D said Lawrence. \u201CI am going to, well\u2026 I\u2019m going to see if I can contact someone else.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m going to tour the gas facilities,\u201D said Mia. \u201CWhat about you? You seem excited.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI got a date!\u201D beamed Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut that\u2019s impossible!\u201D said Mia. \u201CHaha, just kidding!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCongrats, man!\u201D said Lawrence. \u201CWhere will you be going?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!\u201D shouted Keenan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRelax, I\u2019ve got you!\u201D giggled Ripley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWELL IT DOESN\u2019T FEEL LIKE IT!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI will circa 500 meters or so. Besides, I thought you wanted to learn how to fly?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYES BUT NOT LIKE THIS!\u201D Keenan shouted as he plummeted at over 100 meters per second through the Evian atmosphere, desperately trying to stabilize himself with jets of air, but sending himself only further into the tumble he was in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTrial by fire, learn by doing, live like you can always see Gilly in the sky!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re taking those figures of speech WAAAAAAYYYY too literally!\u201D panicked Keenan, who had somehow managed to stabilize two axes of his spin and was working on the third.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know, you\u2019re doing pretty good!\u201D she shouted, grinning, head supported by arms, as if laying down on a couch and not plummeting towards the surface of Eve at a not insignificant fraction of the speed of sound. \u201CYou\u2019re kinda cute when you are spinning around like that!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAaannnddd\u2026 There. Spin: Stabilized! I appreciate the gesture but I would very much appreciate if you could take me down, and home now. Preferably at low speed, low altitude.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat, you don\u2019t have a hover in you?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI barely even have my lunch in me right now, Ripley!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLunch\u2026 You know\u2026 oh\u2026 That reminds me\u2026 I forgot to take my\u2026 my\u2026.\u201D Her eyelids fluttered and her body went limp. Instantly the partial atmosphere of oxygen she had kept around the two vanished, and the thinner, carbon dioxide rich atmosphere rushed in, causing Keenan to panic and lose stability as his lungs began to burn. He quickly reached for his mask, returning oxygen to his lungs, and slowly purging the carbon dioxide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuickly he took stock of the situation. About ten kilometers up, barely capable of controlled maneuvering, separated from his tumbling, medicationless, unconscious date, who had up until now been providing communication, oxygen, and course corrections to them both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe quickly stabilized himself again as the air rushed past, lungs still burning and began trying to propel himself towards Ripley, but found it exceedingly difficult. Realizing he had zeroed in on a solution, Keenan reconsidered, and began using traditional skydiving maneuvers to approach Ripley, finding this much more successful. After several misses, he succeeded in catching her, although they were now both tumbling. He grabbed her mask and strapped it back around her math, pushing the anti-CO2 button so many times he was sure it had broken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurning his attention back to the situation, he had lost track of time. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly how high up they were, but it couldn\u2019t have been more than three kilometers above the shallows of Eve. He tried to hold out his arms and do an air blast, but he couldn\u2019t, as he was holding Ripley. He tried doing it with one hand but just knocked them hopelessly into a spin. He shook her harder, slapped her across the face, screaming \u201CRIPLEY! WAKE UP!\u201D as loud as he could. The surface drew ever closer, they were running out of time!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, he had an idea. He ripped off of his shoes and socks, and made a last minute effort to use his legs as wielding surfaces instead. They sputered about, barely doing anything. The surface of the ocean drew near, and seconds remained, and he looked out at the horizon, content to just admire the sky in his final moments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then he saw Gilly standing there, almost taunting him. It made him angry to be proved differently like that, but something arose inside of him, and he gave it one last shot. Twin bursts of air erupted from Keenan\u2019s legs, and the pair of Kerbals, in a barely controlled fall - no, flight - gradually slowed down to a standstill just above the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell done, Keenan!\u201D cheered Ripley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRipley? You\u2019re awake?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDuh, was the whole time! You really do learn quickly under pressure just like Lawrence said you do!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou would just\u2026 You would just do that to a person?\u201D Keenan asked, flabbergasted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSurely as the sun in the sky right I would,\u201D she said, leaning in for a kiss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeenan dropped her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAH - \u201C she only got the first H out before she splashed into the ocean below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry, I\u2019m not going to date anyone who won\u2019t respect my boundaries!\u201D Keenan half stated, half passive aggressively yelled, before attempting to fly off towards the shore looking cooler than he ever had before. Instead, whatever had possessed him to learn to fly in that moment of crisis left him quicker than a flare leaves the sun, and he too splashed into the water, exhausted over that ordeal, but fortunately still enough energy to swim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHa!\u201D Ripley shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh shoot, you can swim, right?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, but why would I when I could just - \u201C Ripley rose up out of the water, blew him a sarcastic kiss, and flew off towards the nearby shore. Keenan rolled his eyes and began swimming in that direction as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old master coughed as she awoke deep underground from her cryogenic suspension chamber. After a few seconds she regained her composure and spoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat year is it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe year of the Ikean Rabbit.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIs the cure here yet?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid not.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen what brings you here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy name is Lawrence, and great master, there have been some\u2026 new and interesting developments in the world of magic. I fear another war is along the way.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow did you get in here?\u201D she asked. \u201COnly a few people have the code and location!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know my way around a forbidden library,\u201D Lawrence replied. \u201CMaster Tonga, legendary warrior of the coalition, I have come to seek your input.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBring up the war one more time and I\u2019m going back to sleep.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThree things have happened. There have been whispers of a new superweapon. Great and terrible progress has been made towards solving the singularity problem. And I have happened upon an essence ring that can turn a novice into a master. All the while, many, many masters have been assassinated\u2026 Something is going on here, and I don\u2019t - What are you doing - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat sounds exciting!\u201D chirped Master Tonga. \u201CI can\u2019t wait to know the answer! So I\u2019m not going to!\u201D Tonga pushed a button and the cryogenic suspension chamber activated once more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...I suppose that was indeed slightly rude of me,\u201D Lawrene pondered. \u201CNow, how do I get back out of this immortality vault\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat? No! Absolutely not!\u201D said the guide into her phone. \u201CWhat are we supposed to do then? We can\u2019t exactly just store it! We can\u2019t just stop our terraforming, or slow it down like that! No! Look, we\u2026 Okay, yeah, that\u2019s evil, but this is our way of life! Look, I\u2019ll call you back, alright!\u201D The guide hung up her phone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMia looked up at the tour guide, and wondered what was up, as she wiped the concerned look off her face, replacing it with a typical customer service smile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHello, everyone! Welcome to Eve Terraforming Facility 12! As you all should know, Eve is in the middle of a three stage terraforming plan! Stage 1: Remove the atmospheric impurities, regulate the planet\u2019s temperature using anti-greenhouse gasses, and convert enough carbon dioxide to oxygen to allow for limited surface operations, complete! Stage 2: Rid the atmosphere of almost all carbon dioxide, and remove enough oxygen to bring the pressures down to something more reasonable, and allow for a Kerbin-like environment at most altitudes. Stage 3: Purify the ocean and introduce a large scale ecosystem!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tour guide began walking the small group down a hallway through the facility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAgain, as you know, we are currently in the middle of stage 2. Stage 2 requires us to sequester a lot of carbon dioxide underground and break the rest into carbon and oxygen. While other facilities are responsible for the sequestration, and others still are responsible for the separation, and the great vortex, this facility is unique in that it is more focused on the byproducts: Carbon and oxygen. Here is the separation machine:\u201D said the guide, gesturing to a window through which the massive circular whirlwind could be seen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWow! How does it work?\u201D asked one tourist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGlad you asked! Teams of dozens of airwielders spin the air up to incredibly fast velocities, and the pressures at the edge in combination with a number of catalysts allow relatively energy-cheap conversion of the carbon dioxide into carbon and diatomic oxygen. The carbon is collected before it has the chance to react or clump up and is funneled to one of the many printers on the ring, where it is assembled, molecule by molecule using advanced robotics and computers, into incredibly strong pure carbon parts, no composites needed!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd that\u2019s how the Beacon of Prosperity was made?\u201D someone asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPrecisely! The second tallest building anywhere in the solar system, despite being on the world with the highest gravity - \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C*cough* Jool!\u201D shouted one tourist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C - of the bodies with a surface, was made possible only through Eve\u2019s advanced materials science technology, created by free minds. Other worlds struggle to make a sheet of graphene, we\u2019re over here building roller coasters out of the stuff! Advanced carbon parts are our second \u00A0biggest export, dwarfed only by oxygen!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMia braced herself for the words she knew would follow in short order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGiven the colonization boom, a number of worlds are in need of lots of oxygen, and it just so happens that we are trying to get rid of a lot of oxygen! The Vortex provides an easy way to get this oxygen offworld, and our fleet of gas tankers, rather poorly named as they store the oxygen in liquid form, is responsible for transporting it to our customers! The profits from this excess oxygen are distributed around the world, it is what enables our lifestyle! However, one day the oxygen will run dry, and our life of luxury will come to an end, unless we can, in the meantime, figure out a form of society that can sustain this way of living forever. The window is closing, and other terraforming facilities are hard at work figuring out phase four, which is just as, if not more important than the other three: Maintain this standard of living in a post oxygen age.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMia was a bit relieved that the tour guide had danced around the truth, she wouldn\u2019t have to hear those words destroy her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd who are you selling the oxygen to?\u201D asked one non-local.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMia bowed her head in frustration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA small amount sold to interplanetary vessels to supply them. Some of it goes to Duna, but they are trying to produce as much of it domestically as they can. There was that brief time they tried to give Ike an atmosphere, but that has mostly stalled. It is possible but they couldn\u2019t figure out a place to get all the nitrogen from\u2026 Apparently there\u2019s a proposal going around to lift helium from the sun and use it instead, and the technical problems can be solved, but the problem of everyone speaking high pitched cannot!\u201D she chuckled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnother decent amount gets sent to Gilly. The Mun atmosphere project is supposed to start in the next year or two, and that will be a decent source of income, but a large portion of the oxygen is bought for Tylo\u2019s terraforming project, but nearly half of the oxygen is sold to Moho to pressurize their never ending, always leaky series of caverns.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMia wanted to say something, scream something, but she wasn\u2019t sure what.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut aren\u2019t you just enabling - \u201C said one tourist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the alternative? Let them all suffocate? Grey Lilac is an absolute fool, let me tell you that, if she thinks that the bill inspired by her stupid poem is going to fix anything, while it\u2019s gonna make life here a lot harder for us. The rich are just going to sit with their cash in their oxygenated bunkers and let the slaves choke, pack up, move to the Mun or another forsaken world, and do the same thing all over again. Don\u2019t let her fiery idealistic abolitionist words fool you, Grey Lilac\u2019s proposal is just going to make life worse for those poor poor slaves.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAren\u2019t they voting on it right now in parliament?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, been watching it on my phone this whole time!\u201D said another tourist. Everyone, now curious given the guide\u2019s outburst, either opened up the news on their phone or crowded around another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEVIAN PARLIAMENT BILL IR-523\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTITLE: LILAC\u2019S BILL\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs inspired by the recent words of Grey Lilac, perhaps the greatest poet of all time, who has witnessed the horrors of Mohian slavery firsthand, this bill seeks to pressure the Mohian governments into abolition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve is in a unique position, controlling the majority of Moho\u2019s oxygen supply, being as of now and for the foreseeable future the only exporter of oxygen anywhere in the solar system. Eve\u2019s economy is also large enough to weather such a drop in exports, although at great cost to quality of life and \u00A0While the risk of losing access to Mohian metallurgical technology and the tenuous alliance is great, this bill proposes a planetwide referendum with one question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you in favor of a complete embargo of all trade with Moho until all Mohian governments have abolished - and enforced the abolishment of the institution of slavery?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone around the planet watched closely, as the parliament debated back and forth the merits of the plan. Not a single member of parliament was opposed to ending Mohian slavery, of course, but Eve as a planet was tied to its oxygen money. The quality of life, testing of types of ideal society, ambitious terraforming project, and progression of the arts were only possible due to the incredible amount of wealth generated by the sale of its most precious nonrenewable resource. By comparison, its carbon industry was tiny. This would reduce the Evian economy by a third overnight for the foreseeable future. The question was not \u201CIs this the right thing to do?\u201D The question was \u201CAre our ideals worth killing this planet?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis economic struggle was only a fraction of what would come if Eve did not have a period of wealthiness long enough to figure out phase four, if it was possible at all. If Eve ran out of oxygen, or other worlds stopped buying it, no more planetwide prosperity, all Eve would have left would be some carbon trinkets and a lot of dubiously viable purple farmland. Eve could turn into what Moho is today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it worth risking one planet\u2019s future for another\u2019s present?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parliament decided - yes. A vote of 532 to 491. The referendum would happen, and the people would decide - although with how idealistic the Evian populus was, and with how much poetry they had been consuming, the referendum was but a formality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd at last, Professor Neeson and his two grad student assistants emerged from their submarine, the \u003Cem\u003EClara II\u003C/em\u003E, onto the surface of the Evian ocean. After some short checks, the hatch was opened, and he began triumphantly waving his hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ve done it!\u201D he proclaimed. One of the grad students tapped him on the shoulder. \u201CI mean we\u2019ve done it!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe awaiting retrieval boat approached and began attaching itself to the submarine, and took the crew of three aboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSamantha Rae, what goodness it is to see you again!\u201D proclaimed the Professor as he gave her a gigantic hug. \u201CI have big news!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI do too! You go first!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe made it down to just above crush depth, and the caves, they open up down there! So much! It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the weird seismometer readings were correct, and Eve really is semi aquatic all the way down! Well, I suppose it would become a supercritical fluid at some point, golly, that would be fun, designing a submarine to work in a supercritical environment! But the news! While everyone knows you can\u2019t precisely measure magic as it relies on operator consistency, which is not a thing one could ever hope to have, we cannot rule out the existence of the singularity!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s wonderful news, and very on topic!\u201D she said. \u201CI have two pieces of news.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh really?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah. So, Grey Lilac published her new poem, it became a tremendously huge deal, and, well, long story short, in a few days, we are blockading Moho until they stop slavery.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe professor\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat is, ideologically speaking, wonderful news, but the ramifications if this goes wrong\u2026 A dilemma for the ages, this is\u2026 I suppose I won\u2019t be getting any funding for this supercritical submarine idea of mine for many years!\u201D he chuckled sadly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, I do have something to keep you occupied\u2026 While I was out adventuring on the Mun and Moho, I met these three\u2026 This is Keenan, Mia, and Lawrence. They have discovered some rather interesting things that should keep you occupied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell hello there! I am Neeson Kerman, professor of theoretical magic and mechanical engineering at Ervion Technical University!\u201D He shook their hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m Keenan, mechanical engineering graduate from Kerlan Kerman College of Science and Technology, journeyman Minmar, journeyman Lifewielder, amateur airwielder.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd flight attendant,\u201D Mia added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLook, I only took that job so I could go to the Mun!\u201D Keenan protested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m Mia, conventional spacecraft technician, veteran of numerous shuttle missions, and amateur airwielding musician.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd frostwielding ice princess,\u201D said Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI AM NOT A DAINTY ICE PRINCESS!\u201D Mia shouted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m Lawrence, conventional spacecraft pilot, and regrettably, I have been thus far unable to wield.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell you certainly seem like an energetic and well traveled bunch!\u201D said Neeson. \u201CWhat can I help you with?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn our travels,\u201D Lawrence began, \u201Cwe have come across a magical artifact that is behaving strangely. Since you have significant non destructive evaluation and theoretical magic experience, Sam directed us to you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA strange magical artifact? If what you posit is true, I\u2019d be thrilled to take a look at it!\u201D Professor Neeson said in a way that made it obvious he did not believe that there was anything truly anomalous about the object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeenan got closer and whispered in the professor\u2019s ear. \u201CWe also believe that there may be a related or unrelated conspiracy. A number of masters and closely connected parties have been assassinated in close proximity to our findings. Do NOT tell anyone about anything we show you.\u201D Keenan backed away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSam? Are they talking from Pol to Bop?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, I\u2019m afraid they are speaking to the best of their - our knowledge.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen let\u2019s go to the laboratory. Right now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut we need to finish hooking up the \u003Cem\u003EClara II\u003C/em\u003E!\u201D said one of the students.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, then let\u2019s go to the laboratory. In an hour or two.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProfessor Neeson emerged from the door to his laboratory with a frown on his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell?\u201D Lawrence and Keenan simultaneously asked in anticipation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCome with me,\u201D Professor Neeson said in a hushed voice. The three followed him into a small meeting room. The professor checked around just in case any listening devices happened to be present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell?\u201D Lawrence and Keenan again simultaneously asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell this one is easy.\u201D The professor placed the sphere on a necklace on the table. \u201CIt contains a propagule, likely of the person who gave this to you, and should be returned to the host company, Zymbine Immortality, on Pol, for processing. You might find more answers after that, given that he seemed to know a great deal about this whole thing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow did you figure that out?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou really never thought to lift the flap on the side? It\u2019s engraved right there!\u201D said the Professor. \u201CPropagules aren\u2019t exactly uncommon, but the casing appears to be a fairly low production volume run, and quite unusually designed, which is probably why someone as into wielding as you didn\u2019t recognize it for what it was. The other object, the ring\u2026 It is much more interesting.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe professor placed it on the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLawrence,\u201D he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, professor?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is to remain in your possession at all times. Your complete and utter lack of wielding proficiency makes you its only safe holder.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COuch, but okay.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CObject appears to be an incredibly crudely forged pig iron ring. No internal structure besides the air pockets created during forging. Craftsmanship, I would give it a one out of ten, maybe a two. But as you have seen, it imbues the user with tremendous thermionic power despite having no essence source. I tested it in the thermal quench chamber, and I went as high power as I dared with it, eventually the power seemed to plateau, but at a point significantly higher than literally any other thermonic essence ring.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut it isn\u2019t an essence ring,\u201D Keenan said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly! And I have no idea what\u2019s going on here\u2026 The only evidence we have linking this to the singularity, if it exists, which we can only speculate on, is that it happened in the same temporal and geographic areas as the singularity conspiracy. But nobody has reached the singularity, at least not at the time you found it\u2026 The drill expedition is, well, we haven\u2019t heard from them. As the planet\u2019s leading expert in submarine technology, the drill is similar enough to a submarine that it is safe to assume they perished at this point. A shame, I would have loved to tour that magnificent craft\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo you have nothing?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNothing but a bag of questions and a desire to keep my head, and in this case, my desire to not meet a premature end currently trumps my desire to answer my questions. On one hand, I\u2019m going to be absolutely destroyed by those questions until they are answered by someone else. On the other hand, theoretical magic is not a dead end! There are now many more problems to solve! A flood of magic from nowhere, a planet away! I can scarcely believe my own eyes! I can scarcely believe my own instruments!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeenan slumped back, somewhat defeated. \u201CSo\u2026 What do we do now?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, it\u2019s simple, you find someone who knows more about theoretical magic than probably anyone else alive, and someone who\u2019s desire for knowledge exceeds, or is tied with, their desire to live. Fortunately, I know a guy, and he owes me a favor.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CReally?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYup. And since I know you guys aren\u2019t going to say no\u2026\u201D The professor slipped them a bunch of important looking paperwork. \u201CYou guys didn\u2019t get this from me,\u201D he said. \u201CNever contact me again, probably too dangerous. Good luck.\u201D And with that he exited the small room. The trio eagerly dug through the paperwork, finding the paperwork for four temporary visitors to Gilly, space transport tickets, and a date, time, and location for a meeting - but no indication as to who the meeting was with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI never thought I\u2019d ever get to go to Gilly,\u201D said Lawrence with a mixed expression on his face. \u201CSam, have you?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, I could if I wanted to, not permanently of course, but I have enough connections that I could certainly stay up there for a short stay every now and then. But why would I want to? Gilly is pretty much the opposite of everything Eve strives to be about!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake risks, live fast, die young, don\u2019t cling to the past, build a brighter future for the next generation, and try new things,\u201D said Mia. \u201CJust off the top of my head.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI mean, come on, we literally have the saying \u201CLive like you can always see Gilly in the sky!\u201D\u201D said Sam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can see why they do it,\u201D said Keenan. \u201CI don\u2019t know if I can blame them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI envy them but also pity them\u2026 Weird,\u201D said Lawrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEither way, if that\u2019s the only place we\u2019re going to get answers, well, it isn\u2019t exactly a question, is it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNope.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNuh uh.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo question at all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright, then.
