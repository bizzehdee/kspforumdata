Maneuver successful, guys. We have a complete, circular orbit.\u0022 Bill confirmed to Jeb and Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes! All those years of research. All of those failed attempts! We finally have Space Station Launchbird up and we can finally orbit Kerbin, taking photos of the outer edges of the Solar System, taking readings, and hopefully we can soon get these Clamp-O-Tron Ports up and running so shuttles can dock!\u0022 Bob exclaimed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Guys, what do you say we head down to the Hitchhiker Storage Container and celebrate with a little bit of this?\u0022 Asked Jeb. He pulled a bottle of champagne out of a storage box.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb! KSC already said there would be no outside food or drinks in Launchbird!\u0022 Bill told Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, technically, Launchbird is only the name of the Command Pod. I\u0027m not sure that the Storage Container even has a name besides Hitchhiker.\u0022 Corrected Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, he is correct, Bill. Launchbird is simply the Command Pod.\u0022 Bob said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fine. You two go and celebrate. I\u0027ll be up here, doing what I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003Esupposed\u003C/em\u003E to be doing.\u0022 Bill said with a very firm attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb and Bob climbed out of Launchbird and down to the Storage Container when they realized something. They forgot the champagne glasses!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob, can you go get the glasses? I think I forgot them back in Launchbird.\u0022 Jeb asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure thing, Jeb. Be right back.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob climbed back up the ladder and floated into Launchbird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, Bill, have you seen the champagne glasses?\u0022 Bob asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh, n-no. I, uh, haven\u0027t seen \u0027em.\u0022 Bill replied, shakily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay, then. I\u0027ll look around for them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob searched around the Launchbird for a while when Bill finally spoke again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob? Can you come see this and make sure I\u0027m not going insane?\u0022 He asked, signaling for Bob to come see the Control Deck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob floated over to the Control Deck. Bill pointed at the Fuel Gauge Number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022C-C-Could you read that number to me?\u0022 Bill asked, seeming even more shaky and frightened than before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It... It says...\u0022 Bob hesitated. He cleared his throat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022126 mL of fuel.\u0022 He finally said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But... But that\u0027s not possible! We calculated!\u0022 He exclaimed in fright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It seems that too much fuel was used breaking through the atmosphere of Kerbin, leaving us with... Well, this.\u0022 Bill said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But we can\u0027t get home on 126 mL.\u0022 Bob said, his voice breaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022E-Exactly, Bob. We can\u0027t get home.\u0022 Bill said. His voice also starting to choke up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And worst of all, we aren\u0027t getting enough satellite signal to communicate through the radio, and the only way we could pick the signal back up would be to expand our orbit. Given the amount of fuel we have, the speed we would be traveling at would be about...\u0022 Bill said, stopping to think about his calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002257 m/s. And the height we\u0027d need to get to wouldn\u0027t be reached for a bit over six months.\u0022 He stated. \u0022Get ready for a long ride home.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease tell me if you want me to continue on to...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECHAPTER 2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-29T10:48:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2013 10:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by TerabyteSPAAACE\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T09:36:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd the champagne and all non-essential personnel and material to the fuel tank!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVERYTHING IS EXPLOSIVE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and nice work mate.
