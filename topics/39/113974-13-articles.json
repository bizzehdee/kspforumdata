There\u0027s no babies allowed in my aircraft!\u0022\n\nValentina stared at D.N. flatly. \n\n\u0022*D\u0414*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Gah!\u0022 He threw his arms up, \u0022I can\u0027t *believe* Gene is making me do this! Of all the *bratzafrackakraken*...\u0022\n\nHe stalked off down the length of the hanger, trailing off into a string of incomprehensible swear words, or possibly just random syllables. Valentina rolled her eyes, blew at the errant lock of hair tickling her face, and followed close behind. As she walked, she eyed the miscellaneous stacks of tools and equipment along the near wall, mentally considering their skull-crushing potential. *That* one looks nice and balanced... ooooh but *that* one has one end covered in nice pokey-outey bits! She briefly wondered if her diplomatic immunity covered premeditated murder before pushing the thought away. \n\nSo far, the day had been *exactly* what she had been expecting. D.N. seemed every bit as happy about the arrangement as she was, and had given her a competent if profanity-laced briefing before practically throwing her flight gear at her. Donning that, at least, had helped to calm her. \n\nOnce again, some things were universal. Multi-pocketed flight suit that hadn\u0027t been washed recently, standard G-suit, well-worn parachute harness, small survival kit, oxygen mask that, thankfully, used removable liners, and a flight helmet labeled *NEW GUY* in big, bold letters on the brow that hadn\u0027t been washed... well, probably ever. \n\nThe deflated life preserver around her neck felt a bit strange, but clopping and clinking after D.N. wearing half her weight in *stuff* brought a calming familiarity. Flight gear, too, must be the same the world over. KSA gear, Ussari gear, it was all made in Gytep anyway. \n\nAbout this time, someone came walking past from the ramp outside, stacks of mops and brushes slung over his shoulders with buckets dangling from the ends. He whistled a happy tune as he went. \n\n\u0022Who is *that*?\u0022 Valentina asked, looking after him. \n\n\u0022Huh? Oh, I dunno, some spaceplane addict,\u0022 D.N. said dismissively, \u0022he washes the *Widowmaker* every day. I\u0027m not even sure if actually *works* here.\u0022 \n\n\u0022You do not know if he belongs here?\u0022 Valentina said, aghast, \u0022do you not have basic security?\u0022\n\nD.N. rounded on her, \u0022oooooohhh, security! Is that what they call it Ooksi-land?\u0022\n\n\u0022Papers, please!\u0022 He mocked in a bad accent, \u0022in Ussari Union, paper push you, danyetborscht! You see Eye-vin, when shoot everyone, is no traitors!\u0022\n\nValentina gave up on trying to crack his skull. This oxygen hose would make a handy garrote, actually...\n\n\u0022Whadda ya think someone\u0027s gonna do, waltz in and mess with something?!\u0022\n\nOnce again, Valentina stared at him blankly. \n\n\u0022Ha, ha, ha!\u0022 Scoffed D.N., \u0022you still don\u0027t get how it works here, we\u0027re all on the same side! Well, except *you*, of course.\u0022\n\nHer hands tightened on the ringed hose. \n\nD.N. waved his hands in the air, \u0022ooooooh someone\u0027s gonna sneak in and sabotage the spaceplane, har har,\u0022 then spun around and continued walking.\u0022\n\nFor a moment, Valentina bared her teeth at him, hands trembling on the hose, then winced and smacked herself in the head several times with it.\n\nHe didn\u0027t seem to notice, \u0022besides, that\u0027s how I\u0027d *wanna* go out, blaze of glory all the way! Be on the cover of every newspaper in the world, \u0027Fearless Kerbonaut Tragically Lost Pushing Edge of Space!\u0027\u0022\n\nReluctantly, she followed after him. *Some*one was going to end today with more bruises than they started with, that much was certain.\n\nAhead of them, out on the ramp, sat an enormous, dark shape. It somehow seemed to be all harsh angles and smooth lines, like a dagger stretched to incredible size. Even sitting motionless as it was, it looked to be moving... or wanting to.\n\n*Diplomatic. Be diplomatic.*\n\nValentina swallowed bitterly, \u0022is, um, that it?\u0022 \n\n\u0022*Her*,\u0022 D.N. shot back, but oddly lacking his recent ferocity. \n\nIn fact, his entire countenance had changed, he was... smiling? He looked up at the sleek aircraft, ran a hand along its vaguely iridescent, charcoal-grey skin as they passed. \n\n\u0022She\u0027s a *lady*. The Layland L-1011 Mark II. They call her the Widowmaker, though she hasn\u0027t actually, just scared the crap out of lesser pilots.\u0022\n\nHe walked along the flank, caressing it, something like love in his wide eyes, \u0022this is the future, the way forward. She\u0027s not meant to be here on the ground. It diminishes her, *defiles* her. She\u0027s meant to be up *there*, in the blue and the black. Not down here, awkward and helpless.\u0022\n\n\u0022She weeps, you know,\u0022 D.N. glanced back at Valentina for a moment, but she didn\u0027t think he was seeing much of anything just then, \u0022the fuel tanks, they... they don\u0027t seal right. By design. Fill her up, and the fuel seeps right out. You can see faint, shimmering cascades of it spreading out over the concrete. It stains her hull, long streaks of it, like tears. She weeps cuz the sky\u0027s been taken from her, she\u0027s seen the stars and lost them.\u0022\n\n\u0022Then she gets up in the air. Nudge the throttles forward, kick on the \u0027burners. The speed just builds and builds like she\u0027s been set free. Her skin heats up, the structure expands, and the tanks seal.  She\u0027s like a thoroughbred, the faster she goes the faster she *wants* to go. Doesn\u0027t know her own limits. There\u0027s no pushing her on, it\u0027s all holding her back. Every flight is a triumph... and a tragedy. You see, because you can\u0027t stay. You have to take the sky away.\u0022\n\nSmiling, Valentina reached out a hand towards it...\n\n\u0022*Don\u0027t you touch her!*\u0022 D.N. shrieked. His cheeks looked damp--\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t you dare go getting your grubby Ooski fingerprints all over her after..,\u0022 he gestured toward the hangar, \u0022..after whatsisname just washed her!\u0022\n\n\u0022Besides,\u0022 he pointed, \u0022we\u0027re flying in *that*.\u0022\n\nFurther out on the concrete apron, a pair of ground crew were readying another familiar aircraft. Valentina ground her teeth and followed after D.N.\n\n\u0022The Oskar EW-5894 Fleischgewehr! High-performance advanced trainer. Fast, agile, the cutting edge of Kr\u00FCnian aviation!\u0022\n\n\u0022And besides,\u0022 he said more softly, \u0022we got \u0027em *real* cheap after that whole emissions thing...\u0022\n\nValentina was still trying to figure out what he was talking about when the crewkerb with the clipboard raised a hand, \u0022hey, Captain Kickstand, right on time! Got your booster seat all ready to go!\u0022 \u0027Gus,\u0027 his nametag said. \n\nD.N. stalked up to the snickering pair, \u0022was that a height joke?! Do *not* try me today, buddy! I am already *short* on p--\u0022\n\nHe just stood there for a moment, his slightly trembling finger before the other Kerb\u0027s face. A large vein throbbed disconcertingly on his neck. The other fellow sounded like he might be choking. \n\n\u0022You--!\u0022 D.N. squealed several octaves too high, then coughed, \u0022you will address me as *sir*, and furthermore--\u0022\n\nGus scoffed, \u0022this ain\u0027t the milit\u0027ry, Fun Size, I\u0027ll call ya sir when ya sign my paychecks.\u0022\n\nThe vein in D.N.\u0027s neck quickly called in reinforcements. \n\n\u0022What ya *are* gonna sign is this here sheet,\u0022 he rapped the clipboard against D.N.\u0027s still-outstretched finger, \u0022that is, if you want the airplane.\u0022 \n\nD.N. curled his hands into claws, for a moment Valentina thought he might go for the other Kerbal\u0027s neck, but he just stood there, twitching. Then he snatched the pen from its holder, furiously scribbled on the page, ripping it, and slammed the pen back into its clip. Where it, of course, bounced out, and went rolling away down the pavement. \n\nGus looked at the pen.\n\nD.N. looked at the pen. \n\n\u0022Y\u0027know, *FOD* is *everyone\u0027s* responsibility,\u0022 Gus said sweetly. \n\nD.N. shook with conniptions, the veins in his neck throbbing ever larger. Valentina wondered if he might simply have an aneurysm right then and there and this entire nonsense could just be called off. But no, he stomped over to the pen, swiped it up from the ground, and slapped it back into the holder somewhat more carefully, Gus and his comrade laughing the whole time. \n\nGus bowed and swept an arm, \u0022your chariot awaits, Lord Farquad!\u0022\n\n\u0022Get in the back!\u0022 D.N. spun and wailed at Valentina, his voice edging on the ultrasonic, \u0022only *qualified* pilots up front!\u0022 Then tromped up his ladder. Rolling her eyes, Valentina started toward the rear ladder when Gus gently caught her arm.  \n\n\u0022Intercom mute switch, left center panel, mum.\u0022 he said with a wink. \n\nAt the rear ladder, the other one nodded with a proper greeting, \u0022good afternoon, mum. Lovely day for a flight, innit?\u0022 Ferlan, his tag said. \n\n\u0022Yes, is very nice,\u0022 she said as she clambered up into the rear cockpit. Ferlan wasted no time securing and rechecking the myriad of straps, cables, and hoses that connected Valentina to the aircraft with the swift, efficient hand of one who knew his job well. Just ahead, D.N. angrily batted away the same assistance from Gus. Finally, Ferlan pulled a long, red, REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT tag from above Valentina\u0027s head. \n\n\u0022Seat\u0027s armed, now, mum. Give the handles a mind,\u0022 he pointed to the large metal hoops just over her shoulders, then rapped twice on her helmet for luck, \u0022right, then, all squared away. Safe flight, mum.\u0022 He nimbly slid down the ladder, unhooked it from the cockpit rim and stowed it on support rig, then took up position next to a large, red fire extinguisher. Gus secured the other ladder before stepping to the front of the aircraft. \n\nA loud, mechanical whine announced the descent of the long bubble canopy. It slipped down into place to a clattering of latches, sealing the two pilots into what was, for the moment, a large plexiglass oven. The sweat that had been held at bay by the light ocean breeze now came running down Valentina\u0027s face in great torrents. Having secured his ear protectors outside, Gus raised his hands, pointed one finger at the sky and waved it in a wide circle. \n\nD.N.\u0027s voice crackled in Valentina\u0027s ear, \u0022all right, let\u0027s see if you remember the briefing. Open the start-up checklist and see if you can get through it. And do *NOT* hot start my aircraft, do you understand?!\u0022\n\n\u0022Da,\u0022 she grunted as she flipped to the relevant page on her kneeboard.\n\n\u0022If you hot start my aircraft I will personally come back there and *thump* you, do you hear me?!\u0022\n\nFor a moment, she considered pulling that ejection handle, but couldn\u0027t quite remember if they worked on the ground or not. She wiped the sweat from her eyes, tuned out the yammering twit ahead of her, and focused on the checklist. \n\nLet\u0027s see... MAIN PWR to BATT... there it is. ENG FEED... ENG FEED... there, switch to NORM, FUEL to MASTER. A regular thudding noise somewhere behind her signaled that the fuel pumps were running. AIR SOURCE to NORM... check parking brake... Ok, JFS to START 1... Just behind Valentina\u0027s head, a loud *sssshhhhhhhhhh* erupted, followed by the low drone of a turbine beginning to spin.\n\n\u0022Get this right! Do *NOT* hot start this aircraft!\u0022 Said the harpy.  \n\nShe watched the RPM PERCENT gauge come to life and slowly begin to rise. 5... 10... 15 percent... A drop of swear rolled into her right eye... Blast, it was hot! Couldn\u0027t they at least put a fan--\n\n*\u0022Hey, what\u0027re you doing?!\u0022*\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419!*\n\nToo late, she lifted the throttle over the idle detent. The engine coughed and sputtered, and the pitch of the drone began to drop. \n\n\u0022Gah, what\u0027s wrong with you?! I tell you not to hot start it so you blow the bottle instead?!\u0022 screeched D.N., \u0022switch to number two and try it again, and do *NOT* make me call those snaggle-toothed Omorkian dopes over for a ground start! Quickly, before we loose any more RPM!\u0022\n\nValentina ground her teeth against a curse, and flipped the JFS switch to START 2. Another rush of air, and the engine began spooling up again. 10... 15... 20... there! She moved the throttle into position, watched the gauges... turbine temperature rising... oil pressure good... hydraulic pressure good... the engine shuddered once more, the low drone now rising to a high-pitched whine that built and built, tempered by a guttural rumbling. Forty percent, JFS off.. 55%, GEN to BOTH, MAIN PWR to ON... 60... 65... 70%... the SEC light on the indicator grid winked out, and the engine finally settled into a throaty roar. \n\n\u0022There, now don\u0027t touch *anything*, gah!\u0022 Blared in her headphones. Various avionics and other systems clicked on in rapid succession. And, mercifully, a cool flow of air from the vent before her. The two ground crew waved before moving away. \n\n\u0022Mucus niner ringworm, ready to taxi.\u0022\n\nA new, rather bored voice came over the radio, \u0022teacup othello macarena, taxi to runway zero-niner and hold short.\u0022\n\n\u0022Roger, hold short,\u0022 a click, \u0022do *not* touch *anything* until I tell you! If you really screw something up the call will be \u0027eject, eject, eject,\u0027 and if you say \u0027what?\u0027 you\u0027ll be talking to yourself cuz I won\u0027t be here. And most of all *do NOT vomit in my aircraft!*\u0022\n\n\u0022*D\u0414*.\u0022\n\n*\u0022And cut that out!\u0022*\n\nValentina bared her teeth at him, and folded her arms. The haranguing continued as the small aircraft made its way to the end of the runway. This was a test of patience the likes of which no one should have to endure. At least the intercom had a volume control. Pity the *P\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI* himself didn\u0027t. But, strangely... it *did* feel good to be back in a proper aircraft again. Even if she was just a passenger. \n\nThe plane pivoted around just before the edge of the runway, and the radio blared again, \u0022ginseng steeple handsaw, holding short runway zero-niner. Request flapjack upchuck departure.\u0022\n\n\u0022Roger, washtub onion plunger, cleared for takeoff. Don\u0027t dawdle,\u0022 the eye-roll was apparent in the voice.\n\nD.N. nudged the aircraft forward, turned exactly onto the center line, stopped. Somewhere behind, the engine howled into new fury like a thing unbound, the racket challenged only by the deafening *whoosh* of air rushing into the intakes that flanked Valentina\u0027s seat. The trainer bucked and rattled but didn\u0027t creep forward a centimeter. The control stick swung several times in wide circles, and managed to smack Valentina in the knees each time. \n\nFinally, a disturbingly calm voice cut through the noise, \u0022and here... we.... go.....\u0022\n\nThe brakes released, and the plane shot forward like the proverbial winged mammal from a warm place. Acceleration shoved Valentina into her seat as a rumbling below rapidly grew in cadence and intensity. Abruptly it stopped, with only a subtle shift from the craft, followed by a series of loud thumps as the landing gear retracted. But the ground did not drop away, only hurtled past the canopy faster and faster. She couldn\u0027t see past the seat back in front of her, but they must be nearing--\n\n\u0022Express elevator to heaven, going.... *UP!\u0022*\n\nNow she was *crushed* down into her seat, her G-suit automatically squeezing her legs in a desperate bid to keep the blood from rushing out of her head. It was over in an instant, the horizon outside now skewed around as the nimble plane shot straight up like a rocket toward the brilliant blue sky and puffy, white clouds. Airspeed continued to climb for a moment, the altimeter spinning around and around. Then the stick jerked abruptly to the left, and the plane spun about its own axis once, twice, thr-- no, it ceased, and centripetal force crushed again as it pulled...\n\nInverted. \n\nValentina hung from her straps, arms still crossed, feeling rather nonplussed. That irritating bit of hair had worked its way free of her helmet, but was now dangling *up*. Still, she did have to admit the view was quite spectacular like this. The sea spread out below in a stunning vista, like an artist\u0027s study of every shade of blue in the spectrum. Fragile turquoise lined the shores along Cape Kernaveral, quickly surrendering to a deep, penetrating azure mottled darker here and there by the scattered clouds above. Tiny specks of white accented and gave texture to the surface, the golden light of the afternoon sun shone on it like a polished lamp, and...\n\nThat\u0027s odd. \n\nThere were at least a dozen more immense propellium tankers sitting at anchor below, just north of the cape. That\u0027s an *awful* lot of fuel for a space program about to im--\n\nHer thought was cut off as the plane snap-rolled upright, smacking both her knee and her head. \n\n\u0022All right, I\u0027m going to demonstrate some basic maneuvers,\u0022 D.N. buzzed in Valentina\u0027s ear, \u0022and do NOT vomit in my aircraft! We\u0027ll start with a loop...\u0022\n\n\u0022Think you can *handle* a loop?\u0022 Valentina grumbled, a bit louder than she should have. \n\n\u0022Think you can handle the music?\u0022 he mocked back in a whiny voice. Before she could respond, her ears were once again assaulted by one of those obnoxiously catchy foreign rock songs. \n\n\u0022Masks on!\u0022 \n\nShe barely had a chance to figure out the unfamiliar clip before gee force smashed her into her seat.\n\n\u0022Wooooohoooo!\u0022 cried D.N. as the plane passed inverted again. No sooner had it pulled level than he banked *hard* to the right, *hard* to the left, leading them through a stomach-turning series of rolls, dives, and climbs then shooting vertical again. Engine screaming, the small craft clawed for altitude. \n\n\u0022Hammerhead!\u0022 He squealed, mashing a rudder pedal just before the plane ran out of energy, flicking it to the left and now charging straight down at the waiting sea. Speed built and built, the sound of rushing air drowning out the wailing engine, then he yanked back *hard* on the stick. The wings screamed in protest, Valentina felt the flesh pulled down away from her face, but kept her arms firmly crossed despite the crushing weight. \n\nPulling level for a few moments, D.N. yelled, \u0022Coooooooo-BRAAAAAAAAAA!\u0022 and jerked the nose up just past vertical before dropping it back down again. He dove away toward the nearest cloud, pulled up just before plunging into it. The agile little trainer jinked and twisted, swooped and rolled, a tiny gray speck against the brilliant white flank of the cloud. Tendrils of mist seemed to stretch out to it like reaching hands, but it darted away as easily as a dragonfly, D.N. giggling like a schoolboy the whole time. \n\n\u0022*This* is the beating heart of air combat!\u0022 He proclaimed, while Valentina was roughly shoved about the cockpit, and occasionally battered by the flight stick, \u0022you must have *complete* confidence in your aircraft and your ability! It\u0027s not enough to *think* you\u0027re the best, you have to *know* you\u0027re the best! Run right up to the edge of the envelope and tickle it! You have to trust your aircraft like sacred vessel, like a suit of armor. An iron eagle that *noth-ing can pen-e-trate!*\u0022\n\n\u0022Iron eagle?\u0022 Valentina said tiredly.\n\n\u0022Yes, iron eagle!\u0022 He spat, \u0022what kinda fighter pilot are you, anyway?!\u0022\n\nValentina grunted, \u0022am not fighter pilot, am *test* pilot. I fly airplane I do not trust, and have no confidence in, to go *past* edge of envelope and *find* it so big-head cowboy like you not go too far.\u0022\n\n\u0022Think you\u0027re so hot?!\u0022 D.N. snarled, \u0022ok turkey, *you* fly it!\u0022\n\nAbruptly the stick jerked forward and Valentina was pulled up against her straps as the plane nose dived toward the ground. She sighed, unconsciously huffing at the hair that was once again hanging toward the canopy. She sat there another moment before serenely wrapping her gloved hands around the controls, cataloging by feel the various buttons and knobs. \n\nBeneath her mask, a wicked smile slowly split her face...\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u0022...so I says.... I says... I says...\u0022 Gus *tried* to say, amidst a fit of chortles, \u0022\u0027bugger that for a box of bananas, I\u0027d rather sleep by the lake!\u0027\u0022\n\nHe and Ferlan erupted into loud, shrieking laughter, rocking back and forth atop the cab of their fuel truck and slapping their knees. \n\n\u0022Blimey, that one always kills me, it does!\u0022 Ferlan managed before another round of cackles took him. \n\nPresently, the portable radio on his belt crackled, pulling them kicking and screaming from their revelry. \n\n\u0022Welp, look like we got incoming, mate,\u0022 Gus said as he raised his binoculars. He saw a *Fleischgewehr* turn onto final, coasting down toward the runway as if it were on rails. There was no bark of rubber as the tires touched down, only a gentle settling of the landing gear. \n\n\u0022Cor, ain\u0027t that Dean\u0027s plane?\u0022 He muttered, unbelieving. \n\n\u0022Naw,\u0022 Said Ferlan as he lowered his own binoculars, \u0022*Dean* ain\u0027t even *that* smooth.\u0022\n\nThe pair looked on in bewilderment as the plane passed their position, nose-high, bleeding off speed. They glanced at each other, shrugged, and hopped down to don their gear. \n\nA few minutes later Gus stood on the ramp, directing the plane forward with large red paddles in his hands. He crossed them, gave the aircraft a moment to stop, drew one quickly across his neck. The roaring engine calmed, spooling down. Ferlan stepped forward with a ladder, but before the canopy had opened even halfway, a trembling and rather... pungent form tumbled out and smacked roughly onto the concrete. \n\n\u0022By the Queen\u0027s frilly brassiere...\u0022 Gus swore. \n\n\u0022And \u0027er knickers too,\u0022 Ferlan added, the ladder forgotten in his hands, \u0022*Dean\u0027s puked \u0027imself!*\u0022\n\n*\u0022Dean\u0027s puked \u0027imself!\u0022*\n\nThe two looked at each other, then burst into great, roaring waves of laughter. Face down on the ground, D.N.\u0027s shoulders heaved while he coughed and gagged. He managed to look up at his tormentors, dirt from the pavement now clinging to the sticky, reeking, technicolor mess that covered his face. Trails of drool and snot hung from his mouth. Gus thought he might even have been crying. \n\n\u0022Yer buying the case tonight, you rot-faced li\u0027l imp!\u0022 Gus crowed. They pointed and laughed louder than ever before. \n\nA bit further back, and completely spotless, Valentina hopped lightly down from the cockpit, despite the ladder still being in Ferlan\u0027s hands. The laughter died away as she approached the other two, replaced by gaping wonder. Grinning broadly, she doffed her helmet, and pressed it into Gus\u0027s arms.\n\n\u0022How you say... fill her up, yes?\u0022 She winked, before setting off back towards the hangar, her ponytail bouncing jauntily behind. The ground crew could only stare after her in awe. \n\n\u0022Wow,\u0022 Gus breathed, \u0022what a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKer\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E*belle*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yeah...\u0022 Ferland said dreamily beside him, still clutching the ladder. Gus glanced at his comrade, rolled his eyes, then reached over and closed Ferlan\u0027s mouth for him. \n\nWhich was unfortunate, as his tongue was still hanging out. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-27T09:09:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2020 09:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"lodger","CreatedById":126565,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T09:38:43Z","Content":"Now, looks like D.N. learned his lesson the hard way.

I\u0027m just-- ugh. Have a seat, please.\u0022\n\nValentina did as he said. Outside the office windows, the day\u0027s last light was beginning its retreat from the land in a spectacular display. Somehow, she didn\u0027t think Gene had noticed. The bags under his eyes looked big enough to ship rocket parts, and his skin had gone from wan to dreadfully pale. She wondered if he\u0027d slept at all since she\u0027d been here yesterday. J.R. was here too, oddly enough, sitting next to Gene\u0027s desk with his ever-present grin replaced by a strange look of concern. \n\n\u0022So... I\u0027ve got the most usual report in front of me,\u0022 Gene put a hand on the paper on his desk, the other rubbing his eyes, \u0022about a biohazard cleanup in this aircraft...\u0022\n\nAwkward glances were shared by the three Kerbals in the small room.\n\n\u0022You said, do not go easy on him,\u0022 Valentina offered cautiously. \n\n\u0022I did say that,\u0022 Gene seemed surprised by the statement. \n\n\u0022Well, still,\u0022 J.R. broke in, \u0022these circumstances are... well, *most* unusual...\u0022 He absently flipped through his own sheaf of papers. \n\n\u0022Um, what exactly did you *do* up there?\u0022 Gene finally asked. \n\nShe told them. \n\nA rocketship-themed clock on the shelf softly ticked away the time. Scattered papers rustled ever so slightly as the air handlers above cycled on. A fly that had been hanging on the wall took to the air, buzzing around in wide, lazy circles. It flew in and out of J.R.\u0027s gaping, unmoving mouth, then circled a bit more before alighting on Gene\u0027s equally inert eyeball. It wandered about here and there, occasionally having a nosh. Finding little of interest, it eventually buzzed off. \n\nIt took some time for Gene to rally his mouth into coherent motion, but when he finally did, he said, \u0022that\u0027s... not possible. A 5894 can\u0027t *do* that...\u0022\n\nJ.R. shook himself, then rifled through his papers, \u0022accordin\u0027 to the flight data recorder, it, um...\u0022\n\nHe looked at Gene, \u0022...did.\u0022\n\n\u0022But... the airframe... the wings... the *undercarriage*...\u0022 Gene muttered as he leaned back roughly in his seat. \n\nMore shuffling, \u0022Ah\u0027ve got a crew doin\u0027 a full inspection as we speak, but according to the preliminary...\u0022 flip, flip, \u0022the aircraft\u0027s perfectly fine.  Even straightened out a tweaked stringer.\u0022\n\nGene rubbed his hands over his face again, \u0022this can\u0027t go on...\u0022\n\n\u0022I am sorry,\u0022 Valentina pleaded, \u0022but he is just such titanic...\u0022\n\nShe waved her hands vaguely as she struggled for the word, \u0022wash-bag... shower head... *hose bib...!*\u0022\n\nJ.R. blinked, \u0022d\u0027you mean d--*ouch, mah shin!*\u0022 A tiny rocked bounced around the office, ending with a hollow crack. \n\n\u0022Tar*nation* that smarts!\u0022 he cried as he rubbed feverishly at his leg. \n\n\u0022Ohhhhhhhh...\u0022 Gene\u0027s voice sounded on the verge of tears, \u0022my model...\u0022 In his hand, he cradled a dozen bits of gold-colored plastic. He just stared at them for a long time. He tried to pick a single one up, but it crumbled between his fingers. \n\nAt length, he let out a long sigh, \u0022I don\u0027t want to keep you, Valentina. I did tell you not to go easy on him, and the plane seems to be fine, so don\u0027t let it trouble you any more.\u0022  \n\nMore uncomfortable silence spread out while Gene stirred at the DUOS wreckage in his hand with a stubby finger. Valentina quietly let herself out. \n\nShe had almost reached the elevator when J.R. caught her arm, \u0022miss Valentina, a moment, please.\u0022\n\nShe looked up at him cautiously, \u0022yes?\u0022\n\nHe pursed his lips in thought, worry creasing his forehead, before he spoke, \u0022this whole thing is mah fault.\u0022\n\n\u0022How... do you mean?\u0022\n\n\u0022The Spaceplane program is directly under *our* administration, that makes Dean *my* Kerb. Ah never should have let things deteriorate to this level, and for that, Ah do apologize. Ah\u0027ll have a talk him.\u0022\n\n\u0022And don\u0027t you worry, Ah give you mah word,\u0022 the rapacious grin returned, with new ferocity, \u0022he *won\u0027t* trouble you again.\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Bing*\n\nThe elevator doors slid closed. Valentina felt very, well, troubled. Not even the stack of extra-rubbery cheeseburgers from the cafeteria had managed to assuage that. This all felt too... familiar. \n\nA sinking in her stomach, not at all related to those cheeseburgers, signaled the elevator\u0027s ascent. Maybe she *had* been too rough on D.N. Maybe she should have backed off when he\u0027d started screaming like a sorority girl in one of those silly horror films that came on late at night. \n\nSuch ridiculous things, she always ended up rooting for the monster. The victims were just so *stupid*. And they usually brought the whole thing on themselves, anyway. She could completely understand why something would want to disembowel them. Their own fault, really. Own fault. \n\nThe doors *bing*ed open, driving the thought away. With a huff for that stubborn lock of hair, Valentina stepped off. \n\nStill, it had felt good to take him down a p--\n\nShe nearly walked right into him again. D.N. stood in the hallway, a towel hanging over his shoulders, hair damp and tousled. There was still a faint odor, and he looked a bit... shorter. \n\nHis eyes met hers only for an instant, then went back to studying the floor, \u0022oh. Hey.\u0022\n\nSilence stretched on. D.N. scratched at the back of his head. \n\n\u0022That was some first rate flying up there,\u0022 he said softly, not looking up, \u0022you should be proud.\u0022\n\nValentina could feel her mouth working soundlessly, but her brain seemed to have halted. \n\nHis eyes darted to hers for another instant, \u0022and also, I\u0027m sorry.\u0022\n\nAs he shuffled past, Valentina could only stare down the hallway in stunned disbelief. \n\n\u0022Donald Nelson.\u0022\n\nThe words pulled her out of her fugue, and she turned, finally driving sound from her throat, \u0022w... what?\u0022\n\nD.N. stood at the door to his room, hand on the knob. He squeezed his eyes shut before pushing it open.\n\n\u0022That\u0027s my name. Donald Nelson Kerman.\u0022\n\nThe door closed behind him, the lock sliding home with a soft click. \n\nValentina stared at the empty hallway, more troubled than ever. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-18T05:30:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2016 05:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"vsully","CreatedById":129549,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T11:09:28Z","Content":"![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)\n\nGreat chapter!\n\nAlso....

Sacrifice... must be made.\u0022\n\n\u0022They\u0027re ready for you, now,\u0022 said a large, gruff-looking Kerbal in a crisp uniform.\n\nGene pursed his lips as he held out a hand, \u0022you\u0027re a brave Kerbelle, Valentina Kermanova. Good luck. One way or another, I\u0027ll see you on the other side.\u0022\n\nShe smiled and shook his hand. His grip felt weak and sickly. But that was a concern for later. For now... Valentina squinted against the light beyond, and stepped forward...\n\n...the assault began immediately. A thundering rush of screams, whistles, and cat-calls. The cold sweat of a moment before became flowing rivulets as the harsh spotlights seemed to burn her flesh. She crept out, half blind, raising a hand against the glare. \n\n\u0022That\u0027s right, ladies and *germs..*. *you know what time it is!*\u0022\n\n***Boom-boom thud.*** ***Boom-boom thud.*** **** ***Boom-boom thud.*** **** ***Boom-boom thud.*** \n\nThe percussion beat at Valentina like blast waves. In front, she could just make out a couple of onlookers slapping bottles against their open palms in time to the beat. \n\n***Trial by fire! Trial by fire! Trial by fire! Trial by fire! Trial by fire!***\n\nHad... had it been this loud before? She could feel the sound pushing her back like a physical thing. It was like leaning into a hurricane. \n\n\u0022Our victim tonight needs noooooooooo introduction... *but I\u0027ma do it anyway!\u0022*\n\nThe chant shattered into a thousand, thousand screaming, calling voices. \n\n\u0022All the way Kermangrad, Ussari, put your hands together for Valentina Kermanova!\u0022\n\nLouder, ever louder the uproar grew. Whistles, shrieks, and some things that sounded quite crude even if she had no idea what the words meant. With hands that felt weak and trembling like Gene\u0027s only moments before, she took the microphone from its stand, nearly dropping it. She had faced down plenty of things that could kill her. There had been no fear then. Once you were dead, it was over with. She had faced clicking cameras and obnoxious reporters, even cheering crowds, but nothing... nothing could stand to this. It took a conscious effort to keep her knees from knocking together. Her bladder felt suddenly full. Maybe she should have skipped that last--\n\nAt once, the noise died away.\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419*, that\u0027s the cue!\n\nValentina lifted a microphone that felt like lead... and began to *whistle*...\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe last few notes rang to silence, Valentina held her own a breath longer. A drop of sweat rolled into her eye, stinging like fire. That infuriating bit of hair was plastered to the skin between them. Yet despite her sopping face, her mouth felt like she\u0027d been eating crackers and sand. Her throat was a desiccated waste, her larynx a little ball of pure pain. Shoulders heaving, her arm dropped away, the microphone barely remaining in her grip. If it were lead before, it was something far heavier now. Degenerate matter, perhaps. If her mind were still capable of conscious thought, it would have been amazed she was still upright. \n\nBeyond the stage, hundreds of pairs of unblinking eyes bore down upon her. Nothing moved, nothing made a sound. Only tiny motes of dust danced back and forth in the blinding glare of the lights. Heart pounding in her ears, Valentina could only stand there as time stretched on, and await the inevitable. \n\nSomeone in the back coughed. \n\nSomeone sniffed. \n\nSo did someone else. \n\n\u0022That...\u0022 said a fragile voice in the front row.\n\n\u0022That was bloody brilliant.\u0022\n\n\u0022Hell yeah it was,\u0022 said another.\n\n\u0022Mate!\u0022\n\n\u0022Bro!\u0022\n\n\u0022Let\u0027s never quarrel again!\u0022\n\n\u0022I love you, man!\u0022\n\nTwo Kerbals in the front embraced, and the crowd... well, to say it exploded would be like saying the sun\u0027s nuclear fire was warm. The wave of cheers *would* have blown Valentina clear off her feet and some distance backstage if they had not rushed the stage at the very same time. She found herself hoisted on shoulders to whoops and whistles, applause and exaltations. All around the bar-goers hugged, or shook or slapped hands, all to cries of--\n\n\u0022Peace!\u0022 \n\n\u0022Love!\u0022\n\n\u0022Understanding!\u0022\n\n\u0022Free drinks!\u0022\n\nThe hullabaloo instantly stopped, and all eyes turned to Ol\u0027 Sam...\n\n\u0022Not bloody likely, yah cheap bunch o\u0027 reprobates!\u0022\n\nThe crowd let out a collective \u0022*awwwwwwww*\u0022 before returning to their revelry. A thought fought for attention in Valentina\u0027s mind, but was constantly shoved out of the way as she tried with only moderate success to avoid the decorations hanging from the ceiling. A new chant slowly emerged from the fray...\n\n**One of us! One of us! One of us! One of us!**\n\nThe celebrations of new-found fraternity continued long into the night, which was a bit odd as everyone generally got on pretty well even before then. No one would say it out loud, if they acknowledged the thought at all, but an excuse to party seemed quite welcome just at the moment.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n Some time later, Valentina stumbled out into the cool night air, while the noises of carousel continued inside. She bounded along, occasionally skipping and twirling, feeling very much unlike herself. She wondered for the umpteenth time what it was Ol\u0027 Sam put in those drinks. She felt fuzzy and light and so very much *alive*. \n\nA thick full M\u00FCn hung low in the sky, bloated and pallid and casting a sickly pale light. Valentina paused to stick her tongue out at it. No, not even the *M\u00FCn* could spoil her mood tonight! She did it! She finally *did* it!\n\n*One of us....*\n\nValentina trotted along, not really caring where she was going, a long, disfigured shadow trailing out beside her. She had faced the Foreigners on their own terms, and won their respect. She left the bar not as an exotic outsider, but as *one of us...*\n\n...right?\n\nAnd best of all, she had finally stuck it to that obnoxious *P\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI* *Dean*, and--\n\n*Donald*.\n\nShe stopped. \n\nHis name was *Donald*. \n\nWhy did everyone call him Dean? \n\nShe trotted on again. They probably just didn\u0027t like him. Not that she could blame them, how could *anyone* like someone like--\n\nShe stopped again. Only... that wasn\u0027t right... was it?\n\nValentina moved on, with perhaps a bit less trot in her step. She wouldn\u0027t let the odd thoughts spoil her mood. She felt on top of the world! That was quite the odd phrase, really. She\u0027d grown up not that far from the top of the world. It was all ice and snow and whumpers up there, hardly seemed like the place a happy person would *want* to be. \n\nAnyway, Dean- *Donald*- was stubborn enough, he\u0027d get over this. And besides, her time here was growing short now. She needed to think of some gifts. Wouldn\u0027t do to be a rude guest, if maybe she could return some day. She might have to make a few phone calls, and--\n\nSome distance away, just past the east fence, a police VTOL streaked by, lights on and siren screaming. Hmmm. That wasn\u0027t good. That was *never* good. That meant someone was having a bad night. She hoped it got better for them, whoever they were. No one should be having a bad night, not tonight. \n\nYes, it would be all right. These were strong people. Stubborn, and strange, but strong. They would find a way to keep this space program going. All those tankers, after all. Must be a need. What else ran on propellium? Not all these ridiculous kars, they just used standard jet fuel. If not for the space program, why else--\n\nA sudden rush nearly knocked her off her feet. A fire department VTOL shrieked past just overhead, flanked by two more police cruisers. For a moment, brilliant red strobes cast twisted shadows on the ground. That... *certainly* wasn\u0027t good. Maybe just something minor, a kitten in a tree perhaps? Or maybe--\n\nSomething *else* nearly knocked her over, or rather some*one*. Valentina watched the dark figure sprint in the direction of the emergency vehicles. A night breeze caught her neck just so, sending a chill down her spine. \n\nYes, that was all... just a breeze... certainly not the rising cloud of inky black smoke in the distance, silhouetted by the M\u00FCn and lit from below by a deep orange glow. \n\nAnother person ran past, then another and another. A vast stampede of bodies swept Valentina off her feet, carried her along amidst cries and yells.\n\n*What happened?* \n\n*Where?* \n\n*Just outside the fence!*\n\n*It\u0027s a fire!*\n\n*No, an, explosion!*\n\n*No, a crash!* \n\n*How?*\n\n*Who?*\n\nThe throng broke against the perimeter fence like a vast wave, somehow depositing Valentina at the very front. All around people jockeyed for position, crushed her as the fence groaned in protest. \n\nAn ashen-faced police officer, his face streaked with soot, tried impotently to wave the crowd back, \u0022go on, back up! You\u0027ll take the whole fence down, there\u0027s razor wire up there!\u0022 His voice was weak and breaking. \n\nValentina tried to push back, make a space for herself, bathed in infernal crimson light. Not far away, one of the stunted, ubiquitous palm trees that surrounded the space center was ablaze. Thick, oily smoke rose up from it, flames danced around its waving fronds. There, at the base, a twisted form embraced the trunk like a lover. A trail of ruin led from it back to a curve in the perimeter road. Valentina could feel the heat searing her skin. From somewhere, a sound, thin and reedy like... like a...\n\n\u0022Why don\u0027t they *do* something? Why are they just standing around?!\u0022\n\nThe firefighters seemed to mill about aimlessly. Two of them half dragged one of their comrades back, a large extinguisher in his hands. Turning away from the conflagration, he threw it angrily to the ground where it bounced with a hollow ring. \n\nThe police officer raised placating hands to the crowd, \u0022move back, you lot! Off the fence!\u0022 Wide, darting eyes betrayed mounting panic beneath. \n\n\u0022Why don\u0027t they ***DO*** something?!\u0022\n\n\u0022Th... there\u0027s no hydrant out here! The tanker apparatus is on its way, but they\u0027re having trouble--\u0022\n\n\u0022Do something!\u0022\n\n\u0022***DO*** something!\u0022\n\nHe began to shrink back, looking this way and that as if about to flee from the throng.\n\n\u0022Randall! Randall, it\u0027s me, Fredsby!\u0022 Yelled someone next to Valentina, as he tried to reach a hand though the fence, \u0022c\u0027mon, Kerb, you *know* me! Our kerblings to to school together!\u0022\n\n\u0022...know?\u0022 confusion flashed in Randall\u0027s face, then he and everyone else jumped as another gout of fire erupted from the wreckage, sending bits of flaming metal high into the air. The inferno roared like a thing alive, boasting, gloating. It roared... and *whispered*...\n\n\u0022Randall, what *happened?*\u0022 Screamed Fredsby.\n\n\u0022Yeah, what happened?!\u0022\n\n\u0022Tell us!\u0022\n\n*\u0022Tell us!\u0022*\n\nThat horrible, horrible thin reedy sound droned on again. All around, people clasped hands to their ears to block it out. Then a loud crack, and another. Orange-white sparks exploded into the night air, carried upward by the breath of the pyre, as the base of the tree ripped in half. With a slow, guttural creaking, the blazing palm toppled over and smashed into the burning hulk beneath it, scattering fiery debris all around. Demonic shadows danced and writhed and cavorted from the perverted light. \n\nRandall lifted his face from where he\u0027d been hiding it in his hands, smeared with ash and soot and sweat and tears.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s Dean,\u0022 he croaked.\n\n\u0022Dean\u0027s dead.\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-21T05:57:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2016 05:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"lodger","CreatedById":126565,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T14:35:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, RocketSquid said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Wow, where\u0027s that picture from?
