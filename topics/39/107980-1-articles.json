The Kerbal Union launched it into an elliptical low Kerbin orbit on 4 Koctober K957. It was a 58 cm (23 in) diameter polished metal sphere, with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. It was visible all around Kerbin and its radio pulses were detectable. This surprise K957 success precipitated in the Kerbal States Ksputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race, a part of the larger Kold War. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments.\n\nJokes aside..![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif), I hope you like it and sorry for the GUI..
