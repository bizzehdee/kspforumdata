Then I (this part was super long and super hard) learned how to draw a great circle on an equirectangular plot, and filled in one half with black for the night side, and then with the Photoshop 3D feature to map it to a sphere. \n\nIts like a (geographically and visually accurate) cartoon of Mars!\n\n(Edit!) Updated to be more sophisticated! The new image is how Mars would appear to a satellite looking from the Sun-Mars Lagrange Point-1, at the time and date of this edit.
