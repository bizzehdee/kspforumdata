This is the first mission to the Mun, a trip to land on Farside Crater with, as expected, Jebediah Kerman as pilot. This isn\u0027t a stock game. I\u0027m using KAS, KSP Interstellar, Kethane, Mechjeb, Actions on the fly, Editor extensions and Firespitter. I\u0027ve made a custom tree based on Interstellar\u0027s tree but I\u0027m starting this AAR after Kerbals have already got off the ground, so to speak. There have been a few simple missions, suborbital and orbital, but this is their first efforts beyond Kerbin\u0027s low orbit. With KSP Interstellar it is going to end up high tech, but that will take a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have imposed a rule to myself on science. After data is gathered Kerbals need time to actually do research to get something out of it. It\u0027s a little simplified, but I figure a day per science point used is good. (EDIT: given the high cost of late game science I changed this to 3pts per day before I\u0027d done the first research topic after Farside Crater Mission) I\u0027m not going to be going all out for heavy research on missions, trying to eke out every last drop from a biome (though this mission I got more than I thought. I didn\u0027t know the special biomes had better science scores on surface samples!)... at least in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I may have pinched names of Kerbals from others. I\u0027m pretty sure Gene is part of the whole Kerbal backstory, but Ornie may just be KSK\u0027s personal character he did for his story \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33400-First-Flight\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFirst Flight\u003C/a\u003E.

He knew how Jeb felt. He\u0027d been on numerous orbital flights himself and the pre-launch jitters got him too. Jeb though hadn\u0027t seemed to be affected like this before, even on the flight of Kerbal-1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this was a trip to the Mun! What Kerbalkind had been dreaming of for decades. What the team here at KSC had been struggling to achieve for the last four years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh huh.\u0022 Bob said, attaching an airline to Jeb\u0027s suit and getting a quizical look from a technician. Maybe that had been his job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey guys! Control says they\u0027re starting the countdown again!\u0022 Bill shouted from up the corridor. \u0022Get that slowpoke in the capsule already!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You heard him Jeb.

When his straps were checked he got a final thumbs up as everyone pulled back. An electric humm, a hiss and the hatch clanged shut above him, sealing him in.

A few moments later and he was sealed back inside and strapping down... just incase he needed to fire the engines unexpectedly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe view from in here was nowhere near as impressive with the tiny window, but it was just as crisp and clear and Jeb grinned as he watched the view with half an eye, and the incoming descent burn revisions from Mission Control with the other half.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunshadow was boring. He\u0027d already been in the dark before hitting the radio shadow from Kerbin, but it was still dark through most of the comms blackout. They were talking about getting relay satellites out here as well as Kethane scanning probes, but that was a little way off yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027d had a few reports to write up, and he was pretty sure Gene had lined that up on purpose to keep him busy. Still he got those done with over a quarter hour to spare before he left the radio shadow. That meant he\u0027d been five minutes with NOTHING TO DO, before Kerbolrise over the Munar disk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt had been touch and go. The controls called to him and he desperately wanted to give her a spin, literally. But he really didn\u0027t want to loose power in the dark before the solar panels could start to recharge him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he went over this in his head he saw a slight brightening on the disk edge of the Mun. Mun ridges and crater edges catching and reflecting sunlight before it could directly reach him. Grinning he did spin the ship now, lining up a good shot for his camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbol blasted into view like a bomb going off, the glinting yellow light seeming to flood the capsule after his time in the dark. A long \u0027Aaaaaaah\u0027 escaped Jeb\u0027s lips quietly as he took several shots of the spectacle. In fact he was still snapping five minutes later when he left radio shadow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Munar One, this is Flight. Come in Munar One.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They say the Mun is cold and grey Flight. I disagree.

Farside Crater. It was an impressive impact crater, very large compared to the Mun\u0027s size.

One to orbit brake, and one for final deceleration on touchdown. EECOM confirms we still have fuel reserves for this?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, Wernher still gets his baby Munar One.\u0022 Gene said, with some grumbling in the background. \u0022Telemetry shows you good on alignment for braking burn. Standby Munar One.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore waiting. A slight twitch was forming in Jeb\u0027s right cheek, but he held it in check. The view and the sheer enormity of what he was doing helped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Plot looks good. Sixty seconds to burn. Systems check on descent engines Munar One.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems Gene was aware of what Jeb was thinking. Chuckling as the check kept him busy during the last minute Jeb went through the checklist. There was a slight over-pressure alarm on tank four, but with a re-check it seemed the gauge had jammed. He probably should have rotated the ship more after coming out into the sunlight. Kerbol was a harsh mistress out here in the vacuum of space. Thermal variance could get pretty extreme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022T minus ten seconds Munar One.\u0022 Jildon\u0027s tones came across with Gene muttering in the background to someone, then the countdown started and Jeb released the safeties one final time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Three... two... one... Ignition.\u0022 Jeb said, and the descent engines\u0027 drove him into his seat once more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESix LV-909s didn\u0027t provide much thrust, but on this small a ship it was a severe kick in the pants. Especially after over three quarters of an hour of weightlessness. Vibrations started again as the little ship cut it\u0027s orbital velocity. Jeb almost automatically wanted to bring the heading onto retrograde, but the burn called for vectoring purely horizontally to leave the pod descending nearly vertically for the final course to touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe numbers on his panel rolled by and Jeb smiled, feeling the pod respond smoothly, well, almost smoothly, to his touch. There was still that slight wobble from the yaw reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And... engine shutdown.\u0022 Jeb said into the silence as all six drives cut out. \u0022I\u0027m reading us on course by the numbers Flight. Spinning to get a visual on the target.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capsule spun lazily around, pointing down as it slowly picked up speed towards the surface 45km below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We read good on your course too Munar One.\u0022 Gene said, as Mission Control got rather quiet \u0022We have a go for manual descent and target acquisition. Good luck!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb got some detailed figures by lining up the nose camera on the target sub-crater, then slowly spun the ship back vertical again and extended the landing legs. Early yes, but he didn\u0027t want to forget them like he did in that simulator run back in KSC!

Flicking the drive and easing the nose carefully he brought his path as close to the edge of the sub-crater as possible, judging his final descent burn and how it and how the Mun\u0027s rotation would shift the vector, hopefully to the center of the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he passed seven thousand meters he glanced out the starboard window and sighed.

Tell me they had a hard lock on me this whole time, hmm Flight?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill no chuckle from Gene. Jeb hardly expected it.

How\u0027s the landing vector look from up there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a slight hint of worry in Gene\u0027s voice so Jeb drew his attention back to the landing. Still on course, though the speed had slowed a hair too much. Didn\u0027t want to get off plot! He cut the engines for a while. Heck, they were barely running anyway right now, just aligning his profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Looking good flight. I see the target, looks even with surrounding terrain in color.

He jammed the engines on, but it was a bit late. With a sudden crack the little craft hit at over twenty meters per second... and bounced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*WOOT-WOOT-WOOT*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Pressure alarm on leg hydraulics!
