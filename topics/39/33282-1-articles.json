The main tool I use is FL Studio. It available on Amazon (Fruity Ed) for around $100, although I use the Producer Ed. which is quite a bit more costly (I think it was 400 on Amazon.)

They are each separate costs such as Philharmonic Orchestra have higher costs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMusic is more expressions of the heart and soul.
