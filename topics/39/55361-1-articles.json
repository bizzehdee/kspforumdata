It fires projectiles meant to blow up at different ranges, in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut why all that trouble? Have a cup of tea, it\u0027s a long story. Also, I added some story elements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast time, my anti air weaponry fired modified decouplers as flak. That worked for a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman stands beside the cannon, and fires it at the test missile coming in from an angle. The sluggish projectiles arcs over the descending missile, but by some \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eminor miracle, the missile is hit by a stray projectile and blows up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Boss? You might want to make some changes to these..things, they seem to be too slow.\u0022 Bill wipes his forehead, or attempts to anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was about to reply, but then... an alarm breaks out. It\u0027s from a station housing jets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Multiple fast moving blips inbound. Take cov-\u0022. The mechanized voice stops abruptly as a wave of explosions decimate the airbase 2.5 km away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some analysis, it turned out that the flak projectiles that missed fell onto the base and destroyed it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter one minute of mourning, I set to work on stronger and faster projectiles. One that would be strong enough to break free from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy some act of fourth wall gods, I created a decoupler that would definitely go on an escape velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI scheduled a test fire at dusk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moon was just rising as a heavily armoured missile came inbound directly to the missile platform. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill calmly fires. A cloud of projectiles rapidly fly towards the missile, knocking it to its side. Another burst of flak destroys the missile through the fragile parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Boss? I think it\u0027s good enough. Look! The projectiles are on a escape velocity now!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA smile forms on my lips, and I turned my attention to my M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn Station. As usual, Jeb Kerman has volunteered to land on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn via EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough the command centre screen, Jeb salutes the staff before descending. He makes ground safely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science crew cheer, but are cut short by a blared warning from the station itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Multiple blips on an intercept course detected. ETA 30 seconds. Recommend evasive maneuvers and raising ablative covers. \u0022 From a nearby probe in higher orbit, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewe watch as the station raises the covers towards the blips...towards the probe, and fires thrusters. The probe camera blinks out to Jeb\u0027s cameras.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom his view, a ball of fire erupts briefly from the probe\u0027s last known location. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022 Attention all crew. Unknown projectile ETA 10 seconds. Brace for impact. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple explosions are seen on the ablative shield covers. Cracks start to appear, and some parts start to break off. I glare at my science team,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethey must have used cheap jet structural parts for these covers. Abruptly, the impacts stop - the hail of flak must have passed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science team breathes a sigh of relief, and some start to drink koffee. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFFFFF;\u0022\u003ESuddenly, the station is impacted again from the second round of flak. This time, the ablative shield covers shatter on first contact. The hapless station shakes wildly as impacts \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFFFFF;\u0022\u003Eand explosions take their toll. The station is engulfed in many small fireballs..before becoming one itself.
