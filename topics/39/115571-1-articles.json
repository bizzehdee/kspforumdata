Their first twelve decades of probing the star sytem have provided valuable information for textbooks back home.\n\n***Stars***\n\n**Sol**\n\nThe largest star of the Sol System, it is an absolute behemoth, far brighter and larger than Kerbin\u0027s Sun. Because of the obvious language translation, the Hyoomahn word for Sol is \u0022Sun.\u0022 Isn\u0027t that cute, they think their star is the Sun. Of course, the Deep Space Kraken would never permit such heresy. All of its planets are an order of magnitude bigger than their Kerbolar System counterparts, and an order of magnitude less dense.\n\n**Nemesis**\n\nA very small, very dim star far far away from Sol, but nevertheless orbiting it. It\u0027s only barely a star at all, but every few hundred thousand years it comes down and wreaks havoc on the planets of the inner solar system by flinging comets. It won\u0027t come down for another few hundred thousand years, so we have that at least. The name comes from the Hyoomahn for \u0022Enemy.\u0022 Jeez, why not use a simple Kerblish word like Enemy, anyway? Maybe it\u0027s easier for them to pronounce, with their limited vocal chords. Note: Nemesis is not confirmed to exist by direct observation.\n\n***Major Planets*** in order of distance from Sol.\n\n**Murkyerry**\n\nMerkyerry is a bit of an oddity in the Solar System. It is so close to Sol that it almost warrants destruction under planetary formation laws, similarly to Moho. Unlike Moho, Murkyerry has a very interesting geology. It is covered in weird terrain marks from a crater that has a diameter almost bigger than the circumference of the planet. At least, we heard that on a documentary once. It would seem to explain all the strange stuff going on with the terrain.\n\n**Viness**\n\nViness is, put simply, Hell. With a toxic superpressurized atmosphere of death gas, and a temperature hot enough to melt some metals. Apparently it also melted some hyoomahns\u0027 hearts in the past, because they named it after their goddess of love. They say that opposites attract, right? Well apparently Aerth and Viness didn\u0027t know that because they are almost exactly the same size.\n\n**Aerth**\n\nWe\u0027re almost certain we spelled this one right! Aerth is a glorious blue marble floating at just the right distance for the atmospheric pressure at the surface for saltwater to be liquid at some places. This means that it has heckuvalotta life. Also a strange form of life called \u0022mammal.\u0022 They give their own children fluids from their own body. Hyoomahns happen to be Mammals, and Aerth has one major problem from being the perfect Kerbal colony. Aerth is filled with the Hyoomahns. They\u0027re territorial, and they have covered their planet in a lot of VABs and Astronaut Complexes that people live in instead of residing underground like any reasonable species. The Aerth also happens to be undergoing a new geological era. They call it the Anthropocene, we call, it \u0022The time when one species of animal changed the planet way faster than it would have otherwise.\u0022 They have one thing going for them at least, they have a pretty decent space program. Way better construction than ours. They use something called \u0022flight-grade aluminium.\u0022 There is a lot more to say about Aerth, but there just isn\u0027t enough time. Check another section of the textbook for info about Hyoomahns and Aerth.\n\n-Aerth also has a large satellite, called Muna or something.\n\n**Moers**\n\nA somewhat small planet similar to Duna, Moers has no atmosphere. Well, essentially none. Such a small atmosphere that you need a styrofoam boomerang flying at twice the speed of sound just to get any lift. There\u0027s so much atmosphere that it presents a heating problem from orbit, but not quite enough to actually slow you down much. Still, if you use a combination of lithobraking (actual lithobraking, not crashing) and aerobraking, you can land on Moers for less delta-v than landing on Murkyerry, even though they have about the same gravity.\n\n**Joviter**\n\nThe giant of the Sol Sytem, Joviter is like a multicolor brownish Jool, except that it is the size of Kerbol. Orbited by over 60 moons, Joviter has the most moons of any Solar System planet, though most of them are small Gilly-like moons. It has a lot of storms, a thick atmosphere, and probably helps protect the inner planets from some comets and asteroids, on account of its huge hill sphere (A fancy word for sphere-of-infuence!). Joviter also happens to have a Jool-sized storm that has been going on for centuries.\n\n-Four major Moons.\n\n**Sahtirn**\n\nWe were very surprised to find that there was more than one gas giant in the Sol system. Sahtirn is not nearly as massive, but it is only a little bit smaller. It has gorgeous ice-particle rings that shine in the sunlight, projecting huge planet-sized shadows on Saturn\u0027s cloudtops. It is cloudy, but not as stormy. There\u0027s a cool hexagonal storm on the north pole. We like hexagons. Sahtirn also has 60 or so moons.\n\n-Seven or so major moons.\n\n**Yourinus**\n\nBecause of the Hyoomahn pronounciation of the word, it gets a lot of jokes, because Hyoomahns have some kind of [REDACTED] [REDACTED][REDACTED] [REDACTED] that they think is funny, and sounds similarly to the word when pronounced. All we hear is \u0022You are in us.\u0022\n\nYourinus is a cool planet. Literally. The coldest planet. It\u0027s a gas giant like Sahtirn and Joviter, but smaller and made of more \u0022ices\u0022 which are not ices at all in this context, but gasses that are cold. No, it doesn\u0027t make much sense.\n\n-No notable major moons.\n\n**Ineptitune**\n\nIneptitune is a deep blue wonder. The \u0022other blue planet.\u0022 It is an ice giant like Yourinus, but much denser. Despite being further away from Sol, Ineptitune is rather warm due to internal heat. It is far stormier than Joviter, constantly turning out planet-sized storms over and over again.\n\n-One major moon.\n\n***Dwarf Planets***\n\n**Seerees**\n\nSeerees is boring. Boring boring. Really really boring. We think it reminds us of some vague, little known dwarf planet in the Kerbolar system, but nothing comes to mind. It\u0027s an iceball. We suppose it does have a few neat white spots.\n\nNevertheless, the Hyoomahns have explored the dwarf planet using an ion probe. We don\u0027t see why its so cool.\n\n**Plootoh**\n\nMuch like Eeloo, Plootoh\u0027s planethood has been disputed. It is part of a binary system, with five small moons! It is reddish-brown, and made of ice. (Real ice this time!) It is about the size of Kerbin. (But remember, it is very undense.)\n\n**Karen**\n\nSort of like Ike\u0027s orbit of Duna, Karen is not really a moon, but a companion dwarf planet. It is made of similar stuff to Plootoh, but it is grey instead of brown. It\u0027s around the size of Duna. (But remember, it is very undense.)\n\n**Maycmayck.**\n\nMaycmayck is a reddish dwarf planet, and it\u0027s not too interesting. Or at least, it probably isn\u0027t, as it hasn\u0027t been explored.\n\n**Eress**\n\nEress is a very very white dwarf planet, a little larger than Plootoh.\n\n**Howmaya**\n\n\u0022What did the polite fat dwarf planet say?\u0022 What? \u0022Haumea Help You?\u0022 None of us get the joke, but apparently it is related to Howmaya. Howmaya is a very fast spinning dwarf planet, similar to the old science fiction story \u0022Rendezvous with Kragrathrea,\u0022 where a fast spinning planet was found to be an alien observation ship. Unlike the Inaccessible planet from the story, Howmaya is not a very oblate spheroid, it is a very very oblate, very elliptical ellipsoid. It buldges out, and it\u0027s gravity on the tall end on the equator is less than at the poles, because of centripetal force. Would be a really cool place to go.\n\n**Saidnah**\n\nSaidnah is a very far away dwarf planet that is 10 times further away from Sol than Neptune at closest approach, and way further away at furthest point. How did it get there? This is a subject of great Hyoomahn debate among dwarf planet fans, and a neat target for the Kerbal astronauts at NASA.\n\n***Moons***\n\n**Loonah of Aerth**\n\nA big grey rock in Aerth\u0027s sky, something that many Hyoomahns find attractive. So attractive that, much like the Kerbal attraction to the shiney Mun, the Hyoomahns have wanted to go there for centuries. And they did eventually. A lot of hyoomahns don\u0027t believe this, claiming that it was all faked, even that it is impossible. Kerbalkind can rest assured, however, that the hyoomahn nation known as Armerhika did indeed send massive rockets to Loonah and back over the course of three years. The Kerbal Space Commission launched a survey drone that took pictures of the Loonah lander descent stage \u0022Eegal\u0022 and even set down mere meters away from the furthest of the footprints.\n\n**Fohboes and Daymoes of Moers**\n\nSmall gilly-like asteroids of Moers, presumed to be captured asteroids. Fohboes is the larger and Daymoes the smaller. Fohboes the closer and Daymoes the further. Apparently their names come from the ancient hyooman gods known for Fear and Dread.\n\n**Eyeo of Joviter**\n\nEyeo is a large moon of Joviter, the innermost of the major moons. It is the second smallest of the moons known as the Gallehleio Moons, discovered by the ancient Hyoomahn of the same name. Eyeo is highly volcanic, the most volcanic in the solar system, mostly because it is so close to Joviter that it is constantly being squeezed by its gravity.\n\n**Youropah of Joviter**\n\nYouropah is the smallest of the Gallehleian Moons, and perhaps the most interesting. It is frozen on the surface, but underground is a vast ocean that might harbour living creatures.\n\n**Ganeymead of Joviter**\n\nGaneymead is the largest moon in the Solar system, bigger than the planet Murkyerry. It is made of rock and ice, and has no measurable atmosphere. Eyeo, Youropah, and Geneymead exist in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance, which aids in their stability, much like Laythe, Vall, and Tylo of Jool.\n\n**Calestoh of Joviter**\n\nCalestoh is the second largest of the Gallenleian Moons. It is made of ice and is sort of a fourth wheel. Actually, no that doesn\u0027t make sense. Four wheels are good. It\u0027s a third wheel, but where there\u0027s already three? Anyway, it is left out of the orbital resonance of the other three major moons.\n\n**Mymass of Sahtirn**\n\nThe smallest object in the solar system to be a ball only because of gravity. It\u0027s pretty darn icy and fluffy. The hyoomahns have a myth of an artificial satellite that is not actually a moon, that turns out to closely resemble Mymass.\n\n**Inselledus of Sahtirn**\n\nImagine a miniaturized Youropah. A small iceball squeezed by Sahtirn\u0027s gravitation to have a little ocean. Not only that, but it is constantly erupting from the underwater ocean, and the stuff forms one of the rings of Sahtirn. The stuff then falls back to Inselledus over time, eventually replenishing the lake.\n\n**Tetheys of Sahtirn**\n\nNot much to say here. A cratered iceball.\n\n**Dyeownee of Sahtirn**\n\nNothing cool here. Except the ice. And the fact that it is more massive than all smaller moons combined. We read that in a Hyoomahn textbook.\n\n**Reyah of Sahtirn**\n\nAnother really small moon. It\u0027s spherical shape is definitely caused by gravity, not because it is boring.\n\n**Tightan of Sahtirn**\n\nFinally! Something interesting out here! Tightan is the only body in the sol system that has liquids stable on its surface, other than Aerth. It also has a very thick atmosphere, the only moon to have a thick atmosphere.\n\n**Eyeapetis of Sahtirn**\n\nWe have enjoyed studying classic film history, and we think this should have been called Bele or Lokai or Cheron. It\u0027s a classic science fiction thing.\n\n**Trighten of Ineptitune**\n\nThe furthest major moon. It\u0027s a huge object that may be classified a \u0022dwarf\u0022 planet, but it is almost as big as Loonah. It orbits Ineptitune retrograde, and it is believed to be captured by it from an icy object belt called the \u0022Kighper Belt.\u0022 It shepherds all the inner moons of Ineptitune, but throws out all the outer moons to even higher orbits that can take as long as 26 Earth Years, or 90 Kerbin Years. Ineptitune is pretty massive, and really far away from Sol, so it has a really big sphere of influence.\n\n*If you have any suggestions to change something, go ahead, give me the criticism!*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T22:35:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T13:55:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/10/2015 at 10:29 AM, GregroxMun said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Aerth**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E We\u0027re almost certain we spelled this one right!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *If you have any suggestions to change something, go ahead, give me the criticism!*\n\u003E \n\nHahahaha ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketSquid","CreatedById":152665,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T18:10:45Z","Content":"I can\u0027t see the kerbals as invading anything.

The KSP\u0027s more advanced rocket technology sped up the rocket technology of the United States, and a couple of defectors went to help the Russians with their rockets. Travel from Kerbin to Earth was via chemical rocket slowboats, and they brought one hundredth of the entire population of Kerbin with them (that\u0027s like 5,140 Kerbals)\n\n4: Ever notice that you never actually see Neil Armstrong\u0027s face on the Moon? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\nin all seriousness though, NASA was much more keen on using human astronauts for their human space program, so Kerbals only flew test missions that were too dangerous to risk lives and too complicated for 1950s computers to control.
