I had just spent the last three hours practicing various maneuvers I\u0027ll be using for my all-IVA mission to the Mun, and on my return this happened as I entered Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere preparing for an aerobrake. I wasn\u0027t actually recording at first, but I just got stuck in the atmosphere so I had enough time to start FRAPS and get some footage. There was a heatshield that detached and went flying off into the atmosphere, so apparently it got free but as for the Kerbals?

On the first occasion Jeb was trying to get into a ship which was landed on Minimus, but instead he fell through a wormhole and died (poor little guy). Ok, maybe not a wormhole, but he fell through the planet and got ejected out the other side, and then back into the planet. I realize that the above description makes no sense, but it\u0027s the best I can do to portray the incident. The other attack was less likely Kraken and more likely shoddy rocketry, but I had one ship that would get to 30Km and then explode, every time, some really funny oscillation would make it blow to bits (in the end I ditched the design and started from scratch). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T10:39:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMetl, what does CTD mean?

This one was particularly weird because I went for reentry at 40km and was preparing to use my engines to slow myself enough to get out of the SOI of the Mun (sort of a wonky return trajectory) and then suddenly I started getting G force warnings and I\u0027m like, \u0022What\u0027s my altitude?
