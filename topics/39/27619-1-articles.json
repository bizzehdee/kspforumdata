Nobody really knows about the project yet, so I thought I would share it with you. This video is flying it near the KSC. I will make a video soon with it being launched, the aeroshell being deployed and entering the atmosphere of Duna, and unfolding with Damned Robotics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you like it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
