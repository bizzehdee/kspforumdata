He built a homemade rocket for his sixteenth birthday and it smashed a good-sized hole through both floors, the attic, and the roof of his house. At eighteen, he set off for two terms at Mennefry J. Kerman University of Science and Astrophysics, and applied for the space program as soon as he got out, at twenty-six. His application sat in the office of up-and-coming KSP director Emmeneil Kerman for several days, while the head of the program scratched his head wondering what to do. After advisory as to Jeb\u0027s level of enthusiasm for the project, the director finally signed him on as a test pilot for the brand-new rocketry commission. After proving himself with several booster rocket test runs, he became the first Kerbal in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb currently lives in the dorms of the KSC (oft mistaken for part of the R\u0026amp;D center), with few family ties. His parents realized he was unkillable long ago. He is sometimes found alone at night in the Observation Dome, manning the huge telescope, listening to rock music and trying to spot decommissioned satellites so he has a target for his latest \u0022recovery\u0022 mission. These missions are of course not sanctioned by the KSC - they just know better than to argue with Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman was a fairly quiet student for most of his child life. When he was nineteen, he joined the Air Force and ended up as a test pilot at twenty-four. He transferred to the space program at twenty-five, and became the first Kerbal in orbit at twenty-seven. He is currently roommates with Jeb at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob Kerman was that kid who tried to be cool and sort of managed it, always staying out of trouble. He ended up doing several patrol tours with the Navy and subsequently joined the KSP. He was the third Kerbal to reach space, and now lives several doors down from Jeb and Bill in the dormitories as an astroscientist. He has another part-time job as the voice of Rainbow Fish on \u0022The Adventures of Psycho Dorky Fish.\u0022 They say that if there\u0027s ever a manned mission to Duna, Bob will be the one to make the first step.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-21T00:46:14Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2014 12:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SuperWeegee4000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EWith thanks and apologies to Ian.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T23:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJebediah Kerman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Vallentined with 20 children.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Test Pilot for Kerbal Aeronautical Force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Owner and Founder of Jebediah Kerman Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Plays Acoustic Guitar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-grows out beard and \u0027stach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-TOTAL BADS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Older Brother of Bob and Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-has a weird inter-species crush on my IRL friend Tiff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Head Engineer at Jebediah Kerman Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Bisexual, once was boyfriend of James.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Looks after Jebediah and tries to keep him from his badS-ness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Author of the bestseller book \u0022Derptober Sky\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-hates Mundays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Has a KerLorean Motor Car.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob Kerman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Younger Brother of Bill and Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Total Nerd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Teacher of Mathematics at Kerbin City High\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Was once the scientists at Jebediah Kerman Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Atheist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Emarried\u003C/span\u003E Vall-entined \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(It\u0027s the same thing for Kerbals)\u003C/span\u003E to Desley Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-a low amount of only 5 kids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesley Kerman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Socially awkward due to bullying from siblings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-part of an EXTREMELY large family of 148 siblings, consisting of 4 pregnancies.
