Its been quite the moment since my last posting due to my computer being struck with a virus but it has been neutralized. I have been working my mods as of recent and have some big plans for the mod. Good news and possibly bad news depending on the way you look at it, good news, I will be making Epsilon Eridani, Alpha Centarui, and Red Skies for ksp1. Slightly bad news, the rest of SJ\u0027s (Stellar Journeys is a name candidate) development will be moved to KSP2 as the current KSP1 modding community is winding down and it wont be worth it to spend so much time developing a mod for a community that is slowly winding down. Course the previously mentioned systems will also be ported but also with many more systems along with my 3 side mods of, The Worlds of The Cluster, Kerbol Revamped (may change name), and The Klasia Nebula. So uhhhhh I gotta go cya bye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-26T07:31:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Fan Works.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
