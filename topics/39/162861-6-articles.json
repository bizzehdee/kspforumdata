There wasn\u2019t much noise, but there was definitely some activity going on. He heard a couple voices off to his\u2026 right? Yeah. That side\u2019s right. He tried to turn his head, but his neck was having none of it, and sent a searing, stabbing pain up his spinal chord. \u201COoh ow,\u201D He groaned. Then, the voices stopped, and he heard someone walking over. The figure blocked out the light, and Dewey\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t make out the figure.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHow you doing, boss?\u201D The figure asked. \u201CHey Sanson,\u201D Dewey answered, his eyesight clearing. \u201CI asked, how are you?\u201D Dewey gave a weak smile. \u201CGood. Where am I?\u201D He asked, looking around. \u201CA tiny house in Kursk. The citizen who owns this place let us convert it into a temporary hospital. Good guy..\u201D Sanson looked over his shoulder and motioned with his hand. About 5 seconds later, Vanessa walked over, her arm in a sling and her shoulder bandaged up.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhat the heck happened to you?\u201D Dewey asked, making Vanessa smile. \u201CGlad to see you too,\u201D She replied, sitting down on the bed next to him.

Their high-school football team with the legendary Jebediah Kerman as their QB. The decision to go into the Army. Joining the Tank Corps. Fighting in the Great War, and everything in between. Their promotions.

At least 100 aircraft came in to help us out, and the \u003Ci\u003EUSS Tigershark\u003C/i\u003E launched 5 Cruise Missiles. However, the enemy sent in aircraft as well, and there was a huge battle on both our side and the sky. When they finally retreated back to Valley\u2019s Guard, at least a hundred thousand of their guys were either wounded or dead. We lost about 56 thousand; Air and Ground combined,\u201D Sanson replied, before Vanessa cut in. \u201CThe infantry did amazing, boss. Your plan was perfect all the way. However.. We did lose a lot of good guys; Around 40 or 50 thousand.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThe enemy did manage to break through the wall of forces, but fortunately our artillery managed to\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI\u2026\u2026..

Due to recent events\u2026. Blah blah blah\u2026\u201D Dewey read. \u201COh my god.

Without warning, Tarkin leaped out of his chair, grabbed a package out of his coat pocket, and kneeled down. \u201CWhat are you..\u201D Christina asked, before breathing, \u201COh. \u003Ci\u003EOh\u003C/i\u003E.

So far his group (Daisy, Matson, Jones, and him) had covered about 80% of the town. He looked around the seemingly deserted city, and listened for possible enemies who were lurking behind corners. The once thriving and bustling paradise of art and culture was silent as the grave. The group walked past a smoldering tank- an obvious victim of a devastating aerial battle. The UKAF had been mercilessly pounding the city in an attempt to drive out the remaining Klathuians, and so far, it looked like it had worked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0It wasn\u2019t easy though.

Just then, a plane shot out from behind a skyscraper, looking like it was in the middle of a race. \u201COurs,\u201D Daisy noted, waving at the pilot. Seconds later, another plane blazed overhead in hot pursuit. \u201CTheirs!\u201D Matson shouted, dropping to the ground as fast as possible. The plane fired from it\u2019s guns, and destroyed their jeep in a blaze of fire and smoke, before, as if satisfied with the job it had accomplished, sped off to intercept the fighter.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWell there goes our ride,\u201D Jones sighed, picking up a charred oil filter. \u201CAnyone got a toolkit?\u201D Sansy joked. Seconds later, a single gunshot whizzed over their heads. \u201CSniper!\u201D They scurried behind cover, whipping their rifles out.

Daisy exhaled, and then sprinted across the road.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Bullets whizzed past, throwing up dust as they hit ground.

It flipped right over, top-down, and the kid stayed in the can. As the 4 walked over, the can began to shiver in fear. Sansy lifted the can up, and the kid lifted his hands up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CDon\u2019t shoot!\u201D He exclaimed. \u201CWhy the heck would we shoot you?\u201D Matson asked.

Ludwig Van Kerman, you deserve a medal, Val thought to herself as the shimmering lights of Velox City slowly began to peek over the horizon. Of course, this Elise must have been one special kerbal. By now the city was fully visible. Lights shimmered and shined, boats twinkled on the water, an absolutely ginormous Ferris wheel was turning, and, from the pod-mounted camera, Val saw some kerbals dancing in the streets.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CMust be a Liberation party,\u201D Val smiled back, before realizing she was all alone in the 2-kerb cockpit. \u201CAall by myyyseeelf,\u201D She sang, chuckling to herself. Val flicked on her nav lights, and looked down at the city below. Even though they\u2019d been liberated for a week, the Veloxians were out in full force. Turning from the ground, Val saw nothing but an ink-black curtain, and the stars twinkled happily. There was one huge band that seemed to light up the entire sky, one of the items on almost everyone\u2019s bucket list; see the StarBand.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CJeb, if you\u2019re up there, just know that I\u2019m not angry,\u201D Val whispered, giving a sad smile up at the sky through her oxygen mask. A star seemed to shimmer in response.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Right as the star finished shining, a huge yellow explosion went off just inches from the front of the plane. \u201CAah!\u201D Val wrenched the stick, but before she could see what happened, the plane had passed through the explosion. What in the..? Right then, another explosion went off a few feet away, this one white. Fireworks!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Val punched the nav lights on max brightness, hoping someone on the ground would know they were inadvertently damaging and coming close to shooting down the most advanced (and by process of elimination, the most expensive) fighter in UK history. \u201CHey, hey!\u201D Val shouted into the radio, trying to contact ground control. \u201CHold your celebrations!\u201D The fireworks seized for about a second, and Val exhaled in relief.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThank-\u201C She began, before a flurry of festive explosions burst around the plane, blocking out everything but color outside of the cockpit.

Stop please!\u201D Val shouted with all her might over the radio, but it was no use. Then, she remembered something. She was in the Raptor. The F-22! A plane that had a faster climb rate than the Jool V rocket! Val engaged the afterburner, retracted the exterior antennae and punched the throttle up to max, letting out a whoop of joy as she felt her spine momentarily compress from over 7G. As she felt she was in the clear, a massive thud resonated through the entire plane, making the cockpit shake and a sharp, high-pitched alert siren ring.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Frantically searching around, Val saw EC dropping. Fast. \u201CVelox City, this is Colonel Valentina Kerman of the UK Air Force. I\u2019ve been damaged by your fireworks and am leaking fuel. Advise, over.\u201D The radio was silent for a bit, but then a reply crackled back. \u201CCopy Colonel; Emergency landing cleared, Runway 2N. Repeat, Emergency Landing cleared, Runway 2N.\u201D Val frantically searched for the airport. There. She flipped over, and dove down, getting ready to line up. The plane dropped. 2 thousand. 175. 15. 125. Val pulled out of the dive at 750 meters, and lined up. \u201CCome on.. Come on!\u201D The EC was into it\u2019s final 15%.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The plane was over the runway now. Just a little bit\u2026. COME- Right then, the dash shut off, and the plane lost all upward velocity. It dropped like a rock, and slammed straight into the ground, sending up white tire smoke as Val slammed the brakes. A loud clunk! sounded from the rear, and Val lost all control the electrical motors, gismos, and gadgets that controlled most of the essentials. Only the ejection, life support, and air conditioning (thank Kraken) were on their own backup stores. When the plane rolled to a humiliating stop, Val opened up the cockpit. She pressed the button to activate the ladder, but then remembered that there was a temporary power outage.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWant something done right..\u201D She muttered, throwing open the top of the ladder container. She tossed the ladder out, and it fell into position. A pushback truck rolled up, and a couple kerbals stepped out. \u201CPush? Could you give me a push?\u201D Val asked, taking off the oxygen mask and her helmet. The kerbals stared blankly at her. \u201CPush.\u201D She made a motion with her hands. Nothing. Them and their stupid langu- Right then, another car drove up; this one a small car that everyone dubbed the \u201CBeetle.\u201D Another kerbal stepped out, and walked over to Val. He looked to be about Haydi\u2019s age. Light hair, muscular build. Athletic-looking. Haydi and Maxxy would have fainted.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHello there, Madame Valentina,\u201D He said, shaking Val\u2019s hand. \u201CMy name is Jean le Kerman, Facilitator of the airport.\u201D He pronounced his \u201CJ\u201D like you would when saying \u201CJaques,\u201D an effect of the accent. \u201CI apologize for my fellow citizens; when they celebrate, they tend to go a little bit.. eh\u2026. Overboard you could say.\u201D He gave an embarrassed chuckle. \u201CSo what brings you here?\u201D Val looked up at the fireworks. \u201CAh, I see. I apologize, Colonel. I\u2019ll get the crews to take your plane to the hangar.\u201D Jean turned, and said \u201CPouss\u00E9e,\u201D to the crew. \u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0They were a flurry of action, and just a couple of minutes later, Val had a flashlight in hand, investigating the battery hatch. Right where the main EC Generator was supposed to be was a charred, steaming black hole. There was a battery that looked like it and a curling iron had a disagreement, while the other battery had a hole the size of a watch in it. The third battery was missing. While Val was muttering curses under her breath, a member of the ground crew came up and muttered something in Jean\u2019s ear. \u201CVraiment? A quel point est-ce mauvais? L\u0027as-tu avec toi?\u201D The exchange continued for some time, before Jean pulled Val over to the truck.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0There, in the bed, were pieces of debris, and a large, charred-black chunk of plastic. \u201CI think we found your third battery,\u201D Jean said, staring down at the chunk. \u201CYeah,\u201D Val dejectedly replied. \u201CCould you fix it?\u201D Jean smiled. \u201CCommen\u00E7ons! Trois piles et un g\u00E9n\u00E9rateur.\u201D The crew scurried off, running to get parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CDo you want a tour of our city while you wait?\u201D Jean asked, motioning to the abundance of lights on the horizon. \u201CUm..

There was a huge celebration going on, and there were kerbals everywhere. \u201CAh yes. Do you want to visit the park?\u201D Val nodded, and they rushed off. Out by the park, it was quiet. Street lights illuminated the road, and then, as quickly as they had seen it, they were inside.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWow\u2026 This is beautiful,\u201D Val whispered. Fireworks popped way off in the distance, muffled by the thick trees. They both sat down on an old, almost ancient bench, and Jean sighed. \u201CYes.. When I was a young kerbal- years and years ago by now- My dad would tell me stories about his experiences in the Civil War.. We used to spend hours just sitting here, talking.\u201D He looked up, smiling. \u201CHe told me that there was a war before.. When even he was not yet born.\u201D Then, he began humming a song, occasionally muttering a word or two of the lyrics. At the very end, Jean sighed and wiped a tear from his eye.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThat was wonderful.

Every night he would-\u201C Jean was about to explain, but a loud, wailing alarm rang out throughout the city. \u201CAir Raid?!\u201D Jean exclaimed in surprise, trying to look up through the thick canopy of trees. He grabbed Val\u2019s hand, and went out of the park. Around the city, everyone was staring up at the sky, trying to see this raid. Then, a cool, calm voice came on through the speakers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CCitizens of Velox. An international event has happened. Please return to your homes as soon as possible, and remain there until instructed otherwise.\u201D Everyone began running, and Jean took Val to his house, almost sprinting. An international event? Val thought as Jean almost slammed the door closed. What kind of event? Frantically, he switched on the TV, and a news station was on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIf you\u2019re just joining us tonight, we have breaking news from the North. Only 10 minutes ago, the nation of Klathu announced that they had tested- and successfully detonated- a 340 kiloton nuclear bomb in the city of Osiris in Kruola. The bomb was dropped by a Klathuian bomber, and there are an unknown amount of civilian casualties. This is the first ever nuclear bomb to be dropped since the bombing of Jesalia City during the Second Great War over 25 years ago. This bombing is also in direct violation of the International Nuclear Disarmament Act, which was signed by all nations- also after the Second Great War. The nations of the Alliance will be meeting later tonight in Bahmuto City to discuss these actions and how to strike back. For more on this, please stay tuned in to your radios, and this station. Velox City-\u201D Val abruptly stood up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI have to go.

She had made an all-out dash from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to Bahmuto, speeding down the highway at over 70m/s and probably breaking every single law known to the country. \u003Cem\u003EGene is gonna kill me when he sees what the Raptor looks like\u2026\u003C/em\u003E She began taking the steps 3 at a time, leaping up to the building as if her life depended on it. There, at the top, a familiar figure stood, shaking the hand of a guard before walking through. Then, the guard turned to Val.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CColonel-\u201D The guard said as he tried to block her way, but Val just pushed through. \u201CValentina Kerman,\u201D the President said, just walking through the door herself. \u201CMadame President,\u201D Val breathed, softly wheezing from the run she had to make. \u201CI\u2019m here\u2026 F\u2026.. For the meeting.\u201D She coughed, trying to catch her breath.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAh, Valentina. Welcome back. I suppose you-\u201C The president began, before Val nodded. \u201CSaw it.. On the news. Came as fast as I could.\u201D She put her hands on her head and stood up, employing a trick she learned in track during high school. \u201CWell good. I had feared my military advisor wouldn\u2019t show, and sure enough.. Do you want to fill in?\u201D The two began walking towards the Chamber, where they would be meeting.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIt\u2019s why I came,\u201D Val replied as they opened the door. Immediately, a wave of angry shouting hit them square in the face, as the other delegates were arguing at max volume. \u201CI say that we strike back as hard as we can!\u201D The Kruola delegate demanded, slamming his fist down onto the table. \u201CNo! If we do that then we\u2019ll drive ourselves to world ruin!\u201D The Penguinian delegate cried, waving his arms in a \u201CThis is a bad idea\u201D gesture. Meanwhile, USK and Veloxian delegates sat still, looking bored and tapping their thumbs on the table- their eyes looking tired and bored as if they hadn\u2019t slept in over a week. The USK delegate got on his phone out and dully checked his Snaptogram, still looking as if he would prefer to be anywhere but World Kouncil. Off in a corner, the Jesalian and Dystrios delegates played chess. From Val\u2019s vantage point, it looked like a close game.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The president rushed off, trying to stop the two squabbling delegates from going into a fistfight. All alone, Val went over to the match. It was Dystrios\u2019s move, and he looked a mix of angry, anxious, and nervous; his brow furrowed as he planned his next move. \u201CQueen,\u201D Val said, surveying the scene. \u201CWhat?\u201D Dystrios asked, looking up at her with a confused face.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI\u2019d move the Queen. Instant checkmate.\u201D Val waved her finger up and down to indicate the move. The delegate looked at the board, then back to Val, and back to the board. Then, he made the move, taking down a pawn in the process. \u201CCheckmate,\u201D He smugly smirked, and Jesalia\u2019s delegate sighed. \u201CDa. You would\u2019ve won anyways,\u201D She said in a thick accent, getting up from the table and going to her seat. By now, the President had managed to calm down the two delegates, and they were finally ready for the meeting.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CEveryone, to your seats please,\u201D She said. The other delegates went into action, getting ready for the meeting. Veloxia\u2019s delegate was prodded awake by Dystrios\u2019s delegate, as he had fallen asleep. How someone could fall asleep in the middle of a shouting match was beyond Val.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0About 5 minutes into the meeting, Val felt the same as she had almost a year ago now: Immense, unending boredom. The shouting match resumed, and no-one seemed too keen on stopping the yelling. \u201CHow do you get things done?\u201D Val whispered in a half-surprised tone to the Dystrios delegate during the argument. \u201CTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure,\u201D The delegate whispered back with a chuckle. \u201COne second we\u2019re arguing and then poof! Decision made.\u201D Val snickered, and then the President called her name.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CVal? What\u2019re your opinions on this whole thing?\u201D She asked in an exasperated tone, tired of the arguing going on on either side of her. The shouting abruptly stopped, and all eyes turned to Val. Just like the teacher who singled out the one who wasn\u2019t paying any attention at all, the President had chosen probably the most embarrassing moment to call on Val. And just like the student, Val had no idea what was going on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CUh.. What was the question?\u201D Val asked, a bit of color rushing to her cheeks as she blushed. A couple delegates snickered, but the President repeated herself. \u201CWhat are your opinions on this? What do you think we should do in other words.\u201D Val nodded, and thought it over for a bit. Then, without paying attention to the other delegates staring at her, she replied.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CBomb em back. But don\u2019t bomb the citizens. Rural factories, Troop emplacements, High-value targets. If they hit us, hit them with double the force. Hit them so many times, they fear using it against us. But hit only the country that hit us. If Agonarch hits us, hit them back. TAPE hits us, hit them. Don\u2019t hit someone who did nothing to us.\u201D The room went silent, and Val sat back in her chair. \u201CThat\u2019s my idea at least.\u201D The President nodded, and then looked around.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAnyone have objections to that?\u201D She asked. A couple said \u201Cno,\u201D and almost everyone shook their heads. \u201CWell I think we\u2019ve finally come to an agreement. I officially call this meeting of the World Kouncil to rest!\u201D She slammed her gavel on the table, and everyone got up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nTime: 3:00pm, 1 Day later\u003Cbr\u003E\nLocation: High in the Agonarch Mountains, Agonarch Imperium\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Vanessa sighed and watched as her breath made tiny little crystals, dancing in the frigid mountain air. Her piercing blue eyes surveyed the ground below; a snow-covered valley with a large infantry post down below. She wiped some fog off her sniper\u2019s scope, and peered through it. \u201CWhere are you..\u201D She muttered, sweeping the camp for any sign of her target.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThere you are.\u201D She smirked, and watched as the target went over to a fire, warming his hands while he talked to a couple of soldiers. Danburry Kerman. Leader of the 18th National Regiment and the head strategist for the AI\u2019s Army.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAlpha Team, do you have a sight?\u201D She asked, keeping herself flat to the ground. \u201CAffirmative. We\u2019re-\u2026\u2026 LOOK OUT!\u201D A loud, un-ending barrage of gunfire began going off, echoing around the mountains. Vanessa looked down at the target, who was running towards cover. She fired off a load of gunshots, one of which hit Danburry in the arm. However, before she could get the shot straight at his head, Danburry had gotten into his armored truck, and it peeled out of the compound; spitting up gravel, dirt, and muddy snow into the air as it went.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The gunfire ceased, and Vanessa\u2019s radio crackled. \u201CColonel, are you there?\u201D A new voice asked. \u201CCopy Lugas. Everyone okay?\u201D Vanessa asked, getting up and hiding behind a ridge, even though the compound was clear. Lugas coughed a bit, filling the channel with a bunch of loud, abrupt silence. \u201CThey came from behind. A lot of guys are dead.. Robby\u2019s gone. There\u2019s about 5 of us left by now, but there are a couple more guys with some bad wounds. Further orders?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGet to the choppers.

The bomb rolled onto Tarkin\u2019s plane and he activated the brakes. \u201CThanks,\u201D he exhaled, obviously relieved that they hadn\u2019t gone up in a huge, deadly explosion of doom. \u201CYou\u2019re insane!\u201D Val screamed at him, watching them all from behind. \u201CSon, you\u2019d better give me that bomb now or so help me I\u2019ll find you in the afterlife and hunt you down,\u201D Jim commanded.
