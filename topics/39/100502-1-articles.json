(With exception to the star in a car.) So far it has taken me a while to get done but I think it is pretty good. This episode I decided to take them caravaning in KSP which in typical Top Gear fashion went absolutly wrong.\n\nIf you wish to take a look at it you can so here:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/24P6fJ2VlCo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n rpono0k \nPlease tell me what you think about it and/or how I could improve it!\n\nFrom, TheBlockRoom. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T14:18:08Z","Content":"Haha!
