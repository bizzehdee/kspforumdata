Anyone know?...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have pared down B9 to only the things I generally can be found using in my game, which is still considerable (but only about half the size of the original B9 pack. And I am only transferring the trimmed down B9 Aerospace folder, none of the others...though firespitter shows up in one other mod pack I think. I also have active resource management...or active graphics management, or whatever it is called in my BoulderCo folder in hopes of rendering most of it back down unless I am right up close to it. That seems to help some (it actually loads as opposed to crashing mid boot) but it isnt enough...I have also had to lose a number of the other mod packs I really enjoy as well...things like Mekjeb (which I use for a flight data window for easier flying) and so on. Have to say the 32 bit is a little disappointing in the initial beautification process, but I am still tinkering with it. So, for now, wish me luck getting a stable mod list...I will let you all know more soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadtiger","CreatedById":128387,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T20:58:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso, an evening of tinkering, modifying packs, looking at various ways to make this all fit, and it occurs to me...well, I have made a dual boot to linux before, why not again. So I get ready to, and I say to myself, you know, why not see if my frame can handle the x64 without dumping its brains all over my desk...so I play a few rounds, I look, sure enough watching some of the data, it looks a tad twitchy, but all in all, no crashes...soooo...I load the list (short B9 at the moment) and I have myself a play this morning. Good news bad news situation here...short the B9 pack, (which I absolutely love and want to add to the pack tonight after I finish moving furniture and work) I have what appears to be a stable platform for all my mods, plus the beautification, and it looks and plays awesome...almost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one hitch I am having is that Ferram Aerospace doesn\u0027t seem to be working. Does anyone know if there is a special x64 release for it that allows the aerodynamics to work, anyone think that might just be a bug playing x64 in windows? Thoughts? And if all else fails, I will dual boot my system with a linux setup so that I can make this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, more thought on the matter, I am definitely going with the colonization of the Kerbol System as the main thrust of my series. Basically, orbital colonies on every planetary and lunar body in the game, as well as ground colonies on every body I can manage to get them onto. That said, this looks to be a long game, and if all else fails, we are going to see some serious use of the Remote Tech mod (I love using it as it makes comms more realistic) and the ships are goign to be carrying tons of life support for round trips to and from the various planets with Kerbals on board, cause where is the fun if you don\u0027t have to feed you kerbals snacks, make sure they have water, power, air, so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... the x64 list of mods...as of this morning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetter Atmospheres\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadly Reentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnvironmental Visual Enhancement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFerram Aerospace (Parts work and link properly, aerodynamics malfunctioning)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfernal Robotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Attachment System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechanical Jeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModular Kolonization System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote Tech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience Alert\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience Containers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage Recovery\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Life Support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVanguard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETexture Management...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with any luck we are adding B9 back to that and seeing if it still runs tonight, I will let you all know.
