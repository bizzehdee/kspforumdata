Samples, swabs, other samples and a variety of hardware are used to try to understand and determine the cause of this phenomena.\n\nLater back at the astronaut complex.\n\nBill: \u0022That was way too much testing. i think they over probed me and now my left eye has gone straight.\u0022\n\nBob: \u0022The effects are only temporary.\u0022\n\nBob questions Bill on how he is able to levitate.\n\nBill: \u0022Guys I think it all started when I was young. While in the Space Cadets I visited the Desert Temple.\n\nValentina: \u0022So, what happened when you visited the Dessert Temple?\u0022\n\nBob: \u0022Did you find some hidden treasure?\u0022\n\nJebediah: \u0022Where you hit by something?\u0022\n\nBill: \u0022No I just clambered to the top of a ziggurat\u0022\n\nValentina, Bob, Jebediah all exclaim: \u0022WHAT?!?\u0022\n\nBob: \u0022You are not supposed to be playing on those. Those are ancient and should be respected.\u0022\n\nJebediah: \u0022Bob.\n\nBob: \u0022Yeah Jeb.\u0022\n\nJebediah: \u0022Stop being a killjoy.\u0022\n\nBill, Jebediah, Valentina and Bob get ready to go on a pilgrimage to the dessert.\n\n***These waters are not for the uninitiated.***\n\n***Spoilers be here.***\n\n***Approach no further.*** \n\n***Ye have been warned.***\n\n**Chapter Two**\n\nAt the Dessert Temple complex.\n\nBill: \u0022Here is the ziggurat I climbed.\u0022\n\nJebediah: \u0022Want to try again to get to the top?\u0022\n\nBill: \u0022I could.

I am very active and would love to see the view from on top of there.\n\nValentina approaches the base of the large ziggurat \n\nShe starts to climb and just as Bob cannot acquire stable footing and slides as if the stones were covered in KD-42 lubricant.\n\nBob tries too but is more successful in falling.\n\nJebediah approaches Bill.\n\nJebediah: \u0022Bill what do you think\n\nBill: \u0022While I was on top of the statue the medium ziggurat around back flickered a bright light.\u0022\n\nBob: \u0022Valentina would you want to go around and check that out?\u0022\n\nValentina: \u0022Just try and stop me.\u0022\n\nValentina goes around to the medium ziggurat.\n\nThere is a partial partition that is in in front of the medium ziggurat.\n\nThere is an inscription on the the wall and Valentina attempts to read it.\n\n\u0022THE CORNER KEY\u0022\n\nValentina Climbs Medium Ziggurat\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\u0022https://player.vimeo.com/video/134465689\u0022 width=\u00221280\u0022 height=\u0022720\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 title=\u0022Valentina Climbs Medium Ziggurat\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThe team gather and Valentina tells them about the inscription she saw and describes the sensation she felt while climbing the third step.\n\nValentina: \u0022When at the middle of the ziggurat I started to feel lighter, almost as if I were on Minmus.\u0022\n\nThe team packs up and heads back to KSC and is questioned extensively by the R\u0026D team.\n\n**Chapter Three**\n\nBack home at the Kerbal Space Centre.\n\nBill was asked if he could reach the top of the round fuel tank at the launchpad.
