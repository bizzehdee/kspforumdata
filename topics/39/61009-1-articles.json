Suddenly the small ship came to a stop. Jonsey Kerman, a courageous but now woozy Kerbal crawled out of the hatch. Jonsey slumped onto the ground, he then pushed a small silver stake into the ground.

Jonsey had led a pretty normal life up until now. He was born into a family of six. His four siblings also were pretty average. They all became a master in the family business, carpentering. However, one day had Jonsey a choice. After driving back home after work, he came to a fork in the road. This fork consisted of both a road to his home, or another path that was (to him) an unknown site. Nothing ever provoked his interest enough to even explore this mysterious road, but now, a new sign had caught his attention. It glowed brightly in contrast to the night sky. The sign had a turquoise backround, and in big bright text said: \u0022Fun, High-paying Job offerings now.\u0022 Jonsey, a naturally rational person, thought about this. He lived in a small apartment that he could barely pay rent for, and had little fun carpentering. He finished thinking and went down the mysterious road in the moonlight...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...

He remembered the first day on the job - the next morning. He never remembered taking ANY basic training at all. When he tried to contemplate this, his mind dismissed it and he couldn\u0027t even remember what he was thinking. He started out as a flight quality control intern, and quickly rised the promotional ladder. After four years being employed, all of the staff around him changed except two people, Kayla, the Chief secretary and clerk, and Stuvoshkij \u0022Stuwey\u0022, the Chief Scientist Supervisor and Manager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese two mysterious people arrived the same time Jonsey did, and he grew very fond of them both.

Kayla stopped for a moment, shocked, and all of the costumers stared in front of the registration desk. \u0022Sorry, sorry, I didn\u0027t know what came over me.\u0022 Jonsey added, embarrassed of his actions. Kayla looked relieved for a moment, and, all of the costumers looked away without interest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Say, do you want to go out for coffee and a snack?\u0022 She asked in a fluid, calm voice. \u0022Yeah, Stuwey can come with us.\u0022 Jonsey replied. Kayla looked a bit disappointed, but to Jonsey\u0027s perspective, he couldn\u0027t tell if she just wanted to be alone with him, or disliked Stuwey in particular. You see, Kayla never grew very fond of Stuwey, who to say the least, was very annoying to her. She just wanted to socialize, but with Stuwey, it was facts nonstop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJonsey went over Kayla\u0027s body movements in his memory, and it seemed she seemed to have started upset when he said the keyword: \u0022Stuwey\u0022 which made him infer she was more disturbed about Stuwey in paticular than being alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, All in all, Jonsey got in his old, beat up car, (He had barely spent the fortune he made from his job and thought saving it would be more helpful.) contacted Stuwey, and went down to the nearest StarKerbs...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-26T20:35:14Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2014 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alex_Leonardo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alex_Leonardo","CreatedById":56762,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T22:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022 A Way to Space \u0022 Ep. 1 The Landing Part. 05 The Gang \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m just saying we could use a little more improvement.\u0022 Said Kayla, now completely fine with the fact that Stuwey had joined the party.
