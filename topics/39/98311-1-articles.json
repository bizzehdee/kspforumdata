The Gauntlet was the ultimate evolution of the Royal Aircraft Factory Mono-Hunter H.E. 5, spun off to private aircraft manufacturer Gloster (which had acquired some of the R.A.F.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s talent when it transitioned away from design and manufacture upon its rebirth as the Royal Aircraft Establishment). Introduced into service in June 1928, the Gauntlet was hardy, adaptable, and easy to fly, and its radial engine made it rugged and easy to maintain. Highly maneuverable, descended from a monoplane designed to fight biplanes on even terms, it also had excellent short- and rough-field performance. All these factors, refined over years of design work and service on prior models, made it an excellent warplane for colonial use and for lesser powers, and the Gauntlet was exported widely and copied more widely still. It served in many of the brushfire wars and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cemergencies\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 of the post-First World War era, infamously in Algeria and the Far East. It is also notable for serving on both sides of the French Civil War; export models and home-built copies with the \u003Cem\u003Er\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9publicains\u003C/em\u003E and Italian copies and derivatives with the \u003Cem\u003Eactionistes\u003C/em\u003E. Outclassed by frontline hunters from the Great Powers at the start of the Civil War, and despite exceptional domestic aeronautical design talent, it nonetheless remained in active use until the war\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s conclusion. By the time of the Second World War it remained in service only with minor powers in South America, Africa, and Asia, and no Gauntlet saw active combat. \u003Cem\u003EGauntlet Mk VI:\u003C/em\u003E 2535lb dry, 3307lb loaded, 840HP, 272mph. 4x .303cal MG.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9zggdSj.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00229zggdSjl.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9zggdSjl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAn RAF Gauntlet Mk VI, circa 1932.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T23:50:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBl\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9riot D.65\u003C/strong\u003E (\u003Cem\u003ENov 1930\u003C/em\u003E): The Bl\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9riot Company survived the First World War more or less intact; during the war a major manufacturer of French hunters, bombers, and army cooperation aircraft, neither the limits the treaty imposed nor the glut of war-surplus aircraft forced it out of business. As the \u003Cem\u003Eforces aeriennes de la Republique \u003C/em\u003Ewere gradually allowed to rebuild, a strange mix of old and new made up their aircraft. The Bl\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9riot Company, now staffed with young up-and-coming designers, was among those tapped to produce hunters and bombers anew. The D.65 design, selected to be the frontline hunter of the FAR, was of modern construction for its day: a streamlined fuselage and inline engine was supported by minimally-braced main wing and tail. The undercarriage was fixed, helping serve as wing brace, and the underslung radiator well-faired into the fuselage. The final result was a decent performer for the late twenties, but outclassed by the next generation of cantilever-wing, retractable-undercarriage designs already coming into service. The length of development, from the letting of the contract in early 1925 to operational service, was a harbinger of the troubles to come: the fractious French political system, held in check by \u003Cem\u003Eforce majeure\u003C/em\u003E during the Boulangist years, led to interminable strife. Everything from revolving-door cabinets, industrial action, and shifting defense priorities all slowed development of the D.65 and other aircraft. When it finally entered service, the D.65 proved faster than the Gauntlet though less rugged, a mediocre aircraft by that date but still far better than any relic of the First World War. Due to its ubiquity by the July Days, the D.65 was the mainstay of both \u003Cem\u003Er\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9publicain \u003C/em\u003Eand \u003Cem\u003Eactioniste\u003C/em\u003E hunter squadrons during the early days of the Civil War. Few were still in service during the later days: the \u003Cem\u003Eactionistes\u003C/em\u003E lacked the industrial capacity to manufacture it, never controlling the industrial heartlands of France, and relied instead on Italian and Russian support, and the \u003Cem\u003Er\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9publicains \u003C/em\u003Equickly developed, bought, or were supplied with better alternatives. \u003Cem\u003ED.65:\u003C/em\u003E 3131lb dry, 4245lb loaded, 900HP, 282mph, 4x 7.5mm MG\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LCBNWAg.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LCBNWAgl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LCBNWAgl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ED.65 of 82i\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8me Escadrille, Groupe de Chasse I/3, Toulouse, 1934.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-06T00:04:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2015 12:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NathanKell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T05:49:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESikorski I-12 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFlashbulb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/strong\u003E (\u003Cem\u003EAug 1929\u003C/em\u003E): Designed by Nikolai Polikarpov for the Sikorski company, the I-12 was the most advanced hunter in the world when it was introduced in 1929. It was a low-wing metal cantilever monoplane with an enclosed cockpit and retracting landing gear, the combination of those advances and its powerful radial engine leading to revolutionary performance. It was fast, sturdy, and potent--armed with cannon long before other hunters would follow suit--and served Russia well for much of the 1930s.

Based as it was on the airframe of the HF and H2F carrier hunters, its growth potential was limited, and as the decade wore on and reports from France made clear it would prove unsuitable in combat, the H3F-2 saw a phased withdrawal from service in favor of newer models like the H4F Tomcat and H6C Skyhawk.

The length of this apparatus necessitated a cockpit set well aft, harming visibility particularly on takeoff and landing, but the benefit was extreme. A full 25mph faster than early marks of the Hawk, with a full throttle height three thousand feet higher, maneuverable and well-armed and armored, the I-13 was the best hunter of its day.

A redesign for the large new 1850HP radial engine, a development of that used in the I-13, yielded the I-14bis; it proved a much more capable hunter. Retaining the two-stage supercharger designed for the I-13, although now tuned for lower altitude (high altitude being the province of the I-15), the I-14bis was a very dangerous opponent on the deck, as fast under 10,000ft as the best the \u003Cem\u003Er\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9publicains\u003C/em\u003E or the Intervening Powers could field.

Wright-Curtiss, despite being the oldest of the United States\u0027s aircraft manufactures, maintained a reputation for innovation and the futuristic-looking Starship was their answer to the challenge. The Thunderbird was also accepted into service under the aegis of that contract, though it was only ever deemed a stopgap, given the compromises it made in armor and armament to achieve its speed. The Starship made no compromises whatsoever in any of those realms: if one engine would not be powerful enough, then two would be used on a highly-streamlined aircraft little larger than most singles. However, being the first aircraft to truly run into compressibility effects--before aeronautical experts knew what they were--meant the Starship had a long and difficult path to operational capability and the C variant. At its introduction in 1936 it was by far the fastest hunter in the world at 423mph, and when reengined for the finally-mature hypers it could keep pace with most newer hunters, though with its early-30s aerodynamics it was no longer the fastest. \u003Cem\u003EH-27C:\u003C/em\u003E 12522lb dry, 15873lb loaded, 2x1520HP, 423mph, 1x 20mm cannon, 4x .50cal MG. \u003Cem\u003EH-27E (1938):\u003C/em\u003E 12853lb dry, 17416lb loaded, 2x1920HP, 460mph, 2x 30mm and 3x 20mm cannon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XYDVTJl.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XYDVTJll.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XYDVTJll.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EH-27C in bare-metal finish, 1937.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oMsEOFI.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oMsEOFIl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oMsEOFIl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EH-27E prior to transport to southern France during the Intervention, 1939\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MightyDarkStar","CreatedById":115126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T12:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow Nathan!

When finally introduced in August 1936, however, it offered excellent low-level performance and astounding acceleration. By this time optimized for low-level combat and featuring clipped wings and a large-diameter propeller, its performance was however lacking at altitude compared to the latest Hawks, in particular the two-stage supercharged Hawk Mk III.

The Thunderchief, as it was named, looked like a big brother to the Thunderbird, though it was greatly modified during the design and prototype phase in the light of lessons from the French Civil War. The final product was much larger than the H-25, almost three thousand pounds heavier dry (and with a much higher loaded weight), and armed and armored to survive modern combat. In addition, given the use to which the \u003Cem\u003Er\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9publicains\u003C/em\u003E put the Thunderbird, and the hyper-powered air superiority hunters then in development, the USAF instructed Hughes to focus more on ground attack, creating perhaps the first dedicated hunter-bomber in the process. The H-29 that finally emerged, reaching operational capability in early 1937, was as close as the USAF had yet come to a \u0022flying panzer.\u0022 The large radial engine--the largest and most powerful yet flown, developing 1850HP in prototypes and 2000HP in service--gave the Thunderchief the ability to dash at high speed despite its heavy weight and keep flying even with some cylinders shot out, and the cockpit, fuel tanks, and other important areas featured considerable armoring. The armament was also a first for the USAF: all cannon (even the favored .50cal machine guns having been shown to lack punch against armored enemies in the air and on the ground in France). The final product could hold its own in the air, though lacking in speed and not as nimble as competitors such as the Hawk (or forthcoming Rapier), and what it could not outrun, outturn, or avoid it could certainly outlast. The Thunderchief acquitted itself well during the Intervention, and even in the more dangerous environment of the Second World War the Thunderchief proved up to the challenge, regularly bringing its pilots safely home when other aircraft would have faltered. \u003Cem\u003EH-29B (late 1937):\u003C/em\u003E 8972lb dry, 12125lb loaded, 2200HP, 434mph, 4x 20mm cannon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ynq1PWr.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ynq1PWrl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ynq1PWrl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EH-29B of 32nd Hunter Group, Sinclair AFB, California, November 1937\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T21:38:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhoops, forgot to update OP.
