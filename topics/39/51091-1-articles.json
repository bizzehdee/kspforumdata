Each crew member has their own luxurious cabin with panoramic full HD surround sound viewing window, and enough snacks to last for five months in case of an emergency. The central cans are For Science. The station has two large and three standard docking ports (I may add some small ones before liftoff), assuming that the cockpit will be ditched when in orbit. The little gadget on the top is the space tug - it\u0027ll be doing a LOT of work in the near future. I\u0027ve built one station before, and this tug is a tried-and-tested design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post here whenever I\u0027m about to do a KSP stream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, and enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChris\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just noticed I\u0027ve posted in the wrong place.
