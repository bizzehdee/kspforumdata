The picture looks like it is taken from about the height of a person\u0027s head. Which means that your P1000 is probably a couple feet taller than a person in that picture. You will have to position it to be farther back or have a picture taken more upwards in you want it to look realistic.\n\nFor this second part imagine a clock laid on the ground at the spot the picture is taken from so its 12 is facing straight down the middle of the picture. The sun in the picture seems to be somewhere to the 2 to 3 o-clock direction. Looks like the lighting on the P1000 is coming from the 4 to 5 o-clock direction, while its shadow is coming from more of the 1 or 1.5 o-clock. I would say the lighting could have a lot more consistency.\n\nThis is just my take on the image though."},{"CreatedByName":"Zamovinar","CreatedById":127282,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T17:10:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Here you see a documentary about the TOG in its native environment (it\u0027s worth the watch).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p1G8mQVHBw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nI posted this on the **Naval Battle Club (I guess I\u0027ll post it here:)**\n\nHOLY! You did it! You know, **I\u0027ve just watched a documentary about this on youtube from the History Channel a few months ago prior to my Maelstrom Tanks** (Krupp was just a lowly automotive mechanical engineer to those who don\u0027t know) \n\nI was looking for good inspiration guess you beat me to it. I decided to go with the Maelstrom design (heavy and amphibious) but still agile. But **I knew someone would build this mostrosity** and but **I chose to build the Gustav Gun instead but I got too lazy so no work was done.** \n\nNow I feel like **my Maelstrom tanks are the Sherman equivalents taking on Tiger Tanks** **which is in this case that abomination** **(and my Maelstroms are about the size of a regular Tiger Tank)**\n\nSo I say I\u0027m going to give you a rep this time. \n\nIf you are going to use that in Kerbal Powers fine. I left the development of my tanks stagnant for now because I\u0027m busy on building something. It\u0027s a surprise for you too. **(it\u0027s not that big but enough to be awesome, since you made the route to top secret vehicles during World War II I guess I\u0027m there too and making good progress)**\n\nYou see that tank could have worked in reality but it\u0027s just so immense that I don\u0027t think that it should be done in the first place. As I know the main problem of it was the land underneath it just crumbles so that it cannot really be driven with ease. But it will deliver the \u0022Shock and Awe\u0022 to it\u0027s enemies (just like you did to me) Good for propaganda but highly impractical. It can easily be killed by planes overhead and a dedicated attack force. LoL even mines (specialized for that tank) could seriously cripple it if left unchecked.\n\nThere comes a point where making everything big is disastrous, there will be limitations because the smallest parts (Like the chain analogy) cannot support the whole. So basically you can only build large depending on your smallest components (May I ask you a question? when you drive that do the tires get flat from time to time or what? My Maelstroms do and they are lighter compared to that)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I tried.... Something\u0027s off. I feel like it\u0027s the lighting or the proportion of the tank.
