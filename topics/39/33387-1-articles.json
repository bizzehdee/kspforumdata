His heart swelled with pride as he looked to his fuel gauge. Bill, to his left, smiled half grin and nodded his head. They both knew there was still a dangerous re-entry to face as well as the ever merciless landing back at the KSP fields, but that blue dot called to their hearts and souls. Bob looked ahead intently. Soon the moon sailed by, another near miss well calculated to save on ever precious fuel. The small blue dot now coursed with flowing clouds, magnificent blue seas, the verdant greens and white icy tips of brown mountains. This was home. Down below was danger, but also love, life and Kerbin, beautiful Kerbin. \u0022Let\u0027s do it\u0022 Bill chimed with a painfully hidden glee. Bob steadied his hand and gripped the throttle. \u0022Ready to rock.\u0022 Bob confidently proclaimed. Nothing could stop their triumphant return. Nothing could prevent them from landing on the this minute blue dot in the great ebon abyss they had returned from. They had witnessed the glory of Jool from Laythe and left their mark on history. A flag that told their story of patience, pride and success. Bill maneuvered into his final approach and leaned back into his seat. Bob watched the altimeter, counting in his head the seconds he would need. They had but one chance, the last of their fuel in their tanks. Just enough for one pass at landing. At the crucial moment, he throttled up slowing their descent while watching the last bit of their fuel drain into the fire that flared rich red beneath them. As he held his breath watching the last gasp of fuel combust in his mind he heard a faint cheer and the words \u0022Touchdown.\u0022 Bill slowly released the throttle and steadied his hand as he looked over at Bob. Bob was already looking his way with a grin that reached across his face as he flipped the lid to his helmet up and said to him \u0022We\u0027re home Bill. We\u0027re home.\u0022 The sun crested from it slumber on the horizon to greet them with rays of light that kissed them warmly. Through the speaker a static filled voice echoed in his ears, \u0022Welcome home heroes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
