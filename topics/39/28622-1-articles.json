As of right now, without giving away any major details, we can say \u0022so far so good\u0022. Over the past 7 days since the project has started we have achieved orbit, docked, and built the first piece of a space dock and station, we also managed to re-enter Kerbin once without any casualties. We have had minor casualties, estimated at 50\u002B Kerbals, and 25 or so \u0022spacecraft\u0022. You may want to interview the 4 Kerbals who have come back safely from space, but funds may have to be spent to find them on Kerbin because we do not know exactly where they are located. As soon as they have landed we terminated the missions so that we may move on quickly and painlessly onto \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Arial Black\u0027;\u0022\u003EUniversal Domination\u003C/span\u003E. The current status of this mission is as following: 130\u002B space debris, and 4 space craft that are now considered debris because we decided to terminate those missions due to new ideas for spacecraft and those projects are now considered outdated. Again please refer to the living Kerbals that are wandering around on this planet. Future plans for our mission are as follows: we will built a station and head towards the big rock in the sky which we have named Mun. It is quite curious as to what it is made of. We will post pictures in the next report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep sending the money, thanks V3GA\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"V3GA","CreatedById":67402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T16:00:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo: Please don\u0027t reach the Higher Ups of \u003Cstrong\u003EScience\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EFunding\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe blew it up! So sorry... we will try again today. KSS or \u0022Kerbal Space Station\u0022 is gone and it\u0027s all our fault in the name of science! We tried to dock a piece of the living quarters when one of the Kerbals decided it would be a great idea to jump out and board the space station before boarding and the two pieces collided and epic-ly exploded! Debris count is now roughly 300 pieces and we think 4 Kerbals that need to be brought back from orbit. But first some good news! After many attempts of trying to bring pieces of the station into space we have finally found a decent formula of how to do it without exploding mid flight. More on this later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease send us more brave Kerbals. They pay rate is raised due to life Hazard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
