The test room was actually a repurposed public swimming pool but Kerbals space program only puts .0000000000001% of their budget into astronaut training since they just have a long line of random idiots waiting to go to space. As they approached the pool a fat stubby mechanic emerged hidden by a pile of garbage. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Ahhh the intrepid munwalkers\u00E2\u20AC he greeted them warmly, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Here for your training session of course. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Of course bill replied in a professional manner\u00E2\u20AC, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Bah this training is useless\u00E2\u20AC Jeb replied in an irritated voice bob just remained silent. The mechanic with a puzzled look just replied \u00E2\u20AC\u0153alright, then let\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s start\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u0153The Extra-Atmospheric-Suit is designed to protect you from the harsh munar environment, a thick insulated fabric will prove airtight and comfortable while walking on the mun. Its lead lining will also keep you from getting sunburn.\u00E2\u20AC On the back of your suit is your PLSS backpack this contains all oxygen and fuel for your Kerbal Mobility Unit.\u00E2\u20AC After a few more hours of this lecture they were ready for training. Bill and Jeb slipped into their suit relatively easily will bob struggled a bit. Finally after a combined effort they were all ready. Each stood on a repurposed window cleaning elevator a winch spooled up and they were slowly lowered into the pool under water was a full mock up of the Archimedes Lander as they approached it bill immediately began the simulation to the letter while Jeb was constantly screwing with bob. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Will you help me unpack the equipment Jeb\u00E2\u20AC Bob said in a stern angry voice. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Why this is just a simulation, I like to have fun before a mission\u00E2\u20AC as he tripped bob falling over in slow motion. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Besides we\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ve gone over this a million times before in the conference room why can\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t we just rest up you know .16 just came out in Human Space Program I would already have Neil Armstrong walking on the moon right now. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Not now there is no time for your games I swear I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122d hit you if I didn\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t get kicked off the crew now just get to it.\u00E2\u20AC Bill Replied. Just about a week later was the big day, Launch. Inside the astronaut complex the scientist checked and re-checked all the herbals vital signs before dawning their orange launch suits. As the kerbals left each had a life support suit cased hooked to their suit to supply oxygen until they reached the pod. As the large doors opened a flood of light entered as thousands of kerbals hoped to snap that lucky photo. As bill and bob walked calmly jeb took advantage of his celebrity status basking in admiration and handing out autographs. As they parted the crowd they finally reached the kerbal van the famous vehicle that has taken all kerbals to the pad on missions. Inside were plush comfortable chairs fit for a king or at least someone about to die. Bob peered out the window and saw the looming Euclid III rocket sitting on the pad at this sight he began to have a panic attack the kerbal scientist passed off his heart rate spike as normal for him. Suddenly the van squeled to a stop as they reached the crew elevator. They stepped out of the van and began to slowly walk to the elevator door. They waved what they thought was their last goodbye to the people of kerbin as they acended the pad. The long access way seemed to go on forever. As they reached the pod mission control noticed a 1 pound anomaly had appeared in bobs suit. Jeb entered the pod first and took his spot in the bottom of the pod while bill and bob took the pilot seats. After they were secured in the pod the hatch was shut with a final clank the kerbals were know cut off from kerbin until splashdown. Suddenly an ominous voice came over the radio, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153We are T- 2 minutes from the launch of Archimedes I the first Kerbanned landing on the mun.\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u0153T-10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,ignition and liftoff.\u00E2\u20AC As the announcer uttered these words the crew was suddenly sucked into their seat as the mission timer started. The power of the eight boosters overwhelmed the rocket as it climbed higher and higher finally it felt as if the kerbals were launched forward as the bososters cut off and seprated. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153booster separation confirmed we are T\u002B30 secconds into the flight, a voice crackled on the raido drowned out by the 5 engines. As the ship hit 10km the gravity turn started and the ship began to pick up lateral speed. Suddenly an explosive shutter signaled the first stage separation. The engine ignition went smoothly and soon shut down the voice of mission control came over the radio and announced, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Archimedes I\u00E2\u20AC your are go on orbit. Inside the capsule a small celebration occurred however they still had to perform the Trans Munar instertion. After lying dormant for about an hour the engine erupted as it boosted the kerbals into a munar instertion trajectory finally after about a minute the engine coughed and slowly died out. A final explosive crash sent the lander drifting to the mun. finally the crew removed their bulky helmets and floated freely about the cabin bouncing of walls and each other. After about 8 hours of bad knock knock jokes and 10 bags of chips the kerbals began to approach the mun. As the vertical speed indiacator the engine roared to life to put the kerbals in to a somewhat circular munar orbit. As they floated throught the void of space they made their final checks of the landing system before they began to dawn their EVA suits. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Are you ready.\u00E2\u20ACJeb said in a Maniacl voice, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Let\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s do this.\u00E2\u20AC The engine roared again now louder than ever as they began their descent to the moon. Everything was going smoothly until a meteorite knocked of the guidance system. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Bob, Bob!\u00E2\u20AC bill cried, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153you have to pilot this thing\u00E2\u20ACas he glanced over he saw bill had passed out from panic. Determined Bill Pressed up against the window making quick judgments and hoping. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Contact light.\u00E2\u20AC He shouted as a large thud surprised the crew. They had made it with little injury. Immediately Jeb moved to depressurize the capsule a squeal filled the capsule as the last of the air was vented. Slowly the hatch opened to reveal the bright powdery munar surface. Jeb filled with pride slowly crawled out of the hatch looking auround at witch he only could describe as magnificent desolation as he descended from the ladder he firmly planted his foot in the dust knowing he was the first kerbal ever on the mun. Immediately his heart filled with joy and he began doing what he called mun parkour. His joy was interrupted by the voice of Bill calling him to the cargo bay where he reluctantly meandered then. He was caught offguard as bill shoved the flag into his arms as he set it up he peered up to see bill cautiously descending the ladder almost shaking the entire ship. All three kerbals spent 30 minutes bouncing around on the 1/6 gravity of the mun. However that fun was short lasted as the hatch shut once again and they accended into the darkness towards kerbin. After a period of boredom they began to notice the pink glow outside the space craft and admired as the space craft rocketed through the atmosphere finally the parachute ripped open and they glided safely down to the recovery ship were they were greeted as heroes in celebration they all were given their favorite ice cream. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Divaglio3578","CreatedById":29719,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-17T03:01:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood read, but please use proper grammar.
