Pretty soon, I\u0027ll be starting up a youtube series that will involve two challenges: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93234-Ell-s-Ultimate-HardKore-Challenge\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEll\u0027s Ultimate HardKore Challenge\u003C/a\u003E and the grand tour \u002B Jeb level for the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57197-The-Ultimate-Jool-5-Challenge-land-Kerbals-on-all-moons-and-return-in-one-big-mission\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUltimate Jool-5 Challenge\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, I\u0027ll be using the harder mods (plus some visual packs) to attempt a grand tour mission. I chose to do a youtube series because it would add publicity to my channel, plus I\u0027d been thinking about doing this for a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when I get the technology, I\u0027ll be sending some probes to the Jool system to map all the bodies there before selecting a landing spot. Each orbiter will also have a lander, and will resemble the Rosetta mission. There will also be a voyager-type mission that will transmit some data from the Jool system, before taking a picture of the kerbol system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe configuration for the video\u0027s will be on every Monday and Friday (give or take a day).
