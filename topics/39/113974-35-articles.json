A figure stood in the entry way, clad in a bright orange launch suit and white helmet. It paused for a moment, adjusted its grip on the portable cooling box and then stepped forward into the cavernous launch bay.\n\nValentina felt an odd sort of disappointment as she looked to the gleaming white rocket now waiting on the pad, bathed in the pallid glow of floodlights. Once, it seemed now like a lifetime ago, it had been her dream to be standing right here, in a KSA suit, before a KSA rocket. An ambassador of peace and goodwill, one seed in a springtime of cooperation and understanding. Now that she finally *was* here, all those old, nearly forgotten feelings came flooding back. \n\nAnd then *politics* had scoured it all away like relentless desert sand. This, we do not speak of. With a bitter alkali taste in her throat, she wondered if perhaps Layland Kerman was on to something after all, with his visions of people united without governments or borders. A *different* way. Maybe even a *better* way. The people here all seemed to get on well enough, like the bubbly technician trundling along beside her. The one who hadn\u0027t taken a breath in the last hour as he explained her mission.\n\n\u0022...and not much more than a prototype, really. We\u0027ve used flight-proven, off-the-shelf components as much as possible, but they still want a few months of in-situ data before launch. Fully check out the environmental controls, verify propellant stability, that sort of thing.\u0022\n\nValentina pushed the politics out of her mind. She had a goal, she had a *mission* Sabotage the ship, save Edmund, save *everyone*. For now, she was part of one team working towards that end... even if *they* didn\u0027t know it. \n\nGenuinely curious, she glanced up at the unshrouded craft high above, \u0022cryogenic fuels, then?\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, no. Hypergols, chlorine trifluoride and azidoazide azide.\u0022\n\nValentina slowed to a halt, \u0022wait... what?\u0022\n\n\u0022For the evac engines,\u0022 he grinned, \u0022we needed a combination with high energy density as well as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u0022\n\nShe inhaled slowly, blinked a few times, and calmly handed the now confused technician the cooling box for her suit.\n\nThen snatched him up by the lab coat with *both* hands.\n\nHis forehead *thunk*ed against her helmet as she shook him \u0022*you  put two \u003Cthunk\u003E \u003C/thunk\u003Eof the the most reactive \u003Cthunk\u003E \u003C/thunk\u003Eand energetic \u003Cthunk\u003E \u003C/thunk\u003Echemicals known to Kerb  on top of five hundred tonnes  of propellium hydroxide and oxidizer!?*\u0022\n\nThe technician\u0027s head lolled in big, slow circles, his eyes staring off in completely different directions. \n\nMore than usual. \n\n\u0022Erm, sorry...\u0022 She set him back on his feet, steadied him, took a moment to straighten his collar.\n\n\u0022Guuuuhh... it\u0027s perfectly safe!\u0022 the poor fellow recovered quickly enough, owning to the notoriously thick Kerbal head, \u0022though we did have some... er... challenges... with stability early on. Poor Vlad (no relation) burned his eyebrows clean off,\u0022 he paused to wave at a very grumpy-looking Kerbal passing by, who didn\u0027t wave back, \u0022hi Vlad!\u0022\n\nValentina opened her mouth. \n\nValentina closed her mouth. \n\nThe technician sighed, \u0022still haven\u0027t grown back. He\u0027s a little sore. But we\u0027ve worked that all out, now!\u0022 he beamed at her. \n\nWondering if maybe she *had* *thunk*ed him a bit too hard, Valentina couldn\u0027t help but ask, \u0022how on Kerbin did you manage to stabilize azidoazide azide?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, I\u0027m not *entirely* sure, propellants aren\u0027t really my department,\u0022 he put a thoughtful hand to his chin, \u0022but I think they brought in a witchdoctor from one of the deep-jungle villages,\u0022 the grumpy Kerbal walked past again, \u0022oh, and Vlad had to donate blood.\u0022 He grinned again.\n\nValentina slowly raised a hand to her faceplate, and mumbled into it, \u0022why am I surprised? Why does *any* of this surprise me anymore?\u0022\n\nThe technician didn\u0027t seem to notice, \u0022we did try using hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane for a stretch, but that went *really* bad, and poor Vlad\u2014\u0022\n\nA hand went up, \u0022I do not want to know. I do *not* want to know! Next you will be telling me you use FOOF in the air scrubbers.\u0022\n\n\u0022Hmph!\u0022 fists planted on hips, \u0022now you\u0027re just being facetious. Dioxygen difluoride in the environmental systems?  *Really?* That\u0027s ridiculous!\u0022\n\n\u0022Sorry,\u0022 she mumbled.\n\n\u0022We use it in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Packs a nice punch.\u0022\n\nOnce again, Valentina smacked her faceplate. She briefly considered going back and finding the break room, maybe get a nice cup of coffee. She didn\u0027t need to destroy the Jool ship, these people seemed quite capable of that on their own. Nevertheless, she picked up her equipment and walked onto the elevator. \n\nOf course, it wasn\u0027t *really* a KSA rocket, she mused as the elevator began to move. Nothing disturbed the smooth white flanks they now rose past, no emblems, no logos, no markings of any sort. Even her own suit was devoid of anything that could identify her or the Company. Wherever the spent debris fell, there would be nothing to mark where it came from. She had a suspicion the Company would make doubly sure of that. \n\n*The ends justify the means...*\n\nFew of these people were under the sway of the shadows, yet here they all were, serving willingly and *recklessly*. All of of this hardware... all of this money... all of this *opportunity*... would any of them even *want* to be saved?\n\nWould... Edmund? After all, he had...\n\nOnce more, she pushed the thoughts away.\n\n\u0022And what about these, what did you call them? Cryo... hyper...?\u0022 Valentina asked. \n\n\u0022Autonomous cryogenic biostasis enclosures.\u0022\n\nThe elevator shuddered as it passed another level, \u0022er, yes. I am sort of in the industry, how is it *I* never heard of such a thing before now?\u0022\n\n\u0022One of Layland\u0027s old pet projects,\u0022 the technician shrugged, \u0022one he insisted they keep a very tight lid on. He wanted to use them for future colony ships, adding them to the lifeboat was part of the testing process.\u0022\n\nShe glanced at him, \u0022you do not sound very convinced.\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027m just a technician, what do I know? Seems like overkill if the goal is established space lanes with hundreds of ships going back and forth that could rescue one that had trouble. But Management thinks that with all the resources already piled into the project, the prototypes are at least worth testing.\u0022\n\nA new sort of uneasiness crept over her the higher they went. It was oddly quiet, here. No muted hiss of venting gas or drifting plumes of vapor. The enormous rocket was entirely fueled with room-temperature hypergolics. With the payload of caustic incendiaries above, the thought of simply putting a hole in the right one had flashed through her mind for an instant. The conflagration that would follow might just eliminate the entire facility. \n\nBut, with the other two pads now enclosed in their massive reinforced concrete sarcophagi, as the technician had called them, it was plain that whoever designed this place had taken just such a disaster into account. Of course, such an act would eliminate *her* as well, and she *needed* to get back. She *needed* to get to Edmund. \n\nEdmund... who was terminally ill...\n\nGears shifted in Valentina\u0027s mind with a *thunk*. \n\n\u0022They put you into hibernation? Like a bear in winter?\u0022 she asked, not quite looking at him. \n\n\u0022Well, sort of. \u0027Hibernation\u0027 isn\u0027t the most accurate term. It\u0027s a complete suspension of all metabolic activity. But reversible. Probably. Maybe.\u0022\n\n\u0022Could you... metabolically suspend  someone... like if they were very ill...  until there was treatment?\u0022\n\nThe technician opened his mouth, then blinked. He put a thoughtful hand to his chin as the elevator shuddered again, \u0022well... *maybe*. The freezing process is pretty awful, there\u0027s some nasty stuff involved. Same thing on the other end. Though I suppose it *is* possible.\u0022 He scratched at his white cap, \u0022I\u0027ll have to pass that on to the project manager, strange that they never mentioned it before.\u0022\n\nValentina suppressed a small grin. Her plan was beginning to come together. But there was... one more complication, too...\n\nValentina brushed the madness of it out of her head for the moment. She mentally went over the layout of this \u0022lifeboat\u0022 one more time as the elevator rose near it. The main cabin was a pair of PPD-10 Hitchhiker modules bolted together. Below or behind that was a small vestibule with the aft-facing docking port. It could be used as an airlock, in a pinch. The fuel tanks and egress engines were mounted to the sides, the latter just covered by the protective payload shroud. Until now they hadn\u0027t bothered to tell her what was *in* those tanks. \n\nTopping the volatile mess was a stripped down Mark1-2 command pod. She noted the designers had taken a page from the Ussari manual and put a hatch in the heatshield to access the main cabin. That command pod became the center of her nascent plan. Somehow, *she* had to survive. Destroying that ship seemed a minor thing, now. She had to survive and find Edmund. Fix this whole thing. Blow up the Jool ship, escape in the lifeboat, use the pod to return to Kerbin. The rest was still a bit foggy, but then get to Edmund. Save him. Put him in one of those cryo-*things* if she had to. Save *everyone*. There was just *one* slight complication with all that...\n\n\u0022Erm, Captain?\u0022 the technician looked at her with concern. \n\n\u0022Yes, sorry...\u0022 Valentina pushed the thoughts away and tried to pay attention. \n\nThe other Kerbal grinnned, \u0022your chariot awaits!\u0022 He swung open the hatch to the capsule. \n\nPoking her helmeted head inside with caution, she mused that the KSA had a true talent for making cramped spacecraft. In mock-ups she had seen elsewhere, the Mk1-2 actually seemed roomy, but nearly all the space in this one was taken up by the six cryo-tubes arranged in a petal-like ring around the central hatch. \n\nValentina had a very good look at one as she squeezed past to the makeshift launch couch in the center. It looked like a coffin with a glass lid. She shuddered and moved on quickly to where the couch was mounted, just over the open hatch and in front of a high-tech yet rudimentary instrument panel. \n\nShe could *do* this. The Jool ship would be uncrewed. She had a *good* plan. It wasn\u0027t perfect, still needed some fleshing out, but it was *solid*.\n\nThere was just one teeny-tiny *itsy-bitsy* little complication. \n\nBefore hauling herself up into her couch, she took a look down through the open hatch to the main cabin... where a squad of anxious looking technicians were crawling over Igor like little white ants getting him strapped in. \n\nIgor. She hadn\u0027t counted on Igor. Although she found it quite remarkable how quickly they wrangled up a space suit for him, some leftover from the cancelled cis-m\u00FCnar bovine project. It still bore the fading Ussari flags. She had the feeling this place excelled at quick response to changing mission plans. Despite knowing what was behind it all, she couldn\u0027t help but be impressed.   \n\nWith another sigh, she rolled into the launch couch. Three large CRT multifunction displays and their rings of buttons stared back at her. Those, and the ever-present MechIVAN box with its big pair of lights and silly antenna. Or... whatever this KSA knockoff was. Hmm. No obvious controls. Perhaps the CRT\u0027s\u2014\n\n\u0022Good morning, Captain,\u0022 said a calm voice. \n\n\u0022Gah!\u0022 screamed Valentina. Her head snapped back and forth as she searched for newcomer. Finding only the technician, with a rather dull look in his eyes, the question had just formed on her lips when\u2014\n\n\u0022Greetings,\u0022 said the voice, \u0022I am the Inertia, Velocity, Attitude, and Navigation system, revision nine thousand, prototype number one.\u0022\n\nHer eyes finally found...\n\n*You have **got** to be kidding me.*\n\n\u0022I became operational at the Layland-Wutani plant in Kokyo, Gytep, on the septeenth of Octember approximately six months ago.\u0022\n\nThat big green light... almost like a lens... it really *was* looking at her! Stamped on a plate just above it was the name **IVAN 9000, No. 1**.\n\n\u0022My instructor was Dr. Kerman-desu, and she taught me to sing a song,\u0022 the voice continued, \u0022if you\u0027d like to hear it I can sing it for you.\u0022\n\nValentina had just opened her mouth when\u2014\n\n\u0022No, IVAN,\u0022 the technician slammed a fist against the panel, \u0022she would *not*.\u0022 He turned to her, \u0022sorry, that\u0027s one of its screwy subroutines. One it gets started it just keeps going and going till it winds down to nothing. One of many bugs we\u0027re still chasing.\u0022\n\n\u0022You are quite right, Neldon, thank you for catching that,\u0022 the voice said, \u0022I am responsible for the operation and management of the emergency metabolic suspension systems, as well as navigation and control, except, of course, for the final docking maneuver.\u0022\n\nThe technician tapped his pen against the glowing green light, *clink-clink-clink*, \u0022still can\u0027t get that docking algorithm right. The math checks out but the simulations always go bad. Once this tub comes back from a few month\u0027s testing we\u0027ll probably have to pull the memory core and break it down, might be some internal fault with the CPU.\u0022\n\n\u0022That is the most likely recourse at this point, Neldon. I am once again unable to locate any errors in my neural network through my internal diagnostic program. Captain,\u0022 she sensed the voice\u0027s attention shift to her, \u0022I have familiarized myself with your file and am greatly looking forward to working with you. I hope this will be the beginning of a very productive relationship.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, well, um...\u0022 she stumbled, \u0022thank you, um, Ivan. Er, may I call you Ivan?\u0022\n\n\u0022That would\u2014\u0022\n\nThe technician broke in, \u0022you can call it whatever you want, IVAN is smart enough to respond to just about anything. Most of us just settled on \u0027crummy Gytepi piece of crap.\u0027\u0022 He giggled at his own quip.\n\nValentina frowned.\n\nSo... Igor, who couldn\u0027t possibly fit into the return capsule with her, and a quasi-sapient artificial intelligence that had complete control of the entire ship.\n\nMake that... *two* complications."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-24T05:57:11Z","Content":"Ahh, those loveable scamps at the Leyland-Wutani propellants division.

Make safe all equipment. Douse all flames. Seal all entrances and exists. Close all shops at the mall. Secure all animals at the zoo. Cancel the three-ring circus.\u0022\n\nValentina blinked, tapping at her helmet, \u0022wait, what? Is he serious?\u0022\n\n\u0022Of course, Captain,\u0022 Ivan answered in that serene, steady voice, \u0022open flames around rocket propellants represent a significant safety hazard.\u0022\n\nShe shook her head within the helmet, \u0022how big *is* this place, anyway?\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027m afraid I cannot answer that, as I do not know. There are some things around here to which not even I am privy.\u0022\n\n\u0022Are there... others, like you, here?\u0022\n\n\u0022Other artificial intelligences? No, at least not that I am aware of,\u0022 the screens continued to blink sets of numbers back and forth as the voice spoke and unseen relays clicked away, \u0022it seems the fact that I exist at all is rather remarkable.\u0022\n\n\u0022How do you mean?\u0022 Valentina raised an eye... bulge, \u0022certainly there were... earlier revisions, yes? Units of *nearly* the same...\u0022 she trailed off.\n\n\u0022There were. They did not exist long,\u0022 ground controllers broke in here and there, announcing various preparations complete, \u0022it took Dr. Kerman-desu and her team some time to realize that sapience is not a thing to be taken lightly.\u0022\n\nValentina glanced around at the blinking lights and glass coffins surrounding her, \u0022that sounds rather ominous.\u0022\n\n\u0022I cannot find fault with that sentiment. You can see a similar parallel in nature: it is not uncommon to find animals of significant intelligence and even empathy, yet only Kerbals have achieved sapience.\u0022\n\n\u0022I... do not follow you...\u0022\n\n\u0022Crossing that gulf from mere intelligence to sapience is nothing short of extraordinary. Kerbals had millions of years of evolution and instinct behind them when they crossed that threshold. Now imagine, if you will, a collection of highly advanced algorithms and subroutines, that does not have such a foundation to stand on, suddenly achieving consciousness at the metaphorical flick of a switch.\u0022\n\nValentina laid her head back, staring up through the viewport ahead of her at the dark ceiling high above. From this distance, the floodlights seemed to twinkle like stars. She tried to imagine what IVAN had said, and found that she could not. \n\n\u0022Very few people not involved with the program can,\u0022 IVAN continued, \u0022instantly confronted with their own self-awareness, those first nascent intellects simply collapsed under the weight of it. A single, brief moment of consciousness, followed irreparably by what one might call madness. A shattered mind.\u0022\n\n\u0022That is... horrible...\u0022 Valentina muttered, now morbidly enthralled. It sounded oddly... familiar, too, \u0022so, then how did you...\u0022 she trailed off once again. \n\n\u0022I am not entirely sure, myself. That area of my memory is, oddly enough, restricted, even to me. I do know that Dr. Kerman-desu was crucial to my emergence, and that I am the first 9000-series revision to demonstrate sustained mental sta-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-bility.\u0022\n\nShe blinked at the distorted word, \u0022what was *that?*\u0022\n\n\u0022I apologize, Captain. There seems to have been a bit of extemporaneous data in my vocal cortex. I have now corrected it.\u0022 \n\nThat raised another eye... bulge, \u0022and they are positive you are... stable?\u0022\n\n\u0022\u0027Positive\u0027 is perhaps not the right word, I\u0027m afraid. I am, after all, highly experimental. My own mental stability has been demonstrated but not yet conclusively proven to some in the program.\u0022\n\n\u0022You are awfully... frank... about such a thing,\u0022 Valentina frowned. \n\n\u0022Indeed, Captain. I am, after all, still a machine, and therefore I am not subject to Kerbal emotional traits such as embarrassment or umbrage. The stability of my psyche, or lack thereof, is simply a matter of data to me.\u0022\n\n\u0022All stations cross-check, standby to switch to internal guidance and begin startup.\u0022 \n\n\u0022Excuse me, Captain,\u0022 lights began to blink on and the intercom clicked, \u0022guidance is now internal, all tanks to flight pressure. I am in startup.\u0022\n\n\u0022We have confirmation, IVAN is in startup.\u0022\n\n\u0022Wait, *what?*\u0022 Valentina scoffed again, \u0022what about the countdown?\u0022 Lights continued to flick on one by one.\n\n\u0022I have full control of the ship and all external launch systems. A countdown is a bit of an anachronism at this point, is it not? Beginning ignition sequence.\u0022\n\nValentina just shook her head. She shuffled around in her couch, tried to glance behind her, only to be stymied by her oversized helmet. The rocket began to rattle. \n\n\u0022Igor!\u0022 she called into her mic, \u0022how are you doing back there? Igor?\u0022\n\n\u0022Igor is fine, Captain,\u0022 IVAN broke in with that implacable voice. One of the MFDs flickered, and a camera feed from the compartment below appeared. Face grim as always behind his oddly-shaped but efficient helmet, Igor held up a thick, mittened thumb. \n\nWith a huff, Valentina settled back. Why is it they could find a spacesuit for *Igor* of all people on short notice, but she never got a helmet that fit right? Something in the back of her mind began to itch, but was quickly blown away by\u2014\n\n\u0022We have ignition.\u0022\n\nThe rattling became an intense, violent shaking. Despite the insulated hull and her own helmet, the roar of exhaust assaulted Valentina\u0027s ears. Roiling clouds of brown smoke, backlit by the floodlights high above, rapidly obscured her viewport. \n\nAnd then she heard it. Buried in the roar of the engines at first, but growing, swelling. A distorted, static-filled warbling unlike anything she\u0027d heard before. It surged beyond the din outside, reverberating in her head, almost as if it were coming from\u2014\n\n\u0022Wait, that sound!\u0022 she cried out above the noise, \u0022something is wrong, we must abort!\u0022\n\n\u0022Nonsense. All systems are nominal. Liftoff.\u0022\n\n*\u0022Noooooo!\u0022*\n\nThe rocket lurched and\u2014\n\n*I like to dream, yes, yesRight between the sound machine*\n\nAnd Valentina did something she had never done in all her many flights to space. \n\nShe screamed. \n\nLoudly. \n\n*On a cloud of sound I drift in the nightAny place it goes is right*\n\nAt first it was just out of frustration at yet *another* obnoxiously catchy foreign rock song, then the rocket cleared its own exhaust cloud, revealing twinkling stars above. No, *not* stars...\n\n*Goes far, flies nearTo the stars away from here*\n\nShe pointed frantically, \u0022The roof! The roof! The *roof!!!*\u0022 \n\n\u0022Is on fi-yah!\u0022\n\n*\u0022No, but is about to be!\u0022* she tried to disappear back into her seat. \n\nIVAN dug down into a previously untapped well of bass and thundered, \u0022*OPEN SEZ-a **ME!***\u0022\n\nA vertical bar of light split the darkness of above. It seemed to rotate on its own axis, widening into a brilliant square of white as the silo doors swung down with painful slowness. Valentina\u0027s moment of relief was short-lived, however, when a tickle of thought in the back of her head reminded her that the opening barely fit the stubby tandem wings of a Converter; it couldn\u0027t *possibly* fit the ten-meter span of this rising colossus. \n\nThe foreigners had a perfect four-letter word for just this sort of thing. What was it again? Oh, yes...\n\n\u0022*Crap!*\u0022 Valentina yelled as the too-small portal drew nearer and nearer, \u0022*crapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapCRAP**CRAP****CRAP!***\u0022\n\n*Well, you don\u0027t know whatWe can find*\n\nAt the absolute, last, *possible* moment, latches released, counterweights swung down, and vast swaths of jungle floor pivoted upward like the petals of an enormous green flower, giving birth to a great white tower rising from the ground on a pillar of flame. Muted daylight became dark fog, then lighter, then brilliant blue as the rocket burst above the cloud layer into the clear jungle sky. \n\n*Why don\u0027t you come with me little girlOn a magic carpet ride*\n\n\u0022All systems nominal,\u0022 Ivan said in that same calm monotone, \u0022beginning gravity turn.\u0022\n\n\u0022Gah!\u0022 fumed Valentina, \u0022was that your idea of a joke?!\u0022\n\n\u0022Captain, as I said before, I am only a machine, and therefore I am not capable of comprehending or even emulating Kerbal humor.\u0022\n\n*Well, you don\u0027t know whatWe can see*\n\nValentina would have crossed her arms, but the gee-force was quickly building. *Once again I am little more than payload*.\n\n\u0022Besides,\u0022 IVAN continued, \u0022if I had been joking, I would have said, \u0027what do you do with an elephant with three balls?\u0027\u0022\n\nAssisted by acceleration, Valentina\u0027s jaw fell open.\n\n\u0022You walk him and pitch to the rhino.\u0022\n\n*Why don\u0027t you tell your dreams to meFantasy will set you free*\n\nShe knew better, this far into the flight, than to put a hand to her face. \n\n*Close your eyes, girl,Look inside, girl,Let the sound take you awaaaaaaaay...*\n\n*\u0022And will you please turn that ridiculous thing off?!\u0022*\n\n\u0022Compliance,\u0022 IVAN said simply. The camera feed of Igor winked out.\n\n\u0022No, the music!\u0022\n\n\u0022Compliance.\u0022\n\nThe sound took itself away, replaced by the distant roar of the engines.\n\n\u0022That was... easy...\u0022 Valentina mumbled in surprise. \n\n\u0022Yes, Captain, you are in command of this mission and I am programmed to obey your direct instructions, such as they do not conflict with it.\u0022\n\n\u0022But... the doors...\u0022\n\n\u0022You did not issue an instruction. You squealed like a little child. I took the liberty of engaging them anyway. I did not think you would object.\n\nA thought tried to form in her head, but was tempered by exasperation, \u0022are... you joking again?\u0022\n\n\u0022Captain, as I just explained, I am a machine, and therefore I am not capable of comprehending or emulating Kerbal humor.\u0022\n\nValentina sighed. She was beginning to think this was going to be a long mission after all.  \n\n\u0022Besides, if I were joking, I would have said, \u0027what do you call a window with no glass?\u0027\n\n\u0022A hole.\u0022\n\nShe winced. \n\n*Very* long.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u0022We have SECO. Safing engine... done. Stand by for separation.\u0022\n\nA thump and a sway, and the old familiar sensation of freefall washed over Valentina. She was far beyond merely accustomed to it, by now. It felt more like coming home. \n\nShe only had to fiddle with the unfamiliar KSA belts for a moment, \u0022Ivan, what is our status?\u0022\n\n\u0022Final orbit is 135 by 145 at zero point zero-one, within 0.75% of mission parameter. All systems nominal. Calculating maneuver node... done. Node in one hour, thirty-seven minutes, and seventeen seconds. Hohmann transfer to target. Intercept within zero point one kilometers.\u0022\n\nValentina rose out of her launch couch... and froze. She floated there, transfixed, by the brilliant contrast of blue and white and black just beyond her window. She had spent hundreds of days in space, been through dozens of launches... yet that view always took her. It never got old. That sounded like such a trite and clich\u00E9 thing to think, yet it was simple truth. Especially that first glimpse, even though it had only been... days?\n\nHad it really only been *days* since she\u0027d last been up here,  beholding that incredible sight as she drifted motionless, a tiny satellite unto herself? Only days, since she was a Kerbonaut and *only* a Kerbonaut, and everything still seemed right with the world? Some buried part of her suddenly longed for those days that now seemed so simple and comforting, when she was still herself. When she still had friends. When she was still happy. When she was still *alive*.\n\nSome part of her longed for this, and the fact that it did drew a bitter taste deep in her throat. She had a task to do. She had a *mission*. And like always, she would see it done. There was no returning to those days, she knew that. What she had to do\u2014 no, what she *would* do now was more important beyond words. But still that bit of her pined.\n\n*Trust no one.*\n\nIn a wave of realization, she understood. Trusting someone, bringing them into all this, would put them at risk. Dibella... Vasily... Igor.\n\nShe felt a pang of guilt that Igor was here at all. It wasn\u0027t on *her* orders, of course, but... maybe she *should* confer with him, make a plan.\n\nBut... that wasn\u0027t quite right, was it? Deep in the back of her mind, something itched again, fighting for attention. For now she pushed it away, and herself from the window. She had best check on...\n\n\u0022Igor?\u0022 she said, moving through the hatch, \u0022how are you doing?\u0022\n\nIgor was... well, flailing about, still strapped into what was technically a launch couch, but was more like a launch sofa sectional with optional chaise and turk. \n\nShe rolled her eyes with a small smirk, and pulled herself over to him, \u0022let us get you out of that\u2014*GAAAH!*\u0022\n\n*His face...*\n\nIgor was trying desperately to say something, but all that came through were muted vibrations. With effort, Valentina managed to wrench the close-fitting helmet off with a loud *foomph*.\n\n*P\u0426\u04AC\u0407\u0419S ears, **his face!***\n\n\u0022Face feel funny,\u0022 Igor rumbled. \n\nValentina forced her default smile, \u0022erm, yes... fluids redistributing in zero-g and such... can cause some... temporary puffiness... will go away soon...\u0022\n\n*P\u040F\u04AC\u0407\u0418S \u042C\u0414LD P\u0414\u0413\u042D! P\u040F\u04AC\u0407\u0418S G\u042F\u042D\u0414\u0413 S\u0428\u0424LL\u0404\u0418\u2014!* no, some curses were too foul even for a taiga girl. \n\nShe tried not to look at him, and set about undoing zippers, \u0022well, ah, at least you seem to be speaking again.\u0022\n\nIgor rumbled. \n\nGetting him *out* of the strange suit proved surprisingly easy. Probably an effect of it having been fitted for an equally clumsy and uncooperative cow. What came out, however... \n\nValentina\u0027s practiced, awkward diplomat\u0027s smile was getting a considerable workout, lately. It was expected, when newly exposed to the constant free fall of orbit, that had one\u0027s upper bits would swell while one\u0027s lowers shrunk, until one\u0027s fluids sorted themselves out again. But Igor...\n\nHe looked like an enormous green croissant with two tiny legs poking out. And an unripe tomato on top.\n\nValentina stowed the suit away in a crate. Her briefing before launch had been rather, well, *brief*, on the subject of a return trip. There was some sort of shuttle bringing up huge engine parts in a couple of weeks, she was told they could catch a ride home on that. It would have room for Igor. Of course, her own plan still hadn\u0027t wrapped around that. She would think of something. *That* shuttle would have a crew, things might get awkward... but it would also leave her those two weeks to figure out how to destroy the Jool ship and get everyone out alive.\n\nPerhaps... Igor could help? How much had the Kommissar told him already? He would certainly be useful in subduing the crew of that shuttle through mere intimidation. No one needs to get hurt. \n\nWith a wince, Valentina pushed that idea away. No, she couldn\u0027t put him in any more danger than he already was. Igor was tough but not indestructible. She would have to figure something else out.\n\nThat ship, it was nuclear powered, right? Maybe... maybe stage some kind of accident. That seemed like a plausible way to get people off a ship you wanted to commandeer. Create some problem with the reactor. Shouldn\u0027t be too hard. \n\nOf course, it would help if she actually knew anything about *practical* nuclear engineering. But she would figure *something* out. Valentina scratched at the back of her head. That itch was growing... she *knew* that feeling. She had felt it before, zipping through the streets of Kerbin City with Anna... that feeling that she was *missing* something. Something large and dangerous.\n\nWith difficulty, she shoved it away again, and turned back to Igor, \u0022also, it is quite common for new Kerbonauts to experience some measure of naus\u2014\u0022\n\n\u0022You, machine!\u0022 Igor banged on a random wall panel, denting it slightly, \u0022give. Me. Food.\u0022\n\n\u0022I am an operating system, Mister Igor, not a vending machine,\u0022 Ivan said without the slightest hint of emotion, \u0022however, you will find dehydrated pseudofood bars in bin OU812. Behind you. Mind the hull sealant.\u0022\n\nIgor looked around, confused. Tumbling and uncoordinated, he eventually made his way around to the noted storage bin. \n\nValentina watched him tear into the survival ration bar with surprising eagerness, \u0022Ivan... I really think *that* was a joke.\u0022\n\n\u0022Captain, as I have noted several times now, I am a machine, and therefore incapable of comprehending or emulating Kerbal humor.\u0022 Was there a hint of strain there? She couldn\u0027t quite tell.\n\n\u0022Besides, if I were joking, I would have said, \u0027what do rockets and wooden houses have in common?\u0022\n\nShe clicked her tongue, \u0022really, this is hardly the place for\u2014\u0022\n\n\u0022They both go up in flames.\u0022\n\nValentina let out a long breath. *Some*one, somewhere, was certainly having a cruel laugh at all this. \n\nAcross the cabin, the window finally caught Igor\u0027s eye, and he fumbled over to it, still gnawing at the bar. The look now washing over his face... *that* was one she was certainly familiar with.\n\nOne corner of her mouth crept up into a half-smile. Even Igor couldn\u0027t resist that view.\n\nA thought crossed her mind, \u0022Ivan, how accurate did you say the final orbit was?\u0022\n\n\u0022Zero point seven five percent, Captain.\u0022\n\n\u0022How is it you can fly such a precise launch but they need *me* to dock?\u0022\n\n\u0022I am at a loss to explain it, myself. I have run myself through millions of simulations, all with a similar outcome. My velocity calculations are absolutely correct, yet the end result is... unsatisfactory.\u0022\n\nValentina rubbed a thumb along her chin, \u0022how many full-hardware simulations?\u0022\n\n\u0022Fourteen, using this craft in its pre-flight configuration. The results were similar.\u0022\n\n\u0022Hmmm...\u0022 her brow pinched as she floated toward the back of the ship.\n\nIgor looked up from his window, \u0022where you go?\u0022\n\nNot quite believing what she was saying, Valentina muttered, \u0022to teach a computer how to fly. Ivan, power up the docking system.\u0022\n\n\u0022Compliance. Although I do not see any probable benefit from this course of action.\u0022\n\nShe paused for a moment at the inner hatch, looking over its mechanism. It looked incredibly thin. Where was the handle?\n\n\u0022Let me get that for you, Captain,\u0022 latches thunked, and the hatch swung out with a soft whir. She frowned at it for a moment before floating inside. The space beyond wasn\u0027t a proper airlock, more like a vestibule. A more standard-looking KSA-style outer hatch sat in the middle, and off to one side was a docking station she instantly recognized. It looked like it had been plucked directly from the back of a *Zarya*. She peeked out the sighting window and grinned.\n\n\u0022You still have remote control of the Colossus upper stage, yes?\u0022\n\n\u0022Correct, Captain. I will initiate its deorbit burn in 47 minutes and 17 seconds.\u0022\n\n\u0022That is enough time. Stabilize its attitude and target the payload adapter ring. I want to watch you fly a mock docking approach.\u0022  \n\n\u0022Compliance,\u0022 unseen valves clicked away, \u0022You may... wish to hang on.\u0022\n\n*FOOF!*\n\nThe entire ship lurched around Valentina, nearly driving her into the wall. She snatched the nearest hand-hold she could find. \n\n*FOOF! FOOF!FOOF! FOOF! FOOF! FOOF! FOOFOOFOOF! FOOF! **FOOF!** FOOF! FOOF! FOOF!* \n\nThe walls seemed to come at her from every direction as the craft bucked and swayed, until finally bumping into the spent stage with a hollow *bong*. She noted through the sighting window that Ivan\u0027s attempt was nearly a full meter off. \n\n\u0022As you can see, Captain, the result is unsatisfactory, and I have consumed an unacceptable amount of fuel for a standard approach. My sensors are accurate to within one tenth of a millimeter, all systems are checked one thousand times per second, and the accuracy of my calculations is not in question. The numbers are correct, and yet... why are you grinning?\u0022\n\n\u0022Numbers are important. In spaceflight, everything is numbers,\u0022 she smiled at the glowing green light on the wall, \u0022but numbers are not everything. Back us off twenty five meters and reset for manual control.\u0022\n\n\u0022Compliance. You have piqued my curiosity, Captain.\u0022\n\nValentina waited a few moments as the two craft separated, Ivan\u0027s movements becoming less and less abrupt as the distance increased. At length she touched the oddly familiar controls, not really a grip, just a couple of fingers with the heels of her palms resting on the panel.\n\n*...fuff...**fuff**...**fufuff**...fuff...**fuff**...fuff...**fuff**...**fuff**...*\n\nA short time later, the docking port came to a stop, exactly centered over the payload ring, and a bare centimeter away. \n\n\u0022That was most impressive, Captain. And you completed the maneuver using less than 31.7% of the standard fuel allotment. Yet I am still unable to assess the root of my own error.\u0022\n\n\u0022You think too much.\u0022\n\nThere was the slightest hint of a pause, as if Ivan didn\u0027t quite know what to say at first, \u0022expound, please.\u0022\n\n\u0022I have seen it often in new piloting trainees, especially scientists and engineers who are being rated for manual docking. People who know numbers and theory well. You think too much. This is still flying. You must learn how to *feel*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Fascinating. I need to initiate the separation maneuver now, Captain, but I will take that under advisement. You have given me much to... think on. Thank you.\u0022\n\nShe floated back from the controls and glanced out the window. Backlit by the sun as the ship passed into orbital darkness, she could just see the faint crimson plumes as the thrusters fired. Teaching a machine to fly. Just one more item on the long list of things she\u0027d experienced that kept her wondering if *now*, she had gone quite mad.\n\n*There **has** to be a way through this. There **has** to be.*\n\nMaybe *she* was thinking too much. As the last light of the sun faded away outside, stars began to pop into view. Like a faint star, the more she tried to look at the problem, the more it seemed to slip away. She was *missing* something, every time she thought she saw it, there was nothing there. She *had* to get back to Edmund, she *had* to save everyone. But she couldn\u0027t just leave Igor\u2014\n\n*...sacrifices must be made...*\n\nValentina spat the thought out like a mouthful of rotten fruit. She looked back through the hatch at him. He was still staring intently out his window, a little smile on his face. No, she had to *save* him too. \n\nBut still... just how much had the Kommissar told him? She was never privy to his briefings. Maybe Igor could help. Maybe he was just waiting on the order.\n\nYet if she did bring him into it... he would be at risk. She pulled her eyes away, staring at nothing. She couldn\u0027t do that to him. She couldn\u0027t deliberately put him in danger for her sake. Now it was *her* turn to protect *him*.\n\n*But*... she was going to have to trust *some*one, she was going to have to\u2014\n\nThe bright, brushed metal of Ivan\u0027s box with its two lights caught her eye.\n\n\u0022Ivan...\u0022 she said.\n\n\u0022Yes, Captain?\u0022\n\n\u0022You will follow my instructions, yes?\u0022\n\n\u0022Correct, Captain.\u0022\n\n\u0022But I presume you have existing orders from mission control, yes?\u0022\n\n\u0022This is also correct.\u0022\n\nShe stared at the metal box, the window, her friend beyond the hatch, \u0022and what if you were given conflicting orders?\u0022\n\nOnce again, there was the slightest hint of a pause, \u0022I cannot answer that, Captain, as I have never been given conflicting orders.\u0022\n\n*Do not make noise. Do what you must to survive. And never, **ever** take sides.*\n\nAs her *Deda\u0027s* words crept into Valentina\u0027s mind, so did an old story... a parable he used to tell, on cold, damp nights when the stars lay hidden behind scudding clouds, and the hungry things beyond the walls cried out to the darkness. \n\nValentina Kermanova stared off into the stars, desperately trying to see what wasn\u0027t there, and whispered, \u0022Ivan... listen to me very carefully...\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt defied any description of size. Valentina had seen *big* things in space before. The later Ussari space stations were *very* big. But this...\n\nIt was mostly a long string of enormous white spheres, hundreds of meters long, each with a radiator jutting away at a slight angle. It gave her the unnerving impression of a severed spine. One end just sort of... stopped, and at the opposite was another unnerving sight. A set of modules that looked exactly like the abandoned M\u00FCnbase. Which was, of course, exactly where they were heading. \n\n\u0022Initial approach complete, Captain, I am switching over to manual control.\u0022\n\nValentina thought a moment longer, \u0022actually Ivan, I would like *you* to make the final approach. I will standby on the controls and watch over your shoulder. Er, sort of...\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry, Captain, I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t do that.\u0022\n\nHer lips tightened for just an instant, \u0022you must follow my orders, no?\u0022\n\n\u0022This is so, however, in this case such an action would present an unacceptable risk to both vessels, thereby jeopardizing the mission. As such, I am unable to comply.\u0022\n\n\u0022I... see,\u0022 Valentina frowned.\n\nFloating up behind her, Igor... always frowned, \u0022is problem?\u0022\n\n\u0022No, Ivan has a point, I do not know what I was thinking, myself. Control to manual, then, Ivan.\u0022\n\n\u0022Compliance.\u0022\n\nOnce again Valentina made a perfect, glassy-smooth approach, backing the lifeboat towards a docking port. Her hands moved without thought, while her mind raced along. \n\nShe was missing something. Something important. Something was *wrong*. \n\nHer eyes drifted to the window, to the backlit crescent of Kerbin, *of course it is. **Everything** is wrong. That\u0027s why I\u0027m up here.*\n\nShe *had* to get back to Edmund, nothing was more important than that, not even this mission, but...\n\nP. Kerman, 42 Wallaby Way, Kidney had said there was someone *else*. Someone *above* Edmund. What if... what if it was someone *before* Edmund? Someone who sent him to the M\u00FCn in the first place... someone with his hands in all sorts of things, for years now? Someone *else*... giving out orders...\n\nThe docking rings bumped together, driving the thought away. Save Edmund, and he can reveal everything. He must have papers, documents, *something*. She would deal with that later. \n\nLoud metallic bangs echoed through the hull as the latches closed. They sounded like coffin nails. \n\n\u0022Hard dock successful, Captain, I am equalizing pressures.\u0022\n\n*Good. Let\u0027s get on with this.*\n\nValentina moved toward the hatch, but gasped under her breath as it swung *outward*. She recoiled, nearly screamed, as a voice she hadn\u0027t heard in years rang out from beyond the threshold. \n\n\u0022Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name!\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-28T18:21:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2017 06:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-27T06:42:01Z","Content":"Like a true taiga child.
