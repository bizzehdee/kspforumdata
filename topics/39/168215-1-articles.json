It was a beautiful night, with the moon glistening over the sea. As the rough waves crashed onto the shining sand, the shore-birds ran along the beach and put their beaks into the soft seashore. Pelicans swooped in to catch the evening meal, and seagulls retired to their nests.

A \u0022steady stream of salt,\u0022 is how one visitor described the boardwalk\u0027s edge.

He rose and felt his head. A thick sticky liquid spilled onto his hand, and he quickly brought it in front of his face. He was alarmed to find blood covering his fingers and palm. He also felt a stinging sensation in his eyes, and realized that his vision was also being blurred by blood. Stumbling around he felt his seatbelt latch, and unclicked it. The car was completely crushed, the roof caved in all the way to the rear seats, the entire hood crumpled like a piece of paper, and the steering wheel was bent in half. His prized possession, a Corvette Stingray, was more than totaled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrunting, the man reached behind him and groped for his phone. It had fallen between two seats, therefore making it impossible to reach. Slumping back into his seat, the man looked up at the broken roof and began yelling for help. Unfortunately, he had crashed on a winding country road, where only locals and the occasional lost\u00A0traveller venture. He knew he had to stop the bleeding, or he would die from blood loss. Taking his shirt in his hands, he ripped it in half and using one hand and his teeth wrapped it around his head.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs he began to tie an old napkin on his arm, he slipped into unconsciousness.

Nearby sat a man wearing a white suit, writing on a pad of paper. His head and arm were covered in bandages, and an IV line was in his wrist. Glancing around the room more, he noticed a dresser with multiple drawers. One was labeled \u0022Snacks,\u0022 while the other was labeled \u0022Things.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe groaned and glanced at the unknown figure, who looked up from his clipboard and grinned. \u0022Aha!

Now the poor victim was left alone to survey his surroundings more. He noticed that the main door had two handles, one slightly above the other. Taking note of this, he also spied a uniform hanging in a closet where the door was slightly ajar. Leaning over to get a better view, he realized that the clothes were much smaller than a normal human\u0027s, and it was also not proportionate, so it couldn\u0027t be a child\u0027s costume. Curiosity almost got him out of bed to investigate, but he was too weak to move.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClosing his eyes, he went back to sleep, only to suddenly wake up again, this time in a different room. This room was moving, and bumpy. Hearing faint sirens, the realization set in that it was an ambulance. Leaning over him a paramedic tried to get a good blood pressure reading, all the while reassuring the chap that he would be okay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hold on fella.

It was windy and cold, but the sun beat down on his face. A cold breeze whisked his hair and entered his nostrils, filling his head with chill. While this was happening, the\u00A0ground began to shake. Startled, the fellow sat up sharply as it shook more and more. At the same time, he heard a faint rumbling, which got louder and louder. Looking south, he saw a pillar of smoke and flame rising from behind a mountain. Reasoning that it was a rocket, he observed it further. As it ascended, separate boosters began falling back towards the ground.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShielding his eyes from the sun and peering towards the dot in the sky, Darryl\u00A0noticed that it was shaking quite hard, and as it began to disappear from sight, a massive fireball and a loud bang erupted in the cloudy sky. Startled, Darryl staggered back and watched with intrest, but worry, as hunks of metal began falling from the sky. Multiple smaller explosions started up as deposits of fuel in the shrapnel were lighting on fire. Out of the smoke came a small capsule with all three parachutes open. It slowly drifted while everything else settled. Hearing a faint \u0022\u003Cem\u003Efhoop fhoop fhoop,\u0022\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EDarryl turned to see a helicopter flying towards him at high speed. As it flew over and blew grass and dust everywhere, he noticed it had orange and white markings, which Darryl took as a coast guard machine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe decided to try and walk in the direction of the explosion. If this was a dream, why was he feeling cold and the breeze? Was it just his imagination? Would he be able to walk? Taking a deep breath, Darryl sent a signal to his brain to move his legs. Surprisingly, he began walking. Proud of himself, the long trek began towards the crash site.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the while, Darryl tried to remember what had happened before this. Unfortunately, he couldn\u0027t recall anything that happened since before he woke up. He knew that he was experiencing some sort of amnesia, but without a doctor to diagnose it, he didn\u0027t know how serious it was. Suddenly, the man stopped and reached into his back pocket. Pulling out his phone, he quickly went to his \u0022photos\u0022 folder. As he went through his photos from the last week, his memory slowly returned.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, that\u0027s me...At the bar...There\u0027s A..Al..Al..C...Alice...I see Jack...Oh! Here\u0027s a picture of my house...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarryl smiled at his genius. His phone. Of course his phone. That could get him out of this if it wasn\u0027t a dream. He checked. No service. Kinda cliche, but he had other options. He would have to find some sort of building. The smoke ahead was getting thicker and thicker as he approached a hill.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCresting the hill, he could now see the entirety of the rocket crash. Debris was strewn everywhere, and fiery hunks of metal lay al over the valley. Various helicopters and off-road vehicles were maneuvering around the scene, and various dots, which Darry took as people; were moving about.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaking his phone out again, Darryl lay down in the dirt, and using his elbow as a bipod began zooming in using his camera. He noticed a few odd things. First, the \u0022people\u0022 looked more like children than actual adults. He snapped a few pics of one of them, the closest to his position. The figure was wearing an orange vest over a camouflage uniform, and he had a flying helmet on. At the present moment, the \u0027soldier\u0027 was writing in a clipboard, while another uniformed official took pictures of the site next to him. Above them both an army-green helicopter hovered, occasionally changing it\u0027s position ever so slightly. As Darryl continued to snap photos, he heard another chopper arriving, this time much lower. Turning around, he was alarmed to find a helicopter hovering about 500 feet away from him. Looking at the open door in the side, a gleaming barrel of a rifle met his gaze. Scared and surprised, he dropped his phone and shot up his hands.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe helicopter came almost directly over him, and members of the military began to rope down to him. As they approached, Darryl noticed that the soldiers were about 3 feet tall, and had...Green skin? He took a harder look. Yup, that\u0027s green skin. The higher ranking of the two soldiers watched him with a rifle slung over his chest, while the other bound his hands. Darryl could do nothing but watch, but after a minute he couldn\u0027t contain himself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Who...Are you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sergeant in front of him just checked his watch and said one word.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Minmus Derp","CreatedById":187595,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-05T13:27:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Lucida Sans Unicode\u0027, \u0027Lucida Grande\u0027, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EOhhhh, THAT\u0027s how it\u0027s a KSP novel.
