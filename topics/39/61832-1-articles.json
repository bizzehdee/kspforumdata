I don\u0027t like it but I guess there\u0027s not much else to do, so here we go.(a little muffled) Hey, Tomkin where should I start? (Faintly) Tell um\u0027 how you got here, from the very beginning.(Back at full volume)Well, you heard what he said, so i\u0027ll start from the very beginning. My full name is Ronney M. Kerman but I go by Ronney. I never really had too much interest in the space program as a kid; sure, I thought it was pretty cool when Jebidiah first stepped onto the Mun or when Bob landed on Minimus but my interest faded after a few days. What really got me excited was Pilkin\u0027s big discovery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe had been looking for planets outside of our solar system for years when he finally found one, a gas giant, like Jool, but when he did the calculations he found that it was the size of the entire sun! Other scientists rushed to confirm his findings and they did, since then, 8 more gas giants have been found, all as big or bigger than the Sun. And that\u0027s what got me interested in the space program, the fact that our solar system was somehow special, that we haven\u0027t found anything in the universe like it, that\u0027s what fascinated me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack when I first heard it I was still in the Air Corps, as a fighter pilot. I applied for the job as a kerbonaught and got it. It\u0027s been a long struggle, but after 3 shuttle flights and a 5 month stay at the space station I managed to work my way up to the elite rank of kerbonaughts and I was selected to pilot this mission to Dres on the first manned interplanetary spacecraft ever built, the Ambassador 5. Yesterday my crewmates and I launched it into orbit and just 5 hours ago we left Kerbin orbit and left for Dres. That brings us into the present, i\u0027ll make another entry tomorrow, it\u0027s not as if I have much else to do. Ronney Kerman signing out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOG ENTRY 2 MET: 003:09:14\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been a day since my last log entry and already I can start to feel the boredom set in. I\u0027ve never been this far from Kerbin before and tomorrow we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll break the record for farthest kerbal away from Kerbin. since yesterday Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s shrunk down from dominating the sky to being not much more than a small, bright dot in the sky. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least I have my crewmates to keep me company. I\u0027ve known Tomkin for years, he was the Science Specialist on my first shuttle mission and commanded the Space Station for two of the months I was onboard. Tomkin also commanded a Minimus mission and has landed on the Mun three times. He was selected to be the Mission Commander for the Ambassador program as well being the Orbital Science Specialist because he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s had the most experience out of all of us.Over the years we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve become friends and though we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t always see eye to eye on every issue we can generally put our differences aside. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanfred is another matter, I barely know him, We\u0027ve never been on a mission together and the few times I met him during training he didn\u0027t talk to me much, we only communicated enough to get our training missions done. Back at the Complex I asked some of the Kerbonaughts he served with about him. They all came up with pretty much the same response, that he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll get the job done but he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just not the social type. I heard that he was a sergeant in the army until he was injured in combat during the war in the Northern Mountains. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s probably just rumor, but I do know for a fact that he got a degree in geology before he joined the space program. He\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been on both the Mun and Minimus before he was selected to be the Geologist for this mission. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t gotten to know him much so far but, well I\u0027ve got plenty of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSC is telling us that we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re big news back on Kerbin and to expect a televised interview in a few days, before the communications lag gets too long. The president might even talk to us! Being a kerbonaught definitely does have it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s perks. Other than that, not much has been going on, we\u0027ve been performing routine check-up\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s on the hardware, taking pictures and calibrated our sensors. To keep us sane, before we launched we all got tablets full of books and movies to pass the time, i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll definitely be needing it. hopefully, my next entry will be more exciting. Ronney Kerman signing off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOG ENTRY 3 MET: 004:12:25\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExciting doesn\u0027t even begin to describe today. KSC delivered on their promise, We were on live T.V. on pretty much station on Kerbin. Director Kenner sent us a few popular questions from social media and as we were in the middle of answering them all we got a guest. The President of the Kerbal Union himself! I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t remember exactly what he said but it went something like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou men are doing something no Kerbal has ever done, go beyond the confines of our own small world and to another far away. You\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re sacrifice and commitment has made your country and all of kerbalkind proud. I wish you good luck on your journey.Tomkin thanked him and said he was honored and so were Danfred and I. The President hung up and after recovering, we went on to finishing the rest of the questions. The broadcast ended and we were just sitting there in shock thinking did that really just happen? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s what Tomkin and I were thinking, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know what Danfred was thinking, during the broadcast he only answered two out of our 15 questions and both quickly and reluctantly. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think he likes the attention much, but I honestly don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have a clue. He might just be the hardest kerbal to read and even after three days of living with him in a confined space he still hasn\u0027t said anything to me other than the bare minimum to perform our duties. Believe me, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve tried to talk to him, tried to get him to tell me about himself but all he comes back with is the same response: does it matter? it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s infuriating! I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve talked to Tomkin about him. He says that Danfred just has a laser focus on the mission and that he considers anything else to be extraneous. maybe, but even if he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s right, after nine months with nothing else to do, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m sure he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll crack. Looks like Tomkin just turned off the lights, it must be bedtime, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m gonna have to wrap up this log. I think I have a copy of the broadcast on my hard drive, i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll see if I can include it in the log folder sometime soon. Anyway, this is Ronney Kerman, signing off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOG ENTRY 4 MET: 006:7:24\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been about two days since my last log entry, nothing noteworthy happened yesterday and I was considering not making a log today but I figured that I could take the opportunity to talk a little about the mission and how it started. I guess it was first dreamed up about two years ago. It was the ten year anniversary since KSP\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s last big accomplishment, landing on Minimus, sure every once in a while some Kerbonaughts landed on the Mun or Minimus but no new ground was being broken aside from probes that occasionally went to other planets and moons. In short, people were tired of the same old space program, they wanted something new. with all this pressure to do something big with the manned exploration, astronomers made a discovery, the planet Dres was lining up to be the closest to Kerbin ti would get in 100 years. It completely changed the direction the space program was headed in, Instead of going to Duna, Dres would be our next target. for the next two years the engineers at KSC worked around the clock to build a rocket that would get us there and back in time for the launch window. The old Mun lander designs were beefed up a little and a whole new command and service modules were created to get us there. The final design was huge, double the size of the mun rockets. In fact, a whole launch pad was built just to fit it on top. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, well, you know the rest of the story. Time to get back to the present. Other than the routine, there is something I forgot to mention. Yesterday, Mission control sent us some new software, the Real-time Audio Recorder or RAR for short. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll let us record audio from our spacesuits or inside the command and lander modules as events happen and send the data back to the hard drive in our central computer. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll probably be useful in the future, considering that tomorrow live communications to KSC will be impossible, the lag\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s just too much to carry any instructions or conversation. that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s about it, i might make another entry tomorrow if anything goes on.
