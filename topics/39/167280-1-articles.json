into some mischief.\u00A0 Take yesterday for example...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a quiet weekend round at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, no major missions were active and most of the staff were enjoying the fine weather away from the complex with family and friends.\u00A0 Not Bill though, he had been locked away in his office for weeks without revealing to anyone what he was up to.\u00A0 Not being seen by\u00A0his fellow Kerbals, food left outside his door remaining\u00A0untouched, not a sound emitting from behind that\u00A0locked door got them all worried... just what was he up to??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the original four, nobody would ever have called Bill a badass, he certainly wasn\u0027t Mr. Personality like Jeb who just loves being in the spotlight, images plastered all over the press etc.\u00A0 Bill was never interested in this and tended to shun the cameras.\u00A0 So what happened yesterday was totally out of character, resulting in tons of publicity and possible disciplinary procedures being enacted against him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat he did was this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tCtvjyd.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/tCtvjyd.png\u0022

a Single Stage To Orbit (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E) launch vehicle, but nobody seemed particularly interested.\u00A0 They were\u00A0more than satisfied with the present range of rockets which had been provided by\u00A0Flying Deathtraps Rocketry and other private contractors.\u00A0 Bill was adamant though, the cost of launching payloads into space could be drastically cut if\u00A0a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E could be developed which would reenter the atmosphere, be recovered and refurbished, and then reused for further missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealising he was bashing his head against a brick wall, which doesn\u0027t really hurt a Kerbal because of its particularly solid skull, he disappeared into his office, and there he stayed!\u00A0 Most people thought he was just huffing\u00A0at not getting his way, nobody suspected he was working on something which would see his future in the KSA in jeopardy, and the entire organisation left with egg all over its face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe had planned it very well, knowing this particular weekend would see few Kerbals about, Bill had secretly gathered together the not inconsiderable amount of materials and components required to build his\u00A0experimental \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 It had been quietly assembled in a dark and secluded corner of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E without drawing anyone\u0027s attention, with the help of the small number of fellow \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E enthusiasts Bill had managed to recruit.\u00A0 At dawn on Sunday, they secretly assembled at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, opened the doors and started the slow process of rolling their masterpiece\u00A0 - now named \u0022Bill\u0027s Folly\u0022 - out to the launchpad.\u00A0 As it inched towards the final launch position, Bill raced into the changing room to get into his spacesuit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStrapped into the small capsule on top of his creation, Bill went through the final checklist before launch while his collaborators manning\u00A0the necessary consoles and control panels in mission control, nervously watched\u00A0the countdown edge towards zero...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...A bright flash followed an instant later by an earsplitting roar tended to suggest that\u00A0the countdown might have\u00A0finally reached 0:00:00, a feeling reinforced as the entire mission control complex shook and vibrated as the shockwave of the engines erupting into life bounced and echoed all over and around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 \u0022Liftoff\u0022, shouted one of Bill\u0027s buddies, to be followed almost immediately by \u0022Towweeeer\u00A0Clearrrrr\u0022!\u00A0 Even with the noise and\u00A0violence of the rocket engines directly beneath him, Bill couldn\u0027t help but point out that there wasn\u0027t\u00A0in fact\u00A0a tower to clear, urging everyone in mission control to keep calm and not get overly excited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226XZiYDp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022

seven huge \u0022Reliant\u0022 engines rapidly propelled the vehicle skywards, consuming an extortionate amount of fuel in the process.\u00A0 Struggling to keep the vessel under control, as it reached a speed of 75m/s Bill leaned over in his seat (they hadn\u0027t managed to \u0022borrow\u0022 proper controls for their clandestine activities) to try to initiate something resembling a gravity turn.\u00A0 Slowly ever so slowly Bill\u0027s Folly started to tilt in a roughly easterly direction, out over the ocean...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nZSJFNH.png\u0022

seat...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the rocket\u0027s velocity rapidly increased, keeping the vehicle on course was proving more and more difficult.\u00A0 Everyone involved knew that if Bill\u0027s Folly\u0027s heading should wander even slightly off the prograde marker before its altitude reached 45,000 meters, the whole vessel would instantly go into an unrecoverable flip\u00A0and Bill would be forced to pull the abort string (remember, no proper controls).\u00A0 With a supreme effort and not without skills that would have impressed even Jeb, Bill managed to wrestle the vessel into keeping\u00A0pointing prograde (just!) until it reached the altitude he knew would see the danger of flipping come to an end.\u00A0 \u0022OK Bill, you should be safe for orbit now\u0022 radioed mission control, \u0022Yes, she\u0027s much more stable and easy to control now,\u0022 answered Bill, \u0022fuel slightly lower than expected but within safety margins, electric charge at maximum, cabin pressure holding at 5.5, I am go for orbit!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229W5Qh9J.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022

control was tasked with informing Bill when to shutdown the engines once his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E had reached around 72,000 meters.\u00A0 \u0022OK Willie, you now need to get your sideways speed up a bit, level off and floor it mate.\u0022 came the instruction.\u00A0 \u0022Roger, I will now go horizontal and throttle up\u00A0 to maximum to increase my lateral velocity.\u0022 came the reply, and Bill leaned over on the very edge of his seat to tilt the rocket right over towards the horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hBniubj.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/hBniubj.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...level off mate.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe seven powerful engines effortlessly pushed the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. to the 72K mark, and Bill got the message for engine shutdown a very few seconds after \u0022levelling off\u0022.\u00A0 It had proven to be no easy job to keep the speed of the ascent of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E under control, and the engines were quiet for only a few seconds before he again was told to reignite them for orbit insertion.\u00A0 The burn should have lasted four seconds, but Bill overran by about 1/5 of a second and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E ended up at well over 100K, although the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E was at a much more acceptable 72.5K.\u00A0 As the cheers from mission control came over the radio, Bill couldn\u0027t help but break into a loud cheer himself, having finally realised his dream of\u00A0using a single stage to lift a payload into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dlRtOAF.png\u0022

second\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving made orbit, the next procedure was to get back down again.\u00A0 Bill dipped the fuel tanks (you didn\u0027t think he had proper fuel gauges, did\u00A0you?) and nervously did a quick calculation on a snack wrapper.\u00A0 \u0022What\u0027s your fuel like up there Bill\u0022, came a well timed message from the ground.\u00A0 \u0022Yes, I\u0027m just checking that now\u0022, answered Bill.\u00A0 With the struggle to control Bill\u0027s Folly during the flight through the lower atmosphere and now the overrun of the engines as he entered orbit, Bill realised that getting back was going to be marginal at best.\u00A0 The original plan had been to reduce the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to below zero, for a landing as close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E as possible, but now the fuel to do so just wasn\u0027t there.\u00A0 \u0022OK mission control, I am unable to complete the deorbital burn as planned, I will burn off all remaining fuel at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. and attempt to reduce my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E. sufficiently to reenter the atmosphere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You could always get out and push Willie\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022To save weight I didn\u0027t bring a jetpack for EVA.\u00A0 I will now begin a manoeuvre to point retrograde in preparation for deorbit burn\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeez mate, you\u0027re half an orbit away from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E, chill out, relax, enjoy yourself up there... have a beer on us\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Ignoring the suggestion from mission control, Bill engaged the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to help align the vessel retrograde in readiness for reentry.\u00A0 It took only a few seconds before this was complete and the vessel now sped sideways around Kerbin, altitude climbing as Bill\u0027s Folly orbited around towards the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

vessel now sped sideways...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime went by, and beneath the cheering and celebrating, a note of tension had crept into the communications between Bill\u0027s Folly and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 The fuel situation was now on everyone\u0027s mind, it only had to reduce the height of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E. by about two thousand meters to insure some kind of landing, but the small amount of fuel left couldn\u0027t guarantee even this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe seconds rolled into minutes and as the time for the burn approached, the celebrations were slowly replaced by quietness, this\u00A0fuel situation was potentially serious.\u00A0 Mission control was to give Bill a final countdown to the burn... tensely a voice came over the radio, \u0022Right Bill, engine start in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
