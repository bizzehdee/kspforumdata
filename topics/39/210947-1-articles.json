Around him, dark grey to the horizon; above him, utter darkness punctuated by millions of billions of lights, from tiny specks like pinpricks in the night sky to the bright streak of the Milky Way to the purple-hued dot called Eve, lurking low to the horizon where the sun had just set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was on the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the naysayers and doom-mongers were silent now. They had done it- not just him, but all the thousands of people working tirelessly together to make the dream of one day walking on the Mun a reality. It was difficult, it was expensive, it was probably unsustainable, but just for a little while kermanity had a foothold on more than one planetary body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had taken years of work to get this far, from the early days of strapping rudimentary pods directly to solid rocket motors and yeeting the occupant into the sky, to strapping slightly less rudimentary pods to larger rockets and yeeting the occupant into orbit, and finally to strapping rather advanced pods to humongous rockets and yeeting the occupants all the way to the Mun. And back, in all cases- even the time where Jeb himself had had to get out and push his pod out of orbit with the EVA jetpack on Moho 1 because the retro-pack misfired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething \u003Ci\u003Eplink\u003C/i\u003E-ed off his helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKerbin to Jeb?\u201D A voice came over the radio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of him still smarted over the fact that she\u2019d been promoted instead of him, but the rest of him knew that she was the best pick for the job, able to keep the team going long after other teams would have given up-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003Eplink\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CC\u2019mon, Jeb, or we\u2019ll miss taco night.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSighing, he stood, dusted off his suit and trudged back to the MERRI- Munar Exploration and Reconnaissance Rover, nobody really knew when or why the I had been added- to join Val in the airlock. A quick ultrasonic blast followed by a burst of compressed air cleaned off their suits before the inner door opened and they could take them off, stashing them in their respective lockers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal keyed the intercom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAll aboard, Gus. Let\u2019s go home.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRolling.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rover began to move, picking out a path with its powerful headlights to avoid the myriad obstacles scattered across the surface, shrouded by the pervasive grey dust that did strange things to perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne of these days you\u2019re going to be daydreaming again and we\u2019ll leave you behind.\u201D Val said, half-serious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNah, you like me too much for that. Geofdos, on the other hand-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey, what\u2019d I do?\u201D Geofdos piped up over the \u2018com.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLet me guess- you were on the Mun again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb smiled sadly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGot it in one. I don\u2019t even have to try any more, Kerbin\u2019s looking more and more like it every day.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA jolt came through the rover\u2019s wheels, followed moments later by a dull thud through the air and then by a chorus of frightened yelps from the passengers in the lab module, now hastily refitted into a makeshift barracks where the fortunate few the MERRI crew found could rest up before being assigned permanent spaces in the bunkers beneath the Space Centre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust a rogue loner, scopes are clear.\u201D Bob reported from the cupola.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMERRI continued on through the gloom, wheels scrunching over the thick coating of ash that covered what had until recently been a small town. The Great Crater supervolcano, the one everyone said was extinct, had erupted mere days before that historic Mun landing flight had been due to launch, spewing ash into the air and hurling fireballs halfway around the world to ignite catastrophic fires wherever they landed. In mere days Kerbin was engulfed in thick clouds of ash, the sky increasingly blocked out by volcanic fallout and the world economy in freefall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMERRI trundled on for another half an hour until the hills gave way to flat ground as they approached the Space Centre. Acapello 4 still stood on the launchpad, dirtied by ash-clogged rain and listing to one side where the launchpad had buckled under its weight during an earthquake, a symbol of everything that could have been- but would now never be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time MERRI rolled into the Spaceplane Hangar it was down to just two wheel drive out of six, the motors clogging with ash and either shorting out or just overheating until some critical components melted. No planes or helicopters could fly now and now even the most rugged vehicle on Kerbin, built to handle a relentlessly hostile alien environment, was failing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill was waiting to meet them, his face etched with concern: he knew all too well the damage that was being done to MERRI\u2019s critical parts and how few spares were left. As the gaggle of rescuees climbed out one by one, clutching the few possessions they had managed to save- if any- he hurried over to the driving compartment, then stopped when he saw the look on Gus\u2019 face. If even Gus, endlessly resourceful and renowned for his ability to fix nearly anything, thought it was too much to repair, there was no hope left. MERRI was dead, and soon it would be stripped down for parts and spares to keep the other systems running for what was rapidly becoming a full-blown underground town. One of the wheels suddenly caught fire, sparking a panic until it was doused by fire extinguishers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI guess that\u2019s that,\u201D Val said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI guess so,\u201D replied Jeb. They both turned to look at the tilted rocket on the pad, lost in thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf this had happened a few days later, after we had launched, do you think we\u2019d have made it?\u201D Val asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTo the Mun? Sure. Back home, probably, but there wouldn\u2019t be anyone there to find us and I don\u2019t fancy trying to paddle the whole capsule back to shore.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA heavy bulldozer rolled into the hangar towing a truck with a broken wheel. The occupants of the truck quickly began unloading what looked like hundreds of glass cylinders, and as they passed Jeb and Val saw what they were.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSeed bank specimens. I guess being buried inside a mountain wasn\u2019t safe enough for them,\u201D said Val.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEveryone, your attention please.\u201D Gene\u2019s voice came through the tannoys across the Space Centre. \u201CAnother eruption has just started and this one looks like the biggest one yet. The Emergency Council has voted unanimously to seal the outer doors at midnight tonight. If you\u2019re not busy, I suggest you head outside and take a good look at the night sky, because it\u2019s the last time you\u2019re going to see it in a long time- maybe ever.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe unloading restarted with greater urgency as volunteers joined the effort. A team of welders approached the main hangar doors, checked outside to make sure no other vehicles were coming, then began to close the doors to then weld them shut. Jeb and Val watched as their view of Acapello 4 narrowed to a slit, then vanished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m not crying, \u003Ci\u003Eyou\u2019re\u003C/i\u003E crying.\u201D Jeb said and Val chuckled through her own tears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ll get another chance. Or if we don\u2019t, our children will.\u201D They shared an awkward look before she hurriedly continued: \u201COr theirs, or twenty generations from now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVal, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you.\u201D Jeb shuffled from foot to foot, uncharacteristically nervous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah?\u201D Val seemed very close all of a sudden.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBefore the Moho 1 flight, I put laxatives in your drink so you couldn\u2019t fly and I\u2019d get the flight instead.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was expecting her to be surprised, even angry; instead she just laughed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI already know that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWha- how?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI saw you doing it, Jeb. You\u2019re many things, but subtle isn\u2019t one of them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut- but- why\u2019d you drink it then!? You were about to be the first Kerbal ever to reach orbit!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly! It was absolutely terrifying just thinking about all the things that could go wrong- that DID go wrong- but if I had tried to back out they\u2019d probably never give me another mission so I was stuck with it. Until you inadvertently did us both a favour.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo I\u2019ve been feeling bad about that for \u003Ci\u003Eyears\u003C/i\u003E and you don\u2019t even care?\u201D Jeb asked incredulously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI was saving it for something special in the future, but what with the end of the world and all\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal\u2019s eyes suddenly gleamed mischievously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI just had a crazy idea.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe told him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re right- that\u2019s crazy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, are you in?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDefinitely!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt one minute to midnight, the Space Centre appeared deserted. On closer inspection, however, all the entrances to the underground structures beneath were crammed with people all getting their last glimpse of the outside world, the sky, the stars, the Mun and even Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAttention everyone.\u201D Gene\u2019s voice came through the tannoys, echoing strangely through the buildings. \u201CAll personnel are accounted for, we are about to seal-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFIFTEEN SECONDS TO LAUNCH.\u201D A much louder voice drowned him out, a computerised warning triggered automatically by the computer systems in Mission Control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s going on?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTEN.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNINE.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEIGHT.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSEVEN.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSIX.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJEB!!!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIGNITION.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFOUR.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTHREE.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat did you do!?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTWO.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CONE.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA deafening roar shook the air and ground alike, followed by a wall of dust and ash blasted away by the full force of five Mastodon engines at full thrust. Night became day as the rocket lumbered off the pad, drifting sideways until the gimbals corrected its trajectory, dodging the launch tower by millimetres as it rose on five columns of fire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene pushed his way through the crowd to where Jeb and Val were standing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know that was you, Jeb.

The lander undocked, deorbited and finally landed within fifty metres of its target, finding a clear spot in a boulder field.
