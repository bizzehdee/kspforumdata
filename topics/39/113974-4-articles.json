Now, once again, frost clung stubbornly to a waiting rocket\u0027s skin. Now, once again, a Kerbal sat in a tiny capsule atop it. Beyond the cosmodrome, and beyond the skeletal, blackened forest surrounding it, the first hints of orange and red fringed the lower leaves of the trees. This, and the unseasonably cool day signaled that fall would soon arrive. In Ussari, the fall never lasted long.\n\nOnce again, Valentina stared out the expansive windows of the Mission Control building, trying to calm herself. The sky overhead was slightly darkened by a high overcast. The weather center didn\u0027t expect it to delay the launch. Valentina hugged herself against the slight chill in the room, silently wishing it would. Gone were the crowds of spectators, the few who *had* shown up were kept outside by very serious-looking security. The launch would be televised, of course, now on a five minute delay. There was still anticipation in the air, but it was guarded. As guarded as the building now was.\n\nDibella, once again, was coordinating the mission. She quietly went through the final procedures with the engineers at their stations. So far, everything had gone smoothly. Valentina rubbed her arms, and took a long breath that shuddered just slightly. It had gone smoothly before.\n\n\u0022Terminal countdown commencing,\u0022 Dibella said into her headset mic, \u0022how are you doing, *Sila?*\u0022\n\n\u0022All systems nominal, checklist complete. I am ready,\u0022 Tercella\u0027s voice crackled over the speakers.\n\nCalm. Professional. Detached. Every face like stone. Even Tercella lacked her usual lightness. Valentina took another slow breath. She wondered how many others were consciously trying not to hyperventilate. The voice was here too, always here, a susurrus of madness.\n\n*\u0022Sem...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Shest...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Pyat...\u0022*\n\n\u0022Auto sequence start...\u0022\n\nOnce again, thunder rolled outside. The sound of the four kerosene main engines and their four vernier counterparts roaring to life was quite unlike the the chaotic noise of the older solid-fueled launchers. The ground still rumbled, the windows still shook, but it was ordered. Tight. Controlled.\n\n\u0022All engines running.\u0022\n\n*\u0022Tree...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Dva...\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Od\u00E9en...\u0022*\n\nValentina\u0027s breath caught. For a moment, mission control was once again filled with that awful, pregnant stillness. And then...\n\n\u0022Liftoff, we have liftoff. The clock is running.\u0022\n\nThere were no cheers, no shouts, just the sound of a few dozen people breathing again. It took Valentina a moment to join them. She watched nervously as the long, green rocket lumbered past the launch towers, then rolled to the proper azimuth. She could do nothing, now, but watch. After a few moments, it disappeared into the cloud deck, leaving trail of matching grey smoke, and even watching was denied.\n\n\u0022We have planned shutdown of engines two and four.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Sila* copies, confirm engine shutdown, all lights still green.\u0022\n\nValentina turned her attention to the array of screens as Dibella and the controllers went through their procedures with frustrating calmness. A video feed from the hull of a fuel tank showed a shaky image of the gleaming white top of the cloud deck. She watched, as the image slowly changed, the clouds stretched off into the distance, then finally met the sky. The horizon gradually crept towards the middle of the screen. The shaking began to get worse.\n\n\u0022*Sila*, control, you\u0027re coming up on staging.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy, control.\u0022\n\nAn engineer slowly counted down, then the image on the screen suddenly went to static.\n\nValentina\u0027s heart stopped.\n\nShe stumbled back when the feed sputtered and then returned, the spent first stage just visible as it began to tumble away.\n\n\u0022Staging is good, ullage burnout, secondary engine at one hundred percent.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Sila* copies, confirm staging. Tower jett is armed.\u0022\n\n\u0022We have escape tower jettison, all systems still nominal.\u0022\n\nBreathless minutes trudged by as the greatly diminished rocket now clawed for the speed to achieve orbit. Even the video was now useless, all Valentina could do was watch the telemetry display. The numbered blinked and stuttered from the weak signal. Trying to distract herself, she began going over Kerblish verb conjugations in her head. She\u0027d teased enough from the further pages of the manual to know that this was the most dangerous part of the ascent. An abort from this speed and altitude was possible, in theory, but the gee forces from such a steep descent...\n\nShe pushed the thought out of her mind, tried to breathe, tried to focus on something else. Words. Words. Words! She looked away from the screens. At any moment, the call would come, any moment! Something had gone wrong again and now--\u0022\n\n\u0022*Sila*, control, we have SECO. Awaiting final telemetry.\u0022\n\nWhat?\n\n\u0022*Sila* copies, confirm engine shutdown, separation light on.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Sila*, this is control. Telemetry confirmed, you are go for at least five orbits.\u0022\n\nA thick, heavy silence stretched out. Some machine or other beeped softly.\n\nAnd then, \u0022*P\u0426TI\u0419S L\u0417FT \u042D\u0414\u042F*, I did it!\u0022\n\nThe room *exploded*. Valentina\u0027s hearing was still off, it probably wasn\u0027t as loud as it seemed. But then again, it just might have been. Cheers, whoops, shouts of joy filled the cavernous room. Papers and clipboards flew to the ceiling, one of which took out a light fixture but no one seemed to care. All around, people were hugging or shaking hands. Someone ran up to Dibella and gave her a big kiss on the cheek before running off again, leaving the former staring wide-eyed and gaping. Then someone tried to do the same to Valentina, but encountered her elbow instead, which by an odd coincidence arrived at the same place at the same time.\n\nFlashes and explosions outside made her jump, convinced something *else* had gone wrong, before she realized they were fireworks. Small monitors in the control room playing news broadcasts showed people flowing out into the streets, waving flags, hanging from light poles. And in the tiny broadcast room in the back of the mission control building, Mikhail Kerman was so busy dancing around and not standing by his station that he was singly responsible for Tercella Kerman swearing on a live international broadcast. No one seemed to care, though. They had done it, they had finally *done* it.\n\nA burst of garbled sound came from the speakers.\n\n\u0022All right, all right, quiet down!\u0022 Dibella yelled over the din, trying to regain her composure, \u0022we still have a mission to run here!\u0022\n\n\u0022Did not copy that, *Sila*, say again,\u0022 she said into her mic as the noise died down.\n\n\u0022Control, do you have a problem?\u0022 Tercella said, \u0022I just had the oddest bunch of red lights come on up here.\u0022\n\nDibella looked nervously over her control panel, rolled her eyes, then walked to an engineer still sitting on his own panel, and slapped him upside the head. He hopped down sheepishly.\n\n\u0022Um... disregard control, they all went green again.\u0022\n\n\u0022Let\u0027s get back on track here, give me a status report, *Sila*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy... oxygen 99%, batteries 98%, flight fuel 94%, re-entry fuel 100%. All systems nominal.\u0022\n\nDibella looked to the massive central monitor that plotted Tercella\u0027s predicted course on a map, \u0022we\u0027re in this for the long run now. Power off antennas 1, 3, and 4, and switch to your orbital checklist. You\u0027re coming up on the coast, twenty minutes to Objective One...\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s anxiety abated for the moment and she finally decided to join Dibella on the platform where the rows of consoles were stretched out. She kept out of the way, watched and listened as Tercella went through a series of attitude checks, visual tests, and activated science experiments. Tercella remarked that Kerbin seemed to be mostly below her. Dibella asked if it was drifting or falling. Tercella confirmed that it was not, but she was floating in a most peculiar way, and the stars looked very different, today. Valentina had the distinct impression she was missing a joke. A bad one.\n\nThe indicator lights marked \u0027TX1/RX1\u0027 blinked back and forth as the other two spoke over the radio. The little Orbiter craft had now exceeded Dibella and Valentina\u0027s own flight times combined, and continued to perform well. A major mission goal neared as the tiny ship approached the coast of Kerfrica.\n\n\u0022You should be in range, now, *Sila*. Bring up the frequency on antenna 4 and proceed.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Sila* copies, transmitting.\u0022\n\nNow the \u0027RX1\u0027 and \u0027TX2\u0027 light illuminated.\n\n\u0022Greetings and salutations from Ever Glorious Imperious Union of Ussari States,\u0022 her Kerblish sounded at least passable to Valentina, \u0022I am Kerbonaut Tercella Kerman. I bear tidings of peace and friendship to brave fellows of Kerbal Space Administration and its constituent member states, in hopes of greater understanding and cooperation between all peoples.\u0022\n\nRX1 blinked on again, \u0022how... how was that?\u0022\n\nStillness stretched out for a few moments, then RX2 came on, and an unsteady voice spoke Ussari...ish.\n\n\u0022Greetings and... salad stations. Me am be person of being, Kerman Jorrigh. I proclaimed noise of... opening, and, gooey friendship. Because Mister Union of Conditions, king illegal forest. In it a is! With now of persons, we really can into space.\u0022\n\nSomewhere in a forgotten corner of the Mission Control room, an errant cricket chirped softly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-06T07:55:58Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2016 07:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimumSky5","CreatedById":115138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-25T10:52:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And in the tiny broadcast room in the back of the mission control building, #name# Kerman was so busy dancing around and not standing by his station that he was singly responsible for Tercella Kerman swearing on a live international broadcast.\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022we\u0027re in this for the long run now.

Now if you\u0027ll take a look out yer window there, about twenty klicks north of Capitol City, we\u0027ve prepared a little something for yah, in a gesture of goodwill.\u0022\n\nThe assembled Kerbals looked at each other. Dibella keyed her mic.\n\n\u0022*Sila*, control, do you see anything?\u0022\n\n\u0022Looking now... I can just see the Space Center far to the south... and that must be the city... I do not-- wait, there! Just as he said, in a field north of the city. They have made an enormous Crimson Star. It must be a couple of kilometers across. I cannot tell what it is made of, it is rather faint but easily distinguishable. Taking pictures now...\u0022\n\n\u0022\u0027Tis but a small gesture but one we hope will be well received,\u0022 said the Voice over the speaker, \u0022I see yer about t\u0027 pass out of comm range now. We look forward t\u0027 a new era of cooperation, and will be watching for you on yer next pass for Phase Two.\u0022\n\nTercella tried to yammer out a fitting thanks, but her ship had already drifted too far. Valentina thought the entire exchange a bit... off. Nice, perhaps, but... She pushed it away. There were more pressing matters.\n\n\u0022He is right, you\u0027ll be passing out of our commsat range momentarily too,\u0022 said Dibella, \u0022confirm you\u0027re on item 3-a of the on-orbit checklist, *Sila*\u0022\n\n\u0022Confirm, control. Will be continuing from item 3-a. Will see you on the other side.\u0022\n\n\u0022Good luck, *Sila*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Aaaaaand..... it\u0027s gone. We have loss of signal at MET\u002B32:20,\u0022 said a technician.\n\nValentina stepped back, and let the mission control team go about their tasks. Tercella\u0027s spacecraft had now passed southeast over the ocean, beyond the range of ground stations yet below the Union\u0027s still fragmentary satellite network. They *had* tried to build a ground station in Cerima, until the locals realized that the construction materials were equally as useful for beating each other over the head with.\n\nThe ship continued to follow its sinuous path across the map on the enormous tracking monitor, based on its expected position. It plunged deep into Cerima, passing into orbital night, before appearing to turn northeast again. Its track roughly paralleled the borders with Atezaca and Andacania before heading out over the Great Tethys Inland Sea. As it passed over the Erakonian Peninsula, lights on the various mission control panels began to blink on again.\n\n\u0022Signal acquisition at MET\u002B1:06:37,\u0022 said the technician, \u0022we have telemetry.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Sila*, this is control, how do you read?\u0022 Dibella said into her mic with a hint of uncertainty.\n\n\u0022Control, this is *Sila*, all systems nominal,\u0022 came the response. Valentina realized she\u0027d been holding her breath.\n\n\u0022Glad to have you back, *Sila*. You\u0027re officially the first person to overfly Cerima without being shot down.\u0022\n\n\u0022Well... judging by the flashes on the ground I saw, they probably tried. I do not think they realized I was out of range. But *do* I have stories! Remind me to tell you about the fireflies.\u0022\n\nThe technicians looked at each other uneasily. \u0027Space madness\u0027 drifted among the muttering. Dibella just rolled her eyes.\n\n\u0022You can fill them in at the debriefing. Are you ready for Objective 2?\u0022\n\n\u0022Affirmative. Checkout completed during blackout. Protein pills taken and helmet secured. I am ready.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy that *Sila*,\u0022 Dibella looked to a technician, who gave a thumbs-up, \u0022control is Go, on your mark.\u0022\n\n\u0022Venting complete, I\u0027m opening the hatch.\u0022\n\nDibella pointed to the broadcast technician, \u0022bring up the external camera feed.\u0022 He nodded, and threw some switches. One of the looming monitors became a grainy, shaky, monochrome view looking down the length of the ship from the instrument ring above. A washed-out Kerbin drifted slowly in the background. Presently, the tiny pod\u0027s hatch could just be seen swinging open.\n\n\u0022Hatch open, cabin secured. Do you have me, control?\u0022\n\n\u0022Affirmative, *Sila*. We\u0027ve got a nice view, board is green. When you\u0027re ready.\u0022\n\n\u0022Control, I am stepping through the door...\u0022\n\nTercella\u0027s huge helmet and gilded faceplate suddenly appeared on the staticky screen. \u0022\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420\u0022 was emblazoned in large, dark letters on the brow. It was a rather archaic moniker, but these images would soon be seen on screens across the world, and so it made a very subtle yet effective statement. Tercella was now *extra-vehicular*. Her torso appeared, and floating arms, and then she just... stopped.\n\n\u0022Uh, Flight?\u0022 said the Flight Surgeon, \u0022her heartbeat just went up quite a bit.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Sila*?\u0022 Dibella said with concern, \u0022how are you doing?\u0022\n\nNothing but light breathing came back over the radio.\n\n\u0022*Sila*, do you copy?\u0022\n\nStill nothing.\n\nDibella looked to the Flight Surgeon again, \u0022I... I don\u0027t know, her vitals are OK, heart rate still a bit high but well within limits. Neural activity is a bit... odd.\u0022\n\nWhispers of \u0022space madness\u0022 again floated around the consoles.\n\n\u0022Tercella, do you copy me?\u0022 Dibella said with irritation.\n\n\u0022Wooooooooooooooowwwwwwww.......\u0022\n\n\u0022No copy, Tercella.\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s... so... beautiful...\u0022\n\n\u0022Did not copy, Tercella, say again.\u0022\n\n\u0022So beautiful... I can see... I can see everything. The whole world. The whole *everything*. The Union, and the Foreign lands and all the oceans. And the M\u00FCn, just a sliver but I can see it. Minmus is so clear I can see the ice seas... this... this is *awesome*.\u0022\n\nDibella smiled just a bit, \u0022OK, you\u0027ve got a few minutes for spectating before we\u0027re up on the objective. Don\u0027t forget your camera.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy....\u0022\n\n\u0022Heart-rate\u0027s back down,\u0022 said the Flight Surgeon, \u0022everything\u0027s coming back down, now. She\u0027s really relaxed.\n\nThe RX/2 light on Dibella\u0027s communications panel began blinking once again. She pressed it, getting the additional signal in her headphone.\n\n\u0022Well, time to give her a mission again,\u0022 Dibella said, \u0022*Sila*, that\u0027s enough for now I\u0027m afraid, but keep the camera out. You\u0027re almost to the observation point.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy that, Control. The ship is starting to drift a bit but I\u0027ve got a good angle from here, camera ready.\u0022\n\n\u0022Understood, *Sila*, their countdown is coming in now... seven... six... five... engine start.... three... two... one... booster ignition.... liftoff! Confirm liftoff, it\u0027s cleared the launch towers now.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy. I am just south of the Space Center, passing southeast. Nothing yet... I can see the Center easily... there\u0027s some drifting clouds and-- wait! There it is! There it is! I can see the smoke trail.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy that, you confirm you see their rocket trail?\u0022\n\n\u0022Affirmative. It is far but it is quite easy now that I know where to look. Do not know how well the camera will pick it up. The rocket has cleared the clouds and is pitched mostly over now.\n\n\u0022Reading booster burnout, separation now, *Sila*,\u0022 Dibella said.\n\n\u0022Yes, the smoke trail just changed... it is much fainter now.... getting very hard to track.... lost it.... no there... no, it is gone. I can barely see the engine plume and.. nope, just lost that too.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy *Sila*, KSA reports staging complete, you probably couldn\u0027t make out that upper stage plume from there.\u0022\n\n\u0022Understood. But what a thing was that, hmm? The first rocket launch witnessed from space. You must extend my congratulations down the line to this \u0027Kerman Jorrigh\u0027 person.\u0022\n\n\u0022I will do that, *Sila*. But it\u0027s main event time now, are you ready?\u0022\n\n\u0022I was born ready! Tethers secured, let us do this!\u0022\n\n\u0022That\u0027s the spirit. All right, you\u0027re cleared to make your way to the forward experiment package.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy.\u0022\n\nOn the monitor above, the ghostly, washed-out figure came fully into view now, bobbing back and forth in an odd way.\n\n\u0022This is going to be a workout... was not expecting the suit to give so much \u003Cgrunt\u003E resistance. Is very hard to move against it with no leverage, standby.\u0022\n\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\n\u0022Hm, heart-rate\u0027s rising again,\u0022 said the Flight Surgeon, \u0022need to keep an eye on that.\u0022\n\n\u0022OK, almost there... ugh, this suit... it is puffing out like a balloon, takes effort to keep my arms in front of me.\u003Cgrunt\u003E Legs pretty much useless. OK, I\u0027m there, clipping on.\u0022\n\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\n\u0022Pace yourself, *Sila*, you do not want to get over extended.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy that, control. Knew it was \u003Cgrunt\u003E gonna be a rough time. Takes more than hard work to stop me! Working on the instrument cover now... bah, still no leverage.\u0022\n\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\nTercella was just barely visible now, having crawled over the camera to access the necessary housing. All they could see was her white form swinging back and forth.\n\n\u0022Gah, *\u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0419\u042DVS SH\u0424\u0417* this is a \u003Cpant\u003E \u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI\u0423 \u003C/em\u003Eof a thing.\u0022\n\u003C/pant\u003E\n\nDibella sighed, \u0022Let\u0027s mind the language, *Sila*. This isn\u0027t a live broadcast anymore but it\u0027s not much better if half of it has to get bleeped out in post.\u0022\n\n\u0022\u003Cpant\u003EUnderstood, almost... there! Cover\u0027s off, now just-- \u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/pant\u003E\n\nA hand again found its way to Dibella\u0027s face, \u0022what\u0027s wrong, *Sila?*\u0022\n\n\u0022Lost the cover...  it\u0027s drifting off now, nothing I can do about it. Ugh. \u003Cgrunt\u003E Collecting science data now. Capsule is starting to drift a lot now, \u003Cpant\u003E can you trim it?\u0022\n\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\n\u0022See?\u0022 said one engineer to another, \u0022I told you it needed an independent SAS!\u0022\n\n\u0022Bah,\u0022 said his target, \u0022you wanted a full blown probe core. We can trim it remotely.\u0022\n\n\u0022Flight, her heartrate is still rising. Body temp is following too. She really needs to slow down.\u0022\n\nDibella nodded, and rolled her bulging eyes, \u0022Once you\u0027ve got that secure take a minute to rest, there\u0027s lots of work ahead yet. We\u0027re trying to steady the ship.\u0022\n\n\u0022Nonsense \u003Cgrunt\u003E, we have limited time before the next blackout, \u003Cpant\u003E I can handle myself. OK, data is secure with me. Moving \u003Cgrunt\u003Eon to next test. Am I back in view?\u0022\n\u003C/grunt\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\n\u0022Affirmative, *Sila*, we can see you. Be careful now.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ok, tethers double \u003Cgrunt\u003E checked, here I go!\u0022\n\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\nIn the staticky view on the monitor, Tercella suddenly pushed off from the ship, drifting for a moment before her tethers went taut, making the whole ship jerk.\n\n\u0022Oof! Wasn\u0027t quite expecting that, the \u003Cgrunt\u003E whole ship\u0027s bucking around now... \u003Cpant\u003E ok trying this... no, that\u0027s not working, maybe if I... \u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419\u003C/em\u003E, that\u0027s no good either! \u003Cpant\u003E Gah, now I\u0027m... I\u0027m drifting around...\u0022\n\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\nOn the screen, she flailed about, bouncing slightly when the tethers reached their limit. The ship was tumbling randomly now. Watching it, more than a few of the controllers were looking a bit green... Er.\n\n\u0022Uhg, this is not working, I can\u0027t maneuver at all using just the tether and--ack\u003Cgrunt\u003E! Now I am going back the other way, I am passing under the ship I think, the tethers are wrapping themselves around it, can\u0027t stop... \u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419!\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cgrunt\u003E Ow! That just slammed me up against the hull.\n\u003C/grunt\u003E\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\n\u0022*Sila*, are you all right?\u0022\n\n\u0022Heart-rate still climbing, this is getting disconcerting.\u0022\n\n\u0022I will be fine \u003Cpant\u003E. This is a no-go \u003Cpant\u003E. I am going to try to work my way back around the \u003Cpant\u003E hull to the next experiment package.\u0022\n\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\n\n\u0022Understood, *Sila*. Try to take it easy, your vital signs are a bit of a concern.\u0022\n\n\u0022Like I said, it is a real work out. I\u0027m fighting against the suit to do anything, it keeps ballooning. I can already feel sweat sloshing around somewhere. I am going to purge it down a few more millibar.\u0022\n\n\u0022Careful with that, you need all the oxyium in your blood you can get right now.\u0022\n\n\u0022Understood \u003Cgrunt\u003E, just a touch. OK, moving on to the rear compartment... \u003Cpant\u003E hard to move back here, there\u0027s no \u003Cgrunt\u003E hand holds, cannot get a grip anywhere and-- gah!\u0022\n\u003C/grunt\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\n\u0022*Sila*?\u0022\n\n\u0022Lost grip \u003Cgrunt\u003E, slipped off... OK \u003Cpant\u003E, almost there.... I am at the \u003Cgrunt\u003E equipment box... trying experiment 1...\u0022\n\u003C/grunt\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\nHer suited form swung back and forth uselessly, just in view of the camera.\n\n\u0022*P\u0426TI\u0419! P\u0426TI\u0419P\u0426TI\u0419!P\u0426TI\u0419!* \u003Cgrunt\u003E Can\u0027t even turn the \u003Cem\u003EST\u0414LI\u0419S\u041AI\u0423  \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cpant\u003E nut, no leverage, \u003Cpant\u003E I just \u003Cpant\u003E spin the other way.\u0022\n\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\n\u0022Steady now, *Sila*.\u0022\n\n\u0022PulseOx is dropping now, heartrate still rising. I think we have a problem developing,\u0022\n\nsaid the Surgeon.\n\n\u0022*Sila*, we\u0027re getting a bit concerned down here, maybe you should--\u0022\n\n\u0022Gaaaaaaah!\u0022 Tercella raged helplessly as something that looked like a wrench went drifting past the camera and off into space.\n\n\u0022*P\u0426TI\u0419!

Pulseox still dropping, and now her body temperature is getting dangerously high. We need to call this off. Now.\u0022\n\nDibella nodded slowly at him, \u0022*Sila*, I need you to take two minutes to rest, then return to the cabin, we\u0027re going to have to cut the EVA short.\u0022\n\n\u0022No I... \u003Cgasp\u003E I am all right, \u003Cpant\u003E I can keep--\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cpant\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/gasp\u003E\n\n\u0022Tercella....\u0022\n\n\u0022OK...\u003Cpant\u003E maybe enjoying the \u003Cpant\u003E view for a bit doesn\u0027t sound \u003Cpant\u003E so bad after all... visor is so fogged I can \u003Cpant\u003E barely see anyway.\u0022\n\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\n\nNow an engineer nudged Dibella, \u0022We may have a bigger problem. If her body temp is as high as *he* says, it\u0027s pushing what the capsule can handle. The cooling system is pretty weak, and having the electronics exposed to vacuum for so long isn\u0027t helping either. If the cooling capacity is overwhelmed, the capsule won\u0027t be able to cool her down, or the equipment.\u0022\n\n\u0022I see,\u0022 said Dibella worriedly.\n\nThe engineer looked her sternly in the eyes, \u0022If we cross that line, even if she gets back in she\u0027ll cook in there.\u0022\n\nDibella nodded, and pointed to another technician, \u0022You, bring out the scrub checklist. Start going through the procedures. Listen up, *everyone*, this has gone relatively well and we need need it to *end* well, too. I\u0027m officially calling a scrub to the mission. We bring her down on her next orbit. You, start going over the equations, you, scramble the recovery crews and get them to the LZ, and you, go find the political officer so he can make something up.\u0022\n\nShe keyed up her mic, \u0022Tercella, how are you doing?\u0022\n\n\u0022I am \u003Cgasp\u003E all right. Getting... \u003Cpant\u003E warm in here.\u0022\n\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/gasp\u003E\n\n\u0022She\u0027s stabilizing, but her temperature is still way up. Need to get her back inside, carefully.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ok, start making your way back to the hatch, slowly. You don\u0027t want to overheat.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy \u003Cgrunt\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\nTercella\u0027s ghostly form appeared in the monitor again, moving slowly and awkwardly. It seemed to take ages for her to return to the hatch.\n\n\u0022We need to cut the heat down,\u0022 Dibella said to an engineer, \u0022shut down everything we don\u0027t absolutely need, including that camera as soon as the hatch is shut.\u0022\n\n\u0022Understood, Flight.\u0022\n\n\u0022Almost there...\u003Cgrunt\u003E cannot \u003Cgasp\u003E see a thing... \u003Cgrunt\u003E Ok... \u003Cgasp\u003E Ok, I am in.\u0022\n\u003C/gasp\u003E\u003C/grunt\u003E\u003C/gasp\u003E\u003C/grunt\u003E\n\n\u0022Can you get the hatch?\u0022\n\n\u0022...harness...\u0022\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t worry about the harness, just get the hatch closed for now.\u0022\n\nThe Flight Surgeon looked more and more worried.\n\n\u0022Tercella, do you copy?\u0022\n\nThe engineers glanced around.\n\n\u0022Tercella?\u0022\n\n\u0022I have a hatch seal light,\u0022 said a technician.\n\n\u0022Get pressure restored, I want it as high as possible to get the temperature down.\u0022\n\n\u0022On it.\u0022\n\n\u0022Uh, Flight?\u0022 Said a timid-looking technician in another row, \u0022she will be going into comm blackout any minute now.\u0022\n\n\u0022What?!\u0022 Dibella\u0027s head snapped to the map display, \u0022*P\u0426TI\u0419!* Already??\u0022\n\nShe keyed her mic, \u0022Tercella, do you *copy?*\u0022\n\n\u0022She\u0027s alive, that much is certain,\u0022 said the Flight Surgeon, \u0022but she may be unconscious.\u0022\n\n\u0022If we abort now and fire the deorbit engine, she could be on the ground in ten minutes,\u0022 an engineer offered, \u0022but...\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, spit it out!\u0022\n\n\u0022She would land in Cerima,\u0022 he said softly, \u0022one of the less nice parts...\u0022\n\nThe Flight Surgeon\u0027s eyes grew wide, \u0022if she were to land in Cerima, of all places, unconscious... but if she\u0027s not strapped in properly the deceleration alone could kill her.\u0022\n\n\u0022Internal temperature in the pod is rising,\u0022 another engineer said, \u0022we may not have another hour to bring her down here.\u0022\n\n\u0022We\u0027ll be in blackout any moment,\u0022 said the timid one in the back, \u0022after that, we can\u0027t do anything until signal reacquisition, somewhere over Erakonia.\u0022\n\n\u0022Bah!\u0022 Dibella snapped, \u0022where is the Kommissar? Why is he always away on these flights?!\u0022\n\nValentina stepped forward, her eyes met Dibella\u0027s.\n\n\u0022You\u0027re acting Flight Director,\u0022 the Flight Surgeon said to Dibella, \u0022it\u0027s your call. But we don\u0027t have much time.\u0022\n\nDibella ground her teeth, and looked again at the looming display. Valentina stepped back. She desperately wanted to say something, but words would not come. Softly, in the back of her head, the voice was laughing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-06T08:06:35Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2016 08:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T08:21:34Z","Content":"Grrrr - *putinskya* cliffhangers!\n\nNice (but scary) chapter - and I see what you did here. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n\u0022Affirmative.

Her breathing was calm and measured. Her face might have been carved from stone. She folded her hands behind her back. Only Valentina could see they were trembling.\n\nThe engineer\u0027s hand hesitantly moved toward a button.\n\n\u0022No,\u0022 Dibella said softly, closing her eyes, \u0022we wait.\u0022\n\nMurmurs rolled through the room.\n\n\u0022Comrade Tercella\u0027s is not the only life at stake here,\u0022 her voice rose, \u0022if we were to allow that pod and its technology to fall into Ceriman hands, every person in this room would be sent in Kerberia. Or worse. We wait, and bring her home as planned.\u0022\n\nMore murmurs, then a technician spoke up, \u0022we have loss of signal at MET\u002B2:45:24. Expect thirty two minutes to reacquisition.\u0022\n\nValentina flew up the stairs in the back of the room, and charged out the door to the deck behind it, knocking over a coffee pot as she did. Her shaking hands gripped the cold metal railing. This was lunacy from the start! For all their talk of cooperation and parity, they still had to outdo the Foreigners. A solo EVA, from an unsteady, primitive craft.\n\nHer eyes fixed on the Great Banner behind the Kerbonaut Center waving proudly on the chill breeze. Overhead, flights of Converters drowned out the wind. Politics. More politics. The railing rattled as she shook it. It was madness! It was--\n\n*You have great power within you.*\n\nHer breath caught.\n\n*Yes, you feel it. Even now, you feel it. It rages within you.*\n\n\u0022Shut up,\u0022 She spat through clenched teeth.\n\n*Your anger only makes it stronger. Gives it... life.*\n\n\u0022Shut up!\u0022\n\n*Your place is here, in the darkness. Here, your power can find purpose.*\n\n\u0022ShutupShutupShutup!\u0022\n\n*You cannot fight it. But there is... a way.*\n\n\u0022Sh--what?\u0022 Valentina looked up.\n\n*Your friend is not yet lost. Arrangements... can be made.*\n\nHer fingers felt like ice on the railing, \u0022what... what do you mean?\u0022\n\nIn her mind, the voice laughed and laughed.\n\n*If you will but pay the price...*\n\n\u0022Bah!\u0022 Valentina spun around, hugging herself, her fingers numb against clothes. But she could feel it. She *could* feel it. Burning, searing beneath her skin. Anger. Fear. Isolation. Burn her, but she *could* feel it. And there was power in it.\n\n*The darkness will welcome you. It it always there, waiting.*\n\n\u0022*P\u0426TI\u0419* on you!\u0022 She swore, and went back inside. All eyes in the control room were fixed on the monitors. The mission time read MET\u002B3:17:12.\n\nWhat? But she just--\n\nShe made her way quickly down the stairs, stood alone by the wall.\n\n\u0022Expect signal reception in *tree... dva... od\u00E9en...*\u0022 a technician reported. The lights all glowed red. No telemetry.\n\n\u0022*Sila*, this is control, do you copy?\u0022 Dibella said into her microphone.\n\nSilence stretched out.\n\n\u0022*Sila*, this is control, do you copy?\u0022\n\n*Such power...*\n\n\u0022*Sila*, do you copy?

Only silence.\n\nValentina closed her eyes.\n\n\u0022Yes,\u0022 she said softly.\n\nA light blinked on, \u0022control, this is *Sila*. What took you so long?\u0022\n\nA cheer went up from the small crowd that shamed the one only hours ago. Hoots, and whistles, two engineers tried the hand-slapping thing the Foreigners did but only hit each other in the face. The timid one in the back simply lowered his head to his panel.\n\n\u0022*Sila*, this is control, we read you!\u0022 Dibella nearly shouted, \u0022what is your status? We\u0027re not reading any telemetry down here.\u0022\n\n\u0022Sorry, I...  turned it off. Trying to get the temperature down.\u0022\n\nAll across the boards, lights blinked to green.\n\n\u0022Start the re-entry checklist,\u0022 Dibella said to an engineer, then keyed her mic, \u0022how are you? Are you secured for return?\u0022\n\n\u0022I am a factory girl, I am \u003Cpant\u003E used to the heat,\u0022 Tercella sounded weak and tired, but very much alive, \u0022but... what is it Valentina is always saying about \u003Cpant\u003E the cold? I could do with some cold right now.\u0022\n\u003C/pant\u003E\u003C/pant\u003E\n\nDibella jerked, and quickly looked around, but Valentina was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe door to the tiny broadcast room swung open, and Mikhail Kerman\u0027s head swung around. What he saw in Valentina\u0027s eyes instantly convinced him he had somewhere else much more important to be, and he flew from the room. Valentina took his chair, slammed her elbows on the panel as she ran trembling fingers through her hair.\n\nWhat had she done?\n\nWhat *had* she done? She didn\u0027t feel... different. *Was* it all just in her head? Was she just loosing her mind? She wiped her wet face with a wet hand, and watched the feeds from a dozen cameras. From here, she watched Mission Control as Tercella\u0027s ship fired its de-orbit engine, watched the capsule separate without incident, waited again through breathless minutes as reentry plasma blocked the signal. Then relief, as Recovery-12\u0027s camera swung around and revealed the tiny sphere floating gently on its parachute.\n\nShe watched, and smiled at the irony as the capsule plopped down on the muddy bank of the Vulgar River, then tipped on its side. She watched, still smiling, as the recovery teams swarmed over the pod like ants, as Tercella appeared in the open hatch and angrily batted their helping hands away. She watched, as Tercella pulled herself out, and promptly fell face first in the mud. Valentina looked back at Mission Control, and her smile faded, as she watched everyone embracing and kissing cheeks and still not getting that hand-slap thing quite right. She watched, for a moment, alone, then sighed and went from the room.\n\nShe never saw Dibella break away and scan the room for her again. Dibella found only Igor, looking very concerned.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLater that night, Valentina sat on the bed in her small room, hugging her knees. She had thought of going to find the others, but she knew they were busy. Tercella was still in the infirmary, recovering from exhaustion and mild hyperthermia. Dibella had been in debriefings all evening, but word was already spreading. Dibella was going to fly again, on an endurance-testing three day flight. And Valentina was here, alone, forgotten. Outside, the darkness beckoned.\n\nShe looked again to the little glass bottle on the table, as she did every night. Darnitol\u2122, 75mg. Sleep. Sleep, without dreams. The easy way out.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-07T20:35:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2016 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"billbobjebkirk","CreatedById":104713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T14:21:27Z","Content":"Oh.

Here and there, tinier insects flitted about, oblivious to the still mist. Valentina crept silently between the trees, moving with a preternatural grace, fitting through the branches yet not touching a one. Her face was black with foul mud and streaked with sweat. Her quarry lay just ahead.\n\nShe deftly slid past another limb. Moving about this part of the taiga was always tricky. Inadvertently brushing up against a Stick would quickly spoil your day, here. But Sticks, at least, mostly kept to themselves. Mostly. A Twig, on the other hand... Valentina shuddered in spite of the heat.\n\nThe villagers avoided the deep wood, feared it, called it a place of death. Yes, there was death here, death in spades. But there could only be so much death because there was so much *life*. Here, everything was alive. The trees, the soil, the water, even the rocks. Life permeated the air with an otherworldly force. And that life would inevitably bring death. Life fed death fed life, in circles upon infinite circles. The patterns were there, for anyone who cared to look. Valentina knew the circles well, their interactions, their interceptions. Another interception waited in the next clearing.\n\nShe didn\u0027t know the great furry thing\u0027s name. The taiga-dwellers seldom bothered with names. There was so much here, no one could know all the names. \u0022Lunch\u0022 or \u0022argh\u0022 covered most things, and the names could switch with disturbing speed. Except Sticks. And Twigs. Those were worthy of names.\n\nShe had been stalking this particular thing for over an hour, and it had finally let its guard down in the small clearing. Hidden in the undergrowth, Valentina silently drew back on her short bow, its waxed string and supple wood not making a sound. The tiny arrow\u0027s tip had been dipped in the juice of berries and crushed beetles. She took a slow breath, let it part way out, aimed...\n\nThe thing sensed the threat. It tensed, spun its head... but too late. The arrow caught it in the flank and it was dead before it hit the ground.\n\nValentina smiled beneath her mask of mud. Now, there would be meat for smoking, bone for tools, a pelt to trade, and... well, those spiky bits on the tail must be good for *some*thing.\n\nThis, this was *right*. This made sense. Here, in this fearsome place, was comfort. Belonging. Solitude. Peace. This, was home.\n\nBut... that wasn\u0027t right, was it? There was something else, something she had to...\n\nValentina pushed the uncomfortable thought away. She drew her knife, and cautiously approached the carcass.\n\nIt burst into flames.\n\nShe stood transfixed, too shocked to move. Then the *carcass* moved. It shifted, strained, then began to rise. As the flames burned ever higher, it slowly turned. The flaming corpse of Sergei Kermanski stared back at her with empty eye sockets.\n\nValentina wanted to scream, wanted to run, but she was frozen in place. The corpse raised its blazing arms, stepping toward her. Chunks of burning, melting flesh dripped from its bones as it moved, igniting the undergrowth.\n\n\u0022Youuu......\u0022 it somehow spoke in a ragged, rasping voice, \u0022you did this!\u0022\n\n\u0022No, no I didn\u0027t,\u0022 Valentina pleaded, \u0022I couldn\u0027t...\u0022\n\nAcrid smoke filled the clearing, the flames climbed higher.\n\n\u0022Youuuuu did this to meeee.....\u0022\n\n\u0022No! It wasn\u0027t.... I-I couldn\u0027t....\u0022\n\nNow the trees, too, caught fire. The corpse stalked towards Valentina, its flesh cooking away, reaching for her.\n\n\u0022I burned... I buuuuuurned! I burned because of you!\u0022\n\n\u0022No!\u0022\n\nThe conflagration grew and grew, blinding, searing.\n\n\u0022Flames around me! Flames, nothing but *flames*, burning my flesh!\u0022\n\n\u0022I didn\u0027t... I didn\u0027t mean to!\u0022\n\nThe clearing was engulfed. Now her skin began to burn. *It* reached, it reached out for her.\n\n\u0022Youuuuu.......!\u0022\n\nAnd all the while, the voice laughed.\n\n**DO YOU SEE? THE LIGHT EXPOSES ALL, BURNS AWAY EVERY SHELTER. ONLY IN THE DARKNESS CAN YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS HIDE!**\n\nBlackened, skeletal fingers closed around her neck.\n\nValentina\u0027s eyes shot open. For a brief moment, cold relief washed over her. She was in her bed, in her tiny room, in the darkness. But only for a moment,\n\nShe. Still. Couldn\u0027t. Move.\n\nThe shadows on the walls danced and writhed, eyes of nothing looked down upon her, cold and accusing. She couldn\u0027t move. Not a muscle. Not a tremble. She tried to cry out but barely a whimper crossed her lips.\n\nFrom the shadows, a figure rose. Valentina\u0027s panicked eyes darted about, but her body still betrayed her. The figure drew closer, closer. Dark wetness glistened on its green dress.\n\nValentina\u0027s breath grew ragged, but still she made no sound. The Dead Girl looked down on her with lifeless eyes. She strained and wrenched but not a muscle moved. The Dead Girl reached out.\n\n\u0022The price must be paid,\u0022 burbled through its ruined neck.\n\nCold, clammy fingers wrapped around Valentina\u0027s throat, and *squeezed*.\n\nIn an instant, the phantoms evaporated, sensation returned, and Valentina flailed for the table lamp. For an instant as she turned the switch, she was sure that the light would not come, that the nightmare would go on and on. The Dead Girl\u0027s words echoed in her mind.\n\nThe price must be paid.\n\nSooner, or later.\n\nThe price must be paid.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nA cold wind blew down from the rolling hills north of the Cosmodrome, chilling its denizens before moving on south. A slate gray sky hung over the complex, its shades muted, its sounds softened. Despite this, or perhaps defying it, those same forested hills were also alive with color. The hesitant yellow fringe of past weeks was now a sea of gold and crimson. Similar colors were slowly spreading across the Cosmodrome, too, as crews braved the wind and cold to hang banners that marked the anniversary of the Glorious Octember Revolution.\n\nThrough all this, Valentina Kerman walked, not seeing the colors or feeling the wind, her heavy coat and tall *ushanka* little more than habit. The Kerbal coming the other way down the path didn\u0027t look at her, or really see her at all, but shifted his course, giving her a wide berth without even realizing he had done so. On the launch pad, surrounded by towers and equipment, stood the rocket that would take Dibella into space again. Valentina didn\u0027t look at it, she didn\u0027t need to.\n\nShe continued along the path, surrounded by a wide bubble of emptiness despite the bustle. As expected, the towering doors of the VAB stood open. Just inside was the reason Valentina had dragged herself from the shelter of her small room. It was already surrounded by a crowd of gawkers, who nonetheless parted as she approached.\n\n*Zarya*. The second-generation ship, a *true* space ship able to maneuver and do *things* in orbit beyond merely being there. Far more advanced than even the Foreigners\u0027 craft, it could carry two Kerbals into space for a week or more. Some day. The craft mated to the top of this towering *Krasniyy Ivan* booster was merely a test article, half its systems still incomplete, scheduled for an uncrewed launch shortly after Dibella\u0027s. The crowd continued to stare and murmur, despite the fact that no one could actually see it from down on the floor.\n\nValentina had made the trek out here, silently hoping for... something. But found nothing. Her face impassive, she turned back towards the Kerbonaut Center. No one saw her go, or had even been aware she arrived.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-07T20:46:10Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2016 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T01:35:16Z","Content":"Wowzies."},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T06:55:32Z","Content":"**Chapter 27: A Pound of Flesh**\n\n\u0022*Oduvanchik*, Control, we have SECO at MET06:37, reading your orbit at 197 by 145, all systems go.\u0022\n\nOnce again a cheer went up in the cavernous Mission Control room, somewhat muted but no less enthusiastic. Dibella\u0027s launch had gone perfectly with not a single parameter out of place. Tercella had the first shift as flight controller, and despite the lingering hesitancy in her voice, had managed it quite well.\n\n\u0022Control, *Oduvanchik*,\u0022 Dibella\u0027s strong voice crackled over the speakers, \u0022status report. Oxygen 99%, batteries 99%, flight fuel 93%, re-entry fuel 100%. All systems nominal.\u0022\n\n\u0022Er, yes, we copy *Oduvanchik*. You are cleared for an initial 50 orbits. This is the long haul.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy that, control. Let\u0027s hope I still feel this chipper in a couple of days. Butterflies in my stomach already. Ready to begin setting up for the photographic survey of north Kerfrica.\u0022\n\n\u0022Jumping right in, that\u0027s the spirit. Ok, beginning with item 2-a on the on-orbit checklist...\u0022\n\nValentina watched from an empty corner of the room. If one had been looking this way, this small corner would have appeared... dim, as if the light that passed this way was somehow diminished. That is what one would see, if one bothered to look. But no one did.\n\nValentina hadn\u0027t spoken to the other two in several days now. They were busy with training, and preparing, and paperwork, of course. She didn\u0027t want to bother them. She hadn\u0027t actually spoken to *anyone* since... she wasn\u0027t quite sure. It didn\u0027t matter. Once this was over...\n\nValentina stood in her dim little corner, keeping silent vigil. Somewhere deep in her mind, a still, small voice fought desperately. It had to warn her. But it was slowly choking in the darkness.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfter months of setbacks and disappointments, Dibella Kermanov\u0027s long flight was finally the publicity victory the Union so desperately needed. Spinning around the globe, each new orbit brought a new record. The first person to sleep in space, the first person to eat in space, the first person to get sick in space from eating space food. Flying at a high 43 degree inclination, she passed over nearly every population center in the world, beaming down grainy, live television broadcasts, often in the viewers\u0027 native language, and quickly becoming somewhat of a celebrity. All the while, data flowed back to the Cosmodrome, bringing new insights into Kerbal physiology and space science.\n\nBut for Valentina, those three days passed in a haze. She spent most her time in the Mission Control center, for lack of anything else to do. A deep-seated anger she couldn\u0027t understand festered in her mind, coloring everything, and punctuated by the incessant voice that sounded ever more reasonable. Perhaps there was no more point in resisting.\n\n\u0022Copy that, *Oduvanchik*, everything checks out down here, we\u0027re ready to begin the de-orbit sequence,\u0022 said the flight controller as he stood by his console. It was some engineer Valentina didn\u0027t recognize, but he had a bald spot so large even she could see it. Tercella, again, was out with the recovery crews.\n\n\u0022Switching to de-orbit checklist,\u0022 Dibella sounded tired, \u0022looking forward to getting home. After that extension to 70 orbits I think I\u0027m beginning to get a bit ripe up here.\u0022\n\nBald Spot chuckled, \u0022copy *that*, *Oduvanchik*, should have you on the ground in another hour.\u0022\n\nWell, that was it then. Valentina sighed, and walked out the door to the apron in front of the building. She stood there, staring up at the clouded sky, feeling the cold air bite against her face. At least she felt something out here, she felt dead inside.\n\nA technician in a lab coat walked by, hurrying about his business. Valentina ignored him. It was over, now. Things couldn\u0027t go on like this anymore. She missed her *deda*, missed his comforting voice. She could use his guidance now. There was nothing more for it, she would quit the program. Go back home, find the cabin they had once shared. If the forest had not reclaimed it. The police would probably allow her back, now.\n\nAnother technician went past, into the door. Useless little pest. Bustling about his pointless life as if--\n\nValentina blinked. Where had *that* thought come from?\n\n*Do you see? You begin to.*\n\nThe voice was like silk on steel.\n\n*You will be awed by what you can see in the dark, once your eyes... adjust.*\n\nValentina closed here eyes. It was starting already. An engineer went out the door.\n\n\u0022What do you want?\u0022 Valentina said softly.\n\n*For you to fulfill your potential. You shall join the Great Work. You will find a home, here, with us, in the dark.*\n\n\u0022...\u0027us?\u0027 You are a... you?\u0022\n\n*We are many. We are... legion.*\n\nThe engineer brushed past again. Valentina looked sadly around the Cosmodrome, at the people hurrying back and forth like insects, *Zarya* now sitting on the launch pad. Resignation washed over her like icy water. It was all pointless.\n\n\u0022So be it then,\u0022 she said, \u0022take your pound of flesh.\u0022\n\nThe voice railed with laughter.\n\n*You are not yet ready. The price... must be paid.*\n\n\u0022Wha--?\u0022\n\nThe technician in the lab coat bumped into Valentina so hard she nearly fell. Anger surged, and instead she caught him by the arm and spun him around.\n\n\u0022*What* is going *on?*\u0022 she snarled at him.\n\nHis eyes were wide with terror, but at her or...?\n\n\u0022There\u0027s been... we...\u0022 he stammered, \u0022we have a problem.\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-07T20:40:24Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2016 08:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"billbobjebkirk","CreatedById":104713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T13:26:38Z","Content":"That seems to happen a lot around there."},{"CreatedByName":"Monkey29399","CreatedById":152442,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T06:00:29Z","Content":"Was Valentina the problem?![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T02:25:27Z","Content":"**Chapter 28: The Fall**\n\n\u0022What will we do?

Send us all away? But what...\u0022  \n\n\u0022It has happened before, comrades,\u0022 A collective shudder ran through the group, some now eyeing the doors.  \n\nThe controller with the great bald spot inhaled slowly, leaned over the table and closed his eyes, \u0022Dibella Kermanov is the child of the Procurator General. No matter what we do, or do not do, we are *all* doomed.\u0022 He ran a hand over his sweaty face.  \n\nOne of the exterior doors blew open in a crash of metallic thunder, and his head snapped up, harsh words forming on his lips, the reprimand against the breach of decency. He looked over to find Valentina advancing on them, on him, and suddenly his voice wouldn\u0027t work.  \n\nShe was dragging along the an engineer in the white lab coat, his eyes wide and bulging as the deranged pilot tightened her grip on his collar. The look on her face, the hate in those eyes. The Controller took a half step back and nearly fell over the console.  \n\n\u0022What is going on?!\u0022 Valentina looked across the group, from one Kerbal to the next, and one by one their eyes fell to the floor.  \n\n\u0022There\u0027s been a malfunction. . .\u0022 the timid technician from the last flight said quietly.  \n\n\u0022What malfunction? What is it?!\u0022  \n\n\u0022The de-orbit motor,\u0022 the controller straightened, seemed to regain some of his composure. \u0022It misfired. We think--\u0022  \n\nValentina rounded on him, one hand still latched to the collar of the technician\u0027s lab coat. \u0022That is impossible. It is a solid fuel motor, it cannot *misfire!*\u0022 The engineer began to struggle, and Valentina tightened her grip on his collar accordingly.  \n\n\u0022That is what the telemetry says, misfire,\u0022 anger now tinged the controller\u0027s voice.  \n\n\u0022What about the backup igniters? There are backup igniters, yes?\u0022  \n\nSilence.  \n\nValentina let go of the lab coat, spun from one face to another. \u0022You have to do something! The attitude thrusters, venting gas, something!\u0022  \n\n\u0022...not ...enough ...fuel left ...up three and a half days ...already,\u0022 the voice came from the floor, sputtered out between ragged gasps of air.  \n\n\u0022Dibella.. I... how long do we-- how long does she have?\u0022  \n\n\u0022Eight hours,\u0022 the timid one\u0027s voice was barely a whisper, \u0022Ten, if we use the reentry reserves.\u0022  \n\n\u0022And this we will not do!\u0022 the balding controller drew himself up, \u0022there is no need to prolong her suffering, no need--\u0022  \n\n\u0022*Coward!*\u0022 Valentina rounded on the kerb, snatched him up by his lapels, \u0022you cannot just *leave* her up there!\u0022 The others began to back away.  \n\n\u0022You have no authority here!\u0022 the controller squirmed in her grasp, the fear in his voice betraying the strength of his words, \u0022there is nothing more we can--\u0022  \n\n\u0022You. *Cannot!*\u0022 Valentina was screaming now, her grip on his collar like an iron vise, \u0022just leave her to DIE!\u0022 The lights in the room began to flicker and dim.  \n\n\u0022*Security!* Someone--\u0022  \n\n\u0022*NO!!*\u0022 Rage exploded through Valentina. Fear. Helplessness. Hate. She released the mangled shirt collar, grabbed him by the throat instead, made to break the worm\u0027s filthy neck. It would snap like a twig, she knew it, had broken plenty of necks before. It was easy, just like an animal, no difference, just an animal. Her countenance twisted into a sneer, darkness dancing along the edges of her vision, her pulse close in her ears, the other Kerbal\u0027s pulse in her palms. Time seemed to stretch out and slow down.  \n\nOutside, the gloom darkened, the clouds thickened.  \n\nSuch power. Such *power*. Laughter filled her mind, the sound of it raw and hungry. She felt the writhing flesh in her grip, felt the spasms, the terror, the *weakness*.  \n  \n*Do it!* the voice laughed in her head, *Do it! One is as good as another!*  \n\nThe controller flailed at her with ineffective hands, his eyes wild and terrified. She began to squeeze, the light in the other Kerbal\u0027s eyes starting to go out.  \n  \n*Do it! Pay the price and* **TAKE YOUR PLACE IN THE DARKNESS!**  \n\nThe price.  \n\nDibella.  \n\nBut, no... It was something... else...  \n\nIn the suffocating darkness of her mind, another voice floated up through the fog of hate, weak and frail and achingly familiar.  \n  \n*Tinka. You have been played*.  \n\nRealization crashed down upon her like a fallen star. She looked up from the terrified eyes, and up along the bald scalp, now glistening with sweat. And she could, just barely, make out the twisted visage of her own reflection.  \n\nThe darkness didn\u0027t want a death. It didn\u0027t even want a life. It wanted...  \n\nIt wanted *her.*  \n\nDestroyed and broken beyond life, or death. The perfect...  \n\nValentina\u0027s hands dropped, and she spun away, tears welling. Emotions hammered into her like waves against rocks. Anger. Disgust. Fear. Hate. Hate for herself, for what she had become. And *burn her*, there *was* power in it, drawing her like a Siren in a storm. The predator had set a trap, she had fallen right into it, and was now, truly, Lost.  \n  \n*At last!* The darkness cackled close in her ear, *you are ready. Now finish it, embrace the darkness, and take your place.*  \n\nShe folded her arms around her, drew away from the others, deeper into the shadows of the control room. Her vision swam, her face a mask of agony. The voice was right. It had been right all along. There was no return from this. The room darkened further, the lights on the consoles, signal from the stricken capsule, everything. She felt reality begin to waver and crack around the edges. It was too late.  \n\nThe world around faded, and as she slid down into the darkness, Valentina lifted her eyes skyward once last time, looked out towards her doomed friend, the only one who had ever cared. She looked out the window. *I am sorry my friend, but it is too...*  \n\nHer eyes focused suddenly, arrowing in on a small, short lived flash of light through the window.  \n\nShe blinked. Tercella cared. And Igor. And...  \n\nIt flashed again. And her parents had cared. Her *deda*.  \n\nSomewhere out in the gloom, a tiny hole in the cloud deck had opened, and a thin streak of sunlight shone down, glinting from the distant window of...  \n\nValentina inhaled sharply, deeply, and the anger and hate that burned within her... *turned*. It turned to something cold, and hard, and very, very focused. She spun back towards the others, one hand flashing out to point up through the window.  \n\n\u0022That!\u0022 The cloud cover broke completely, illuminating the experimental rocket sitting on the pad. \u0022We send *that*.\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-07T20:45:35Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2016 08:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T04:00:11Z","Content":"**Chapter 29: A Shot in the Dark**\n\n\u0022*Zarya?*\u0022 the balding controller was rubbing at his throat but apparently uninjured, \u0022it\u0027s just a test rig, it\u0027s not due to fly for days.\u0022  \n\nThe timid technician\u0027s eyes slowly widened, \u0022it could work...\u0022 he muttered to himself.  \n\n\u0022Well, why not?\u0022 Valentina stepped up to Bald Spot, \u0022you can *make* it work!\u0022  \n\n\u0022Half the systems are just dummy parts, ballast,\u0022 he stammered, \u0022we can\u0027t just...\u0022  \n\n\u0022It is a rocket, yes?\u0022 Valentina shot back, \u0022you are *rocket scientists?* Do rocket science!\u0022  \n\n\u0022It *could* work,\u0022 Timid turned to table, swiped its contents unceremoniously onto the floor and began furiously scribbling on whatever was available.  \n\n\u0022It\u0027s not that simple, you *know* that,\u0022 the engineer in the lab coat offered calmly, \u0022there are protocols, procedures...\u0022  \n\n\u0022So you are just going to abandon her?\u0022 Valentina said, \u0022your *comrade?*\u0022  \n\n\u0022Hey...\u0022 the timid one said... timidly.  \n\n\u0022Look at the map!\u0022 the controller pointed, \u0022Dibella is in a 43 degree orbit.

Valentina will have to fly the final approach by eye.\u0022  \n\n\u0022Who?\u0022  \n\n\u0022Her?!\u0022  \n\n\u0022*Me?*]\u0022  \n\n\u0022She can\u0027t fly, she\u0027s grounded! Comrade Tercella would be--\u0022 began the controller.  \n\n\u0022We need a pilot!\u0022 Timid snapped back, surprising himself again, then quietly, \u0022w-we need a *real* pilot.\u0022  \n\nThe engineer put a hand thoughtfully to his chin, \u0022it *could* work... but...\u0022  \n\nHis eyes scanned over the jumbled scrawls, concentration wrinkling his forehead, \u0022...life support. Oxyium. There\u0027s just not enough. Eleven hours to the launch window, a few more-- maybe another half day-- to a rendezvous...\u0022  \n\n\u0022Anabiosis,\u0022 the other Kerbal said.  \n\nThe engineer blinked at him.  \n\n\u0022Hypothermia, coupled with h-hypoxia,\u0022 he paused to wet his lips, \u0022we lower the cabin pressure, far as we can, *just* enough to k-keep her alive. Shut off everything in the pod, a-and I mean *everything*, but the coolant pumps, point it away from the sun. Use the service section as a shade.\u0022  \n\nThe balding controller could only gape at him in horror.  \n\n\u0022The young fellow has a point,\u0022 the flight surgeon said, clearing his throat as he approached, \u0022there *is* precedent.\u0022  \n\nThe controller spun to him, \u0022*you?!* You\u0027ve lost your mind! This is pure desperation!\u0022  \n\nThe older Kerbal stared at him flatly, \u0022there\u0027s no shortage of examples. I\u0027m sure I *don\u0027t* need to be any more specific. Our kind has a rather well documented record of such...\u0022  \n\nThe controller\u0027s eyes darted back and forth between the gathered Kerbals.  \n\n\u0022You\u0027ve *all* lost your minds. And you\u0027ve overlooked one critical point. Only the Kommissar himself could authorize this. He has the launch key. And as usual, he\u0027s gone,\u0022 the irritation at this last fact was plain in his voice.  \n\nHe held the flight surgeon\u0027s gaze, \u0022there *are* worse things than Kerberia.\u0022  \n\n\u0022Greetings, Comrades!\u0022  \n\nThe group yelped and spun around.  \n\n\u0022Papers, please! Yes, yes, good, good, you, your shots are out of date, you need a booster. Now then,\u0022 the Political Officer grinned widely, the lights above giving a sinister cast to his features, \u0022does the indefatigable Ussari Space Program have a problem?\u0022  \n\n\u0022Well, you see, sir, um, we... I mean...\u0022 the controller stammered.  \n\nThe Political Officer raised a hand, then looked at the timid technician, who shrank back from his gaze.  \n\n\u0022You,\u0022 he said softly, \u0022what you have said, can you do it?\u0022  \n\n\u0022Um... I think... just a rough...\u0022  \n\nThe Political raised an eye... bulge.  \n\nTimid swallowed hard, \u0022y-yes.\u0022  \n\n\u0022And *you*,\u0022 the Political Officer turned to Valentina, \u0022what he has said, can *you* do it?\u0022  \n\nValentina felt icy focus flow through her, \u0022yes.\u0022  \n\nThe Political Officer regarded the other Kerbals silently for a moment before speaking, \u0022as you know, as Political Officer assigned to this facility, during certain emergency circumstances, I hold equal rank with the Kommissar. Do you dispute this?\u0022 Heads briskly shook in the negative.  \n\nHe pulled something from under his shirt, snapping the chain with a quiet *plink*, then tossed it on the table. The other Kerbals stared in awe at the launch key.  \n\n\u0022You have your authorization. *You*,\u0022 he said to the controller, \u0022do whatever *he* tells you,\u0022 nodding to Timid, who gasped.  \n\n\u0022And *you*,\u0022 the Political Officer turned to Valentina, \u0022bring her home.\u0022  \n\nThe controller backed away a step, gaping at the others, \u0022you\u0027ve all gone mad! This is madness! I--\u0022 he clapped a hand to his mouth and stared wide-eyed, realizing just *what* he had said to *whom*.  \n\nThe Political Officer grinned again, exposing *far* too many teeth.  \n\n\u0022Madness, Comrade?\u0022 He clapped an arm around Bald Spot\u0027s shoulders, \u0022this, is *Glorious* Ussari Union!\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-07T20:52:36Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2016 08:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T07:19:23Z","Content":"Oops and a special thank you goes out to Ten Key for playing editor again on these last couple chapters :D"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T09:00:47Z","Content":"Oh yeahhhhh!
