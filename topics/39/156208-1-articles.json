The announcement about the KOL Program would be made by Director Direc. But, it would be fleshed out by the dapper one with the cane. The kerbal who still believed in the program despite the fact it almost killed him. He wondered occasionally if it was one of Walt\u2019s creations or if he really did believe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKhenry rapped the stage for attention with his cane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright folks,\u201D he said. \u201CWelcome to the KOL introductory briefing.\u201D He pressed a button on the remote in his hand. The first slide click-clacked into place. \u201CRated capacity five, one engineer, four scientists. Supplies for three months. Longer if you eat the snacks you don\u2019t like first.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was chuckling from the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is the initial arrangement. More modules will be added to expand capacity and capability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe initial rotation will be engineer heavy until we\u2019re sure it\u2019s working and all the bolts are tight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe pressed a button and moved to another slide. It showed arrows from Kerbin to Mun and Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe KOL stations are a stepping stone to stations on and around the moons. Approximately half of the projected work will be research and development of tools and techniques to facilitate those stations.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe pressed a button again. The slide had arrows from Kerbin to the other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd trips further out. If things are going to fail or go very wrong. Help is a few hours away in a KOL station rather than a life time away.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, Khenry,\u201D someone said, \u201Cthere\u2019s going to be real science done and not any of Walt\u2019s TV stunts?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry Jose,\u201D Khenry said. \u201CWalt\u2019s got some hours on the slate. He promises that it will be less stunt work. Besides you\u2019ll be in shirt sleeves and not in a suit.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo what are the rotations going to be like,\u201D someone else asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEvery three months to start,\u201C Khenry said. \u201COnce things are up and running we\u2019ll stretch it to six months. Half of the crew will rotate every three months.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs much as I don\u2019t mind hanging around in the black,\u201D a third kerbal said. \u201CThe stepping stones are a good line for the press. But the supply ships mass as much as the science missions we\u2019re running now. Then there is cost of the station and crew. Most of it we can figure out from those. We don\u2019t really gain anything more for the amount we\u2019re spending.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKhenry frowned and peered into the crowd. He wondered if it was a real question or a plant by Walt. But, it didn\u2019t matter. It was a question that would be asked by some reporter when they sat out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe first reason I\u2019ve touched on. If something is going to break you want to break in Lo-KO and not three quarters of the way to Jool. Help is a few hours away in Lo-KO or it\u2019s a half hour to the surface if you have to leave quickly. Knowing how to prevent a problem is better than knowing how to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSecond, if you want to spend a year and change inside something with the interior volume of a fridge, in your suit\u2026 well some of the others can tell you how much fun it is doing it for a full week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe third reason has to do with the first. It\u2019s what we don\u2019t know. It\u2019s really hard to plan against what you don\u2019t know about. It\u2019s hard enough planning against what we do know about. The KOL station will let us know what we don\u2019t know about.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe paused for a moment. \u201CAny other questions?\u201D He paused again. \u201COkay.
