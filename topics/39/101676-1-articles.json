I get so many good feels from this game and I like to express that with music. I wanted to show how the thing works but also put something creative into it that might draw people into the KSP experience. What do you guys think of it? Is it good? I haven\u0027t seen a gyroscope in KSP yet (oh wait maybe I have and didn\u0027t realize that\u0027s what it was) and mine needs work still, but I hope it doesn\u0027t take away from the art. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jV8NFsJPfBQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T07:05:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 07:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Little Katie**\n  \nchanged video link to one that werks"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T21:31:06Z","Content":"Little Katie needs more rep!

I mean I could but it wouldn\u0027t make sense without the music. I used two different remixes and spliced them together and listened to it a lot to see why it got a claim for the original (not the remix) which I thought was weird. I\u0027m pretty sure now it\u0027s because of one of the tracks not changing enough on it. So I could try using a different part from the other track I used and see how it might fit.\n\nLong story short I might be able to make it work without having to do a big ordeal. It\u0027s nice that you want to see it because I was excited to share it! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n[edit] fixed it. I hate touching that part of the song though. It feels like painting a really bad mustache on the Mona Lisa.
