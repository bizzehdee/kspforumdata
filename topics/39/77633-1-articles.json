The Insular Airfield. Here\u0027 date=\u0027 we can see an old base of operations, but clearly there is evidence that an old space program took place here. It was likely abandoned hastily when the Kerbal Space Center was built only a few kilometers to the West. \u003Cp\u003EOur journey brings us far to the north, where we encounter a crashed vessel of an origin unknown. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the distant southwest is what seems to be an abandoned Space Center. It was assumed that it was merely the launch site for Namergan missiles during the Kerbin War.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we seem to have some random occurance of Kerbals being stranded in this new update. It seemed to have occured when the lights at KSC2 lit up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that the Secret Space Program pays companies to claim that their employees are getting trapped in space, allowing KSC2 to bolt out into space and do weird science on anomalies while KSP focuses on retrieving the lost Kerbal. This is also a great means to get new spies, as KSC will hire these new recruits as astronauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that this secret space program is in a conspiracy to take over the world or even the entire Kerbolar System.

Press release claims that the satellite exploded upon launch into Kerbin Orbit.

The Spy Satellite was found and an Anti-Satellite Missile was quickly launched to destroy the satellite, which had not yet gathered enough data to beam down more than simple blurry pictures of Kerbin down, and the capsule that holds he film was verified as destroyed. Scott Manley still did not get off our backs. He later organized a high-budget exploration of all anomalous readings. The space program gathered too much information about the unidentified objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder the newest of Director Manley\u0027s space programs, the Interstellar Quest has uncovered the evidence of the dead Kraken recently. A high amount of distraction will be required during our newest endeavors, And we are sending an intern, Rofurt Kerman, to infiltrate his space programs and hold them back as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
