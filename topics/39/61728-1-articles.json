I didn\u0027t texture anything so they\u0027re all just solid color. I also started on a model of the actual solar sytem, but with the extra bodies, inclinations, and eccentricities, it may take a while. Does anyone else have any KSP CAD models?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverview of the system with orbits shown.
