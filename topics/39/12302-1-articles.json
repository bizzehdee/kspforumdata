Two important designs, the XV-6 \\\u0027Odyssey II\\\u0027 and F/A(V)-26 \\\u0027Minot) showcase the growth of VTOL technology. The XV-6 design, pioneered by the Avienne Air Force, is a VTOL helicopter design, never seen before. Using the concept of high-powered servos, it allowed after takeoff, nearly complete forward thrust from the two turbo-prop engines. The XV-6, however is planned to not seen any combat duty, but designed as an experimental craft to prove to concept that would work. The F/A(V)-26, pioneered, by the Taheireaz Air Force, is a fighter and realistic design using jet STOL, and jet VTOL technology. The advent of these two new aircraft can possibly boom more civilian travel with these new aircraft designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVTOL, or vertical takeoff and landing, is a method which lifts an aircraft or in the case of the Odyssey II, up, and then allows it to move horizontally. VTOL, can only be used in thrust vectoring in an aeronautical term, or gimballing, in the orbital term. VTOL is used when air is pushed out from the bottom, by controlled valves from the engine used in the aircraft. This allows a vertical control, while fighters are attacking ground-positions. Most believe this can only be done with two engines, so as to prevent loss of control, but it can in fact be done by a single engine, but less vertical thrust though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETilt-rotor designs feature moving of the engines to allow for vertical or horizontal flight. This is principally used in helicopters, but can be done with regular aircraft. The design is much simpler in theory than VTOL, but a loss of thrust in one engine if citing the XV-6, can cause a flip, as it causes a loss of thrust in that side, causing a flip in the design. Many of the incidents involving the XV-6 have been associated with this, as well as a Vortex Ring State. The XV-6 designers say that a design using autoration, can significantly improve survival rate, but from what interviews have said, it will slightly increase, due to the design of the aircraft. A statement by Chief Engineer of the XV-6 to us said that, \u0027The concept of auto-rotation will not significantly improve survival rates lower than a certain altitude. If the loss of power in both engines were to occur, it would be highly impossible for the survival of the crew in the aircraft. Simulation showed that, yet the managers refused to listen to us, resulting in the deadly crash at Charlesburg Airshow, killing the crew of the XV-6, and over 200 civilians who were in the path of the destruction.\u0027 At the time of this article, the Chief Engineer has been fired, and put into trial by the company citing \u0027Company Secrets\u0027 and \u0027Classified Data\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the greatest implication is the Kerbal Space Program. The KSP has started to see less and less available usable aircraft to train future crewmembers with Zero-G. However, the pioneering of VTOL technology, can see a trainer for the KSP, which can drop from 15,000 meters, to 7,000 meters, which there, the primary engines will reengage in a dive, and stabilize itself. Civilian airliners, like the Baiti-462 transcontinental airliner, is used for this, but high stress is indicated on the design, and especially with a declining budget in face of the crash of Julii following launch due to a loss of power to the starboard engines. This indicates a highly needed growth with VTOL technology, in the training of new astronauts, as the Julii was piloted by an entirely new crew. Thusly, importance is needed in the KSP with VTOL designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummarize Your Article Idea in less then 5 sentences: The article is expressing how VTOL is changing military designs, and for the future of KSP.

The Republic invested in Vertical Take-Off and Landing mechanisms as a means of saving both space and money in areas that are lacking in the aforementioned qualities. Many of Avienne\\\u0027s old carriers, such as the AVN Reinstar and the AVN Kenomo, had a very poor record with new horizontal takeoff designs. The computer models performed at Avia University showed that those ships, and any ships of their class, were incapable of transporting and deploying the latest naval plane models designed for the Avia-Class Supercarriers. Seeing as it was much too expensive to scrap the ships and build new ones, the task was given to various private corporations to build a prototype for a craft that could takeoff from ships of their class and still take advantage of the latest technologies. Later, the Oxbolt Corporation presented the XV-6, which appeared to be the best deal available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Were you aware of certain problems with the method?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

That meant that if a bullet punctured the outer wall of the plane, it could strike a fuel line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ministry of Aerospace worked diligently on the problems before building the first manned prototype, but apparently they didn\\\u0027t work hard enough to prevent this catastrophe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027The safety record of the Odyssey II has been increasing, but awful during the beginning why is that?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The Odyssey program from the onset was plagued with engineering problems mostly because of the newness of the mechanisms which were employed for VTOL. However, as the team of the Odyssey worked on the project longer, experience was gained and new people were brought in from across the nation to work on the dilemma. Now, a full team of highly-trained specialists have been working to make the Odyssey II fully operational and safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Why are you still believing the principality of tilt-rotors, even after the Charlesburg Airshow Disaster?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Tilt-rotors are a necessary part of the future of aerospace and the Republic is not willing to let itself be left behind. In addition, in the long run it is much cheaper to research these new technologies than to continue to use outdated methods of travel in places where it is simply impossible to use them. As I mentioned before, the ships, which are perfectly capable of operating normally, are simply incapable of using the new aircraft. Where expense out does funding, it is necessary to research new technologies which offer coming in under budget.

The Republic will not end a trial simply because it is bad PR, that is both against the Grand Republic\\\u0027s ideals and its laws, and we will not intervene in the matters of private enterprise, that being faulty design on the corporation\\\u0027s part, but also the failure of the government ministry to properly examine the design and find the faults before rushing it into production.

This combination doesn\\\u0027t seem exactly great unless you think: It\\\u0027s reusable, it uses less resources over time, and does not need a rescue craft, it has recently appeared after the success of recent aeronautics achievements and such. It even introduces larger, and better cargo bays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, this does not free it from problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore getting to that, let\\\u0027s EXPLAIN what the spaceplane does and how it works, to understand how this affects the KSP. Everything starts with design. Design of spaceplanes are difficult and challenging, it has elements, which are required in all spaceplanes. The first and most important, structure. The spaceplane must be able to withstand the rigors of the atmosphere and space as well, and require minimal maintenance for quick and spotless research missions. Second, aerodynamics. The spaceplane must be able to sustain flight, or else the idea of the spaceplane falls apart, and never works. Third, Space travel. Without the ability of space travel, it will never work, and won\\\u0027t serve it\\\u0027s purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you have flight. Flight starts with take off, take off goes to flight. Take off has two modes in a spaceplane, horizontal, and vertical. Horizontal is the most difficult mode, and should only ever be used if it\\\u0027s absolutely necessary. Vertical still has it\\\u0027s own problem, the spaceplane creates an asymmetrical design due to many features including tail, cockpit, and other things. It requires SAS, ASAS, and many things just to make it from tipping over. It also requires a huge amount of lift to get it off the ground, and most likely require big bulky stages to get it up, including large amounts of LFE, SRB, and others. Now, this can be lessened with correct usage of control surfaces, even on the spaceplane itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\\\u0027s say you got past those problems. Now, that the spaceplane itself is now acting like your run of a mill spacecraft (except for stages), you can do a simple paraphrase for the next two steps: Orbit, where you achieve orbit, can be achieved simply by rotating 90 degrees at your apogee and firing, and then circiulizing slowly at your perigee and apogee. The next step, the goal, can be achieved by the many things the spaceplane offers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step is reentry. Spaceplanes arrive with a problem here: How to reenter without the standard heat shield? And how to even slow down once you get through? Kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere is dense, causing a large amount of friction and then so: heat. The solution has been found of putting heat tiles on the bottom of your spaceplane, and then tilting up to let the heat absorb around there. This is a good solution, but not a permanent one. These tiles can have many problems, and if just one falls off, disaster can strike. The tiles also have to be constantly replaced, causing delays and issues, which what no space program wants. Many solutions have been brought up, but, for now, we have to deal with those tiles. The second problem, slowing down. Not slowing down sufficiently, even if Kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere is so dense, causes many problems: First off, gee forces. These forces could rip off your wings and cause disaster, or kill your kerbalnauts/knock then unconscious. This problem has been circumvented mostly by using a maneuver in which you slowly turn at a high pitch, which causes a lot of downwards drag, slowing you down without too many gee forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final part, landing. Most spacecraft do not have an atmospheric engine, and this is where atmospheric design really comes into play. Your craft must be able to glide safely towards the runway, and not require power. It must also be stopped in time, before problems arise. Parachutes on landing, and such have drastically increased safety with these craft. Large delta wings give spaceplanes. good gliding time, and then so allow landings much easier and safer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, how will this affect the KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSP has been known for trying new things, and the spaceplane is obviously one of their next goals. But it brings many pros and cons they must know, and have been discussed above, to summarize the pros: Allows for reusage, no need of a rescue craft, larger and better research, through use of cargo bays and such, able of atmospheric flight so it can land easily where ever it needs. The cons however, are equally as powerful: The heat tiles have to be replaced constantly, and reentry could easily kill your crew. Large rockets are required just to get them into space, and horoziontal take off is near impossible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSP have to take these into account, but however, nearing the current situation in which the old and wearied out unreusuable rockets are taking it\\\u0027s toll, the spaceplane seems like a great option, but until the KSP makes it\\\u0027s move, we will never know the spaceplanes future, but it looks like a good one with many tasks for it\\\u0027s life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAAAAND DONE.

The first weapons were incidentally sharp rocks, and the first battlefield, one of the vast grassy plains that dot our verdant world and (so far) only home. In time, Kerbals discovered steel, gunpowder, mustard gas, airplanes and machined parts. Each time, the field of battle widened, from the distance of an outstretched arm, to a few hundred yards, to several miles,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand finally to every continent and the vacuum above. Space: the last battlefield. It is the new high ground that all militaries seek to hold over their enemies, and there has been frantic development in the areas of space weapons research since Jebediah and his crew first pioneered the new realm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe doctrine of orbital weapons use is similar to that of nuclear weapons: strike first, strike hard. Prevent your enemy from firing as many salvos as you can, and disable his constellation of weapons, either by ground based interceptor missiles, or by other orbital platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two main categories of space weapon: kinetic, and energy based. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us examine the first, as at present it is the more practical, cost-effective option by far. Kinetic weapons can take the form of anything from a bullet to an ICBM, and everything in between. At the small scale, defense cannons and emplacements can fend off attacks by hostile craft, and in an offensive role can down satellites. These are crude, unguided projectiles, with a high rate of recoil, and as such are difficult to employ effectively and generally should be considered a weapon of last resort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the larger scale, the ICBM is universal, but again, it is a ground based weapon, intented to hit a target on the ground. Space-to-space missiles would have a variety of ranges. The largest category would be able to reach any spot above the atmosphere and guide itself onto the target via a heat or electronic signature. The smaller categories would be like the cannons, primarily for defensive purposes. The second type of missile would be space-to-ground, able to guide itself to any target on the surface of the earth, visible or otherwise. There would of course be a limited firing window as the platform passes overhead. Missiles that try to work against their orbital momentum are inefficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is, however, a third type of kinetic weapon: the infamous \u0027rods from god\u0027. At orbital velocities, almost anything can be turned into a devastating kill vehicle, as the cleanup crews who constantly scrub the Kerbin atmosphere of debris will tell you without hesitation. If a highly dense material is used, such as tungsten, a shock effect similar to a conventional warhead can be achieved for a much smaller price-tag. Although lugging a bundle of tungsten rods, each the size of a telephone pole, into orbit is highly fuel intensive, their trajectory can be predicted almost as easily as that of missiles, although without their course correction ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA single platform could hold dozens of such rods, raining terror and death down upon anyone who thinks themselves safe inside a bunker or hardened structure. If penetration is not the aim, the tip can be serrated for greater surface disintegration upon impact, and the shrapnel scatters like a charge of bribery fired into a session of the grand Kerbal congress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second category of space armament is that of energy weapons. These can vary from tightly concentrated pulses of plasma to solid state, wave motion lasers. There are many different varieties and power sources for these weapons, but practicality is limited at this juncture. Solid state lasers diffuse quickly, even in the vacuum of space, and are thus not suited to surface strikes, but rather useful for meteoroid defense and close combat, should it occur. Plasma can be built up into larger magnetic envelopes to form torpedoes with a superior range. Like lasers, they will simply be defused should they be aimed at Kerbin, but can be potent long range, anti-ship weapons. These weapons can be powered most efficiently by reactors or solar panels. The former can provide enough power for devastating strikes on demand, and lasts a long time, but cleaning up after a meltdown or malfunction on one of said reactors would be difficult and dangerous in the extreme. Solar panels provide a second level of self sufficiency, but are very limited in power output and obviously don\\\u0027t work when not in direct sunlight (although advances in battery technology could change this), negating their area of operation over a large portion of Kerbin\\\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt present, no nation or private entity has enough platforms operational to conduct a real shooting war in space, but all must prepare themselves for that day, for it is coming. The stations currently operational are either testbeds for ground strikes, possess short range anti-ship capability, or are intended for debris clearance. It will not be long before the dominant political powers turn their attention to this new arena, however. As of yet the level of technology is not sufficient to permit advanced missile or projectile trajectory guidance, and the range of warheads is limited to a few yards at most, but betting on Kerbals to stand idly by while a new killing tool is in sight is not a smart use of money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Salamander","CreatedById":12724,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-11T05:52:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Monkthespy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Monkthespy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAAAAND DONE.

This combination doesn\\\u0027t seem exactly great unless you think: It\\\u0027s reusable, it uses less resources over time, and does not need a rescue craft, it has recently appeared after the success of recent aeronautics achievements and such. It even introduces larger, and better cargo bays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, this does not free it from problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore getting to that, let\\\u0027s EXPLAIN what the spaceplane does and how it works, to understand how this affects the KSP. Everything starts with design. Design of spaceplanes are difficult and challenging, it has elements, which are required in all spaceplanes. The first and most important, structure. The spaceplane must be able to withstand the rigors of the atmosphere and space as well, and require minimal maintenance for quick and spotless research missions. Second, aerodynamics. The spaceplane must be able to sustain flight, or else the idea of the spaceplane falls apart, and never works. Third, Space travel. Without the ability of space travel, it will never work, and won\\\u0027t serve it\\\u0027s purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you have flight. Flight starts with take off, take off goes to flight. Take off has two modes in a spaceplane, horizontal, and vertical. Horizontal is the most difficult mode, and should only ever be used if it\\\u0027s absolutely necessary. Vertical still has it\\\u0027s own problem, the spaceplane creates an asymmetrical design due to many features including tail, cockpit, and other things. It requires SAS, ASAS, and many things just to make it from tipping over. It also requires a huge amount of lift to get it off the ground, and most likely require big bulky stages to get it up, including large amounts of LFE, SRB, and others. Now, this can be lessened with correct usage of control surfaces, even on the spaceplane itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\\\u0027s say you got past those problems. Now, that the spaceplane itself is now acting like your run of a mill spacecraft (except for stages), you can do a simple paraphrase for the next two steps: Orbit, where you achieve orbit, can be achieved simply by rotating 90 degrees at your apogee and firing, and then circiulizing slowly at your perigee and apogee. The next step, the goal, can be achieved by the many things the spaceplane offers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step is reentry. Spaceplanes arrive with a problem here: How to reenter without the standard heat shield? And how to even slow down once you get through? Kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere is dense, causing a large amount of friction and then so: heat. The solution has been found of putting heat tiles on the bottom of your spaceplane, and then tilting up to let the heat absorb around there. This is a good solution, but not a permanent one. These tiles can have many problems, and if just one falls off, disaster can strike. The tiles also have to be constantly replaced, causing delays and issues, which what no space program wants. Many solutions have been brought up, but, for now, we have to deal with those tiles. The second problem, slowing down. Not slowing down sufficiently, even if Kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere is so dense, causes many problems: First off, gee forces. These forces could rip off your wings and cause disaster, or kill your kerbalnauts/knock then unconscious. This problem has been circumvented mostly by using a maneuver in which you slowly turn at a high pitch, which causes a lot of downwards drag, slowing you down without too many gee forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final part, landing. Most spacecraft do not have an atmospheric engine, and this is where atmospheric design really comes into play. Your craft must be able to glide safely towards the runway, and not require power. It must also be stopped in time, before problems arise. Parachutes on landing, and such have drastically increased safety with these craft. Large delta wings give spaceplanes. good gliding time, and then so allow landings much easier and safer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, how will this affect the KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSP has been known for trying new things, and the spaceplane is obviously one of their next goals. But it brings many pros and cons they must know, and have been discussed above, to summarize the pros: Allows for reusage, no need of a rescue craft, larger and better research, through use of cargo bays and such, able of atmospheric flight so it can land easily where ever it needs. The cons however, are equally as powerful: The heat tiles have to be replaced constantly, and reentry could easily kill your crew. Large rockets are required just to get them into space, and horoziontal take off is near impossible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSP have to take these into account, but however, nearing the current situation in which the old and wearied out unreusuable rockets are taking it\\\u0027s toll, the spaceplane seems like a great option, but until the KSP makes it\\\u0027s move, we will never know the spaceplanes future, but it looks like a good one with many tasks for it\\\u0027s life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAAAAND DONE.

The first weapons were incidentally sharp rocks, and the first battlefield, one of the vast grassy plains that dot our verdant world and (so far) only home. In time, Kerbals discovered steel, gunpowder, mustard gas, airplanes and machined parts. Each time, the field of battle widened, from the distance of an outstretched arm, to a few hundred yards, to several miles,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand finally to every continent and the vacuum above. Space: the last battlefield. It is the new high ground that all militaries seek to hold over their enemies, and there has been frantic development in the areas of space weapons research since Jebediah and his crew first pioneered the new realm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe doctrine of orbital weapons use is similar to that of nuclear weapons: strike first, strike hard. Prevent your enemy from firing as many salvos as you can, and disable his constellation of weapons, either by ground based interceptor missiles, or by other orbital platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two main categories of space weapon: kinetic, and energy based. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us examine the first, as at present it is the more practical, cost-effective option by far. Kinetic weapons can take the form of anything from a bullet to an ICBM, and everything in between. At the small scale, defense cannons and emplacements can fend off attacks by hostile craft, and in an offensive role can down satellites. These are crude, unguided projectiles, with a high rate of recoil, and as such are difficult to employ effectively and generally should be considered a weapon of last resort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the larger scale, the ICBM is universal, but again, it is a ground based weapon, intented to hit a target on the ground. Space-to-space missiles would have a variety of ranges. The largest category would be able to reach any spot above the atmosphere and guide itself onto the target via a heat or electronic signature. The smaller categories would be like the cannons, primarily for defensive purposes. The second type of missile would be space-to-ground, able to guide itself to any target on the surface of the earth, visible or otherwise. There would of course be a limited firing window as the platform passes overhead. Missiles that try to work against their orbital momentum are inefficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is, however, a third type of kinetic weapon: the infamous \u0027rods from god\u0027. At orbital velocities, almost anything can be turned into a devastating kill vehicle, as the cleanup crews who constantly scrub the Kerbin atmosphere of debris will tell you without hesitation. If a highly dense material is used, such as tungsten, a shock effect similar to a conventional warhead can be achieved for a much smaller price-tag. Although lugging a bundle of tungsten rods, each the size of a telephone pole, into orbit is highly fuel intensive, their trajectory can be predicted almost as easily as that of missiles, although without their course correction ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA single platform could hold dozens of such rods, raining terror and death down upon anyone who thinks themselves safe inside a bunker or hardened structure. If penetration is not the aim, the tip can be serrated for greater surface disintegration upon impact, and the shrapnel scatters like a charge of bribery fired into a session of the grand Kerbal congress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second category of space armament is that of energy weapons. These can vary from tightly concentrated pulses of plasma to solid state, wave motion lasers. There are many different varieties and power sources for these weapons, but practicality is limited at this juncture. Solid state lasers diffuse quickly, even in the vacuum of space, and are thus not suited to surface strikes, but rather useful for meteoroid defense and close combat, should it occur. Plasma can be built up into larger magnetic envelopes to form torpedoes with a superior range. Like lasers, they will simply be defused should they be aimed at Kerbin, but can be potent long range, anti-ship weapons. These weapons can be powered most efficiently by reactors or solar panels. The former can provide enough power for devastating strikes on demand, and lasts a long time, but cleaning up after a meltdown or malfunction on one of said reactors would be difficult and dangerous in the extreme. Solar panels provide a second level of self sufficiency, but are very limited in power output and obviously don\\\u0027t work when not in direct sunlight (although advances in battery technology could change this), negating their area of operation over a large portion of Kerbin\\\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt present, no nation or private entity has enough platforms operational to conduct a real shooting war in space, but all must prepare themselves for that day, for it is coming. The stations currently operational are either testbeds for ground strikes, possess short range anti-ship capability, or are intended for debris clearance. It will not be long before the dominant political powers turn their attention to this new arena, however. As of yet the level of technology is not sufficient to permit advanced missile or projectile trajectory guidance, and the range of warheads is limited to a few yards at most, but betting on Kerbals to stand idly by while a new killing tool is in sight is not a smart use of money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the humor, I see this style all the time in the industry magazines.
