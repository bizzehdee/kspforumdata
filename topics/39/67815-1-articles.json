I love this texture, and I can\u0027t wait to get my hands on a downloadable version. Jool has always bugged me a bit cause I feel like it\u0027s Highly unlikely or even impossible that a gas giant would have the coloration that Jool does in the stock game. Correct me if I\u0027m wrong here, as my Chemistry knowledge is lacking, but there aren\u0027t many gases with that coloration and those which have similar color, are generally not found in great abundance such as this. Gas Giants are typically made of gasses found fairly low on the periodic table if I\u0027m not mistaken, and compounds of those. things like hydrogen, Methane (carbon-hydrogen compound), Ammonia (Nitrogen-Hydrogen compound), and the like. A greet tinged gas giant is definitely possible, but deep emerald green seems out of place to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Colour actually seems to be more so based off of the temperature of the giant see here \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudarsky_extrasolar_planet_classification\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudarsky_extrasolar_planet_classification\u003C/a\u003E this means that a green gas giant is possible, but it has to be very hot.
