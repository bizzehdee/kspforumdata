So my vote is for Career mode, however, Career mode with no mods and no reverting. Everything you do has to matter and every fail has to hurt your heart. I think that will make people gravitate towards yours over someone else\u0027s (ah, ah, see what I did there).

I think if you wanted to play the game and let people watch, it may not matter which type of video you focus on. Just unique content really. But with Twitch, what I like about what I\u0027ve seen so far, if you allow it to store your videos ( you have to choose this setting otherwise after you stream its just gone ), then you have so many tools available to take snippets of all of that and make a highlight video, or edit out all the boring and keep it to the point, or even do all of that and then add audio on top of it. Personally I\u0027m not comfortable yet with a camera feed or audio just yet, my kids are home from school now with the whole pandemic going on and they get unruly from time to time.
