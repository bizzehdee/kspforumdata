Bill is considered the \u0022scientist.\u0022 They figure the dumber the recipient of knowledge the greater total knowledge received so they have a purposeful dumb lead scientist. Gene was Bob\u0027s old buddy from college and he worked the politics to get KSP back up and running.

By the end of a save Jeb has grown to respect Bob and Bob has conquered his fear. Gene becomes the elected Overlord of the Kerbals and space interest skyrockets from the already high level of interest to the point where the entire kerbal industry is space related. Werner dies shortly thereafter and Bill, now a genius scientist thanks to his hard work. Gives a moving speech after his funeral on the importance of space travel.
