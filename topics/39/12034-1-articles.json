Coming back into consciousness is a difficult ordeal, no doubt. Reaching for my headset, the one just across from me on the table of this ever-so-dark room, a quick green flash came, and back to sleep I went.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings weren\\\u0027t supposed to go like that. It was all a simple recovery mission, get in, get out. No explosions, no tense negotiations, not even a catchphrase to blurt out every 5 seconds. Yet, somehow, I got involved in all of this, and if you\\\u0027re reading this, you are too. If you read ahead, your life may very well be put at risk. I do not guarantee your safety. However, someone must know. Someone must be told the story, lest it be lost forever and the perpetrators go unpunished. Read on, at your own risk, for if they catch you, my fate may be yours to share.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EChapter One - An Invitation\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy name is Ethan Rein. I served in the Avian Expeditionary Force for 7 years before making the switch. To me, there was nothing better than the next mission. I loved the mafioso-style meetings we\\\u0027d had, and the cannonade blast of the explosions we\\\u0027d inevitably run into. I guess that\\\u0027s just a part I get from my uncle, Jebediah. I only switched because of a letter I got from Uncle Jeb a few days ago, to be honest, and I never thought things would turn out like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E****8 Days Before****\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Ethan! I\\\u0027m home!\u0027 My wife called, coming home from work at the Svartfalk Heavy Industries Headquarters. She was a corporate gal, always talking business, yet I looked past that, to the sweet girl inside I had met years before. Her auburn hair and deep eyes were the only things I caught sight of as she swished into the kitchen to grab a soda.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027So, how was work, mon cherie?\u0027 I asked from the stairs, blissfully caught in her radiance. I, not wanting to be rude, opted for the quickest route to the kitchen, that is, skipping the stairs all-together and jumping down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Come on, Ethan, stop scaring me.\u0027 She told me as she ran to the phone, which had, out of all times it could have, decided to ring at that moment. She picked it up. \u0027Hello?\u0027 She asked into the phone in an illustrious, almost fascinating manner. \u0027Ethan, come\\\u0027ere, its Anna, she wants you to do something.\u0027 Briskly walking over, I ran into the door trim. \u003Cem\u003EI\\\u0027m losing my edge,\u003C/em\u003E I thought, reaching for the phone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Hi Anna! How\\\u0027s it going in Avia?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Fine daddy. I need you to check something.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Sure, anything. Just promise me you\\\u0027ll be here early for Matthew\\\u0027s graduation. Briscanny get\\\u0027s traffic all over the place after five.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Sure thing dad. So, anyway, could you check the mail? Uncle Jeb wanted me to ask you to.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Alright. Thanks, see \\\u0027ya next week!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Bye daddy.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Marissa, have you checked the mail?\u0027 I asked. She nodded a no, and I made my way to the door. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur suburban home was quite a nice home for middle class. It was a classic Taheirean design, Marissa always had an affinity for the way buildings were made in Taheireaz. I promised her we\\\u0027d go there on vacation some day, so far, we haven\\\u0027t. It had a marble floor for the front porch, and columns made of stone. The trim was gold-leaved, and the rest of the house was made in a sort of clay material. It all culminated in a central dome atop the house, the family room. The yard was a nice, rich green, dotted with a few Iridere trees. We didn\\\u0027t wine them though, too much work for us, now that Matthew was going off to college.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI approached the charcoal black mailbox with its little flag up high. Opening the door, I discovered a letter in a pouch that seemed to be made almost of parchment paper, completely unlike Uncle Jeb. My neighbor, Voltan Evanov, a Makavite that moved here last year, passed by and I waved to him. Then, I carefully opened the letter and read the contents - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEthan Rein,\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAfter careful consideration and a nomination from Jebediah Kerman, the Kerbal Space Program Kerbonaut Training Committee has decided to approve your application. You will be expected to report to the KSP Regional Headquarters in Avia, Avienne, to complete your application and to prepare for your transfer of residence to Taheireaz, Taheireaz.

Get the car!\u0027 I yelled, elated. My application, which I had sent in 5 weeks prior, had been accepted! No doubt Jeb had walked in during the discussion and done something to the committee, but no matter, I was in. That was all I could think of as I ran inside to grab my things. After Matthew\\\u0027s graduation, I\\\u0027d finally get to see Taheireaz, and maybe even get into that Mun program the news stations were all garbing about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EChapter 2 - Oddities\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe drive to Avia was quite long, and boring, seeing as I had driven this route many times before. Still, the countryside was the most beautiful place in the world, and nothing could compare. Nowhere else on Kerbin would you find the all of these features coming together. I felt like everything was finally coming into place. Matthew graduated last week, and today, I\\\u0027d find myself fulfilling my dreams.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI drove the SUV into the KSP HQ parking lot, getting a slot as close to the door as possible, seeing as it would probably rain soon, and I didn\\\u0027t want Marissa to get sick. We both got off and began walking to the door. To either side of us were politicians, economists, bankers, merchants, children, vendors, families, people, life. No matter where you looked, something was going on. Music poured from an entertainment center across the street, and a group of teenagers walked towards an Orange Store. As we approached the door, it swished open like a door straight out of Kerb-Trek. Inside, a massive scale model of Kerbin rotated, illuminated by lights, under which the help desk was located.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027Welcome to the Kerbal Space Program Regional Headquarters, I assume you need help?\u0027 Asked the teller in a friendly, if condescending manner. I nodded a yes, and gave her the teller receipt that was included in the letter. \u0027Alright, astro-boy. Go upstairs to floor 15, and head into the conference room, D352. Ma\\\u0027am, you\\\u0027ll have to stay here.\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027Now, miss. I\\\u0027m taking my wife with me for this occasion.\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027Sorry sir, administration policy. No family members in the conference room for this type of briefing.\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027This type? Now, surely what kind of briefing would require that a family member stay down here? This is a civilian program, not military.\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027Sir, this is not under my jurisdiction, and there is no use talking about this. Your wife will stay here, and you will go upstairs to floor 15, room D352. Got it?\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027Quite.\u0027 I said with a grumph. I proceeded to the elevator and went upstairs, gliding up the plexi-glass tube to the 15th floor, where I found myself among a massive array of computers spewing out, what I thought, was massive piles of garbage, ones and zeros. Coming up to the conference room, I found a little device plastered to the door. Studying it further, I noticed its striking similarity to a device I\\\u0027d seen at a hotel that would control access to the room, a lock.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPaying no mind to it, I sat down at the end of the hall to wait for my appointment time, when suddenly a high-pitched whine starting coming out of the little device. It opened, and out popped a block of goop that began expanding to shut the door. It dripped and dropped, eventually covering the entire door and surrounding areas. It seemed quite a bit like the bombs that were used in Nexvulch to clear out rooms containing enemy combatants. The bomb usually went off when the whine stopped going, or when a spark made its way in. Suddenly, the whine stopped. \u0027Oh sh--\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAll went black.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027Mon dieu. What just happened!?\u0027 I muttered, groaning heavily as I tried to move my head. I couldn\\\u0027t yet see where I was, so I tried looking to the right. No luck, there were the charred remains of what I thought was a desk to the right, so I looked left. To the left, a gaping hole looking out into Downtown Avia. \u0027My God.\u0027 I breathed. Then, I tried to stand up. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe time between my trying to stand and actually getting up seemed like a lifetime of pain and misery. Finally, I stood on both of my legs and looked out into the hole created by the bomb. \u0027This is ridiculous. What kind of insane madman would do this!?\u0027 From my perch I looked out across the street, where pieces of shrapnel lay strewn across the park. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOh God.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E I thought. I nearly went back into unconsciousness, but then, I remembered Marissa, and wondered where she had gone after leaving the HQ. She loved parks, and the thought hit me. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENo, my God no. Not that.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E I expelled the thought from my mind, and began frantically searching for a way down, despite having recently woken up from being unconscious by bomb blast.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI heard the monotonous rounds of a helicopter pass, then get louder. The sound grew more intense as the seconds came by, and despite what my head told me, I couldn\\\u0027t help but think that I wouldn\\\u0027t like what was coming. Around the corner came a black helicopter, obviously designed for night operations, yet for some reason being used during the day. For a second, I was relieved, as that could be my ticket to safety. Then, when it opened up its side door, I found myself being captured in a net, and hauled aboard.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radion","CreatedById":3273,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-03T23:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EChapter 3 - What Others Bring\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shock of again being tossed around made go back into the darkness of unconsciousness. I doubt that being down this many times within the space of a few hours is going to be very helpful. I don\\\u0027t know how long it was, but eventually I came back into consciousness. It\\\u0027s quite ridiculous, really, how the day had been. Things were looking up, and then the world had to go kaput. Conscious, I let out a groan. I opened my eyes, trying to figure out where I was now. The world was a kaleidoscope of dull colors and wispy shapes, until finally I could see sufficiently clearly to attempt to communicate. \u0027Eilp.\u0027 I yelped, still not yet able to speak clearly. \u0027W-what\\\u0027s g-goin\\\u0027 on here?\u0027 I said, pleased with what I thought were superb vocalization capabilities for a person in my situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Agent Kanstov, the boy is awake.\u0027 Called a man in a furry hat and coat in a trademark Taheirean accent. \u0027I think he\\\u0027s ready to answer a few questions,\u0027 the man said, making my situation ever more uneasy. \u0027Are you ready, Kanstov?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yes, Voysnia. Don\\\u0027t worry, we\\\u0027ll have all of the questions from Seleneikos soon enough.\u0027 Kanstov replied, triggering a thought in my mind. \u003Cem\u003ESeleneikos?\u003C/em\u003E I thought, \u003Cem\u003EWasn\\\u0027t he the king of Taheireaz or something, deposed during an election?\u003C/em\u003E My thoughts would go unanswered for the time being, as a shining object caught my eye from my perch on the top of an equipment rack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027You\\\u0027re kidding.\u0027 I said, before the Gatling on the other end of the shiny object began belching out hundreds of rounds of steaming hot lead, all of them blazing through the steel casket the helicopter was soon becoming. Smoke burst from the engine compartment as the chopper twirled around. A 50 pound pack fell from the top of the rack and began bouncing around the cabin until impaling 2 of the crew, and punching a hole in the other side of the cabin. Now thoroughly compromised, and with the rogue jet still screaming lead, the helicopter gave in to the pressures and dropped like a dead bird. Then, the jet put a missile through the back of the helicopter, pushing me close to the open door. \u0027I\\\u0027ve had enough of this.\u0027 I muttered, eyes rolling, as I jumped from the equipment rack into the crisp gray air. The feeling of thankfulness of being free from a 15-ton death trap quickly dissipated as I looked at the massive expanse of green below. It was only a matter of time before my body would make a noise that only psychopaths would revel in. Suddenly, a little white circle appeared below me. It could only be a parachute, so I dived as far as I could and tried to over-take the nearly unconscious man at the end of my lifeline. Easily enough, I was soon safe in a parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my slowly descending perch, I could see the random jet that had taken down the helicopter, flying about and behaving like an erratic bee. The jet noticed me, in my white parachute regalia, and began turning for the inevitable. It occurred to me that, for the first time in my life, I might actually be at risk of dying. Never, not even in the Expeditionaries, was I exposed to this fact. I was always superior, always on top. Now, a crazy madman in a jet would decide whether I lived or died. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA song played in the background, seemingly bringing my doom. Then, I thought \u003Cem\u003EWait, since when does life have background music?\u003C/em\u003E A funny thought to be thinking in my situation, but suddenly, it came to me. The boys in the Avian Air Force were always dramatic when they made their entry, and what they liked to do was launch the most powerful speakers imaginable into the air to play their edited version of \u0027\u003Cem\u003ERide of the Valkyries\u003C/em\u003E, while they flew in. Sure enough, the two badboy-jets flew in and made quick work of the rogue jet, basically strewing it in the Brisca River.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, I came down from my safety and landed on the cold, hard ground. Still, I was relieved, as this was the first time in what I thought was days since I\\\u0027d been under 300 feet from the ground. I looked around, and things looked vaguely familiar. My eyes were still killing me from all of the action they\\\u0027d endured, but I managed to finally recognize the area. Home. I was home. I made my way to the front door of my home, and opened the door. \u0027Marissa?\u0027 I called into the house. No answer. \u0027Matthew?\u0027 I called, this time for my son. Still no answer. \u0027Anyone?\u0027 I called, faintly this time, out of hope. Then, I noticed a small packet sitting on the table off the foyer. \u003Cem\u003EWas that there before?\u003C/em\u003E I thought, still queasy. The yellow manila packet was entitled, strangely enough. It simply said, \u0027Ethan.\u0027 Opening it, I found a note.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEthan Rein, we have your wife and your two children. Come to 4207 East Maddahaker Street, Taheireaz, Taheireaz with 10 thousand Kerbits if you ever want to see them again.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI collapsed, tears budding out of my eyes. I went upstairs to look for any signs of life, anyone, anything, maybe Anna\\\u0027s old pet. Yet, to my dismay, I found nothing. Then, I heard a thud coming from the front patio. Looking out from the top window, I found a man in a jet-black suit boasting an assault rifle getting ready to blow my door in. From that point on, I just let my military training do the thinking for me. I grabbed an Expeditionary standard issue assault rifle, barricaded the stairs, and prepared to just about blow the living daylights out of what I presumed to be the cause of this entire fiasco. He came around the corner, and I threw a shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EChapter 4 - Christopher\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shot found its mark on his arm. The invader retreated to the side of the wall as I made my way downstairs. Nothing would stop me from getting to my loved ones, no one. If I had to kill a million of these types to get my family back, I would.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProceeding down the stairs, I found myself looking at the mess which had dared to invade my home. \u0027Hands up, now.\u0027 I growled, adding, \u0027Put the gun down!\u0027 The man disregarding my commands, simply stared back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Excuse me, sir, but I am Lieutenant Chr...\u0027 and then I had enough of his smuggities. Reacting quickly to his slight step forward, I twirled my gun to put the end onto his face, probably breaking his nose. Afterward, while the man still lay in daze from the nose-breaking incident, I ran out the door. My pickup, which I only kept as a backup car and was planning to sell to Old Man Reicher, suddenly came back to life as my getaway car as I slammed the pedal onto the street. The open road ahead of me, I was sure I\\\u0027d finally be able to concentrate on my task, finding my family.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I drove down, going around triple the speed limit for the area, I heard an explosion coming from behind. I took a quick look behind to find, that to my dismay, there was a car after me and a helicopter had gone down in my backyard. \u0027You\\\u0027ve got to be kidding me.\u0027 I let out, turning my attention back to the road and breaking the law a fourth time with acceleration. I took a quick look back again as I did, and made out the figure in the following car to be the kerb I\\\u0027d slammed back home. \u003Cem\u003EI\\\u0027ve got to lose this clown\u003C/em\u003E, I thought. \u003Cem\u003EThe backroads! That\\\u0027s it! I\\\u0027ll take B-12 to curve back around and get to Briscanny Airport.\u003C/em\u003E Putting my plan into action, I turned sharply into the dim little dirt path that was B-12 and made a quick smile watching the surprise in the face of my pursuer do a sudden grimace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDriving down the road, I saw a smoking helicopter getting ever closer to the ground. \u0027I thought that thing went down ov-\u0027 and then the helicopter hit a telephone poll, bringing the whole thing down onto the road. Quickly, I swerved, only barely missing the horizontal propeller that would have made my head only so much goop on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of nowhere, a gun began firing. The shots hit the windshield, the chassis, the fender, and then blasted through the rear-view mirror. \u0027Oh Heil Naw!\u0027 I yelled, quoting a Kerbo-net meme, then pulling out my assault rifle to try and shake off the would-be assassin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI let off quite a few rounds, somehow managing to keep my pace on the road. Blowing out the windshield, of the assailant, I quickly rounded a bend, then began trying to escape in a more subtle fashion. However, before I could put my plans into action, the attacker unloaded a clip on my rear tires, blasting me off the road and into a tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI slowly stood up, cautious as now the assailant happened to be right across from me. The invader yelled, \u0027\u00E2\u20AC\u0153God damnit! Why is it that whenever I get something very simple, it always turns complicated! I am sick of this shit!\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI, disregarding his being sick of this, asked him, \u0027Okay... now can you tell me exactly why you came in my house, and shot me while I was on the road? That\\\u0027s not very nice.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Alright, first tell me your name.\u00E2\u20AC He replied with his semi-casual bravado that I would have slapped if he were under my command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Ethan, and yours?\u00E2\u20AC I told him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Christopher. Okay, Ethan, I am a Lieutenant in the People\\\u0027s Republic of Aries Air Force. I was assigned on a patrol, and ordered to try to rescue you. I then proceeded at nearly Mach 2 to get to you. My aircraft lost the radar-pod, thus losing my radar, requiring visible identification. After half-an-hour, I saw your helicopter and aircraft. I brought my aircraft in a perpendicular direction to shoot down the helicopter. A gunner from that helicopter shot my aircraft, requiring me to bail out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rogue jet was shot down by your air force. After I landed, I saw your parachute, and proceeded to follow the steps to your house. I knocked on the door, and with no response, I broke the door to the house down. I came inside, and checked the first floor, and seeing no one there, I proceeded to go up the stairs. Then you bloody shot me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you headed downstairs, I attempted to speak to you who I was, but you shoved your rifle butt at my face. I raced outside, and seeing your pick-up gone, \\\u0027borrowed\\\u0027 a neighbor\\\u0027s car, and chased after you. Your house exploded just after I left, from a helicopter, which then crashed. I then chased you, and shot you, and then you crashed, so that is the situation right now,\u00E2\u20AC he finished, starting to sit on the ground, my eyes ever staring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yeah, right, whatever. Anyway ,can you please give me the car so I can head to Briscanny Airport, right away?\u0027 I asked, caring too much about other matters to pay attention to this man-child\\\u0027s whining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Why do you need to head to the airport? I need to report the situation to my commander, as well as the Head of the State,\u00E2\u20AC Christopher retorted, reloading his side-arm. I pulled out the note from back home and shoved it at him, hoping to awaken his sense of urgency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Alright, what is this?\u00E2\u20AC He muttered, opening the note. Upon reading it, he dropped his half-loaded pistol like an amateur, beginning to send off what I presumed to be prayers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153That is why, Lieutenant. And, technically, I outrank you.\u0027 I told him, giving off a sly grin as I informed him of my official superiority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Shit, man didn\\\u0027t know, and you can borrow the car, but I am coming with,\u00E2\u20AC Christopher replied, his eyes showing a dangerous glint that I had once seen from one of my juniors, right before they got their heads blown off by a Cleavle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Alright, whatever. I\\\u0027ll drive.\u0027 I told him, rounding to the driver\\\u0027s seat.
