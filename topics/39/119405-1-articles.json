Part 1: A Short History of the Kerbal Dream.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose we ought to start from the very beginning, shall we?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EY -20,037 D6 5:29, Prehistoric Ferleferna\u003C/strong\u003E (Kerbin timescale)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbals had never seen the Mun before. They never usually looked up. THeir heads were black, so they could photosynthesize more energy. They were all hot, tired, and dumb. None of them wanted to do anything cool. But then, one day, a tribe member named Felefurlin fell on his back while trying to lift something that was a bit too heavy. That\u0027s when he saw it. The glorious white orb in the black darkness around it. It seemed to call out to him. Perhaps it was just because it was shiny. But this new realm that he decided to call \u0022Sky\u0022 was alien to him. He ran back to the settlement telling his wives what he saw. They all went out of the hut, and looked up. The news spread around the tribe very quickly indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is perhaps what kickstarted the civilization of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EY -2,756 D23, Ancient Ferleferna\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKing Tutrim Kerbil II holds a meeting to discuss the announcement of the first space program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We have chosen as a civilization to depart the bonds of Kerbin and voyage to the Mun. We shall do this not because it is an easy feat. We intend to do it because the struggle is half the adventure. We intend to do it because that goal is one which can only serve to improve us! We choose to go to Mun.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, their space program never amounted to much more than a few pyramids and a statue of Tutrim, but Kerbalkind learned a valuable lesson that week. The Mun is a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E further away than it looked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EY -130 D9, Great Kerbland\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDersberry Kerman put on his helmet. A modified diving helmet capsule with all the holes \u003Cem\u003Eproperly\u003C/em\u003E plugged up. His space suit firmly locked into the helmet. Surely, they thought, this would work in the hazardous environment of space. They already knew that the air thinned with altitude, so they had to pack accordingly for the Voyage to the Mun. Dersberry Kerman was the first volunteer. A BadS before his time, Dersberry would fly on the first mission to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe stepped inside the capsule. Several workers lifted the capsule and placed it into the large barrel of the cannon. Dersberry wanted to be the first. He\u0027d wanted to since he was a little kid. And now he would finally be the first to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cannon was ignited, propelling Dersberry forth. The scientists and engineers cheered as the capsule vanished out of sight. Then they became very confused when the capsule came back. They recovered the capsule to find a half-flattened Dersberry Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The barometer barely got out of the light blue.\u0022 He said. \u0022And the Mun didn\u0027t get any closer.\u0022 Dersberry Kerman became depressed after that. His childhood dreams crushed by the laws of physics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the years, scientists put their estimates for the Mun further and further upwards. Some even suggested that it was infinitely far away, like the stars. But one day, a scientist and mathematician named Ike Kilonewton discovered how gravity works. Using careful observation and a few Analytical Engine clusters for computation, he figured out orbital mechanics. Using the speed of the Mun as an estimate, and with a known surface gravity of 9.81 m/s^2, he figured out exactly how far away the Mun was. 12,000,000 meters. This was too far away for most people, but the aging Dersberry was given hope. In fact, his last dying words were, on Year -102 Day 23 at 1:20 AM, were \u0022The Mun can be Reached.\u0022 He smiled at that thought as he passed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EY -37 D1, Usussian Empire\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKonstantine Tsiolkerman had an idea. He woke up after New Year\u0027s eve, the only sober adult around. Of course, they\u0027d all have a bit of time before it was time for school, so at least the teachers could take some painkillers to get rid of their hangovers. Tsiolkerman, very much unlike the other citizens of the North-Crater Tundra Empire of Usussia, was not fond of mixing Hydrazine, Alcohol, and Water together in his stomach. The horrible concoction they called \u0022Wodka\u0022 was not very appetizing to say the least. He was thinking about his idea during the walk to the school that he worked at as a High School Teacher. He decided to drop the lesson plan for the day. As he walked to the school, he saw all the used fireworks littering up the streets. This was the key to his idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe students were all top-of-the-class physics students. They could understand his idea, surely. The idea was about getting to the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t try accelerating all at once (unless you want guacamole instead of Kerbals in the capsule) or using some kind of propeller or wheel or anything that needs to push off of something static.\u0022 He then picked up a piece of chalk, and scribbled something on the board. It was a cylinder with a cone on top, and a long stick attached to it. \u0022Can anyone tell me what this is?\u0022 A few of the students raised their hands. He picked on one of the students, Valentina Kermana. (You may recognize the name. It\u0027s not a coincidence. She was in fact the Mother of Valentina Kerman.) \u0022You, Tina.\u0022 She nervously responded. \u0022A firework rocket?\u0022 Tsiolkerman nodded. \u0022Yes indeed. A fire work rocket. Can anyone tell me what differentiates the rocket from other forms of propulsion?\u0022 He picked on a young boy at the back. \u0022You there, Dudrim.\u0022 The boy was very much confident in his answer, as if he thought he was better than Tina with her nervous answer. \u0022A \u003Cem\u003Erocket\u003C/em\u003E travels through the sky instead of the ground.\u0022 He looked so smug. A few of the other students frowned and sighed. \u0022No... not really. That\u0027s not the important bit. The new radial propeller engines and airplanes travel through the air. Can anyone else give it a go?\u0022 He pointed at another kid. \u0022Kirk, you there.\u0022 Kirk thought a bit. \u0022Because...\u0022 he started. \u0022Because a rocket pushes on itself rather than other things, it can operate even in a place where there isn\u0027t anything.\u0022 He was almost interrupted by Tsiolkerman. \u0022EXACTLY.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If you want to get an object into space and let it stay there, you have to make it go as fast a small moon would have to go at the altitude of just above the atmosphere. About two thousand meters per second. However, you also have to account for the fact that you have to climb out of the gravity and contend with drag, right?\u0022 The class nodded. \u0022So you have to have the energy to go from anywhere from three and a half kilometers per second to five kilometers per second. This means that you can\u0027t just accelerate all at once. So can anyone tell me where the rocket comes into this?\u0022 One of the kids in the front already started blurting out, without raising her hand. \u0022It\u0027s because a rocket can have a constant acceleration over time instead of a single burst like a cannon!\u0022 \u0022Thank you Fredericklynn.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few months later, he published a paper on the subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Exploration of The Mun by Means of Rocket Devices, Y-36, by Konstantin Tsiolkerman.

Section 7 on Practical Staging Concepts\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E To launch truly massive objects, such as a rocket powerful enough to send a gold prospecting crew to the Mun, we may have to resort to more unconventional methods of staging the vessel. It may be possible to strap several liquid powered fuselages and engines together, and have the burn out in such a way that they feed their fuel into the next tank. Due to the strange appearance of this design, one of my students called it \u0022Asparagus\u0022 staging. If a rocket fuselage can be built that is considerably larger than one meter, it may be possible to build a rocket that can accomplish the trip in a more conventional staging setup.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Exploration of the Mun by Means of Rocket Devices, Y-36, by Konstantin Tsiolkerman.

Section 13 on Rocket Boosters\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor the trip through the lower atmosphere there are several ways that can give the rocket a boost. The most obvious is simply to use more rockets. For disposable rockets you would not need the efficient Liquid Fuel, but instead the raw power of the Solid Boompowder fueled booster rocket. These may be considerably cheaper and only need to lift through the lower atmosphere. For a more reusable option, it may be possible to lift the rocket on a large Dirigible to the higher altitude...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly a few short years later, the very first liquid-fueled firework rocket rose into the sky under the Fafrikan rocket scientist Bobby Goddy Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EY-5 D96, United States of Aferica\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah Kerman stepped onto the lot. A junkyard. \u0022So this is the scrapyard. Dangit dad, you promised me a factory!\u0022 Jeb looked up at the sky, and saw the Mun and a little flickering Minmus. His brother Bob, his brother Bill, and his sister Valentina all followed him out of the truck. There was a nice medium sized house on the lot. The four Kerbals loaded the cardboard boxes onto the cart, and pushed it into the house for unpacking. The house had a decent living room with a couch, a television, and a few chairs. Jeb\u0027s father really rather liked having visitors. There was a kitchen, and five bedrooms, and a study. Jeb wasn\u0027t interested in the study. He let Bob have the study instead. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob decided to take a look into the study to see what books his father left for him. A few astronomy textbooks, a full set of the Encyclopaedia Kermanica, and a few science fiction stories. He saw a drawing on the table. Bob looked at it, wondering what it was. It appeared to be a rocket engine. But this was no little toy rocket. Going by the scale on the page, the rocket engine was a full meter wide. \u0022Woah.\u0022 Bob said, staring at the drawing. He looked at the drawing behind it. A full rocket fuselage section. He flipped through further. A few fuselages and engines were strung together from top to bottom. \u0022Three stages\u0022 Bob whispered to himself The drawing had in big bold words \u0022Mun Rocket\u0022 written on it. Bob studied the unfinished drawing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis father--Jason Kerman--was a big fan of astronautics and the possibility of Space Exploration. He usually saw Duna and Jool as better goals than the Mun. He taught his kids all about astronomy and aeronautics and rocketry. He was a high-school friend of Wernher von Kerman, another huge figure in astronautics, and once met Bobby Goddy Kerman for a drink. He was an aeronautical engineer for C7 Aeronautics and Locomotive Works Company, before quitting his job to work on the principle of rocketry. He built his first Liquid-Fueled rocket that marched past five kilometers. He wanted to get one big enough to take pictures of space, but he knew he would need a bigger rocket than the half-and-a-bit meter diameter fuselages that were being used at the time. So--just before he passed--he was working on concepts for a larger rocket fuselage. The Fuel-Tank-800, and an engine to go with it, the Launch Vehicle Test-15.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob was a scientist. He could help only with theory. He couldn\u0027t build a sandcastle without giving up, let alone a rocket. Jeb was the idea man, and not afraid to get his hands dirty. Bill was the engineer, having gotten a degree as a birthday gift from one of his friends. He was an idiot in almost every way, except he could put things together perfectly and figure out why they didn\u0027t work if it didn\u0027t. Valentina was more about coming up with practical applications for these machines which the other three were so enthralled with creating. A machine that can make things cold, she once said, would better be put to use in equatorial homes and buildings rather than as an industrial skii-park generator. Their patent-pending Extend-O-Maxx joint would not be practical on doors as it would be on large robots. Of course, she knew what a rocket would be used for. She looked up through the sun-roof, listening to the other three discussing their engineering plans to build off of their father\u0027s design...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn\u0027t long before they had assembled a test mockup of the engine. Using not much more than scattered pieces of junk that were not being used, the LV-TP15 prototype thruster stood on a thrust structure, upside down. Jeb, Bill, Bob, and Val all hid in a makeshift bunker while Jeb pressed the pump start button, followed shortly by the ignition cartridge button. A few sparks spat from the motor as the cold, white oxygen gas bubbled out of the rising alcohol pool in the engine bell. Jeb pushed the button again, despite the others begging him not to. The engine\u0027s nozzle extension exploded as the rocket ignited successfully, while the rest of the engine continued producing thrust for about 30 seconds before the fuel ran out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter reading the industrial pressure dial, the thrust of the rocket exceeded 180 kilonewtons. Valentina was already running through the phonebooks and newspapers, trying to find a use for this high-power thruster. That\u0027s when she saw it. An advertisement for workers for an industrial project just across the continent. She read it aloud to her brothers. \u0022Wanted: Laborers, Pilots, Technicians, and Inventors for a Kerballed Space Program effort.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina looked into more detail about the Kerbal Space Program, finding a news article from a few months prior about the start of a public Fafrikan Space Agency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Kerbal Times\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Kerbal Times\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESHERMAN ROCKET SCIENTIST FOUNDS AFERICAN SPACE PROGRAM\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Sherman rocket scientist Wernher von Kerman, the inventor of the LV-2 Bomber Missile, pushes for a Kerballed Spaceflight Program in the United States of Aferica.\u003C/em\u003E \u0022We\u0027re going to go to the Mun in this decade, not because it\u0027s easy, but mostly because of just how difficult it is and always has been.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe space program administrators have claimed that any company which is able to produce a valid space exploration technology will be given the industrial resources to extend their manufacturing, including the capability of in-house specially built components. \u0022We don\u0027t want \u003Cem\u003Ejunk\u003C/em\u003E flying into space.\u0022 says PR manager Walt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah picked up the phone and dialed a number. \u0022Hey, this is Jebediah Kerman, head of Jebediah Kerman Junkyard...\u0022 he paused a bit to think. \u0022... and \u003Cem\u003ESpace Ship Parts\u003C/em\u003E Company.

The Steam Locomotive. The Rocket Motor. Revolutions in transport. Because of the wheel, Kerbals were able to transport goods between villages and homes to shops. Because of the steam train, Kerbals could transport goods and people across the planet. The rocket engine created a vast empire spanning the Kerbolar System. But Kerbalkind had sort of stopped past Eeloo. There wasn\u0027t anything else for trillions of miles. Sure the thought of colonizing the depths of the outermost wilds was attractive, but impractical. A rocket would have to be several orders of magnitude more powerful and efficient than anything within reason to get a Kerbal colony ship to another star system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESammi Kerman was used to people underestimating her intelligence. She had ideas that made sense in her head, but she couldn\u0027t communicate them. Thus, she had a heck of a lot of trouble getting a grant for her experiment. She got all of her materials from cheap sources, like the Jeb Kerman Jr. Junkyard and Advanced Machinery Company. Finally she managed to complete her machine. It was meant to be a more efficient form of television. It didn\u0027t work like that at \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E. As a matter of fact, it didn\u0027t work as a television at all. But something definitely wasn\u0027t right. When a certain irrational number was plugged in to the input, it began to move. Something was not right at all. It seems as though it was breaking the rules. When the power was boosted, she narrowed down \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E what was happening. It was \u003Cem\u003Emoving\u003C/em\u003E. Upward to be precise. But there was no thrust. She tried interfering the machine with a supermagnet, with no effect. So a magnetic force was ruled out. It worked in a near vacuum chamber. It worked underwater. There was only one way to figure out what was \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E causing the effect. She\u0027d have to put the device in \u003Cem\u003Espace.\u003C/em\u003E Deep Space is the only place where there isn\u0027t stuff. No strong gravitation, no atmosphere, and no magnetism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe brought the device to the Kerbal Space Center. Without speaking much, she turned the device on. She showed the Kerbal Space Program Administrators the device and its motion at a scheduled appointment. She then passed a supermagnet by it. The device didn\u0027t change at all. She dropped the device in water, and they all watched as it rose out. She didn\u0027t have a vacuum chamber on hand, but she showed a video of the device working there as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022it definitely seems to be moving without thrust.\u0022 one said. \u0022But we don\u0027t have the funds right now to risk launching some unknown device into space without payment. And from the looks of it, you don\u0027t have much money.\u0022 another said. A third nodded his head. \u0022Sorry, Miss Sammi.\u0022 Sammi left, feeling sad and a tad bit embarrassed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor weeks, she did nothing, but every day she thought about the machine and how it needed to be tested. Finally she became fed up. She was going to call one of her old friends. His name was Zeffy Kerman, and dealt with black-market rocket parts. Real cheap stuff, not government regulated, and definitely not \u003Cem\u003Eactually\u003C/em\u003E space grade. For only a few \u003Cem\u003Ehundred\u003C/em\u003E funds, Zeffy would be able to provide Sammi with a rocket capable of launching \u003Cem\u003Efive\u003C/em\u003E of her devices into orbit. She jumped at the chance. Calling the Jeb Junior Junkyard, she ordered the parts for the spacecraft to hold one of her devices. The final design would cost only two thousand funds. It was time to break into her retirement funds. Any sane Kerbal would never dream of this. Sammi may not be entirely sane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFive weeks later, her rocket was assembled in an old grain elevator. She brought a cargo of camping supplies in case she landed somewhere dangerous for a while, and climbed into the cramped used Sescnah cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff. The rocket rose into the sky, with a few sputters of sparks coming from the nozzle. Second stage is cut. She\u0027s now in orbit. Stabilizers up. Running perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spacecraft, which had been christened \u0022Krakensbane,\u0022 was now ready for the test. The device was activated. The most confusing part was what happened next. Kerbin very rapidly vanished into the distance. Krakensbane flew across the skies. Sammi took control. The stars seemed not so far away now. The sun vanished to a point. Sammi steered the ship towards the nearest star. She didn\u0027t think this would happen. She didn\u0027t know \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E she was flying a junk spaceship to another star using a broken television that disobeys the rules of physics using a power source comparable to a microwave oven. She supposed that bringing her camping gear was a good idea after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENearing the star, she found a planet on the map screen. It was un-named, uncharted, and undiscovered.
