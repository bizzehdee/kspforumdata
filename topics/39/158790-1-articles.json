This would be the third time today that my focus has been broken as I attempt to finish my news paper. So I stand up and head to the door expecting yet another farmer or local attempting to sell something to me when I instead see what I did not expect to see; a well dressed gentlemen. He wore a black suit with a rounded bowl cap carrying a slick black suitcase to match. As I continue to approach the door I ask \u0022How can I help you sir\u0022? He clears his through and tells me \u0022I am here on behalf of one of your relatives who sadly just past\u0022. I looked stunned as I know the majority of my family are already dead. I asked him who and he said, \u0022A Gus Kerman\u0022. \u0022I\u0027ve never heard of \u0027em\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 I then open the door and usher him in and he then explains that he came to provide me with Gus\u0027 will. \u0022What\u0027d he leave me?\u0022 I asked, and that\u0027s when he opens his briefcase and pulls out\u00A0a sheet of paper. \u0022The legacy of Gus Ivan Kerman has set forth to his sole remaining relative, his entire wealth, profits, and property\u0022. I stare at him for a few moments before finally asking \u0022So what does that leave me?\u0022. \u0022That would leave you with a large sum of wealth and three pieces of property, specifically the Kerman Mines, Drysands and his estate\u00A0east of Labrek\u0022. I know the Kerman mines are they were a hotspot not too long ago for mining activity for those who wanted wealth before the mines were closed for unexplained reasons, however I had never heard of Drysands nor of any estate in that area however I knew Labrek as an old town that used to be a hotspot for activity before people started moving elsewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 Then I finally focus on the part that I was most interested in, I ask, \u0022How large a sum?\u0022. That\u0027s when he raises one eye brow and replies, \u0022a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E large sum\u0022. That\u0027s when he truly peaks my interests and I ask him \u0022So how or when do I get access to this?\u0022. \u0022You will receive all keys and grants to the properties in the mail in the next few weeks and as to the wealth, that\u0027ll come as a\u00A0check for you to give to your local bank\u0022. That\u0027s when I see him lean down and put the sheet back into his briefcase before standing back up and replying \u0022Is there anything else you\u0027d like to know before I head off? Any other questions or concerns?\u0022. To which I answer \u0022None. You just made me very happy, \u0022I certain I am\u0022. I then open the door for him and watch him walk back towards the road where he came.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 Once he leaves eyesight, I head into my study and search for my existing maps of the local area and begin scanning them for the location of the two properties the man mentioned. I quickly find Kerman Mine, which is located just north west of Labrek. With the location and nearby markers memorized, I then begin to scan all my maps for \u0027Drysands\u0027. I\u0027ve never heard of it\u0027s name nor anything like it having lived my entire life in highlands and grassland. There\u0027s a quarry south west of town, however it\u0027s nearly a weeks trip by horseback. The maps I have say that it goes by a different name which makes me think that it likely isn\u0027t it. Then I come to conclusion if I can\u0027t find it then there must be someone who can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 So I grab my brown leather hat and\u00A0throw it on and head out and\u00A0jump atop my horse,\u00A0Moho. Then I quickly head off\u00A0towards Kerman\u0027s mine. The trip took me the majority of\u00A0the remaining day and\u00A0I arrived at the property fence line at just before sundown. There I could see the large hill that is Kerman\u0027s mine. With the entrance being a boring stone entrance with some wood planks bordering the sides. I knew this was once the sight of a large bolstering \u0027Kold Rush\u0027, back when Kerbals from all over used to flock to get some kold, a metal which is easily malleable and is used in a lot of structures as it\u0027s\u00A0capable\u00A0of supporting large structures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0I consider hoping over the fence and peering it but I know I likely wouldn\u0027t be able to see much without proper lighting seeing as the mines has been abandoned for nearly a century. So as I climb back onto Moho, I see another Kerbal approaching. I turn to them and say \u0022Strange to see someone this far from town and into the forgotten areas\u0022. That\u0027s when he tells me, \u0022I actually live not to far from here and I heard you approaching so I decided to come check was going on, since we don\u0027t often get much traffic noise\u0022. \u0022I actually just headed down here from my homestead since apparently... I just inherited this place\u0022. That\u0027s when I see his gaze shift from the mine back to me as he says\u00A0 in surprise, \u0022Really\u0022? \u0022Apparently so\u0022. Then after several minutes of silence he says \u0022Well if your considering reviving the mining activity here, I wouldn\u0027t advise it\u0022. I turn to him in look in shock and ask \u0022Why shouldn\u0027t I?\u0022. \u0022Well for one the mines dry. Thieves drained it years after the owner shut it down...\u0022 His comment hung unfinished for several minutes before I answered back \u0022and for another\u0022? \u0022Secondly, kold isn\u0027t the drive anymore\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u0022Then what is?\u0022 I ask. \u0022Ore\u0022. \u0022What kind?\u0022, \u0022Oil saturated ore, school kids down south have finally found a use for the stuff to make power and flying machines apparently\u0022. \u0022Flying machines? What kind of flying machines?\u0022. as far as I know of, there is nothing that can get off the ground for longer than a few seconds in the time it takes to fall so\u00A0his statement surprised me. \u0022Apparently machines that can ascend into the sky atop a flame, however from what I\u0027ve heard they haven\u0027t gotten far\u0022. \u0022Why not?\u0022, \u0022They explode\u0022. That was the last comment between us before there was a long silence as I sat and thought on the events of the past few hours. Flying on a flame? Only thing I knew that was remotely similar was a crazy old man who attempted to fill a barrel full of explosive powder and tried to have it fly, but like these machines, it too exploded. Not to mention that I\u0027m also rich. My life is made, but yet I have this guttural desire for more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 Finally, with the sun\u0027s light dimming as the last of the beams of light shine through the leaves of the surrounding trees, I ask \u0022Ever heard of Drysands?\u0022. I turned to look back at him and I could see him thinking hard, \u0022No... don\u0027t believe I have... I have heard there is a quarry south of us\u0022. \u0022I\u0027ve checked my maps and according to them, that isn\u0027t it\u0022. After that we didn\u0027t say much. Time went by and nothing but silence was said between us. When the last of the light left us, so did he as he must of headed home. Soon after I did too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 The following morning I again returned to the road, but this time into town in search for the local library. I figured that if there\u0027s written record of my \u0027Drysands\u0027 property, it\u0027ll have to be in a library. Granted the town library was in poor condition and hasn\u0027t gotten many new books and such in quite a well, but maybe still it will have a lead. When I arrive at the library, I see that it is indeed in poor condition as the building has several areas where the wooden structure is clearly falling apart\u00A0and is experiencing rot. As I enter I see the librarian approach me, \u0022How can I help you... Mr...?\u0022. HIs question annoyed me as I rarely liked to mention my name as it was the subject of ridicule from everyone who hears it. I tell him it\u0027s\u00A0\u0022Burger Kerman\u0022 and immediately he starts to chuckle and the sound of it makes me cringe in pain as it reminds me of many other times when people had done the exact same thing in the past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 I was not proud of my name. Having not known my parents long, I wouldn\u0027t have a clue they were thinking having named me this. There was no where I could go or anyplace I could hide to avoid the awful name my parents gave to me, however in time I learned to accept it and move on. The acceptance of it, did not ease the aggravation that came with the constant chuckling and laughter that followed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 So to break his constant chuckling I asked him, \u0022So do you have any maps I could look through? I\u0027m searching for a property that I can\u0027t seem to find\u0022. This thankfully breaks his humor which then led to him taking me to the map section of the library where he told me \u0022We\u0027re a bit bare, however this is all we have. I hope it helps\u0022. I quickly poor through the maps around me, searching every detail and name listed on them however I never find anything by the name. I found a few locations by the name of \u0022Dry Gulch\u0022 or \u0022Drybeds\u0022. I waste hours pooring through what must\u0027ve been nearly a hundred separate maps of locations near and far. I search so far into the depths of the maps that I even find parts of the world I never knew existed. Despite this, I find nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 So I return home, with nothing to return with. Questions raced through my mind. What should I do with the money? What should I do with the mine? Where is this \u0022Drysands\u0022? Where is the estate? Despite my best efforts my mind keeps returning to the question of what I should do with the money and soon I decide on a plan of action. I would take the money and open a business to drill for this new kold I\u0027ve heard of. If thieves and kold rushers can take all the good out of my recently acquired mine, then I\u0027ll find my own wealth hidden in the ground. All I can do now, is wait for everything to arrive so I can begin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 But then I realized at the very end; I had struck it rich, and without having done anything. I felt satisfied but I knew that it wouldn\u0027t last. What I truly longed for, was the wealth that awaited me if this business turned the same profit Kerbals did in previous years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Episode 2:\u00A0Ore Runs Deep\u0022 coming soon...\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
