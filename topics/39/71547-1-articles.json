He lives in orbit around Kerbin where he\u0027s constantly ready to seduce unsuspecting Kerbonauts as they go on EVA, and they invariably give in and embrace him within a minute of his appearance in their vicinity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of yet, no Kerbal has been able to resist him. This is bad, because he\u0027s also very dangerous. As soon as a lovestruck Kerbal approaches the Great Naked Space Man for a kiss, he removes its helmet and causes a rapid decompression of its space suit. His victim dies in his strong, manly arms from asphyxiation, and he then proceeds with consuming its soul before he vanishes into the blackness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, over a dozen Kerbals are confirmed to have perished at the mighty hands of the Great Naked Space Man, and Kerbal souls are believed to be his favourite food as well as the source of the strange, hunky glow that surrounds his flawless body. Numerous attempts have been made to improve the safety for spacewalking Kerbals, including the development of increasingly complex locking mechanisms for helmets, but unfortunately, he has outsmarted Kerbin\u0027s finest engineers every single time. He could open even the world\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s most complex helmet in a mere 69 seconds, and it looks like there\u0027s no real way to beat the Great Naked Space Man besides staying inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pf96yE7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pf96yE7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-06T12:37:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2014 12:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Felsmak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T13:10:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am so confused.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T13:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EErrrrr....
