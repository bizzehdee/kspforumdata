Forum user ghostbuzzer7 and I are collaborating on a video of sorts for KSP Version 1.0, and we need your screenshots!  \nAnything that gives a sense of adventure, or discovery, or the journey you\u0027ve had in KSP is what we\u0027re looking for. We hope to get this done before 1.0 hits the ground, so if you\u0027re interested, I\u0027d suggest submitting something here ASAP.  \n  \nVideo will be posted here upon completion.  \n  \nEDIT:  \nVideo Complete! Thanks to all who submitted their images, and enjoy!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T17:01:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 05:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starwhip**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T00:01:26Z","Content":"Alright, I have 54 images for inspection:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
