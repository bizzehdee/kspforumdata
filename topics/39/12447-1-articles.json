Nothing reached the orbit,\u0027 answered Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027And you will bring it there!\u0027 - the Chief Engineer pointed to the three Kerbonauts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027YES!!!\u0027 Jeb was really excited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Can\\\u0027t this be done by unmanned crafts?\u0027 asked Bill hoping for something safer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027After all these crashes because remote controlled crafts lost contact or autopilot did some stupid things like detaching the satellites during ascent, we can trust this project only to experienced crew like you,\u0027 answered the Engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027As if I could do this better,\u0027 thought Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027They barely can get a satellite up and want us to get a station there...\u0027 Bill didn\\\u0027t like the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027This will be lot of fun,\u0027 smiled Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA large station was rolled out of the VAB. There were rumors that the parts come from at least 6 or 8 different manufacturers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was just a test on the pad, there was even no launch vehicle, but the pod with the crew was installed. In the moment the crawler released the station it fell apart destroying half of the modules. The escape tower pulled the pod up and crashed into the launch pad tower. The pod fell back on what remained of the station and damaged half of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Can a test on the pad be cooler?\u0027 asked Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe workers collected the remaining modules and took them back to the VAB. Half an hour later the reassembled station with some more struts was standing on the pad again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027At least it didn\\\u0027t fell apart,\u0027 said Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027It doesn\\\u0027t guarantees that it will survive the launch,\u0027 Bill wasn\\\u0027t so optimistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027So boring...\u0027 murmured Jeb and pressed the abort button. The escape tower crashed into launch tower again, the pod fell on the station and destroyed half of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027That\\\u0027s better!\u0027 smiled Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027What was that?\u0027 asked shocked Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Again...\u0027 gasped Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the station was fixed and prepared for the launch, the primary crew was offered another mission. They boarded a powerful rocket and started preparing for launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027What is this part? It has no part type icon? And here are two more,\u0027 asked Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I think I saw something new on the rocket. There was something written about power,\u0027 answered Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027A powercell? let\\\u0027s try activating one!\u0027 said Jeb and pressed a button. A satellite detached fell on a booster, deployed solar panels, tipped over and crashed in the pad damaging one of the wiglets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027At least now we know what was that and what we were supposed to do,\u0027 said Bill looking out of the window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027SL-18.52, this is mission control, what happened?\u0027 a voice came from the communicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Nothing special,\u0027 answered Jeb and pressed the launch button. The rocked started tilting, but Jeb managed to make it fly straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027That\\\u0027s not for long\u0027, said Bill estimating how balanced the rocket is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 10 km Jeb finally lost control and pressed the booster separation button. 6 liquid stacks started their flight along the craft, but 2 of them crashed into the remaining satellites, destroying most of the orbital craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Cool fireworks!\u0027 said Jeb looking at the remaining boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027At least the pod and the chute aren\\\u0027t damaged. What were you thinking about when launching an unbalanced rocket?\u0027 asked Bill and pressed the chute deploy button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Remember the Shuttle last week?\u0027 answered Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027And why didn\\\u0027t they install the escape tower?\u0027 asked Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Wasn\\\u0027t this emergency separation the best way to do this?\u0027 replied Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Better look there - they are rolling the station out again,\u0027 said Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Without us?\u0027 Jeb wasn\\\u0027t happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs they splashed down the engines of the rocket on the pad ignited. But nothing happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I knew this type of the rocket isn\\\u0027t powerful enough for so large station,\u0027 said Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I wouldn\\\u0027t just stay there\u0027, said Jeb. This very moment the boosters separated and destroyed the station. The escape tower pulled the pod to the ocean and detached... by destroying the chute. The pod splashed down and sunk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027That\\\u0027s cooler,\u0027 said Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027If you want to do this yourself, do it without us\u0027, Bill replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Why are you so boring?\u0027 wondered Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next morning a new rocket with the station was standing on the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Don\\\u0027t mess this again or we won\\\u0027t send the recovery craft!\u0027 said the Chief Engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Okay...\u0027 Jeb wasn\\\u0027t happy with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I\\\u0027ll control the staging this time,\u0027 said Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Then press ignition and let\\\u0027s go!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Thirteen engines, will they bring us luck?\u0027 stated Bob as the rocked leaved the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027CECO,\u0027 said Bob 30 seconds later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027There shouldn\\\u0027t be CECO. That engine is the third stage!\u0027 answered Bill. \u0027Who messed the fuel flow?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Why did they mess it without my help?\u0027 asked Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yes, the lines are reversed! And here\\\u0027s stage 2 cutoff,\u0027 said Bill and called the mission control: \u0027KSC, this is KSS. The fuel lines are reversed, we can\\\u0027t reach the orbit this way!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Roger that. We\\\u0027ll fix the reserve craft. You are free to abort the mission.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Roger that,\u0027 replied Bill, disabling the first stage and separating the return vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Boring. Why didn\\\u0027t you make some boom of it?\u0027 asked Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027If you want to make a boom, do it without us\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen they returned to the control center there was report from the next station crew:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027KSC, this is KSS. We are in orbit.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Hurray!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027But we have a problem.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027What really?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027We used all the RCS fuel to stabilize the orbit. The station is almost uncontrollable\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027The next craft will deliver the fuel. You can proceed with the experiments\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027The station has no power\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027How?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027We accidentally deployed the solar panels in the atmosphere and they fell off.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Okay, return to Kerbin\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027We can\\\u0027t, we spent the return vehicle\\\u0027s RCS, too.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027What about the life support? does anything work?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Couple little solar panels for the life support survived, so it still works.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Okay we are building a module that will deliver the fuel and the panels. The help is coming.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Jeb, that\\\u0027s not funny. What are your smiling at,\u0027 asked Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Guess who will fly that rescue craft!\u0027 answered Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GabrielG.A.B.Fonseca","CreatedById":13436,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-10T17:10:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaha!
