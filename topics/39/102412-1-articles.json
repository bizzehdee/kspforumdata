The Helicarrier is a primary inspiration in the Kraken\u0027s development as well, and I\u0027ve already been down that road. Better Buoyancy is great for making buoyancy calculations more accurate, but it won\u0027t magically make things float if they don\u0027t already.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) It can land anywhere with just three engines using [Throttle Controlled Avionics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107802-Throttle-Controlled-Avionics-2-2-0-0-90-Continued) ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nDid not know about that one, good find! Though it was less a question of if it can take off / land (at all), and more a specific question of interplanetary capability. HX HPDs pack a punch though, so I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if you could in fact fly it right off Kerbin and out to Laythe.\n\nProbably not wise to do so until it\u0027s seaworthy though.\n\nAnd Roninpawn, sorry for semi-hijacking the thread, that is an awesome piece of work you\u0027ve created as well. Love the train of thought: \u0022Movie? Man, forget the movie, I just want to try building that in KSP!\u0022\n\nAnd also, for some reason it never occurred to me to tweak engine thrust to help balance VTOL engines (or remove horizontal engines from the VTOL equation).
