The only rule, is that it has to be stock. To send this craft to me, just post the craft file and photos here. Also, if it is a difficult craft to fly, give me some flying instructions. Videos are recorded whenever I can, and then I will post the links here, and tag the person who I made it for. I\u0027ll make sure to put your forum name, a link to this page, and a link to your forum page, in the description of my videos. If anybody is interested, leave it down below! I am also willing to do revisits, if something changed.

I would be very selective and do not show a craft if you think it is bad and do not promise to review peoples craft. There are people here who think they deserve awe and admiration and will post a link to their thread and then blow up when you don\u0027t do anything with their submission which probably didn\u0027t even obey the rules in the first place. If I was you I would put some rules in place straight away like the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117920-scf-home-base-7815-spacecraft-friday-next-maintainer-yargjay9991/\u0022\u003ESpacecraft Fridays\u003C/a\u003E thread (and some people have blown up at that when their genius was not immediately recognised) and make sure every submission gets a reply with those rules.
