ITS ARMSTRONG TIME! and, i failed , and failed again, and again, and then, i failed again, but then, i landed in 2 of the most kerbal situations, my rocket ran out of fuel, and only my command pod survived, so Jeb 6,7,8,9,and 10 were sent to save them, and, as you probably have guessed, all of them failed, and i slowly made adjustments to the rocket, i added solar panels, i added ore processing, and radiators, the less said about Jeb 7 the better. but on Jeb 10, i landed, and i was so far away, one of my Kerbals died trying to get to the rocket, so i sent it closer, and, died somehow...probably the kraken. but then on Jeb 11, came the great crashining! the game crashed! no parts loaded! nothing was spared! the culprit? i think i was \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, probably one of the ten mods i downloaded. before that i only had infernal robotics, i had a great idea of a landing leg from IR, but then i discovered the fact that the landing legs didn\u0027t rotate form the attachment point. so i left for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso the conclusion of this story i probably will be continuing is, if at first you don\u0027t succeed, its probably the fact that you haven\u0027t thought enough, or too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\njust read the instructions! like the name of one of the SpaceX barges!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
