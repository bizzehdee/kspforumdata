I just depleted my 2,000\u002B science by unlocking another 20% of the tech tree, which is now over 80% unlocked. I try never to do a mission unless a contract is offering me money for it, which is why my administration building has strategies in place that take well over 50% of my funds to yield extra\u00A0science and reputation.\u00A0Minmus is my main science bank, but I\u0027ve nearly bled it dry by now, so the Mun is my source of emergency science. I can land 1 Kerbal on either the Mun or Minmus for just $35,000 per launch, and if I hop around on Minmus 2-3 times I can multiply my science gains. (I try to make my launches as cheap and efficient as possible. I try not to clip parts, but my rockets are, I think, still fairly aesthetically pleasing.)\u00A0I launched two probes that successfully entered orbit, and transmitted science back from,\u00A0Eve and Ike. I have a Duna mission planned that will cost $120,000; 4 Kerbals will travel to Duna, and 2 will land and return from the surface. (Getting them back down after they\u0027ve returned will be tough -- I\u0027m considering building an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E to fetch them, since, although I have built many successful \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s in the past, I have never built one in career mode before.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy end-game will be to have some kind of Grand Tour mission. The rocket will probably cost a million or two, but getting science from every single solid body in the Kerbol system all in one launch should be well worth it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, a screenshot from a recent landing on Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002215443158_369781626709993_592008162038376\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022https://scontent.fagc1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/15443158_369781626709993_5920081620383764203_o.jpg?oh=b5e645ff86499e9d96560903472ede9a\u0026amp;oe=58E3E64B\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-18T04:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just stated Year 6 (Day 6) and $800k in the bank after building some big ships. I\u0027m in the process of shifting my focus from science and money to just plain expansion via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and the Simple Construction mod. I\u0027ve got a miner landed on Minmus and another headed to Duna, and I\u0027m starting to fear that the one headed to Duna will be stalled out because all the surface base does is mine, and I\u0027ve not got enough fuel there to lift the ore into orbit to the refinery. So, I\u0027m prepping for a fuel run from the Minmus base (which isn\u0027t quite up yet either) before the next Duna window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI probably won\u0027t make much more money in this save, as I\u0027m going to just stop even paying attention to contracts. The only ships I\u0027ll be launching will be passenger ships to send people to Minmus for eventual ejection to other places. That\u0027s the plan at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
