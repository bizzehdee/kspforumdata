I might get one, but I really want to go DIY for now... I am considering to add a simple joystick to a platform similar to this (which apparently works with KSP) to get the pull/push effect: [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:78693](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:78693)"},{"CreatedByName":"lawnmowerlatte","CreatedById":112768,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:51:54Z","Content":"I went with two three axis joysticks with the rotation mapped to forward and back for translation.

This has two reasons. No. 1 is that in reality RCS has no throttle, so you don\u0027t need analog input for translation. Second reason is I can\u0027t handle rotation and translation at once, it just puts too much stress on me. You can see my joysticks in my hardware thread.\n\nAt first I had two full joysticks where I used one twist rudder as up/down control."}]}
