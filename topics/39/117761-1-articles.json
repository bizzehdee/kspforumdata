There it was. The Great Light in the Sky. Soon the stone-faced family, running from the darkness came to serve it. Moho, the youngest and most energetic. He was ill, and resides closest to the Great Light so It can care for him. Eve, the mother of the family. She had a peculiar gray object with her she called \u0027Kerbin\u0027. Duna, the piping-hot furious member of the family and his stress doll, Ike. Dres, the outcast. Made fun of by the rest for being different and not possessing a glow. Jool, the father of the family. He usually kept himself shrouded in a thick green layer of smoke, almost hiding himself and his collection. And finally, Eeloo. He was least loved by the Great Light. He soon grew ill, and lost his glow as a result. Shortly after the family arrived, Eve had shown the Great Light her \u0027Kerbin\u0027, and It proclaimed, in a deep, booming voice, \u0027Giveth here this Kerbin, for I shall mend it.\u0027 And so It did. All of it\u0027s gray spots soon turned into vast blue waves and wide green pastures. Tall stony mountains and yellow deserts. Soon Moho, Dres, and Eeloo were jealous of what Kerbin had become. All three of them vowed to get revenge on Kerbin, and then on the Great Light\u0022\n\nThen the gong sounded.\n\nThe klergy then stood, gave a final verbal sacrifice to the Great Light, and walked out.\n\nOne particular Kerbal was mumbling to himself as he was walking to his truck.\n\n\u0022What malarkey,\u0022 he murmured, as he shut the door and started the engine.\n\n\u0022Great Light? Planetary vows? Sudden atmospheric formations? Seriously?\n\nI don\u0027t have time for this! I got a junkyard to run!\u0022\n\nHe then drove off to work.\n\n**TO BE CONTINUED...**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T12:53:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 12:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DH\\_Ocelot**"},{"CreatedByName":"DH_Ocelot","CreatedById":149355,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T14:07:06Z","Content":"**The Selection**\n\nAs this Kerbal was driving, he was talking to himself.\n\n\u0022Ah well, I\u0027m not going back there again. No matter what Val says.\u0022\n\nHe turned the radio on, and on came an emergency news report.\n\n\u0022Hello and welcome to K-EMN. I\u0027m Rich Kerman.\u0022\n\n\u0022And I\u0027m Lindsay Kerman.\u0022\n\n\u0022So, breaking story today: Two Kerbals were kidnapped from their homes last night in Karlston City. KCPD are investigating and have not reached a conclusion on either of the victim\u0027s IDs.\u0022\n\n\u0022The first kidnapping took place around 11:00 last night in the North side of town. The second at around 2:00 AM in the East end. It is unknown who the victims are, how they relate to each other, and who the kidnapper is and what his motives are.\u0022\n\n\u0022Wow, I live on the East side. I should call Val and see if she\u0027s okay.\u0022\n\nSo he picked up his cell and dialed Val\u0027s number.\n\nAround a minute later:\n\n \u0022Hello! I can\u0027t come to the phone right now as I\u0027m a bit busy. Call back later, bye!\u0022 \\*beeeep\\*\n\n\u0022Ok, uhh, hey Val, it\u0027s me, Jeb. I\u0027m just calling to check on you because there\u0027s been a kidnapping near the junkyard and I\u0027m worried. Call me back if you get a chance. Bye.\u0022\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, he pulled into the junkyard and stepped out of his truck. He entered a shack labeled \u0022Keys\u0022 and took one of the keys off the hook. He saw a sticky note on the wall. It said \n\n\u0022Jeb, I took the dumper out to pick up a new load. I should be back within 5 minutes of you reading this. -Val.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ooohh, she left her phone here.\u0022 Jeb realized. He climbed up a ladder near the shack and got into a control room and sat down. He was in the crane. He started it up and fired up the electromagnet. He then picked up some loose junk laying around and put it up on top of the large mounds.\n\nJeb shut it off and climbed down the ladder, but midway down he saw Val\u0027s truck coming. He continued climbing down. He stepped to the ground just as Val pulled in. Val stepped out of the truck and asked, \u0022Did I leave my phone here?\u0022\n\n\u0022You sure did, Val. It\u0027s in the key room.\u0022\n\n\u0022Thanks. You ready to test the rocket?\u0022\n\n\u0022You know it, Val!\u0022\n\nJeb and Val both walked to a tipped over cylinder. They pushed it up so it stood straight up. On the side in front of them it said \u0022Caution: Contains Boom\u0022.\n\n\u0022Alright, I\u0027ll be in the shack in case this thing blows up,\u0022 said Val.\n\n\u0022C\u0027mon, it\u0027s not gonna explode! Not this time! I worked out the kinks, it should fly properly now.\u0022\n\n\u0022You said that the last three times.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ok, ok, ok. Ready?\u0022 asked Jeb.\n\n\u0022Yeah.\u0022 replied Val.\n\n\u0022Ok,\u0022 Jeb lit a small match, \u00225, 4, 3, 2, 1, ignition!\u0022 He stuck the match under the cylinder and it made a loud roaring sound as it flew straight up in the air.\n\n\u0022Wooooooo!\u0022 cried Val.\n\n\u0022C\u0027mon, c\u0027mon.\u0022 mumbled Jeb. \u0022Parachute, parachute!\u0022 The cylinder seemed to have stopped in midair before falling back down. Then, a tiny cloth came out from the top and it expanded as it came closer to the ground. The cylinder landed on the ground without damage.\n\n\u0022Yeah, it worked!\u0022 screamed Jeb. Val ran out and stood next to him and they hugged.\n\n\u0022Let\u0027s go get lunch\u0022 said Val, as they turned around, heading for Jeb\u0027s truck. They saw a hooded man run at them and that\u0027s the last the saw for a long time.\n\n**TO BE CONTINUED...**\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nHey if anyone reads these and is interested in making artwork that might fit the story so far, post them in my artwork thread (link in sig).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T14:06:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DH\\_Ocelot**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T20:19:24Z","Content":"Sounds interesting, would love to make artwork but I\u0027m completely rubbish at that sort of thing, can\u0027t wait to see more.\n\n(oh, and this may sound stupid, but is there a Jeb \u0026 Val ship here?
