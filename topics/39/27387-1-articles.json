But kethane is more like oil on Kerbin. Fuel, industry, everyday objects are made from it or at least it\u0027s needed as catalyst. And sources of kethane on Kerbin are running thin and new ones are not being found. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for the first time in kerbal history there is kethane crisis starting and it\u0027s predicted that in 20-25 years there will be no precious gas left. There is no replacement for it so people, goverment but esspecially kethane union (richest mining companies on the planet) are now looking with hope towards real space program with the main goal - find ethane, mine it, bring it to Kerbin. Observations from Kerbin\u0027s surface so far revealed that there is possibility that there can be sources of kethane on Mun.

What stronger reason that goverment\u0027s KSA should need. They need resources and brains for completing such a epic-scale task. Especially after the totally failed first flight. And that was supposed to be only sub-orbital short flight. Goverment offered so far 3 companies to join the KSP. All of them are top in their fields of business. Of course it\u0027s very hard and innovative work for all of them but it seems to work well so far. KSP is progressing and second attempt is planned on December. Not only sub-orbital flight but stable orbit and EVA during that. First time ever of course. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short - KW Rocketry and Robert Kerman\u0027s Space Indrustries are working on long term job - getting heavy-duty unmanned cargo ships on orbit and designing and putting togeather first Kerbin International Space Station (since all those companies are from different countries).
