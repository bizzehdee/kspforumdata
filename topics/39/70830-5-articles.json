They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re probably going to launch the real mission sometime in the next couple of months.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThough we mustn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get too complacent,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb pointed out. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe fact that they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve done all those tests means that they should be able to build another rocket straight away.

What would happen if the CKFN managed to make it to the Mun first? The current wildly positive public opinion of the Space Program may vanish if the USKK didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t paint itself as a leader in space exploration. And once the public left their side, so would the backing of their (somewhat shady, Bill had to admit) corporate friends. Without money, they couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t launch missions, and without those, why, it just devolved into a negative feedback loop which could end in a hundred different ways, none of them good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re the Director, Jeb,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bill said. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat should we do?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering his options silently for a minute, Jeb then spoke. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CFirst of all, modify \u003Cem\u003EUranus IX\u003C/em\u003E.

Keep the crew capsule, but beef up the fuel supplies, and get Danbro cracking on making a rocket which can take it to the Mun. Finally, schedule a press conference.

This is now, and I need to hear how \u003Cem\u003ECaelus IV\u003C/em\u003E is coming. The Advisory Council certainly can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t revoke our funding if we do launch first, now can it?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlashing a wry grin and withdrawing the screwdriver from the engine module, Dilbrett began listing the mission\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s components. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe \u003Cem\u003ECaelus\u003C/em\u003E capsule is nearly complete, final vacuum checks are being done as we speak. Its launcher appears to have developed a small problem with the starboard fuel flow; fortunately that \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be an easily solvable problem, the turbopumps just need readjustment. I estimate we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be able to launch on schedule.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGood, good. Have you solved the power issues? I recall the first \u003Cem\u003EJanus\u003C/em\u003E needed several kilowatt-hours of batteries. That won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t last the whole trip to the Mun. Did you get the solar panels to work in a vacuum yet?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDilbrett\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s brow furrowed, as he unconsciously turned the screwdriver over in his hands. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CUnfortunately, no. We are still dealing with outgassing in hard vacuum. The R\u0026amp;D wing is researching alternate sealants but they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re coming along slowly. Fortunately, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got a prototype fuel cell which should fit our needs well enough. It doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t output much power, but it should be able to sustain \u003Cem\u003ECaelus\u003C/em\u003E on its way to the Mun.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CExcellent, and how about \u003Cem\u003EJanus\u003C/em\u003E? How\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s its construction proceeding?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C\u003Cem\u003EJanus\u003C/em\u003E itself is complete. In fact, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s proven so easy to build, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re thinking of constructing a whole bunch to put into orbit. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s talk about linking them all together and using their shared fuel supplies to move massive payloads.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking about the size a Munar lander would have to be, Danford was glad his Engineering team was looking that far ahead. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s your ETA on the launch?

We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re using the same lifter design for both this time, so no more polar launch sites nor SRBs. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s such a well-used design, the chances of anything happening are really quite negligible. In fact, this has really shown off how standardized lifter designs really speed up the process of launching, not to mention the safety benefits. If we began Project \u003Cem\u003EJupiter\u003C/em\u003E, we could have a whole \u003Cem\u003Efamily\u003C/em\u003E of lifters, not just the one!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CEasy there.

Perhaps when \u003Cem\u003ECaelus IV\u003C/em\u003E has returned it might be worthwhile to look into building some larger rockets. We \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E have to send an entire lander to the Mun, after all.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CVery true.

Guard duty here was a tremendously boring occupation; nothing of note ever happened on the border, least of all at night. At least he could look at the sky. The stars were visible above the trees surrounding him, and away from the bright lights and bustle of major CKFN cities, they shone especially bright. His attention was currently skywards, wondering about what might lay beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, he heard a noise from the woods, a strange crackling and rustling. Immediately springing to attention, he gazed out into the darkness beyond his post\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s spotlights. Seeing nothing, he leaned back in his chair, but remaining mindful of his surroundings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe noise returned. It sounded almost like an animal dragging itself through the underbrush. Sitting bolt upright, he reached for a pair of binoculars and twisted a dial on the side. This supposedly enhanced their image at night, but all he found it did was decrease the contrast and turn everything a sickly shade of green. Still, every little bit helped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter warily searching the darkness for the source of this strange noise, he found it. A kerbal stumbling his way through the forest, who appeared very, very lost. From the style of this figure\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s clothes, he evidently hailed from the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSKK, but they were so torn and covered in dirt you could barely see what colour they originally were. This kerbal must have dragged himself through the USKK\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s barbed wire perimeter fence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalbin quickly pulled his jacket around himself, and put on his helmet. He needed to get down there and see what this kerbal wanted, be it good or bad. A thought occurred to him, and he grabbed his service revolver and slipped it into his holster, just in case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClimbing down the ladder of his watchtower, he approached the gate. The mystery kerbal had slumped against its bars, looking disconcertingly like a prisoner. Calbin grimaced. Based upon some things he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d heard about the USKK, that particular description of the wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t terribly inaccurate.

Still, he seemed unlikely to fall into unconsciousness any time soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurning away from the kerbal for a minute, Calbin went to his locker, where the manual on how to deal with such scenarios as this was stashed. Flipping through the pages, he found the chapter he was looking for: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153\u003Cem\u003EDefection Directives: What To Do When the Other Side Comes To You\u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe leaned against the wall and began reading. Fortunately, it was a short chapter, outlining the basic procedures of what would happen next. All he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d have to do was radio his commanding officer, and the authorities would soon arrive to pick his charge up. The kerbal would be collected and debriefed (naturally, one would want to get as much information as they could from the defector), then the kerbal would be integrated into mainstream CKFN society, under a new name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be a bit of a turbulent time for the poor kerbal, but judging by his state, Desdin was used to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7ittO0xt.png\u0022 alt=\u00227ittO0xt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECFKN:\u003C/strong\u003E Space Facility \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOne day later\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/02f1yyi.png\u0022 alt=\u002202f1yyi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t believe it.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYes, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve said that already, Bilvin.

The door looked more like an entrance to some sort of highly fortified bunker, with multiple locks and reinforced hinges, complete with a hand-lettered sign stating: \u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDO NOT OPEN\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, after what seemed like hours, the locks were undone and door opened up, revealing the developer, carrying a stack of photos. The largest ones he displayed at the front of the room, while a few smaller copies were distributed to the crowd. Immediately, there were \u003Cem\u003Eooohs\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Eaaahs\u003C/em\u003E from everyone upon seeing the photos; this was the Mun, and while it \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E look an awful lot like a large potato someone had let fall into the dirt, these were the best photos of this celestial body anyone on Kerbin had ever taken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2aoHCZR.png\u0022 alt=\u00222aoHCZR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven more interesting were the images of the Far Side; while only illuminated partly by the sun, one could clearly see the increased number of craters and scarring caused by the Mun basically acting as a shield for Kerbin from the cosmic hailstorm of meteoroids and their ilk. There was even a long canyon snaking its way across the surface. Gusbin wondered what that would look like from the surface. Imagine the geological processes which must have taken place to produce such a distinctive feature!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cCtqYI0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cCtqYI0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGusbin even let his mind wander a bit, imagining himself standing on the lip of that canyon, seeing its grey walls slope downwards.

For the first time since joining the Programme, he keenly felt that their goal was near. The fact that they got these pictures was proof that they were close. While Danford hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t revealed anything official, talk abounded throughout the Space Facility that work was soon to commence upon the rocket that would take kerbals to the Mun.

He appeared to be in a very good mood, he was leaning back in his chair and smiling, two rare characteristics of the kerbal. Joliana continued, she\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d oblige him for as long as this mood lasted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell sir, I believe the main problems with the engineers stem from both guilt for the destruction of \u003Cem\u003EUranus IX,\u003C/em\u003E and the poor administrative policies enforced on them so far. You took care of some of that guilt, by replacing it with pride, but they will need something to strive for in the long-term. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not entirely certain of the specifics of what that should be, though.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CInteresting.

Danbro was only a symptom of a larger problem; we need to fix the lack of support the engineers have been getting at its source, or we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll just get more *Uranus IX*s.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI agree with you on both counts, Joliana.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bob then raised an eyebrow. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHowever, we can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t exactly just march up to Bill and ask him to change those policies. For one, Bill doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even have that authority. Any changes will have to be extensively negotiated with the Board of Directors, as well as making sure the budget is balanced with our accountants, etc. Besides, Bill would have a fit if he knew I was pushing for such dramatic policy changes. No, it will have to be something else.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYes sir.

Surely it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not beneficial to the Program if one of its senior members is unable to change its policies?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell, the kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s never liked me much to begin with, but with the recent loss of Jebediah and the chaos consuming the Program, I actually think he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s afraid I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll take over. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s why he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been assigning me these tiny jobs, in the hopes that it will keep me distracted.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell, to be completely honest sir, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve seen the efficiency at which you complete those tasks.

Making any direct policy change, such as the ones the engineers want, takes a whole lot of negotiation with accountants, the Board, and many other departments to make sure everything is in order.

Upon them was the early version of an official request to open this new division. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI first had the idea a couple of months ago, based upon your employer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153recommendation\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. From there, I simply tweaked the idea of a separate division to best suit our needs. And there we have it, the salvation of the Space Program. Today\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s trip to the engineers was to make absolutely sure that they would be totally receptive to this plan.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAnd I presume they were?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COf course!

What if there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nothing new to learn in rocket science?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 While in favour of the scheme, Joliana tried to poke any hole in it she could. If this new division flopped (or was vetoed by Bill), USI would be \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E annoyed, so Bob had to be prepared for any eventuality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this, Bob grinned. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COh, I have my sources, primarily among those techs in Werhner\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s labs.

The Director\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s authorization will give us all the clearance we need to open up the new division.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHow on Kerbin are you going to get Bill to approve this?

If I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know you were doing this for USI, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d think you were starting your own private space program here.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhich is why I need you to translate it into something a little less readable, preferably full of very long words, so that Bill won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even bother to read it. He\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been so busy lately, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d be surprised if he had time to get through one paragraph.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CVery well sir, I will get right on it.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo days later, Joliana approached Bill Kerman outside the Administration Facility. The Director was freshly returned from the capital and looking very tired and harried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMr. Bill!

What is it?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe engineers need authorization to open up a new dedicated testing division of the Space Program. They say it will prevent accidents like the one on \u003Cem\u003EUranus IX\u003C/em\u003E.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThat sounds like a good plan. How\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s it being funded? Will I have to talk to the accountants and work out a budget for the division?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CActually, no. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s taken care of, as you can see here, on Page 12.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill leaned closer, taking a look at the paragraph in question. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAh yes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6I, er, see.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The Director was obviously having difficulty deciphering the meaning of the words Joliana had enlisted one of her lawyer contacts to write. Finally having enough, Bill straightened. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell, I, uh, presume everything else is in order; I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll authorize it.

Then, he set off again towards his office, leaving a very pleased kerbal behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImmediately after talking to Bill, Joliana joined Bob in the VAB. A makeshift podium had been set up, and the kerbal was preparing to make a speech to all the engineers, who were gathered together in the main assembly chamber, among various rocket bits and pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a sense of pride, Joliana spoke. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m pleased to report that Bill signed the document, sir. The Advanced Projects Division is now officially authorized. The timing worked spectacularly; Bill was in such a rush that he didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even read the fine print.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNot that he would have found anything; your legalese was most impressive. Now, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time to share the good news with our crowd.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob walked to the podium, greeted by cheers from those who remembered his speech a few days ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan for this speech was to reveal the new division, or the Advanced Projects Division, as it was called. Had Bill had not signed the document, Bob would have had to speak more inspiration for the engineers to continue their work, while frantically drafting an alternate plan to achieve his goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHello, all!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bob spoke into the microphone. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m pleased to report that myself and my colleagues of the administration have heard your complaints and are in the process of brainstorming solutions as I speak!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineers, already pleased by Bob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s return, began cheering louder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe first and foremost solution is as follows. As of this moment, the administration is opening the Advanced Project Division, a subset of your work here in the VAB. Its primary focus will be to research and develop new rocket technologies. No longer will you be forced to work with discarded tech from Werhner\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s labs, or have to do all your testing on your own; this new division will provide everything you need. Now, all you have to do is what you do best: put rockets together!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe largest cheer yet greeted Bob\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s words. Joliana smirked. The engineers had been ignored and patronized for so long that they were \u003Cem\u003Eoverjoyed\u003C/em\u003E when someone actually listened to their concerns. They would be loyal to Bob for a long, long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, for all that kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s talk about not preferring the spotlight, he handled this sort of thing very well. Indeed, Joliana had been surprised when USI had made her the assistant of this seemingly quiet, unassuming kerbal in the Space Program. She\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d argued that providing USI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s guidance would be a waste and that even if Bob would lack the authority to carry the advice out. However, she was never as happy to be proven wrong as he was today. With the access to space launch facilities and technologies granted by this department, USI would be able to finally mount some sort of defence against the CKFN\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s military\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s previously-unrestricted access to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoliana would be keeping a close eye on Bob in the future; the kerbal had nearly single-handedly managed to turn a nearly untenable situation into a win for all parties involved. That sort of skill would be very dangerous if ever directed against her and USI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s own interests. Still, a new dawn approached for the Space Program; while a tremendous amount of work still awaited everyone, the USKK was back in the race to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/u7rcFGB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u7rcFGB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I\u0027d like to apologize for the extreme wait between Chapters.
