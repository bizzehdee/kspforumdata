This extraordinary mission is the first step in the US Government\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Mars Exploration program using the new Z-51 interplanetary orbiter. But there is a darker purpose for the moon flight. It is also the first step toward the militarization of space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Upon arrival to the moon, the spacecraft is hit by the solar wind from a coronal mass eruption. The crew\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s courage, discipline and resourcefulness is tested the fullest extent as they struggle to return the wounded spacecraft back to earth orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E During a death defying reentry, the ship loses all of its navigation equipment. Harris, a seasoned aviator from the USAF, is forced to perform visual navigation and landing into Portland, Oregon International Airport while hurtling through the sky at twice the speed of sound. Unfortunately poor weather combined with failing flight control systems force Harris to ditch the spacecraft into the Columbia River. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The shaken crew barely survives the ditching and searches the local area for human contact. They immediately discover that Portland, Oregon has changed in unimaginable ways. Volcanic eruptions along with earthquakes have shattered the area\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s infrastructure while killing most of the local population.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The few remaining survivors are locked in a struggle for survival where basic necessities like food and clothing have become highly prized resources that are fought over by warring factions. With no rescue in sight, the hapless astronauts struggle to survive during a hard winter while lost in the ashes of the forgotten city.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T17:20:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t seem to be a KSP fanwork, so I\u0027d assume it goes better in off-topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I\u0027ll be on the lookout for it.
