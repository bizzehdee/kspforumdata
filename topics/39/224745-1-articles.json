Dull, lifeless, and bland. Winds blew and whistled, storms rumbled and churned, but there wasn\u2019t even a semblance of something reminiscent of a bird singing or a wolf howling at the moon. Boulders and slabs of rock lazily dotted the rusty sands that covered this world, but there were no trees, no rivers or lakes, no wild animals searching for food. Nothing could survive in this frozen desert wasteland.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yet, there was an allure to the void of life. An unscathed world, entirely devoid of the influence of biology and biochemistry, left to the whims and mercy of geology. A world which never dealt with root erosion, oxygenation events, or chalk deposits. A world of untampered silence, a world with a purity never before experienced by a living creature. This ethereal quiet and peaceful serenity of the Duna landscape, untouched and pure for billions of years, was birdsong in and of itself, and nothing could ever shatter its sterile tranquility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECLANG, CLANG, CLANG!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 \u201CAgh, you lousy good-for-nothing bucket of bolts, WORK already!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is, until the kerbals found it and began colonizing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qZycFMK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002289.67\u0022 height=\u0022673\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qZycFMK.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy some means, either through skill, tenacity, or dumb luck, the kerbals managed to establish a permanent presence on Duna. There were multiple small outposts erected on Duna\u2019s surface. They were self-sufficient, though they all relied on the support of eachother to prevent shutdown-- one base was good at extracting water from the soil, one base was skilled with refining radioactive materials, one base was capable of assembling rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis base, the PREcious MInerals and Exotics REfinery (PREMIERE), had the capability of refining many resources-- iron, silver, water, even gold. This majestic facility, a testament to the skill/tenacity/dumb luck of kerbalkind, happened to be the longest-operated permanent establishment of several on Duna\u2019s surface. It was comprised of 4 primary structures: a habitation tower, an ore collection tower, a logistics/refinery building, and a majestic solar array tower to keep it all powered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022caMiPJT.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002268.50\u0022 height=\u0022592\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/caMiPJT.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wasn\u2019t easy to forget how impressive such an accomplishment and feat was, but Sidnie Kerlin, one of the few engineers operating the skeleton crew at PREMIERE, managed it anyways.

Since he was in the water refinery room, overseeing machinery extracting water from raw ore, he was attached to the same building the sieve was, and probably heard Sidnie\u2019s attempts at percussive maintenance and/or anger management. \u201CIs the sieve fan stuck?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidnie sighed, collected her bearings, and spoke into the intercom, \u201CNo, it isn\u2019t-- listen, the sound and whatever caused it is not important right now.

She could brew a cup of tea, that usually helped her calm down.

Usually, she worked at PREMIERE, seeing as her master\u2019s degree was in geological engineering, perfect for a complicated base involving machinery and rocks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mission wasn\u2019t abnormal (she often found herself going on maintenance trips to fix some poor tourist\u2019s rover whose tires shredded themselves on a rock), though this was certainly one of the longer ones she\u2019d had to perform via rover. If she didn\u2019t need her equipment and repair arm, she would\u2019ve just hailed a propellor plane to take her there in fifteen minutes. Though their speed and convenience were valuable assets somewhere as barren as Duna, she could probably have found one that wasn\u2019t in use for anything important. Alas, it was not meant to be, as how else was she going to bring at least six projectile percussive maintenance tools?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe packed a few days\u2019 worth of rations, perfect for 130km of driving. The service rover was a solar-powered rover that slept as she did, unable to drive for very long in the night before running out of battery, and thus the trip took much longer than it would have with a fancy nuclear rover. That\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not like she could\u2019ve driven 6 hours a day without some sleep anyways. A 2-hour long sleep was more than enough for her, and she continued as soon as the sun appeared over the horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter another hour of driving, she finally caught sight of the rover in question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yzwaiIC.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002272.25\u0022 height=\u0022775\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/yzwaiIC.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidnie didn\u2019t usually have to send maintenance trips to unmanned logistics rovers.

Ah, of course, dangerous goods like this weren\u2019t really put on SSTOs because pilots often benefitted from a high degree of stupidity that often was inconducive with the safe delivery of things like explodium or nuclear waste.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zwIYA3E.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002273.50\u0022 height=\u0022796\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/zwIYA3E.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf which this rover happened to be transporting both.

It also stated the suspected cause was computer troubles, so she\u2019d start there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidnie steered the rover to align it next to the logistics rover and set the parking brake. The maintenance boom\u2019s servos whirred quietly as they slowly maneuvered themselves to lower the chair at the end to a reachable position as Sidnie commanded with the controls. She put on her suit and exited the airlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo possibly save herself some work, she did a quick walk-around of the derelict logistics rover, and inspected for physical issues, inspecting and scrutinizing every detail she could.

Comms looks good from the outside.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidnie crawled down underneath the rover and began inspecting its undercarriage for signs of damage. \u201CDrive train looks fine, though a bit rusty. Axles fine too. Suspension looks okay, but front left tire needs some repairs soon. Steering looks okay.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidnie stood back up and went down the mental checklist of things to work on next. Unfortunately, all signs pointed to her having to check the rover\u2019s navigational systems, causing her to mumble, \u201CSoftware. Figures.\u201D and conjure mental images of incompetent programmers playing video games instead of fixing some obscure edge case she now had to deal with.

The constant chopping whir of the propellors as they spun at several hundred revolutions per minute resonated through the craft. The sleek solar panels on the spine of the low-mass plane constantly refuelled the aircraft\u2019s generous batteries, allowing it extended flight times whilst the dull sun filtered through the dusty atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts massive wings spanned over a dozen meters, despite its resemblance to a malnourished pelican. Duna\u2019s thin atmosphere required such a wingspan to have access to higher altitude regimes and make rescues on desolate mountains, Sidnie noted. This craft was a marvel of engineering-- a fast, agile rotor-powered plane on Duna of all places. Though, she\u2019d have more time and mental energy to properly appreciate the craft\u2019s majesty had her ankle not been Killing Her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, what were you doin\u2019 all the way out there?\u201D said the paramedic, trying to make small talk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe paramedic, a Minmusian kerbal by the name of Edlin Kertop, had managed to quickly load her into the cramped interior of the craft after landing. The ambulance plane\u2019s interior space was miniscule: a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003Ecot\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E next to the hatch in the back which Sidnie laid on, and a swiveling seat next to the front window which Edlin sat. The rest of the interior space was littered with various first aid supplies, including the splint being used to keep her fractured ankle straight. She\u2019d recieve proper medical attention in Russet Skies, but for now this would keep it from further damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidnie expressed her disdain for Duna\u2019s resident engineers, saying, \u201CAll the kraken-posessed engineers on this kraken-posessed planet were too lazy to fix a rover, so I went out to go fix it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CnM7brI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002289.92\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/CnM7brI.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdlin nodded. \u201CI see.

The craft\u2019s horizontal velocity was cancelled by clever control of the plane\u2019s attitude as Edlin tilted it to and fro. The plane descended from its vantage point in the sky, and Russet Skies came into clear view through the front window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LycgDrn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002289.92\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/LycgDrn.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEasy does it\u2026\u201D Edlin mumbled to himself. Sidnie wisely let him focus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs she looked at Russet Skies, Sidnie noticed one interesting trait. The loading/unloading pad (designed for VTOLs like this one, no doubt) was obviously not large enough to comfortably fit this large aircraft. How was Edlin expecting to land it there? She could estimate the pad\u2019s size by eyeballing it, and if the plane landed on it diagonally, it could fit, maybe. Potentially. Assuming all goes good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAh, hmm.

Edlin also survived without injury.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo Edlin\u2019s credit, the plane successfully landed on the helipad, though notably one of its wings was truncated and its propellor had careened off into the distance. The other propellor had its blades stripped by collision with the helipad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve arrived!\u201D Edlin said cheerily after several seconds were taken to process the event. \u201CNow we can get yer ankle fixed up in the medbay.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidnie sat there, stunned. \u201C...Of course.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past century or so since Jebediah Kerman landed on the Mun, kerbalkind\u2019s technology had rapidly accelerated as individuals from around the world studied the sciences and made unprecedented alliances with their enemies for the common goal of exploring the stars. This led to a massive leap in medical sciences too, as kerbals studied methods of preventing and treating injuries and illnesses in the harsh environment of space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncredibly, broken ankles were relatively quick fixes-- a bit of open surgery, a dollop of bone repair formula, a bit of lasering to set the formula, and some patching up, and your bones were as good as new (with, of course, a recommendation to go easy on your new ankle for a few days). It was only a few hours after she woke up from the surgery, and she was already capable of going home if she really needed to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, she didn\u2019t need to (nor necessarily want to) make the trip all the way back to PREMIERE to continue her infuriating and tedious job.

This wasn\u2019t something Sidnie often got to see in her little boring refinery. Sure, rovers came every now and then to pick up the stuff PREMIERE made, but they were usually automated. Crew transfer only really came when people went on leave, quit, or were hired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt got pretty lonely out there. No people.

Edlin was there eating some sort of salad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdlin looked up from his meal, and gave a friendly, \u201CHowdy!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey, Edlin!

Nobody can sit in the unmanned cargo plane, so it obviously couldn\u2019t\u2019ve been illegally boarded. Plus, they must know the identity if the cameras caught someone leaving Russet Skies and boarding the plane. So, obviously, none of that happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what else? Did someone stick a cockpit in the cargo bay? That makes no sense, someone would\u2019ve noticed it, and it would\u2019ve had to come from somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat leaves pretty much one option, and that\u2019s that someone is remotely accessing and controlling the plane. She looks outside at the window where the plane once was.

The Head of Public Safety knew, obviously, since this was all on camera, so she didn\u2019t feel the need to head up to his office. Instead, she felt the need to do something insane about it.

I might get on the news.\u201D She then punched in the frequency used for taxi planes, such as the one just outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAh, uhm, be safe, alright?\u201D Erlin responded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidnie didn\u2019t respond, because she was already on the phone. \u201CHey! You! Taxi pilot. The one outside Russet Station. You there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh, yes? What can I help you with? I want to take a shower at Russet so I might be a bit.\u201D How convenient, Sidnie thought to herself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidnie asks with a neutral tone, \u201CCan I steal your entire plane?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe taxi pilot replies, \u201CPffft! Hah! Yeah, right, sure. That\u2019s a totally reasonable thing to suggest.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBingo. \u201CNo takesy backsies,\u201D Sidnie replies with a smile, and hangs up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing public airwaves, this was recorded by Russet Skies\u2019 traffic control. Therefore, it was effectively in writing. Contracts have been signed over radio like this before, though not usually accidentally like this. If it came to court, she could claim that he signed a contract saying she could steal his plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe quickly heads downstairs to the airlocks, puts on her suit, and heads out the airlock, slowly limping over to the plane. She climbs into the cockpit (abandoned due to the taxi driver taking a shower), straps herself in, and examines the controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlying a plane should be easy, right? You just use the knobs and dials and levers and switches to keep speed and angle in check. She could think of it like resource flows. Speed is energy, energy is a resource. She has to manage the resource and make sure it doesn\u2019t go so low that the plane stalls or so high that the plane overheats. Drag is a resource you don\u2019t want if you want to go fast. Point prograde to drain this resource, but you\u2019ll lose your upwards velocity if you don\u2019t nose up. Great, fine, easy. Easy peasy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe flips the switches necessary for takeoff. Stability assist on. Engine mode: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Throttle up-- woah that\u2019s a lot of thrust throttle down right this instant. She sets the navigator to fly in the same direction the cargo plane flew off to, switches the engines to flight mode, and throttles up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HMaE5FL.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002289.92\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HMaE5FL.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wIpLHRc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002289.92\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/wIpLHRc.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgnore the fact that Russet Skies keeps moving around, it\u0027s accidentally exploded approximately 5 times now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Might do a second pass over this chapter and rewrite it a little, I\u0027m not too proud of my writing here\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-05-31T21:47:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2024 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022May 31\u0022\u003EMay 31\u003C/time\u003E by LittleBitMore\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
