Jool-Mother then performed its escape burn and, while it was transferring to Jool, VL-50 de-orbited and landed back at KSC. Sometime later, shortly before entering Jool\u0027s SOI, Jool-Mother released \u003Cem\u003ELander 1\u003C/em\u003E on an inclined orbit to intercept Bop. Lander 1 established orbit around Bop then Jool-Mother aerobraked at Jool and again at Laythe, where it released Lander 2, which established orbit there. Jool-Mother left Laythe on transfer to Tylo. Meanwhile Lander 1 landed on and re-orbited from Bop then transferred to Pol, Lander 2 landed on then re-orbited from Laythe then transferred to Vall.

Sequential-numbering just doesn\u0027t do it for me, as you have to look all over the place for the next number. Parallel swim-lanes certainly work well for showing multiple craft and all docking/undocking/staging requires is lines that split or converge on nodes. It may be that showing specific \u0027manoeuvre\u0027 rather than \u0027body\u0027 nodes works better for position ... that\u0027s my next experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ezriilc","CreatedById":34556,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T16:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve started a repo on GitHub here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Ezriilc/KSP-Mission-Overview-Generator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Ezriilc/KSP-Mission-Overview-Generator\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now it\u0027s nothing but an empty shell, and it will likely change drastically in the beginning, since we don\u0027t really know where we\u0027re going just yet.
