View full album](//imgur.com/a/xnqxC)\n\nFrom F[ocke-Wulf Triebflugel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Triebfl%C3%BCgel) to [Mil V-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil_V-12), I have been reading up on wacky/highly advanced rotary wing concepts from an earlier age of aeronautics and wanted to build a crazy rotorcraft of my own after seeing members of a [KSP Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/324560547661780/) have a go at creating models of turbo-shaft engines. \n\nTo keep part count down, I decided to use the Fw Triebflugel\u0027s rotor-tip engine setup and try my hand at replicating the twin rotor configuration of intermeshing rotors used by the [Kaman K-MAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaman_K-MAX). This would give me all the fun of trying to make a twin rotor setup work without the massive bulk of the V-12\u0027s huge wings and struts. \n\nI then added stub wings to my copter, again an idea borrowed from old Russian cargo helo designs with wings to off-load the rotor system during high speed cruise - this is crucial for KSP as the 62.5cm parts I used have a limited load capacity (about 6 tons for each 62.5cm docking washer, before it will shear off under load regardless of how many struts there were).\n\nWithout further ado, here\u0027s what Airwolf on Kerbin could look like with B9 aerospace parts and a engineering philosophy of moar rotors ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/yrgLMPRzuGA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n[The craft file can be obtained from KerbalX](http://kerbalx.com/crafts/1306)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T15:31:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 03:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T14:44:50Z","Content":"The vid is borked"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T14:56:49Z","Content":"The thumbnail doesn\u0027t seem to work, which is strange because they appear fine when I published it.
