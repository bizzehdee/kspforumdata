This one is so far my crowning glory - its an Apollo style mission profile for Mun and Minmus stuff. I named it \u0027Jool V\u0027 as a hat-tip to the Saturn V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe video is mostly just to show the design, and how it works in each phase of the mission. I figured I would show it here in the hope that maybe some newer players might get some ideas from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, this is a career mode flight, I\u0027m using KW Rocketry, B9 Aerospace, Ferram Aerospace, there might be a Nova punch part in there somewhere -- And Deadly Reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull Disclosure: There is a mechjeb installed, I like to use it for its Delta V display and for orbital info mostly - This mission was entirely hand flown though,except for the last few kilometers of the rendezvous because end up being in the dark, and was making me freakin batty! Normally I\u0027m really good at that, but yikes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, here ya go - and remember, this is not an \u0027entertainment\u0027 type of video - its just a show-off, I tried to cut it as short as reasonable while still showing all flight phases.
