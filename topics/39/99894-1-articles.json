I know there has been some great fanwork in the past, but I confess I am totally unfamiliar with it. Any recommendations? As they\u0027ve been developing the art I really love the idea of humble beginnings, that Jeb and crew (please let there be 3 guys and 3 gals) start a tiny space company on a farmland junkyard and bravely careen their way into history. Of course players will be writing their own stories, just as players of TES and dozens of other games do, but developing a genuinely compelling and fun backdrop and structure really helps people enter a world. Thats what I\u0027m interested in. What are kerbals like as beings? What drives them? What scares them? What are their personal relationships like? Any thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T04:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this intended to be a suggestion for inclusion in the game?
