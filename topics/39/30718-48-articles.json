His gaze travelled slowly over the great Arches, each symbolising one of the six Regionalities of Kerbin, each anchored by two of the smaller, but still impressive, out-buildings given over to the administration of that Regionality. Four of the Arches were grounded in the light spilling from every ornately carved doorway and every arched window. The Wakiran and Firesvarn Arches were grounded in darkness, staff recalled to other administration centres on another continent. \u00A0The evening sun threw oddly angular shadows from the statues decorating the nearest out-buildings and the flag of all Kerbin drooped listlessly against its pole, as if cowed by the flaming evening sky. Across the great central Dome, a gap-toothed chequerboard pattern of brightly lit office windows stood out against the twilit stonework.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman sighed and went back inside, nodding briefly to the guards as he walked past. Head down, deep in thought, he strode along the corridor and up the stairs to his chambers. Retrieving the coffee jar from where he\u0027d abandoned it on Corsen\u0027s desk, he busied himself setting a fresh pot on to brew. For a long minute he stared at his red-eyed, haggard reflection in the mirror by the door. Then he shook his head and walked through to his office in search of eyedrops, casting a weary glance at the stack of old books on their cart as he went.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome time later, moister of eye and fortified by hot caffeine, Donman carefully set his empty mug down on the edge of his desk before pulling on a pair of white archivist gloves and opening the leather-bound book in front of him. Delicately, he turned the yellowing pages until he found his bookmark, placed the square of silver filigree on its stand, and began to read. For the next couple of hours, he worked his way steadily through the book, pausing occasionally to jot down a note or look up a cross-reference in another, equally old book. Eventually he pushed his chair back, rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands, and swore feelingly under his breath.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECan\u0027t invoke Article 24 without declaring for one side or the other or declaring against another Regionality altogether. The Emergencies and Global Unity Act looks like it\u0027ll be useless unless we can broker a ceasefire. I don\u0027t have a Right of Conclave because I\u003C/em\u003E am \u003Cem\u003EConclave.\u003C/em\u003E Donman set his jaw, reached into his desk drawer and found a sheet of headed notepaper and a fountain pen. He paused then, reluctantly took out a \u00A0small hand press, a sheet of thin wax discs and his seal of office. Setting them to one side, he uncapped his pen and began to write.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe hadn\u0027t got any further than a perfunctory \u0027Dear Mr President,\u0022 when his phone rang. Groaning at the blinking red light under its keypad, Donman pushed his letter away and picked up the receiver. \u0022Mr President?\u0022 He frowned, nodding impatiently at what he was hearing. Then his eyes snapped open. \u0022They did what? Commander Valentina survived? Thank Kerm for small mercies. But where in the seven smoking \u003Cem\u003Ehells\u003C/em\u003E were those planes? I thought they were under orders to keep to Wakiran airspace at all costs?!\u201D Anger rapidly turned to consternation. \u0022Fifty kilometres south of the border? We can prove that?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman sat bolt upright in his chair. \u0022That\u0027s ridiculous! The second Fleet are under strict orders to remain within the Jhazi Straits and surrounding coastline! Chadwick and Aldwell know the trouble we had getting permission to sail through Veiidan waters - what in all the Blighted Groves do they think Wakira and the Confederacy would do if we sent Gusden any \u003Cem\u003Efurther\u003C/em\u003E west? That fleet is there to secure our medical relief operations - end of story!\u201D A bleak expression settled on his face as he listened to Obrick\u2019s reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t think we have a lot of choice. We promised medical aid to any kerbal involved in the fighting. If our relief workers need to go armed in order to protect themselves, then so be it.\u0022 He listened intently for several long minutes then fell silent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wakira, Mr President,\u0022 he said at last, propping his forehead on one sweating palm. \u0022We offer succour to all but we stand with Wakira.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe laughed shortly at Obrick\u0027s reply. \u0022One of the few ways we could, although I doubt anyone will be any more receptive to tales of sapient Kerm then they were last time, especially after an Article 24 declaration. What\u0027s that? No - apart from Article 24, it seems the only guaranteed way to force a session of the Twelve Pillars is for one Pillar to be impeached... or to resign.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a long pause. Donman glanced at his seal of office lying on his desk. \u0022I hadn\u0027t got much further than the usual pleasantries\u00A0before you so kindly interrupted.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EShred that damn letter, Don. We can talk about that once we get out of this mess and even then you\u0027d better hope you can write faster than I can.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely led the two legalists up the hill towards Jonton\u2019s hut. One of them raised her eyebrows at the three stacked rings braced against the Kerm trunk and the ropeways winding between them. The second just nodded and murmured something to his taller colleague. Enely caught the words \u2018Sage of Barkton\u2019 and smiled to himself.\u00A0The front door opened and Jonton stepped outside to greet them, leaning heavily on his walking stick. Both legalists did a swift double-take before recovering with an obvious look of embarrassment. \u201CForgive my surprise, Keeper,\u201D the shorter one said diffidently, \u201Cbut I was led to believe that you were\u2026 indisposed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CI was until very recently.\u201D He gestured at his stick. \u201CAnd I\u2019m looking forward to the day I can leave this behind. But please - come on in.\u201D He hobbled through to the kitchen where Meleny and Thombal were waiting with Gerselle around the table. Once everyone was seated, a cup of fresh coffee or \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E in front of them, he found a convenient spot against the wall and leaned back with a sigh of relief. \u201CI hope nobody minds if I stand here - I still find sitting for any length of time uncomfortable.\u201D\u00A0 He looked at the two legalists, gathering his thoughts.\u00A0 \u201CHow much did Erlin tell you?\u201D he asked at last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Almost everything I believe,\u0022 replied the senior legalist. \u0022Including a digression into some significant breaches of established Grove law, although there I am informed that you have special dispensation from Chief Ambassador Donman.\u0022 The tone of her voice stopped politely short of outright disbelief. She ticked the main points off on her fingers. \u0022You are about to engage in an...undertaking at Gerselle Kermol\u0027s Grove. Yourself and Gerselle have a daughter, Joenie. You believe this undertaking may be hazardous to the adult kerbals involved and therefore wish to register Meleny and Thombal Kermol - and the Kerm of this Grove - as Joenie\u0027s guardians.\u0022 Meleny and Thombal nodded solemnly. \u201DFinally you wish to give both Meleny and Thombal power of attorney to speak on behalf of the aforementioned Kerm.\u0022 She coughed. \u0022I must be honest, Keeper - I\u0027m not sure I completely understand your last request.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s straightforward enough,\u0022 replied Jonton, \u0022but neither Gerselle, Elton or myself were sure about the legal technicalities.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Elton?\u0022 asked the second legalist. \u0022Pardon me, Keeper but I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve met an Elton Kermol. Or should that be Elton Kerman?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Neither name suits him very well,\u0022 said Jonton calmly. \u0022Elton is the Kerm of this Grove and he\u0027s looking forward to meeting you both. If everyone has finished their drinks, we can go through.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe led the skeptical looking legalists through to the sleep room and waved at the rows of bunks. \u0022Please make yourself at home. All the bunks are much the same so pick any one you like. We can bring extra pillows through if need be. Once you\u0027re comfortable just rest your head against the leaf clusters and Elton will take it from there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth legalists looked startled at that. \u0022You want us to Commune with the Kerm?\u0022 one of them said doubtfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I do,\u0022 said Jonton, \u0022Once you\u0027ve both had a chance to talk to him, I\u0027m hoping you can find some legally binding way for him to grant Thombal and Meleny power of attorney to speak for him in mine or Gerselle\u0027s absence. We\u0027d also very much appreciate some advice on writing him into our wills.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe senior legalist raised her hands. \u0022As you wish, Keeper.\u0022 She nodded at her colleague. \u0022We shall see what we can do for Guardian Elton.\u0022 She smiled faintly at Jonton\u0027s surprised expression. \u0022It\u0027s been many decades since I was kermol, Keeper but I was always taught that \u00A0the Kerm were guardians of the Groves.\u0022 She walked over to the nearest bunk, lay down and, propping a pillow under her neck, tipped her head back into the waiting leaves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time Jonton joined them, Gerselle, Thombal and Meleny had already paid their respects to Elton and had moved quietly back, to let him speak to the legalists without distraction. The Communion crackled with intense curiosity, awe and a barely suppressed excitement. Elton stopped in the middle of a sentence and Jonton sensed his sudden regard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;good afternoon, Jonton\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EGood afternoon, Elton. I brought the legal advisors whom Erlin recommended.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;yes, I have been speaking to them. They think very clearly and do not fear new things - we will need more kerbals like these\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA brief sense of sorrow washed over Jonton but was swiftly replaced by fresh excitement from the senior legalist. \u003Cem\u003EThis is incredible, Keeper - we apologise for ever doubting you!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENo apologies necessary,\u003C/em\u003E answered Jonton. \u003Cem\u003EIf anything, I should apologise for being quite so cryptic but Elton can speak for himself far better than I can speak for him.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAnd I would speak with him for much, much longer if he has the time. For now, I can assure \u00A0you that it will be a straightforward matter for him to grant power of attorney to Thombal and Meleny. A simple declaration in front of everyone here and then we can sign the agreement\u003C/em\u003E bel-oncordaan, \u003Cem\u003Ethat is, outwith one contracting party, witnessed by myself and my colleague for Thombal and Meleny and yourself and Gerselle for Elton.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThank you\u003C/em\u003E, said Jonton gratefully. For a long minute he turned inward, sensing the ebb and flow of emotions through the Communion link. \u003Cem\u003EOur undertaking at Gerselle\u2019s Grove, he said at last. How much did Erlin tell you about it?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EVery little\u003C/em\u003E, came the answer. \u003Cem\u003EHe didn\u2019t think he was the best person to talk about it although he did assure us that it was of the utmost importance.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIt is\u003C/em\u003E, said Jonton simply. \u003Cem\u003ETo cut a very long story short we think we can awaken Gerselle\u2019s Kerm in the same way that Elton awoke from mine. And if we can do that for one Kerm, we can do it for all Kerm.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a stunned silence. T\u003Cem\u003Ehat would be\u2026 wonderful\u003C/em\u003E, said the legalist at last. \u003Cem\u003EI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think I have the proper words for what it would imply.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETo be honest, I\u2019m not sure I do either,\u003C/em\u003E said Jonton. \u003Cem\u003EBut from personal experience I do know that awakened Kerm could mean an end to the Law of Territory. \u003C/em\u003EHe waited expectantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBut that would mean\u2026\u003C/em\u003E Wild hope flared across the link. \u003Cem\u003EPlease tell me that means what I think it does?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIt does\u003C/em\u003E, said Jonton quietly. \u003Cem\u003EI \u003C/em\u003Eknow \u003Cem\u003Ethat Kerm do not need to fight amongst themselves. If we can awaken them and speak to them, we can explain the danger that the Seeding puts all of us in. And if we can do that, then\u2026 then we may be able persuade them to draw in their territories - and so create enough room on Kerbin for all the Kerm yet unplanted.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sudden maelstrom of emotions churned the Communion link to near insensibility. Instinctively, Jonton tried to damp them down, Enely and Gerselle hastily following his lead. Then Elton came forward, a vast, calming presence helping everyone regain control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;we can speak of this later. For now, tell me what words I must speak to guard my Joenie\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two legalists conferred for a moment and then, hesitantly, spoke to Elton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;very well\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E Elton paused, absorbing the unfamiliar language. \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;then I Elton, Guardian and Kerm of this Grove, do hereby grant Thombal Kermol and Meleny Kermol, jointly and severably, the rights and responsibilities to speak for me in all matters pertaining to the guardianship of Joenie Kermol and the estates and worldly properties of Jonton and Gerselle Kermol. Let any of those present, state their disagreement with no fear of coercion nor fear of censure nor fear of reproach\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll seven kerbals remained silent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;Then by the laws of Grove, Enclave and Council, as we have spoken, let it be done\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026Nordham Bay. Firesvarn air support was severely impeded by defences around the town itself and by anti-aircraft fire from the Kolan 2nd Fleet commanded by Admiral Gusden. We don\u2019t have accurate casualty numbers but losses are thought to be moderate to heavy depending on who you ask; pilot losses significantly less so.\u201D The Chief of Fleets cleared his throat. \u201CFiresvar, predictably, are pointing to this as evidence of Kolan aggressive intentions. Kolus - equally predictably - point out that the Firesvarn aircraft were defeated by defensive facilities, installation of which has now been shown to be fully justified.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe grim silence around the table was broken by the clink of glass on lacquered wood. President Chadwick blotted his lips before tucking his handkerchief back into his pocket. \u201CWhat of the Firesvarn fleets?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Northern Ocean situation remains unchanged, Mr President. Forces in the Wakiran Ocean are on high alert but so far as we can tell, Firesvarn efforts there remain focused on increased coastal and near-coastal patrols in an attempt to intercept any Children of Kerbin vessels.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo we have any indication that they\u2019re operating any further afield?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Chief of Intelligence glanced at her colleague who dipped his head in reply. \u201CScouting operations only, Mr President,\u201D she said. \u201CPurely systematic at present with nothing to indicate that they\u2019re specifically watching ourselves, Doren or Wakira. Formally, I have several reports of violations of our territorial waters - to which we\u2019ve turned a carefully blind eye.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorried faces and angry murmurs rippled around the table. Chadwick contented himself with a nod. \u201CVery good. And what of the Children of Kerbin? Do we have any new information there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder the table, the Chief of Fleets\u2019 knuckles turned white but his voice remained unruffled. \u201CNo, Mr President. We watch for them of course but we deem Doren, Kolus and latterly, Firesvar to be of greater concern at present.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNaturally, \u201C Chadwick replied. \u201CAnd likely to remain so.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAcross the table Chief Ambassador Aldwell pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201CFor how long, Mr President? Our sympathies to the Children\u2019s goals, if not their methods, are well known. What happens when a Firesvar scouting patrol finds something that we cannot conveniently ignore?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresident Chadwick raised his eyebrows. \u201CThen we will of course lend any assistance we can, although Firesvar will understand that our resources are stretched very thinly. However, I believe we have made our opposition to unsanctioned Kerm planting perfectly clear and I trust that Firesvar will remember that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EErbabar-beldaonerba ebda berot pilla,\u003C/em\u003E\u201D somebody muttered.

The literal translation is \u2018words possessed by those they rely on for words are half-truths\u2019. Or in plain Kerba - the words of diplomats are but half-truths.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI fear I do not see your point,\u201D said Chadwick politely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldwell sighed. \u201CMy esteemed colleague is correct, Chadwick,\u201D he said reluctantly. \u201CWe aren\u2019t overtly supporting the Children but neither are we overtly opposing them.\u201D His voice turned grim. \u201CWakira\u2019s inability to prevent the Children\u2019s incursions was sufficient pretext for Firesvar to invoke Article 24 against them, triggering\u00A0 a war which Kolus has now been dragged into. How long before our inaction provides a similar pretext?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThank you\u003C/em\u003E. The Chief of Fleets\u2019 hands relaxed for the first time that meeting. Carefully, he brought them above the tabletop, poured himself a drink of water and took a sip. \u201CThat would be my concern also, Mr President.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Chief of Intelligence nodded. \u201CWe would also run the risk of providing a common enemy for both Firesvar and Wakira combined, possibly supported by Kolus.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that, a clamour broke out around the table. Chadwick watched impassively, weighing his options. He let the clamour subside before tapping his glass on the table for attention. Gradually the room quietened as all eyes turned towards him. \u201CSo what would you suggest?\u201D he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVeiid,\u201D said the Chief of Intelligence bluntly. \u201CWe reach out to Veiid and, through them, to Doren proposing an alliance against the Children. With Doren on our side, we can persuade Firesvar that there is no further need for them to trespass on Confederacy territory.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadwick\u2019s eyes bored into hers. \u201CWhilst betraying our people\u2019s most deeply-held principles?\u201D he said quietly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Chief of Intelligence didn\u2019t flinch. \u201CNo, Mr President.

If we find any Children operating from the Confederacy we deal with them sympathetically whilst reaping the diplomatic benefits of preventing further unsanctioned Kerm planting.\u201D She locked eyes with her President. \u201CWith respect, Mr President, the alternative is running a growing risk that Firesvar will find us to be harbouring the Children. I believe the consequences of that discovery are obvious.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldwell held his breath.\u00A0 Chadwick\u2019s expression remained stony. \u201CWhy Veiid?\u201D he said conversationally.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA murmur of agreement rippled around the table. \u201C\u003Cem\u003EVeiidol ebda balsathona\u003C/em\u003E,\u201D muttered the Forseti deputy Chief Ambassador under her breath.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadwick sighed. \u201CIf you insist on demonstrating your erudition in Council, Madame Ambassador, might I suggest you read an Old Kerba grammar first? I have many excellent examples in my personal library which you would be welcome to borrow.\u201D He flicked a glance at Aldwell\u2019s deputy, now blushing dark green. \u201CI believe the expression you were searching for is \u2018Veiidol ebda \u003Cem\u003Ebelda\u003C/em\u003Esathona.\u2019 Whilst the Veiidan Council are indeed bureaucratic to a fault, I would hesitate to describe them as useless items.\u201D\u00A0He turned back to the Chief of Intelligence. \u201CNow, as I was saying before we were interrupted - why Veiid?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause alone, neither we nor Veiid have the political capital to persuade Doren of the benefits of an alliance,\u201D said the other bluntly. \u201CTogether we might, particularly if we can also demonstrate the effectiveness of Confederacy-Veiidan cooperation first.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadwick absorbed her words unblinkingly. \u201CIndeed,\u201D he said. \u201CParticularly as I suspect that Veidd will also be rather happy with the diplomatic benefits.\u201D He looked at his Chief of Intelligence thoughtfully. \u201CVery well. I want to see a position paper and heads of terms for a declaration of alliance by the end of the week. In the meantime, myself and Chief Ambassador Aldwell will speak to our Veiidan colleagues and propose a summit meeting.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSilently, Enely watched Gerselle at work, his thoughts a roiling mix of trepidation, happy memories, and sorrow, mingled with an undercurrent of guilty excitement. Jonton stood by her side, leaning heavily on his walking stick with one hand, holding Gerselle\u0027s tools with the other. Enely watched him bend forward and take the fresh Kerm cutting out of her hand, completely absorbed in the sight of Gerselle painting leaf paste over the exposed branch stump.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle peered at her work critically then, satisfied, handed the bowl of left over paste to Jonton. She took a pruning bag out of her poncho pocket and shook out the loose charcoal dust before slipping it over the stump and pulling the drawstring tight. She looked up to see Jonton staring at the cutting in his hand. \u00A0\u0022Here we go again, Jonton Kermol,\u0022 she said softly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton dropped the rest of the pruning gear into his own poncho, hobbled over and put his arm around her in an awkward one-armed hug. \u0022Here we go again,\u0022 he repeated. \u0022We\u0027ll do better this time though, love. You, me and Enely - we\u0027ll do it right. And your Kerm is just a sapling compared to Elton - that should help with the...\u0022 He stopped, fumbling for the right words. \u0022It should help,\u0022 he said at last. Gerselle didn\u0027t reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two Keepers made their way to the planting site, Enely following them at a discreet distance. He wasn\u0027t surprised by the crowd of kerbals waiting for them, from both Jonton and Gerselle\u0027s Groves. Fredlorf and Ferry waiting solemnly at the front. Silently, everyone watched Gerselle plant and water the cutting, watched her unfold a wickerwork screen and arrange it carefully around its stem. Enely watched her and Jonton work their way through the crowd, offering a reassuring word here, a moment or two of explanation there. He saw one or two of the eldest kerbals inspecting the leaves of the the nearest mature Kerm trees then, apparently satisfied, walk away. Others stood by the wickerwork screen, reaching over to touch the new cutting and even, Enely was bemused to see, caress it, running their fingers \u00A0over its leaves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGradually, the crowd dispersed, leaving their thirty-eighth Kerm alone in the soil. It was, Enely thought, a sign of the respect that the villagers had for their Keepers that the whole event had passed quite so peacefully. \u003Cem\u003EBut why not? They\u0027ve seen the Law of Thirty Seven broken, they\u0027ve seen Jonton survive his time spent an-Kerm. Most importantly, they\u0027ve all had a \u00A0chance to Commune with Elton.\u003C/em\u003E He shook his head. \u003Cem\u003EBesides - we\u0027ll be watching the new sapling.

After the last minute change to \u003Ci\u003EPioneer 5\u2019s\u003C/i\u003E crew caused by James Kerman\u2019s illness, crew training schedules now included a mandatory two week quarantine before launch day. Despite their relative luxury, the isolation quarters used in the final week were regarded as something to be endured rather than enjoyed by the flight crews, particularly the first time kerbonauts.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBarrie looked up from her flight manual, speared another chunk of creva with her fork and turned back to her power up and prelaunch checklists. Wilford sliced a piece off his own breakfast steak and chewed on it thoughtfully as he watched Milden, mind drifting back to his flight aboard Moho 3 and his sleepless night before it.\u00A0\u201CYour steak\u2019s getting cold,\u201D he offered. \u201CLast proper food for a couple of months - I\u2019d make the most of it.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CI know,\u201D said Milden. \u201CI\u2019m just not hungry.

How much sleep did you manage to get last night?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMilden looked at him oddly. \u201CEnough,\u201D she said. \u201CWhy do you ask?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CBecause I remember what it\u2019s like,\u201D said Wilford quietly. \u201CI didn\u2019t get much sleep at all before the Moho 3 launch. After the second nightmare, I was about this far,\u201D he held up his finger and thumb, \u201Cfrom bailing on the flight.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBarrie put down her manual.

He decided not to go into details. \u201CNot a surprise looking back. Jeb\u2019s flight nearly ended in disaster because of a faulty synch trigger on the decouplers. We got that fixed for Camrie\u2019s flight but\u2026\u201D He shrugged. \u201CWe were working with brand new technology. We tested it as best we could but another failure somewhere was always an option.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CBut you climbed aboard anyway,\u201D said Barrie.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWilford nodded. \u201CI figured I wasn\u2019t going to get any more sleep that night, so I went down to the canteen to get a drink and think things over. I found Jeb already there with the flight plan and what looked like half of Wernher\u2019s schematics for the Moho booster. I got my drink - made Jeb a coffee - and we had a chat. I\u2019ll always remember the end of that chat.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMilden sat down opposite him. \u201CWhy - what happened?\u201D she asked curiously.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CIt was something that Jeb said,\u201D Wilford replied. He closed his eyes for a second. \u201CI\u2019m not going to lie to you - at the moment, it\u2019s still a risky business. But when the recovery team fish you out of that capsule tomorrow and haul you up onto the boat, I\u0027m going to be there asking you just one question; \u003Ci\u003Ewere the risks worth it\u003C/i\u003E?\u201D\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWilford looked at her solemnly. \u201CJeb thought he knew the answer\u00A0 already - and he was right. They were. \u201D He smiled. \u201CWe used Minmus as a reference point for testing the attitude control system. Just seeing it with my own eyes, a tiny greenish-blue dot smack in the middle of the capsule window - I can\u2019t describe it. I think it was at that moment that I knew everything was going to be okay. The spacecraft I was flying, everyone on the ground watching over the systems, all the procedures and planning - they were working just as we\u2019d hoped.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWilford\u2019s eyes sparkled with a sudden fierce joy. \u201CWhen I brought Moho 3 out of orbit, I promised myself I\u2019d go back one day. I never dreamed that I\u2019d be on the first flight out to that greenish-blue dot - that I\u2019d be one of the first to see what it\u2019s \u003Ci\u003Ereally\u003C/i\u003E like!\u201D He shook himself. \u201CSorry - getting carried away there. Seriously though, Milden, we\u2019ve come an awful long way from the old Moho days. We\u2019re flying the most advanced spacecraft ever made, built by the best in the business. Our flight control teams have Kerm knows how many hundreds of hours experience between them.\u201D He looked Milden in the eye. \u201CLike Jeb, I won\u2019t lie to you - we\u2019re still in a risky business but we\u2019ve got the best kerbals in the world behind us - and the risks are \u003Ci\u003Eall\u003C/i\u003E worth it.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBarrie nodded approvingly. Milden picked up her fork and began to eat, mechanically at first but then with greater enthusiasm. Just as she swallowed the final mouthful, there was a knock at the door followed by a cheerful voice.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CEveryone awake in there?

Finally she uncoiled a length of tether, snapped one end onto her belt and looped the other through its D-ring on her chest. \u201CHat and gloves sealed, life support green, tether set.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CCopy.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMilden edged her way carefully through the hatch. Clumsily, she pulled the rest of her tether through after her muttering to herself as the stiff material flapped awkwardly around her. Sweating slightly in the confines of her suit, she found the safety buckle at its other end and clipped it onto the outside of the hatch. Barrie watched her pull herself clear of the capsule.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CYou\u2019re doing fine. Left a bit.

She tipped her head back, peering through the top of her helmet but all she could see was blackness. She took a deep breath, settled her boots firmly against the restraining bar holding them to \u003Ci\u003EProspector 2\u2019\u003C/i\u003Es hull, and straightened up.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELike every other space-walking kerbonaut before her, she stared, enraptured by the blue-green sphere of her homeworld\u00A0 - seen for the first time as a planet in its own right, and a fragile sanctuary against the frozen dark. Barrie heard her suck in her breath.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CIt\u2019s something isn\u2019t it?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFor a moment, Milden didn\u2019t reply. \u201CNo sign of the KDS,\u201D she said at last.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CWe left that behind hours ago,\u201D Barrie agreed.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMilden tipped her head to one side, squinting at the glowing horizon along the edge of her visor. Awestruck she watched it crawl away from her rough and ready reference mark, Kerbin itself shrinking before her eyes as she sped away from it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CCome on,\u201D said Barrie gently, \u201CWe\u2019ll point a window towards home once we\u2019re all aboard.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMilden shook herself, \u201CRight.\u201D She reached up, unclipped her tether and secured it to the next attachment point before easing her feet free. Slowly, deliberately, she worked her way along the hull, pausing occasionally to sneak a look around her. The flanks of her spacecraft gleamed mirror bright under her feet, matched by the reflected sunlight from the photovoltaic arrays jutting out to either side. Peering down between her legs, she could just see the habitation module hatch with Barrie\u2019s head and shoulders poking out through it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CI\u2019m clear. Watch your feet on the edge. There you go - nicely done! You want to pass your tether down - get it out of the way? Okay, Wilford - we\u2019re ready for you. Don\u2019t lock the hatch behind you.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWilford\u2019s answering laugh echoed inside her helmet. Milden watched his head emerge from the command module hatchway, helmet and life support backpack cutting an oddly blocky notch out of Kerbin\u2019s horizon.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAn appetising smell emerged from the galley, followed by Barrie nonchalantly pushing a tray of steaming ration packs in front of her, already opened and clipped into their handles. Leaving the tray floating in midair, she unstowed the collapsible dining table from it\u0027s recess in the habitation module hull. The tray fitted snugly into its own recess, held in place by the ubiquitous patches of hook-and-loop fabric. \u0022Hey - you two want me to eat these for you as well?\u0022 Milden looked over her shoulder in surprise as Barrie continued in mock indignation. \u0022I got one spare white bean stew with extra firewhisker and one grey mush - my apologies, one tuber and pepper cactus surprise - with tomato sauce.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWilford tucked his book into its elasticated pouch on the wall. \u0022Better hope that Sherf isn\u0027t on a console,\u0022 he said, \u0022She and Derny spent Kerm knows how long perfecting this.\u0022 He swung his legs over the edge of his sleeping shelf and carefully pushed off towards the floor. Tucking his feet under a convenient pair of restraints, he buckled himself into his sack chair and reached for his ration pack. Ignoring Barrie\u0027s amused look he dug happily into his meal. \u0022Mmm - I think Derny is still tinkering with this one. The extra onion sure makes a difference.\u0022 \u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022And we can still\u00A0patch the EVA suits with it in an emergency,\u0022 said Barrie. \u0022How\u0027s the stew, Milden?\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022It\u0027s very good,\u0022 said Milden softly.

There\u0027s got to be somebody else out there, Commander. Somebody other than kerbals I mean. I sometimes wonder if some of them are flying to one of their muns right now and asking themselves the same thing.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Maybe some of them are,\u0022 said Barrie. \u0022And I bet they\u0027re wishing \u003Cem\u003Ethey\u003C/em\u003E had a hot pouch of coffee to help them along the way. Can I get you two anything to wash these fine rations down with?\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022A green \u003Ci\u003Edjeng\u003C/i\u003E please, Commander,\u0022 said Milden.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Coming right up,\u0022 replied Barrie. \u201CAnd I keep telling you - that\u0027s Barrie to you. Leave the ranks and titles for the simulator and the kerbonaut office.\u0022 She waved at the window. \u0022Out here, it\u0027s just us. What are you drinking, Wilford?\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Just a water please,\u0022 answered Wilford. \u0022Thought I\u0027d brew up a sapwood later for the TV broadcast.\u0022 He glanced at the instrument panels above his head. \u0022We\u0027re still set up for the finale?\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Yep,\u0022 said Barrie. \u0022Should have quite a show for them tonight.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe \u003Ci\u003EProspector 2\u003C/i\u003E crew finished their meal in companionable silence. Milden sat cross-legged by a window, her pouch of \u003Ci\u003Edjeng\u003C/i\u003E floating within easy reach. Wilford gathered the empty ration packs and tidied them away before pulling out a Tiles set from its webbing by his sleeping bag. He raised his eyebrows at Barrie. \u0022Spot you five?\u0022\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBarrie snorted. \u0022I was going to ask you the same question. Set \u2018em up - honours even. I\u0027d better check in with Mission Control.\u0022 She pulled herself carefully over to the communication panel and flipped a switch. \u0022Flight, Prospector 2 on high gain alpha. How do you read?\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ENelton\u0027s reply was tinny but clear. \u0022Loud and clear, Prospector. Be advised, we\u0027ve just run a poll down here and you\u0027re looking good across all boards. CapSys recommends you restart the thermal control roll after the broadcast though.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Understood, Flight.

Proper bunks, an honest to Kerm dining table and I don\u0027t get Kerke\u0027s elbow in my eye for the whole journey. Can\u0027t beat it. Milden\u0027s enjoying the view and I\u0027m thinking we\u0027ve got plenty of time before the broadcast for me to hand Wilford his box at Tiles.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Not a hope,\u0022 Wilford put in cheerfully. \u0022Just so the flight controller pool knows, the good Commander has refused my generous offer of a five-spot.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ENelton chuckled. \u0022I like to see confidence in my spacecraft commanders - but I think I\u0027ll sweep low on this stake.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022No faith,\u0022 said Barrie sadly. \u0022That\u0027s the problem with flight directors these days.

She ducked slightly as Milden drifted overhead. \u201CAt least this one should be over in time to spare the folks back home my blushes.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMilden checked the battery charge on the camera before unclipping it from its mounting bracket.

Can you hear us Prospector?\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBarrie smiled into the camera. \u201CWe can hear you, Jon. Good to have you with us again.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CThank you for taking time for us, Barrie. How\u2019s the flight going?\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CVery well thank you, Jon. We\u2019re a little under three days out from Minmus right now, so we\u2019re making the most of our last day in the habitation module. Tomorrow we\u2019ll be going back into the command module, where we\u2019ll be staying until we\u2019re on the way back to Kerbin in six days time.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CYou won\u2019t be staying their for the whole six days though, I hope?\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBarrie laughed. \u201CWe hope not too, Jon, but we won\u2019t know for sure until we wake the lander up. That\u2019s a big part of what we\u2019ll be doing for the next two days - we have a third midcourse correction burn first thing tomorrow morning your time - and then we\u2019ll be running a complete systems check on the whole spacecraft to make sure we\u2019re ready for the landing attempt.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CAnd everyone at KBS News is wishing you the best of luck with that, Barrie. But for now, for the folks that couldn\u2019t join us for our last broadcast, we were all wondering if you could show them around a little?\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CBe happy to, Jon.\u201D Barrie cleared her throat. \u201COkay, Prospector is a lot like the Pioneer spacecraft that we use for going to the M\u00FCn. We\u2019ve got a service module at the back which holds our main engine for getting into and out of Minmus orbit. We\u2019ve got a lander on the front for getting down to the surface and back, and we\u2019ve got the main command module. That\u2019s the only part of the ship with a heat shield and it\u2019s the part we\u2019ll be flying back down to Kerbin in.\u201D Barrie smiled again. \u201CThe thing is though - that command module is pretty compact. It\u2019s fine for flying to the M\u00FCn and back but it\u2019s too small for the round trip to Minmus. By the time we\u2019d filled it with all the supplies and for the journey, there wouldn\u2019t be much room for us kerbonauts! So the KSA built us a habitation module to live in.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CIs it true that the habitation module was based on the Endurance space station, Barrie?\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAbsolutely, Jon. The original Endurance module was originally designed to support four kerbals in space for four weeks. We had to move the hatch around to the side and make some other changes too but the Endurance design turned out to be a good place to start. We\u2019ve got Milden here with the camera, if you\u2019re ready for a guided tour?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CThat would be splendid, Barrie.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ERecognising her cue, Milden tilted the camera until the hatch was framed neatly in her viewfinder. \u201CUm. Like Commander Barrie said, the habitation module has a side mounted hatch. It\u2019s in the middle of the spacecraft, in between the service and command modules, so, um, a hatch in the end would be no good.\u201D The camera panned slowly left. \u201CAt the end there is the toilet compartment and then most of the module is divided into two by these shelves fitted to either side. They\u2019re, uh, a bit like bunk beds - we sleep two to a shelf.\u201D Milden zoomed in on her sleeping space. \u201CWe get our own sleeping bag and lots of elasticated webbing pockets to store personal belongings in like books and things. It\u2019s a bit like being in a tent.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CBut with a better view outside, right?\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMilden\u2019s face lit up. \u201COh yes! If I get any spare time during the flight, I like to sit by a window and watch the stars. You just never get tired of it.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CBut when we do need to take a break from stargazing,\u201D Barrie put in, \u201Cthere\u2019s room for other things too. Down here,\u201D the camera tracked her gesture, \u201Cwe\u2019ve got a table and sack chairs. It looks a little snug but it\u2019s actually pretty roomy in zero-g. Wilford is a bit of a traditionalist - he likes to use the table as an actual dining table.\u201D Barrie tore a tile off the abandoned board and held it up to the camera. \u201CAs you can see, we\u2019ve got a Tiles set too. The hooks on the back here stick onto little bits of fluffy fabric on the game board which stops them from floating away.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CSo where is Wilford?\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CHe\u2019s in the galley making himself a drink. Could you pass me the camera please. Milden?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CUm. Certainly, Commander.\u201D Milden turned the camera around and carefully pushed it over to Barrie, treating the watching KBS team and their viewers to the sight of the habitation module walls drifting slowly past. Deftly, Barrie snagged the camera from mid-air and carried on talking. \u201CThis compartment here is the galley, where we keep all our food supplies. What you got for us, Wilford?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWilford waved at the camera as it appeared around the doorway. \u201CJust mixing up a sapwood from one of our new multi-bag packs.\u201D He held up a pouch of white powder with a nozzle attached to each end. \u201CI prefer my sapwood with milk, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to take care of first.\u201D Wilford unclipped the cold water hose and pushed the end over one of the nozzles. \u201CWe have to make sure this is on tight - if the hose pops off, we\u2019ll have water balls floating everywhere. Okay.\u201D He pressed a button and a jet of water shot into the bag, breaking up into a myriad of shimmering spheres that slowly turned a pearlescent white as the milk powder stuck to them and began to dissolve.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWilford disconnected the hose, catching the stray water droplets with a towel. \u201CNext, we knead the bag, make sure all that powder is properly dissolved. Then we screw this nozzle on this bag onto this nozzle on this other bag here\u2026and squeeze.\u201D The milk streamed through into the second bag, splashing off the toffee coloured coating inside. \u201CKnead the bag again, give it a shake and there you have it - one zero-gravity sapwood!\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBarrie applauded from behind the camera. \u201CAnd before you say it, Jon, we did try putting the milk and sap into a single bag but they just don\u2019t mix right. Unless you use hot water.\u201D Wilford made a face. \u201CWhich doesn\u2019t taste so good,\u201D Barrie finished.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWilford screwed a spout onto his sapwood bag. \u201CLast but not least - the drinking spout. Beloved by parents all across Kerbin, with a built in valve to stop spillages by clumsy kerblets - or kerbonauts!\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EGerselle laughed. \u201CHe\u2019s right - that looks just like something you\u2019d give a kerblet to drink from. I wonder how well it would work for pastes - a bag of puree with a spout would be perfect for weaning.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201COh Kerm, yes,\u201D agreed Jonton. \u201CAnything to keep the food in one place instead of over the floor and into little eyes.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAnd hair,\u201D said Gerselle. She shuddered. \u201CI still have nightmares about washing Joenie\u2019s hair after the blueberry pudding shampoo game.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EEnely rolled over on his makeshift bunk and smiled at the unforced banter between his two friends. The long watch over Gerselle\u2019s Kerm was beginning to take its toll on all three of them, none of them able to stray too far from the sleep room and at least one of them being constantly on the watch for the first sign of black spots. \u003Ci\u003ESpeaking of which.\u003C/i\u003E He glanced up but, much to his relief, the glossy green leaves overhead remained resolutely blemish free. He yawned and picked up his book, flipping idly through the pages in search of his bookmark.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201C\u2026this is our main camera by the window here. We brought it for um, for photography of Minmus from orbit but when we saw this, we really hoped we could um, share it with everyone back on Kerbin.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CWe\u2019re picking it up just fine, Milden and what a\u2026what a truly incredible sight that is.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EGerselle sucked her breath in sharply. \u201CEnely - look!\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EEnely looked up from his book.
