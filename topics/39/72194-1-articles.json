The earliest known records of Kerbal astronomy date back the the reign of king Tutankerbal the 2nd. King Tutankerbal ruled a large empire where a dedicated group of astronomers observed the planets and stars. Notable discoveries were the two moons and the nearby planet of Eve. Perhaps even more notable is the tower of Tutankerbal, the first attempt of Kerbal space travel. The kerbals of that time created the tower based on the belief that if they could build it high enough they could reach the various celestial bodies that they longed to reach. Unfortunately the tower collapsed during its construction killing many Kerbals as well as the great leader Tutankerbal. Tutankerbal\u0027s tomb stands to this day and contains a large database of the many discoveries of the time. After his death the empire collapsed and progress stalled on Kerbal exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
