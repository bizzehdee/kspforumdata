The first 2 seasons of the LP were, let\u0027s face it, terribly done. I was an amateur when it came to video/audio editing, and some of the stuff I did made absolutely no sense. It seemed I was torn between making a Let\u0027s Play and a Machinima.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, using my brain, I decided to do a Machinima in one playlist, and an LP in another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThusly was born the SaurKraut Legion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoin Captain Jeb, Commander Bill, and their crew as they take the flagship of the SaurKraut Corporation\u0027s defense force around the system, protecting the Corporation\u0027s interests and assets. They\u0027ll have to deal with the politics of the Kerbin Triumvirate, the governing body on Kerbin; as well as piracy and the dastardly terrorist organization known as The Black Hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECountless hours have been spent constructing sets and ships, recording video sequences, wrestling with the proper codecs, recording audio, editing it all, and compiling it. As a bonus, my skills in doing all of this has steadily and drastically increased as I have quested to make a Machinima on the level of some of the greats. It\u0027s not perfect, but by episode 3, it looks pretty darn legit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently working on set/ship-building for episode 4, and everything is going quite well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease head on over to my YouTube channel and check out The SaurKraut Legion! (Be advised: the characters are based on a typical military mindset. If you\u0027re offended by profanity, don\u0027t watch, or grow thicker skin and enjoy the humor and drama \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll start you off at episode 1, but the one I\u0027m most proud of (until I upload ep4) is 3.
