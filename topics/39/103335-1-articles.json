I just hope that nobody will make video like this about TAC lifesupport. That was wonderful! Maybe best KSP video I have ever seen.\n\n--- I am becoming strange on next lines ---\n\nOr best video ever. NASA should learn from it. ESA should learn from it. If Obama have seen this, he would certainly give more money to NASA. People should really stop all wars and start making Infernal Robotics in real life. Seriously. Ok, not seriously. It would be however nice. But unrealistic. Why is mankind so stupid and don\u0027t unite? Ok nevermind, I am not going to start discussion about this. It won\u0027t change anything if we talk how world could be awesome. Stop, Nik333. Stop writing. Ok, I am calming down! I am calming down...\n\n--- Edit ---\n\nSorry, get too emotional yesterday... It is trully awesome video. As every video should be. Every second has something moving. Something interesting. That\u0027s awesome...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-04T09:04:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2015 09:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nik333**"},{"CreatedByName":"Darren9","CreatedById":58062,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T00:25:55Z","Content":"Thanks, Zodius is playing himself down a bit though, there\u0027s designs, direction and lots of other stuff in there that I wouldn\u0027t even of tried on my own, I\u0027m very pleased with the result though ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T03:22:41Z","Content":"Wow that was a really great video. I have always avoided the IR mod because I always worry about complicated mods making the game crash or corrupting save files, not to mention I have to limit part count on my crafts to keep the game from being too slow. This video just tipped the scales. It is worth the risk. When 1.0 comes out I will try adding 1.0 to the game. Really great video, and those parts look great!"}]}
