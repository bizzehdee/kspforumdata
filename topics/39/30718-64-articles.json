(Fanfic writer would like more in-game writing shocker. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) I do think it shows the kind of attention to detail that makes a game look cared about and it doesn\u0027t have to be terribly obtrusive for those that aren\u0027t much bothered about such things. BattleTech is a nice example - you can play the game right through without ever reading one bit of lore, but it\u0027s all there if you want to, tucked away behind various hyperlinks. A more extreme example is probably Subnautica - the amount of background detail that the devs have put into the various marine plants and beasties is incredible and really makes the exploration side of the game shine. And again - it\u0027s all mostly optional.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re going to be building an interstellar civilization in KSP2 - wouldn\u0027t it be nice to know a little bit about it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can honestly say that I\u0027d be happy with any sort of in-game lore. Alternate Universe (AU) is a well established style of fanfic, so whatever the official word on the kerbals and Kerbin ends up being, it wouldn\u0027t spoil \u003Cem\u003EFirst Flight\u003C/em\u003E for me.

The wires supported by each set of poles ran from a pair of metal pipes standing side-by-side, half-buried in the ground, to the imposing front steps of the Berelgan Institute manor house. A trail of cable clips guided them up the steps, in through the front door and along a hallway to an airy, high-ceilinged office. There, they disappeared into one of the many pieces of electronic equipment piled up on a large equipment cart next to the Berelgan telephone exchange.

Plywood formwork lined its walls, anchored at the top by a lattice of cables and bolted to the ragged tops of exposed concrete walls at the bottom. Trickles of sand leaked from the joints in the formwork and cascaded over the rope ladders dangling over the edge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the bottom of the pit, a work crew heaved suction hoses into place. Their supervisor checked the copied architectural plans clipped to his board and marked off the hose positions. Satisfied, he stuck a finger in each corner of his mouth and gave a shrill whistle. Above his head, well back from the pit edge, diesel generators clattered into life and sand began disappearing up the hoses with a hissing roar. The work crew, ear defenders pulled over their heads against the noise, walked back and forth, marking out a trench along the edge of the long wall of the pit. Sand tumbled in to fill the trench and was sucked out in turn. A second crew began excavating a similar trench along the other wall, leaving a steadily diminishing hillock between them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe supervisor watched the sand level creeping downwards, revealing more and more of the concrete wall at the far end of the pit. The head of a door frame came into view, followed by the jambs and the top of the door proper. Beside him, the top of a curved bank of monitors was emerging from the hillock. He gave a sharp double-whistle and the noise from the generators immediately throttling back to a muted rumble. Both work crews gathered around the exposed door frame, pulling off their ear defenders and fitting wand-like extensions over the ends of their hoses, the wands tipped with brushes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis end is nearest the emergency exit, so we\u2019ll most likely find a few of them here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe workers drew back into a loose semicircle and began skimming away the sand in layers. Then one of them stopped and knelt down, brushing away a circular patch of sand and exposing dark hair. At the sight of his raised hand, the others stepped back to give him room. Not daring to remove any more sand directly, he began clearing a circular trench around the buried head, letting the sand fall away from the distressingly young face, eyes still squeezed tightly closed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe supervisor flipped over the plans on his clipboard, revealing a sheet of photographs beneath. For a minute he stood in silence, head bowed, before ticking off Desden \u2018Des\u2019 Kerman\u2019s name from his list. Then he knelt down with a soft-bristled paintbrush and began clearing the last vestiges of sand from the corners of the scientist\u2019s eyelids.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDawn was creeping over the horizon as the laden sling emerged from the funeral pit, the crane operator slewing his load around in a slow half circle before depositing it beside the row of closed body bags. The sling fell open and respectful figures lifted the mortal remains of Macbus Kerman onto yet another dark green bag and, after a minute\u2019s silence, zipped it closed. The weary KNSA team retreated beneath one of the gazebos ringing the pit, watching the sling lift into the air, swing round, and descend out of sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the bottom, a grim-faced work crew stood by the reception desk of the now-cleared Site D lobby. Before them a figure lay sprawled on the floor, one out-flung hand still clutching a pistol, the laboratory coat covering the opposite shoulder crusted with a mixture of sand and dried blood. Beside its head a slumped figure sat cross-legged, dressed in the uniform of a major in the Wakiran Border Security Force, the back of its skull a mummified horror of clotted tissue and bone fragments. It too held a pistol, wedged under its jaw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGently, almost tenderly, the KNSA workers lifted Hading Kerman\u2019s body onto the open sling on the floor, standing to attention as the cables tightened, pulling the canvas closed around their once colleague, and lifting him up into the dawn sky. The click of a camera shutter broke the silence and they turned to find their supervisor stretched out on the floor, photographing the Wakiran officer\u2019s corpse. She stood up, shaking her head in acknowledgement of the unspoken question in their eyes. \u201CNo, we\u2019re not. This coward doesn\u2019t deserve to go home to his Grove. Stick a tarpaulin over the \u003Cem\u003Ebjedla\u003C/em\u003E and we\u2019ll let Wakiran High Command decide what to do with him.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElton\u2019s map wasn\u2019t quite what Jonton had been expecting. For all his time spent an-Kerm, at heart he remained a kerbal, with a kerbal\u0027s expectation of how things should work. Kerbal maps were tidy affairs of precise lines and easily read symbols that brought order to the landscape they depicted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was not a kerbal map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIrregular splotches of brown spotted the thinly spread carpet of healthy green clover, like raindrops spattered across a sheet of newsprint. For the most part, the splotches had run together into a blobby fern-like pattern but, closer to Elton\u2019s trunks, the criss-crossing trails of dead clover had melded into a single expanse, spattered here and there with curiously geometric patches of green left between overlapping circles of muddy brown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely scratched his head. \u201CNone of them are as neat as I thought they would be.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No,\u0022 said Jonton. \u0022It\u0027ll be interesting to hear how they fared at the Berelgan.\u0022 He shrugged. \u0022I doubt they\u0027ll have seen much difference but Obrinn\u0027s a much younger Kerm so you never know. Anyway, for older Kerm it looks like you don\u0027t need to start the map so close to their trunks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where do you think would be the best places to plant the transmitter and receiver?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton got to his feet. \u0022As far apart as we can. Elton\u0027s managed to find a couple of chemokines that shouldn\u0027t have too much effect on the local soil fauna and he thinks he can dampen down any effect they do have, but even so, they\u0027re bound to do something. For the sake of signal clarity if nothing else, we think it\u0027s probably better to keep the damper zones as far away from each other as we can. That should keep their micro-ecologies, as Mallas would call them, from getting mixed up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely nodded. \u0022That makes sense.\u0022 He gave Jonton a self-deprecating smile. \u0022Or, at least, I\u0027m happy to trust that a former an-Kerm and one of the oldest Kerm on Kerbin know what they\u0027re doing.\u0022 He saw a fleeting shadow behind Jonton\u0027s eyes. \u0022When it comes to Kerm micro-ecologies,\u0022 he added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Those, we do know about,\u0022 muttered Jonton. \u0022I wouldn\u0027t be so sure about anything else.\u0022 He closed his eyes for a moment. \u0022Anyway, apart from putting them as far apart as possible, I\u0027d say we\u0027re looking for a branch point on one of the main cross-tree fibres.\u0022 He held up a hand, thumb and fingers outstretched. \u0022According to Mallas, the working end of the prototype sensors that he\u0027s bringing next week are about half a span wide with some room for adjustment. So, we can\u0027t go too far out from the trunk but we should have some leeway.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely paced out a distance from the dead clover around Elton\u0027s trunk. \u0022About here then.\u0022 He studied the greenery around his feet, searching for a fork in one of the wilted brown trails marking out the buried Kerm fibres. \u0022Here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The next one out, maybe? Yes - that looks better. That\u0027ll do.\u0022 Jonton watched Enely retrieve a handful of red-painted garden canes from the bundle slung over his shoulder and drive them into the ground around the branch point, making sure to keep well clear of the fibre trail. Jonton grimaced. \u0022I suppose we should check the fibre width but I\u0027d rather not disturb them any more than we have to. I wish the Berelgan had come up with a way of finding Kerm fibres without digging for them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No.\u0022 Enely said flatly. \u0022We don\u0027t disturb the fibres unless we absolutely have to.\u00A0 Even then...\u0022 He shivered. \u0022I too hope the Berelgan can find a better way of doing this. Come - we should find somewhere for the second sensor to go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPractice, Jonton reflected, made most things easier, even reading Kerm maps. Finding a suitable location for the second sensor took much less time than the first and it wasn\u0027t long before the last red cane had been driven into the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe journey home was a sombre one with Enely wrapped up in his own thoughts and Jonton maintaining a respectful silence. As they approached Gerselle\u0027s hut, Enely stopped. \u0022I suppose he volunteered too in a strange sort of way. I shared my story with him, so he must know the risks. But he\u0027s never once mentioned them, or been anything less than supportive of the telegraph project.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know,\u0022 Jonton answered. \u0022We\u0027ve discussed it and I deliberately mentioned your... story as well. More than once in fact but every time he seemed indifferent.\u0022 Jonton raised a hand. \u0022Not to your suffering - I sensed \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E very clearly - but more as if there simply wasn\u0027t any possibility of the same thing happening to him.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let us hope so.\u0022 Enely opened the front door and went inside. Jonton cocked his head at the sounds coming from the living room. Puzzled, he followed Enely inside to find Meleny\u0027s family, along with Ferry and Fredlorf, sitting around the television with Joenie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe screen showed a double line of black-clad kerbals marching down City Avenue carrying a plain wooden casket on their shoulders. A lone kerbal walking behind them carried a banner bearing the emblem of the Wakiran Border Security Force. Jonton watched two lines of similarly black-clad figures emerge from the crowds lining the Avenue and fall into perfect lockstep with the marchers. The casket was passed forward from shoulder to shoulder, unburdened kerbals peeling away pair by pair from the back of the lines. Finally, the Wakiran banner was furled, its bearer stepping to one side and another figure, carrying the banner of the Firesvarn Combined Deterrent Forces, taking her place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton glanced at the news ticker scrolling down the left-hand side of the screen, a look of quiet approval settling over his face. He walked over to stand behind Joenie\u0027s chair, hands clasped in front of him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe casket proceeded down City Avenue to the Capital building, representatives from the armed forces of each of six Regionalities of Kerbin taking their turns as pallbearers. Then, at the gates to Capital Park, it was handed off to a final group of mourners, the banner carried behind them bearing the flag of all Kerbin alongside the crest of the Kerbin Nuclear Standards Agency. They carried the casket through the park to the front of the Capital building itself, and set it down on a stand set up in front of a long table, a thick sheaf of paper stamped with the Seal of the Twelve Pillars, and a single microphone placed at its exact centre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBehind the table, twelve figures, their hands also clasped respectfully in front of them, watched the KNSA delegation place the casket on its stand and step back before taking their seats with the other pallbearers. President Maller of Veiid stepped forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good Kerbals, we stand divided.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaller adjusted his microphone. \u0022Divided both by Regionality and by more ancient loyalties, we wage a bitter and bloody war. A war for which we have all paid dearly, in the lives of loved ones lost fighting for what they believed to be right. And yet the price could have been uncountably higher.\u0022 Maller glanced at the cameras. \u0022For, in one terrible moment, we faced the spectre of nuclear science on the battlefield. A tool of peace twisted into weapons capable of defiling the very lands, for which so much was sacrificed, with radioactive poisons.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Veiidan President\u0027s gaze swept over the rows of pallbearers. \u0022But we have been given a second chance. Our worst nightmare was averted by the steadfast courage and dedication to duty of one kerbal who, along with too many of his companions and colleagues, paid the ultimate price for that dedication.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The reasons for the war are many and varied but now is not a time for recriminations, nor for apportioning blame. Now is a time for seizing the gift we have been given and using it wisely for the benefit of all. And so, I speak for all the Twelve Pillars, when I say; this we pledge to do and we pledge to start today.\u0022 Maller gestured at the sheaf of paper in front of him. \u0022Before you lie the Hading Accords. Drawn up by this Council and named for the kerbal who gave us this second chance, they commit us all to a permanent ceasefire and the renewed search for a peaceful solution to the Kerm crisis.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaller drew a silver pen from his pocket. Moving the microphone to one side, he signed his name on the first sheet of the sheaf. \u0022For the kerman of Veiid, I Maller, do hereby sign these Hading Accords.\u0022 He put the pen down and stepped to one side.\u00A0 Chief Ambassador Obmy was the next to step forward and sign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For the kermol of Veiid, I Obmy, do hereby sign these Hading Accords.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne by one, with the eyes of the world upon them, the other ten Pillars signed the Accords. Finally, Maller stepped forward again and affixed a wax seal beneath the twelve signatures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As it has been written by these Twelve Pillars, so let it be done. And may you all give us the wisdom to find our course.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton scooped away the last handful of soil, exposing a cluster of nodules on the ancient Kerm fibre. He fitted a U-shaped jig over the cluster and marked the position of its two holes before putting it to one side. Hardly daring to breathe, he drove two mounting pegs into the soil, one on either side of the fibre.\u00A0 \u201CReady for the emitter.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas lowered the slender tube, with its matching U-shaped tip, into the trench. Jonton fitted the tip lugs over the mounting pegs. \u201CDown a little \u2013 and hold it there.\u201D He scattered a layer of soil over the fibre. \u201CBit more\u2026 and stop.\u201D Jonton shovelled soil back into the trench, packing it around the emitter base. \u201CThat should hold it.\u201D He stood up, watching as Mallas unfolded three tripod legs from around the tube and locked them into place. The two kerbals set to work backfilling the trench until the only thing marking the excavation site were a ragged patch of bare earth in the midst of the clover, out of which the emitter tube with its hemispherical cap sprouted like a bizarre metal mushroom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton wiped the sweat out his eyes. \u201COkay, that\u2019s both of them. Time to hook them up and see if they work.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI suppose so,\u201D Mallas dragged his gaze away from the line of telegraph poles marching across the fields from Jonton\u2019s Keeper hut to the nearby village. \u201CThis part always makes me nervous,\u201D he confessed. \u201CAs the old saying goes, in theory, there\u2019s no difference between practice and theory. In practice, there usually is.\u201D He picked up the length of sheathed cable which stretched back to a junction box mounted on the nearest pole and inspected the plug on its end. Satisfied, he knelt down beside the emitter tube and pushed the plug into its socket under the hemispherical cap, before tightening up the threaded tube that secured it in place and sealed it against the elements. \u201CWe\u2019ll need to cover the cabling but that can wait until everything\u2019s working.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes.\u201D Jonton handed Mallas a reel of cable from his backpack and watched as he plugged one end into the emitter cap. They lugged the reel over to the second sensor, already emplaced on the other side of Elton\u0027s trunk, taking it in turns to carry the reel or pay out the cable. By the time they reached the transmitter tube, Jonton\u0027s back was aching from walking doubled over. He arched his shoulders, trying to relieve the knot of tension at the base of his neck, whilst Mallas plugged in the transmitter and tested its connection to the receiver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well everything seems to be working - as far as I can tell. Only one real way to find out though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGathering their tools, they walked back to Jonton\u2019s hut in silence. Jonton staring at Elton\u2019s main trunk emerging from the roof, his mind back at the exposed fibre in the trench, sensor tube descending towards it. He opened his front door and waved Mallas inside, watching as the other made a beeline for the telephone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHalsy? It\u2019s Mallas here. Yes \u2013 we\u2019ve just finished setting up. How\u2019s the installation going at your end? Excellent \u2013 we\u2019ll be in Communion and waiting for his call.\u201D The handset rattled on its cradle as Mallas turned to Jonton, eyes bright. \u201CThey\u2019re all set. Halsy is on his way over to Erlin\u2019s Grove now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton took a deep breath and willed his voice to remain steady. \u201CIn that case we\u2019d better get ready ourselves. He led the way into his sleep room, relieved to find the air no more cinnamon-laden than normal. Mallas lay down on the nearest bunk bed and looked at him questioningly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo ahead. He\u2019ll be expecting both of us.\u201D Jonton watched Elton\u2019s leaves closing around Mallas\u2019s head before lying down on his own, slightly musty smelling, bed and propping a second pillow under his neck. He glanced at the ceiling, unable to make out any tension in Elton\u2019s branches or unusual changes to his leaf clusters. Unreassured, he clenched his toes and lifted his head towards the waiting leaves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;good afternoon, Jonton\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EGood afternoon, Elton.

Undercurrents of tension, which Elton took care to damp, swirled from link to link as they waited for a signal from the Berelgan. Then, amidst a sudden wave of excitement, a string of coloured dots appeared before them. For a moment, Jonton looked at the dots in confusion before realising that one colour represented a dot and the other a dash. Long hours of practice proved their worth as he began to automatically assign letters to groups of dots and then letters to words.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncoming.

The border between Kolus, Wakira and Firesvar is also a bit different in-story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is in Kolus and the Capital and Berelgan Institute are on the Itaalic Isthmus.

As a practical matter, the main fronts in the war are between Kolus and Doren, and between Kolus, Firesvar and Wakira.\u00A0 There\u0027s also an uneasy truce between Veiid and the Spierkan-Forseti Confederacy (basically the grey areas on the map). Both of them are relatively minor powers and are desperately trying to avoid getting into a shooting war with Doren. For their part, the Doreni are more concerned with Kolus and have no real desire to open up a second front with Veiid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also an odd sort of war, in that all the participants are equally responsible and equally to blame. Thus there\u0027s no single aggressor that kicked the whole thing off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt all started with the Kerm Seeding. As you\u0027ll recall, the Kerm only seed every few centuries, and each seeding has, historically, driven a wave of kerbal expansion. This time around there\u0027s almost nowhere left to expand into (on Kerbin at least) which triggered a bit of a crisis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe war itself, began with a series of border skirmishes as each Regionality tried to grab whatever uninhabited land it could to plant new Kerm Groves on. Those skirmishes grew steadily more acrimonious but the two tipping points that escalated them into all out war were down to the pro-Kerm group, the Children of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne solution to the Kerm crisis that had been tried was simply to put any new Kerm seeds in cold storage until a place could be found for them, on or off Kerbin. The Children were violently opposed to this* and broke into the cold storage facility on Veiid to liberate the seeds. They then proceeded to plant unauthorised Groves wherever they could, including Firesvar. Somewhat understandably, Firesvar blamed Wakira for failing to stop the Children\u0027s incursions and, eventually, declared formal war on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven then, the situation may have been retrievable were it not for a second incident in Veiid. Following a strategy from the previous Kerm seeding, the Veiidans were in the process of planting a chain of lightly overlapping Groves around their eastern seaboard. Since deliberately uprooting a Kerm was traditionally anathema to any kerbal, the Veiidans reasoned that their chain of Groves would provide a de-facto barrier, blocking access to the rest of their continent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, the Children, or at least the more fanatical Children didn\u0027t get the memo. They attempted to uproot a Veiidan Kerm to make room to plant one of their own seeds - and found out the hard way that the Kerm are not merely defenseless trees. It was well known that the Kerm possess an array of sub-surface vines or tendrils - the kerbals had made medical use of those so-called \u0027healing vines\u0027 for centuries. What had been forgotten was that the healing vines also provided a lethally effective defense against predators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe combination of breaching the ultimate taboo (uprooting Kerm) and outright fear of the rediscovered Kerm defenses (the images of dead kerbals impaled on \u0027healing\u0027 vines were fairly effective at stoking that fear), proved to be the final tipping point that escalated the various Kerm conflicts into all-out war.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, not a simple war and one that\u0027s been a long time in the telling, so I\u0027m not surprised that folks are losing track.\u00A0 Hopefully the above summary will help a bit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003E* Kerm rights on Kerbin provoke much the same intensity of feeling as abortion rights in the US.
