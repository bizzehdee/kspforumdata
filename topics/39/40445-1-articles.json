And had escaped death many times himself. Thinking back the microwaved noodles incident must have been the most pointless, (and messy) And all because that \u0022nutter\u0022 had \u0022upgraded\u0022 the microwave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe high fatality rating meant that every day new and unexperienced workers joined the labor pool, causing more accidents. He walked out of the cafetaria only to see a very enthousiastic young kerbal being caught by his sleeve to one of the cranes going to the top. no-one seemed to care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaring up at the construction he had been a part of he wondered if it would ever fly. And then to think that according to the plans, this would only be the fuel carrying core of the new line of \u0022Capital\u0022 Class ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/d9wIepO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d9wIepO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022d9wIepO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022LOOK OUT BELOW!!\u0022, without thinking or looking up all the ground workers moved 2 meters to the left. A girder slammed into the ground, tipped over and crushed 2 workers carrying a modified RCS module. When the sound of the crash ringed out a single sharp voice could be heard:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THAT RCS MODULE??!!, THAT WAS THE ONLY WORKING PROTOTYPE!!\u0022 A particular small kerbal in a white labcoat limped out of the shadow near the overseers office that was suspended near the ceiling. Professor Otto van Kernstrohm glared at the workers on the floor. And was greeted by a sea of terrified little green faces looking up at him. A small chuckle escaped his lips, there was nothing he enjoyed more than scaring the simple folk. Offcourse it wasnt the only working prototype. He had other .. prototype\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022LET THAT BE THE LAST ACCIDENT, WE HAVE GOT A BIG DAY TODAY .. EMPEROR JEBOBILL WILL BE HERE FOR THE LAUNCH THIS AFTERNOON!!\u0022 and with that statement the professor limped back towards his labaratories, leaving the shocked workers to \u0022clean\u0022 up the mess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis afternoon, that \u0022nutter\u0022 has now truly lost it. Okay the construction would be finished this afternoon, but surely they would want to run some tests. Surely if this thing was ever to become the center of the megalithic flagship it was designed to be. Well if all else fails I will make sure the launch supports I have personally designed are in perfect condition and up for the task:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/trJAfQ0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/trJAfQ0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022trJAfQ0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey seemed in perfect condition, but just as his inspection was complete Burt heard exited shouting. \u0022THE SYSTEM STARTED ITSELF!!\u0022. A cold machine voice filled the assembly building: \u0022KAL3000 system post, all systems starting. Preparing for first round of diagnostics. Life forms detected near core. Please be advised, radiation shielding insufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe workers stared up at the ship, most looked puzzled. Some made their way to the radiation shelters, but most of them just stood there looking at the light show now coming from the ship they had been working on for so long. And listened to KAL going through his cycle\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Final warning, All life forms should vacate the area as soon as possible. Quantum struts initiated, structural integrity to 110%. Engine fuel lines opened, first pre engine start test cycle complete. Fuel supply locked in place. Engine group 1 ready, Engine group 2 warming up.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurt looked with growing concern from the shelter, the assembly area was as good as deserted now. Only a few kerbals had remained to receive a lethal dosis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main entrance was thrown open, he could hear a loud buzzing and static noise making its way to the floor. The irrational fear this caused surprised him. He was completly terrified of what this noise meant. He had heard tales of this noise. It was the lifesupport system the emperor had devised. Small blue static charges began to appear accross all the metal surfaces in the assembly area. And a sleek looking completely jet black metal tube glided across the floor. It stopped just a few meters from the ship. Then after what seemed like an eternity a cracked but strong voice came from the tube. \u0022KAL are you there.?\u0022 The system responed: \u0022Yes my emperor, I am here. All systems operational and ready for launch.\u0022 The tube began to turn, and slowly made its way to the doors. Burt could swear he heard irrational laughing and chuckling in 3 distinct voices coming from the tube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs suddenly as he had come he was gone again, the ship seemed to power down. It was a full 5 minutes before the first workers came out from their respective hiding places. They all looked at the ship with fear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022WE MOVE TO LAUNCH!!\u0022 this was the professors voice over the intercom system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood thought Burt, lets get this thing out of here so we can get back to building something a little more .. well normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe automated systems kicked in, the launch buildings doors rolled open. The ship was lifted by the tracks and began to move towards the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurt in the meantime took his seat in the launchbunker to watch the launch. He could clearly hear the computer voice of KAL running its final diagnostics and planning its trajectory to parking orbit. To think that thing will be flying over our heads for the next few years looking down on us. This caused a tremor of fear to run through little Burt\u0027s spine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no countdown, no flight crew. The thing just sat there and the next moment all its engines roared at full power. The locking clamps gave way and the ship\u0027s core was underway. A slow and lumbering start, but it moved. It appeared to be controlled. And it carried enough fuel to burn a small planet to a crisp. Burt wondered what controlled this ship as none of the operators around him were doing anything except stare at the launch with a terrified expression on their face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/2pTkVtl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2pTkVtl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222pTkVtl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing was now actually picking up speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/nIvB1gB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nIvB1gB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nIvB1gB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd soon it was removed from view completly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/KVpMmqg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KVpMmqg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KVpMmqg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA speaker hummed to life in the control area, causing some of the tech-heads to become a few shades lighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is KAL3000: stable parking orbit achieved at 200KM above surface, awaiting further development.
