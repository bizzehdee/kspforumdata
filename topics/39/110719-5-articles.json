I know how you feel. My own project has ground to a near stand still, as all my major wood and metal working tools reside in an unheated barn a town over, and that is far too cold right now to be venturing that far away, for that amount of time, to do that kind of work! \u003C/font\u003E![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif \u0022:huh:\u0022)  \n\nFortunately, I can still work on electronics, but cash flow has been slow, so parts are on a trickle supply. Furthermore, I\u0027ve been focusing almost all my spare project time on my mechanical keyboard. It\u0027ll be only a couple weeks before the key caps show up, so it\u0027s a rush to finish by then. Very excited about finishing that project! It\u0027s oaky though... I\u0027m *really* just waiting for 1.1 to launch, and for the mods to catch up to that... In the meantime, I\u0027m busy having too much fun playing Fallout 4. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif \u0022:sticktongue:\u0022)  \n\nI did have a major setback with my own project, specifically the FDAI (navball) controller. Turns out, an Arduino doesn\u0027t stand a CHANCE of communicating enough bits over I2C, or processing fast enough to control the raw data needed to feed the DACs at a sufficient rate to do the arbitrary waveform generation on 10 channels. one, *maybe* two channels, sure, but not 10. Fortunately, someone suggested a cheap DAC that featured an independent voltage reference input that allows me to use the DACs as attenuators. Now I only need to make a hardware 400 Hz sine generator, and feed that into the attenuator DACs... I only need to update those (x10) at the rate KSP sends telemetry updates, not at 400 Hz x timebase resolution x 10. Far more manageable! The good news, is that once I\u0027m done with my keyboard, I think I\u0027ll go back to working on the FDAI controller. I need to actually BUILD the circuit... I\u0027ve got *almost* all the parts for it already. Focus, me! Focus! ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif \u0022:confused:\u0022)  \n\nThe actual control panel itself has been untouched, cause the translucent synthetic paper (from Nekoosa paper products) that I plan to use for meter and control panel backlit panels... Is useless with a printer that doesn\u0027t print color well, anymore. When spring comes, I\u0027ll venture forth from my weather shuttered doors, once again, and find a print shop. Too darn cold! ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif \u0022:rolleyes:\u0022)  \n\nAnyhow, very, VERY awesome build you have going on, and that \u0022glass cockpit\u0022 is looking mighty, mighty fine!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On January 15, 2016 at 10:56 AM, Starwhip said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The fact that you have the Red Green show on greatly pleases me. I guess you really are a handyman if you can get that to work! XD\n\u003E \n\nWell, if the women don\u0027t find you handsome, they should at least find you handy! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)  \n\nThe new plan for it is to get one of those cheap little Raspberry Pi Zero boards (the ones that are *super* cheap). I want to set it up to play animations of the IVA and mission control characters (Gene Kerman, etc) at random. If I can make that work, then I\u0027ll mount the CRT in portrait mode. It\u0027d be purely aesthetic. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027d even have any interactivity, other than a \u0022Coms\u0022 switch on the panel that will be able to turn it on or off.  \n\nThat\u0027s one area where I plan to have non game switches to make it feel more \u0022space capsuley\u0022. The various components of the system will each have their own unique power switches, with their own \u0022DC Bus\u0022 or \u0022AC Bus\u0022 supplies labeled (\u0022DC Bus A\u0022, \u0022AC Bus Aux\u0022, etc).

I have had problems with the MAX chips if the signal is over long wires, the DP pin would not reliably work.

Or you can [query this post I found](https://fabienroyer.wordpress.com/2011/03/13/using-a-max7219max7221-led-display-driver-with-a-netduino/) talking about it.  \n\nIn short: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E There was discussions about SPI and data lengths. These people were trying to run SPI lengths of like 30 feet, or something silly.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway - one commenter mentioned that they **twisted the clock and data lines together to eliminate interference**.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I figured I\u0027d do a test-try to see if this would work. I twisted the cables of both the lines from the 7-segment, and the respective lines from the flex cable - and it works!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Keep this in mind if you\u0027re having any issues with GPIO assigned SPI devices!\n\u003E \n\nThis may help eliminate issues.
