Despite being designed as a day fighter its stability and carrying capacity made it a very effective bombing platform. As new designs were pressed into service the Air Force was left with a surplus of jets that were no longer needed, so in 1950 they began selling the F-6 along with other obsolete piston powered planes from the Oceanic War to other countries. Due to their low price and high performance they found new life in the service of poorer nations who had no domestic aircraft manufacturing of their own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Qdqbkrm.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022494\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/Qdqbkrm.png\u0022 width=\u0022747\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EImage taken by a fellow Comet during\u00A0training flight-1948\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne such nation was the Thean Empire who in 1950 began purchasing these hand me down planes to augment their fleet of grossly outdated planes, some of which were biplanes from the early 1930\u0027s. As the Empire was showing off their might the poorer farming communities in the southern region of the country began to grow discontent by these decadent expenditures by the Empire when many had trouble feeding their families due too massive crop taxes. This divide had been present for many decades following the discovery of precious metals in the northern mines which greatly improved the quality of life in the cities surrounding the capital but failed to trickle down to other areas.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Emperor of Thea suddenly died in his sleep on March 5, 1951, leaving a power vacuum that\u00A0\u00A0soon spiraled out of control as his younger son Johase-Mun,\u00A0who was seen by many in the south to be spoiled and selfish and completely unsympathetic to the plight of the poor, announced himself as the new Emperor. The oldest son who was the true heir and greatly admired\u00A0 by the peoples of Thea was out of the country on a diplomatic mission and threatened with death if he returned and attempted to usurp power. The final straw that ignited the tensions was the declaration by Emperor Johase that a collection of 5000 yurin would be made from each town to pay for a lavish funeral for his father, which while pocket change from the mining towns, would decimate the farmers in the south. Thus the country of Thea broke out into a civil war that soon drew in the interests of the world.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeeing the plight of the rebels the League of Nations backed support for them and began to supply them with military and material aid in the fight. Within six months nearly a quarter of the troops and over half of the pilots in the South were made up of LN personnel. The influx of first generation jets by the LN countries quickly overtook the limited air force of the Empire reducing their numbers from 400 to only 70 by early 1952, with all 67 F-6 Comets which were their only jet fighters being shot down. This allowed for near total control of the skies and extensive bombing campaigned by the piston powered B-2 bombers remaining from the Oceanic war to take a heavy toll on the North. It seemed that victory was nearly there when two unexpected allies joined the fight to aid the Empire. The air dominance which allowed for quick advancement for the Southern forces was soon to come to and end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
