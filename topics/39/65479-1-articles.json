Each engine was as powerful as fifty Mainsail engines that had propelled Kerbalkind to land on the Mun an entire century earlier, but unlike the Mainsail, these engines could burn for years, as compared to minutes or even the seconds; products of the horrid efficency of the Mainsail engine, which was now confined to musuems. It was an massive vessel, three kilometers in length, the product of an system-wide effort to open an new frontier. Its radiators streched far out, slowly cooking at temperatures as hot as the corona of the sun, while deep inside, an fusion reactor provided the power for the life support functions and robotic units onboard. With its photon sail folded out, the vessel made an speeding dive near its home star, using its gravity to fling itself out of the system and its radiation to speed the sail along. Within a single month, the ship had flown past the orbit of Jool. Within a year, the craft had departed the system altogether. But onboard, not a single soul stirred. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommander Nedbob Kerman was sound asleep. Actually, he and his entire crew of thirty was sound asleep. They had set out from Kerbin on an voyage that would last five hundred years to another star system. Charging across interstellar space at 3,000 kilometers a second, they had raced out of the solar system, away from their family, away from their friends, away from everything they had ever known and ever had. And despite its breakneak speed - enough to circumavigate Kerbin five times in a second, turning the scenery into an majestic blur of colors, the starship would take centuries to arrive. The crew had long since entered their cryopods, leaving the journey for the onboard supercomputer to handle without manned interference. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll onboard was silent now, except for the occassional chittering of the many robots as they scurried to and fro, scaling the ships rigging, inspecting te antimatter rockets, and fixing any mechanical issue that arose on the voyage. The years ticked by, and the massive ramjet at the front of the vessel continued its scooping up of any stray particle for manufacture into fuel. The ship was at its top speed of one percent light speed, its antihydrogen tanks half spent despite the best efforts of the ramjet, which as now only functioning at half capacity. The reactor itself was beginning to show signs of its immense age, but onward the ship charged, their home sun now lost among the sea of stars. Their target star, Huones A twinkled in the distance, an stunning backdrop against the unforgiving velvet blackness of interstellar space. Finally, five hundred years after they set out, their starship, the Dawn Voyager One braked itself with its remaining antihydrogen fuel, settling into an low orbit around Huones Ab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdam woke up to the sound of hissing pipes as the cryopods all depressurized and spat out their occupants, dazed and confused. He grappled at several handles in the centerfuige chamber, slowly clambering his way to the Flight Deck. Slowly adjusting himself to the microgravity outside of the centerfuige chamber, he looked out the porthole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nedbob!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedbob stirred from his sleep. \u003Cem\u003EMuffins and pancakes\u003C/em\u003E, he thought, trying to return to his dream. \u003Cem\u003EBoosters and liquid rockets\u003C/em\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nedbob!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedbob woke up from his stupor as dazed and confused as the rest of his crew. Quickly recognizing the voice as Adams, he made his way to the flight deck. A small group was gathered around the Porthole, engaging in hushed conversation at the ocean planet below. Jebediah pushed his way through the crowd, then turned to face Adam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The planet, sir!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking through the hole, his heart sank. Bright lights shone on the planetary surface, and several clearly artifical constructs were orbiting the planet, coated in bright lights and small spacecraft docking and undocking in an flurry of activity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Should we attempt contact?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The inhabitants of the planet might not be friendly, sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Should we launch a preemptive strike and conquer it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn nanobot engineer by the name of Al spoke up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t think so. What if they are more advanced?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But we do have weaponary-\u0022, another Kerbal protested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You mean our asteroid defense system and whatever remains of our antimatter? Not a chance. Whoever lives down there is more advanced than us, heck, their stations are of an more efficent design than we last saw on Kerbin, and their cities shine brighter. We shouldn\u0027t awaken a sleeping giant.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But what about the mission? What now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedbob motioned toward the controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Adam, turn the reciever dish toward Kerbin.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir, I do-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s an order.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew gathered around the reciever, listening closely. Static began, with the usual background noises of cosmic radiation following - then, suddenly, came a burst of Kerbal languages, differently spoken, but still understandable, another, for another 20 years. Nedbob turned the controls toward Huoenes Ab, and the same sounds came out. Kerbals talking - in an more advanced language, but still speaking understandably and clearly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, great.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nedbob, we have a vessel apporaching us from aft, starboard. Should we signal them?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, go ahead.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENonbob slumped down, defeated. He had travelled 500 years to an remote planet, away from his friends and family, away from everything. He had sacraficed everything for this mission, only to find out that someone else had beaten him to it. An notice flashed on the status panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDOCKING PORT ONE OCCUPIED\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn Kerbal emerged from the airlock. He was dressed in an unidentifable uniform, and grinned at the crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sorry about that. We detected you after you entered the system, but we had to completely create an identical replica, of..uh, what was that thing in the history books again? Oh, the Clamp-O-Tron docking port! We had to ship it all the way from Kerbin on an faster-than-light vessel, an-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Woah, woah, slow down. You have faster than light?\u0022, Adam interjected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We invented it a whole century after you left. Some Kerbal astrophyiscist named Dr. Jenkens and his team of engineers, uh, I forgot some names. There was this Fanboy Kerbal scientist who worked with the docking functions of the FTL drive, allowing ships to dock while going at tremendous speeds, and there was another Kerbal who was building interplanetary shuttles with it. I don\u0027t remember. It can acclerate ships up to 10c and back down again.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wait, you know when we left Mun Station? And how the drive works?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure I do. You were the start of a first wave of sleeper ships. How the drive works is an state-controlled secret, only few have access to it, and I\u0027m not one of them. Are you guys hungry? We have a whole feast down in our shuttle.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedbob nodded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We certainly are\u0022, he declared, rising to his feet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Follow me then! Uh, how do you work the airlock?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Commander grinned silently, and opened the hatch to the shuttle below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__________________________________________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Anyways, sorry about that quick introduction. You Kerbals are like heros, seriously. Its like Jebediah Kerman himself shows up in person. I\u0027m really sorry about that, Huones Prime isn\u0027t mean\u0027t to host interstellar celebrities.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Huh?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We renamed it Huones Prime. Its got an big population, around a million.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedbob paused to poke at something on his plate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Whats this?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s Jias steak. Some form of animal on Jurosu A. They\u0027ve domesticated it an now use it like cattle. It\u0027s pretty good, the animal itself is way more efficent to be farmed for consumption than beef, and it tastes better.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Anyways, we\u0027ll have to send you back to the main dockyard in three hours.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Quarantine. As much as I hate to say it, they\u0027re afraid you got some viruses from pretty long ago on you. Your ship is \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E compared to this shuttle. Ned, since you\u0027re the Mission Commander, the property rights legally belong to you. You get to say if you want to sell it or not. It\u0027ll make a mighty fine musuem ship, mind you. It even has an vintage fusion reactor, even later ships used antimatter for electrical power. It\u0027s up to you, sell it, or keep it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ll have my crew decide. How long is quarantine?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Three days. They scan you on the fourth day to kill any viruses.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027ll be plenty of time for us to decide.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAl spoke up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So, Huones Prime, is it an independent faction or still an colony?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s an colony. We have the United Kerbin Outer Space Authority governing almost all the colonies of Kerbin. It\u0027s either that, lawlessness, or a transnational corporation. We dock with the station in half a hour. Your ship is already there, and its being serviced by our nanobot repairmen.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is spaceflight something that\u0027s still uncommon, or is it already mundane and typical?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mundane and typical. A trip outside this solar system is pretty common nowadays, but we still do have exploration vessels probing far-away systems. Some even operate at speeds of 100c!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E100c?\u003C/em\u003E, Nedbob thought. He quickly calculated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022100c, right? Isn\u0027t that one thousand, five hundred years to the nearest galaxy?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I believe so.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Do you have sleeper ships headed there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022None.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why not?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Noones volunteer-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal\u0027s eyes widened. He looked at the crew, each and every one of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You don\u0027t mean-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We mean exactly what we mean. We\u0027re going to sell the ship to an orbiting musuem, then use the money to purchase an exploratory starship, then transform it into another sleeper vessel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027ll name it the Dawn Voyager Two\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027ll be a 3,000 year round trip!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We aren\u0027t coming back, actually, we won\u0027t come back for a while, but eventually we will. That galaxy, Uisla, it\u0027s going to collide with our galaxy in ten billion years, so even if you don\u0027t build a faster ship, we\u0027ll still come home.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027ve just come here! And buying a starship like that is going to be expensive, your vessel couldn\u0027t cover half the costs!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Which is why I\u0027m asking you to help me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I would love to donate, but I can\u0027t cover the rest!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I mean, spread the news.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That,\u0022 he paused, then continued. \u0022That, I can do.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_______________________________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWord spread quickly. Within several months, Nedbob was once again at the helm of an starship, this time, one that was faster than light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was an massive vessel,powered by three anti-matter reactors and several onboard facilities that would produce matierals during the trip, letting the starship travel forever in space and time. His entire crew stayed with him, faithful to their captian. And a new addition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nedbob!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal who had greeted them from the first day of their arrival at Huones Prime was running toward them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why are you here?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I want to come with you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I want to explore!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedbob turned toward Adam. Adam shrugged. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We have three extra cryopods. He could fit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedbob smiled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well son, what\u0027s your name?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lucifer, sir!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lucifer, head to Cryopod 31. Buckle in, and have a safe trip. Next time you wake up, we\u0027ll be at another galaxy.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELucifer grinned, and shooked Nedbobs hand before running down the aisle and strapping himself inside the cryopod and pulling the cover over his head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_______________________________________________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022All systems ready!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger that!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedbob clambered into his cryopod. He looked out at the beautiful planet below, an shining oasis against the backdrop of space. \u003Cem\u003EDo I want to do this?\u003C/em\u003E, he wondered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe sighed, then pulled the glass cover over his head, and fell asleep, just as the engines began to roar...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[THE END]\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-11T21:41:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2014 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NASAFanboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T21:35:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShort but sweet - I like it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne minor nitpick - assuming that your kerbals are living in our universe, 1% lightspeed is 3,000 km/s (give or take), not 110,000 km/s. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
