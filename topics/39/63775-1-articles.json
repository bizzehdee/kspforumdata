I have thus, created the avatar of Professor Boone, a Kermin wanting to reach the \u0022Blue Heaven\u0022. I started by doing an odd \u0022Narrator thing\u0022 just to myself while playing. Like I\u0027m reading a story to myself. I than found myself naming rockets for missions, and purposes. Soon, the names started to have meanings. Much like I designed a rocket with the soul purpose of just getting out of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, and naming it Blue Heaven Mk1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing a step further, I used the description box that is accessible from the ships name, to give back story, details of the craft, and even failure to launch/flight accidents log. Getting really into this surprisingly, I thought maybe others might be interested in it, being that I seem to be enjoying creating it so much. I thought about playing some, and than maybe writing a bit of a story with how Professor Boone makes his journey into \u0022Blue Heaven\u0022 and what he does there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone think this sounds like something they would enjoy?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"randomness5555","CreatedById":53367,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T13:58:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, could be worth a try.
