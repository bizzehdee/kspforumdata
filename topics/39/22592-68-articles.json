We watched it last night. It was... very well done. Wouldn\u0027t say it was \u0027very good\u0027 overall. The jumping back and forth in time early on, the constant static (and most of it was viewed through the ship\u0027s on-board cameras) got really annoying. Yes, it tried to represent things realistically, and did that very well, but it seemed odd, and (I won\u0027t go into details. No spoilers) the ending seemed abrupt and they didn\u0027t seem to finalize things, even with Mission Controls few post commentaries at the end.
