After a couple months of no progress... \u003Cem\u003EToday\u003C/em\u003E I spoke to my boss at the machine shop about getting some time\u00A0on the bigger mill to mill out the openings to the main instrument panel. I also looked into ordering female header sockets with flying leads... Only to realize I\u0027m better off just soldering ribbon cable to the female header sockets I already have. Everyone sells individual pins for Arduinos... I want proper long sockets, and ebay is being stoopid\u2122 (that or I just haven\u0027t found the magic (key)words to search by). I want to use them to attach the diode ROMS to the LED driver board, which will mount behind the main DSKY LED display board. I want to figure out a good LED driver as well. I ordered MOSFETs and transistors MONTHS ago.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI need to stop by the screen printing shop and see if I can get an\u00A0official purchase order... That is, if they are still willing to print the tape for my tape meter radar altimeter. I\u0027ve unfortunately, had no replies regarding the images I submitted, so I\u0027m not actually sure what is even going on with them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy biggest worry is the software... I STILL have no real grasp on programming C... I think I can cobble together the basics like analog meters and toggles and digital displays, since there is already base code to start from for KSP serial IO, but the prospect of coding the software to run my FDAI is daunting... I understand what needs to happen, just not how to implement the code to do it.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n*EDIT*\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne more thing... I had mentioned a while ago (in the simpit repository) that the structural rail for the control panel slide interferes with the leftmost edgewise analog meter. It\u0027s the entire reason I went and sold some of my single meters and bought more double meters. It let me eliminate some of the single edgewise meters, reducing my count to just four of the edgewise meters int he front instrument panel.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of my justifications for this was I didn\u0027t want to cut into the meter housings... I am now tempted to do this. It occurs to me, that if I cut into one of the meter housings, I can shift the four meters slightly to the left side, and net myself a hair bit more space. I\u0027ve been concerned whether I have room for both the tape meter and the carriage meter. Moving the edgewise meters slightly over, even if it means cutting into a housing, gives me a bit more space to work with. Part of me is tempted to try to have a go at building the LED light boxes to direct the appropriate color LED illumination on the correct areas of the scales. I could check cut clearances then and see how that will turn out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-04T13:13:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2017 01:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HighFructose","CreatedById":180349,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-06T02:44:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow,\u00A0most of this is over my head, but I am glad this project is still alive.

I\u0027d have to figure it all out though... Hundreds, easily. Partly though, that\u0027s because I\u0027m buying premium parts. You can get analog meters for a few bucks, but I\u0027ve spent upwards of $10-40 a meter to get REALLY NICE ones. My FDAI cost a couple hundred bucks alone, and I still got it for an absolute steal. I spent way too much on LED displays alone, though to be fair, ebay refunded me for bad ones that came from China (skim the simpit repository I link to in the first message of my post to get the long term history of this project). I spent a lot on toggles with a fancy lever (and I\u0027m not even sure if I like that style now...). I spent $70 on\u00A0Futura typeface rubber stamps. I know I\u0027ve spent $20-80 from ebay, dig-key, and other online parts sources as few times each... I spent $40 on aluminum panels once.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLong story short...

My enclosure is mostly recycled materials that I got for free. The important thing, is that you can spend as much or as little as you like, to be fair. Max7219 modules from China are DIRT CHEAP... If you get a good one, you can have an entire array of LED displays for about $10-20. Cheap toggles are in a never ending supply. An Arduino clone is all you need (still go with a Mega), so there\u0027s no need to go with some overly expensive kit or official branded model. My mega cost $9.99 from Micro Center. It\u0027s entirely possible to keep costs down, if you limit the amount spent on parts, go with cheaper parts, and maybe even do a little salvage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-17T13:17:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228wQSKFv.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8wQSKFv.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSometimes, you have to suck it up, and start on the more mundane tasks...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI began cutting bits of copper sheet (actually, this particular sheet is VERY thin PC board material) and started work on the light boxes that will go into my five analog edgewise meters.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LI1R3hK.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LI1R3hK.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nProtoboard is cut and filed to fit the openings, and the edges of the copper traces soldered to secure the board to the light box.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00226N6kpD8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6N6kpD8.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese light boxes will contain red green and yellow LEDs to illuminate the colored portions of the analog edgewise meters correctly.

I\u0027m trying to decide whether to go with a stepper or a DC gear motor. To get a stepper with a threaded shaft is almost twice as much as a surplus DC motor that I found\u00A0with a similar threaded shaft. I\u0027d probably have an easier time controlling a stepper, but it\u0027s so bulky and expensive in comparison... The cheapest parts seem to be CNC and 3D printer parts, thanks to the volume those are seeing these days, but it\u0027s still approximately\u00A0$35 on average for the stepper alone, with the threaded output shaft. It seems linear bearings are pretty cheap, and I have some steel rods already, for my linear guide. Man, it\u0027s SO overkill. Literal CNC parts to move a pointer with LED displays on it. Everything cheap though... It doesn\u0027t have the reach. I could try a setup with some manner of long arm, hinged further back, and get a different assembly with about 90-95 mm of travel, but it seems like so much extra mechanical work, when I know exactly how to do the whole job with the CNC parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll I know, is I wanna order soon, cause I want to build the meter before it starts getting cold outside. I want time to make the meter (since it\u0027s the last instrument to be made or acquired), so I can know exactly how it\u0027ll turn out, and start placing parts and measuring to cut the main panel. I\u0027ll likely need to do that outside, so as to not bother the neighbors, thus outside. If it gets cold before I have all the instruments ready and measured... It probably won\u0027t happen again till next year, and likely no sooner than late April or May. And yes...

I also wanted the normal single meter to be my atmospheric density meter, since I had more room for the graphic.

I have to assume the scale always displays max density at whatever one local atmosphere of pressure at \u0022sea\u0022 level is? Like if I land at the lowest surface altitude at Duna...

I have it on my computer. I actually could see getting it for the switch as being reasonable, given the portability! Not only that, but since the Switch has keyboard support, why not hide full keyboard support in the game, along\u00A0with the regular console controls!\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u6OUN6f.jpg\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022u6OUN6f.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u6OUN6f.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022934\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo then, my second thought of the day revolves my translational hand control.

I got the controller from ebay, only cause I remembered the unique controller, thanks to my owning a Channel F as a kid. It\u0027s about as close as any controller ever got to the real translation controls on the Apollo and Shuttle vessels. I have no intention of modding the controller... I just want to make an opening where it can insert through, and then have a soft clamping mechanism to secure it. It\u0027ll plug in to a DIN-9 socket on the inside of the panel. That lets me preserve a vintage video game artifact, while still making use of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy actual second thought though, relates to where I am going to mount this. I\u0027d assumed that I was going to find some manner of\u00A0tiny corner of free space \u00A0on the instrument panel to mount this. After all, I\u0027d reduced my meter count to 4 meters, now that I have so many double meters, vs the old single meters. It occurs to me that there\u0027s really no obligation for the THC to actually be mounted INSIDE the panel at all... It does have a 9-pin D-sub connector, after all! I\u00A0could honestly mount it ANYWHERE in the desk, and it would work! Potential mounting points are just under or beside the left side of the control panel surface, or where my concept drawing currently shows the CRT box. The CRT box isn\u0027t happening anytime soon, and probably won\u0027t even fit there, so that space would be reasonable to utilize.\u00A0It\u0027s actually very similar to the location of the THC on the Space Shuttle, so I\u0027m more than cool with that. I can simply mount the clamps to the outside of the control panel, and have a cutout int he desk to make space for the\u00A0controller to pass through.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of these days, when i get more time, I\u0027ll try to update the concept art.

It\u0027s been an interesting road, learning how to use KiCAD. I\u0027m certain I will use it to do the FDAI synchro emulation board now. I really have no reason not to. I was considering going with OSH Park as supplier in the future for small boards, but man, my boss\u0027s (the machine shop)\u00A0supplier\u00A0is a place called Circuits West. Website ain\u0027t all that impressive, compared to OSH Park, but they offer a $31 special for up to 60 square inches (387 sq-cm)... That\u0027s 3x 6x10 inch (15x25 cm) PC boards for $31. That\u0027s actually pretty insane! Thing is... Their website makes it vague whether that\u0027s for all three boards or per board. They\u0027re not as fancy as the OSH Park boards, but it\u0027s a basic HASL (solder coating the copper instead of gold\u00A0plating), green solder mask, and white silkscreen, so it\u0027s not that bad... except another weirdly worded bit on the website makes it sound like only one of your three copies is plated... Seriously, if they wanted my business, they could have put more than 20 minutes into making their website. Went with OSH Park... And that marks the \u003Cem\u003Efirst\u003C/em\u003E time i\u0027ve ever designed a PC board from concept to manufacturing using CAD and a professional manufacturer!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aq3WUb7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022533\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/aq3WUb7.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0027s the backside. KiCAD has very bad tools for via stitching (none), so it takes a few extra \u0022hoops\u0022 to jump through to tie things like ground planes together over the board. Still, KiCAD is both free and open source. I\u0027m alright with that! I guarantee i could have done a better ground plane if I had tried, but It\u0027s in the \u0022good enough\u0022 range, and I really needed to get this manufactured... We already built our first batch of hall effect commutation sensor boards. These hall boards mount inside electric motors and tell the position of the rotor, based on sensing magnetic fields generated by a ring of magnets. A functioning board will always have on or two outputs the same, but never all three. It also has a pattern that changes based on direction of rotation. With this tester, we can hook it to a hall board to verify functionality (if an output is stuck on or off, eventually, as it switches through it\u0027s outputs, All three signals will end up being the same. This latches a fault detection circuit on, lights a fault LED, and requires a reset button be pushed to clear the fault. This lets us detect bad hall effect sensors or bad wiring or soldering (shorts or opens). In motors, if we spin the rotor by hand, and read the hall pattern, a motor wired incorrectly will show an incorrect pattern.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, on to where this is relevant to Kerbal stuff...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis marks a major change for me!

It literally will have three identical copies of everything except the input stage.\u00A0I can split the design so that three identical boards can be tied together at the ends to perform the job. i\u0027d only populate the input stage portion on one board, and jumper the signals across the other two boards.

That was a \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E pain in the retrograde... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0I also forgot to up the hole size for the pushbutton\u0027s alignment peg hole, and the two switch leads, since they were a bit thicker. I was able to make it fit by filing the square leads round, but again... \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E pain!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGood news, is making minor mistakes like this now means I\u0027m far less likely to make them in when designing future boards! As for future boards... I\u0027ve pretty much latched onto the plan to do the FDAI Syncro emulators professionally. Since most board manufacturers offer prototype boards in triplicate, I can simply do like I said, and make each board be 1/3 of the circuit. This will mean a few things... I need to decide whether each board will handle the DACs and amplifiers identically at the cost of using more components, or if I will conserve components with more crossover links between the three boards. Since each DAC and each Amplifier handle\u00A0two signals, and I need three signals per axis (for three axes), it means I need nine DACS and Amps. In an ideal circuit, I\u0027d use five DACS and five Amps, wasting only a single circuit. Going with three separate boards means I can\u0027t share one part across a pair of separate axes, without additional links between boards.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe part count isn\u0027t significant. I can add six DACs and six Amps without an issue, be it\u00A0space, complexity, or cost wise. The main consideration is communication. Over a serial bus, do I want to communicate with six devices instead of five? Do I have time to waste on an extra frame of data, when the micro running the show is busy with sine lookup tables and multiplications?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlternately, does it simply become easier to split it up the task?\u00A0If each axis is entirely separate, and entirely identical, then rather than have a single micro handle those calculations for all three axes, I could have three small micros handle the identical functions on one axis each, and only communicate with two DACs, rather than five or six. I guess I\u0027m erring on the side of six DACs and Amps, with three small micros, so\u00A0each axis is 100% independent from the other two. The only thing shared between them, is an inverted and a non-inverted 400 Hz sinusoidal reference frequency coming off a bit of vintage retro hardware, and the general serial bus for the main Arduino to retransmit received values to other devices. Each of the three micros would only need to sniff for it\u0027s specific axis value, and only process that, and nothing else.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHmm... I was pretty broke when I ordered the DACs... I might need to order one more, if I went super cheap and just ordered five...\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0027s the blank board, as it came from the manufacturer.

I need to trace out one issue, and make another adjustment. The green LEDs are almost painfully blinding, so I\u0027m just gonna pop a bigger value resistor in to dim them. The red fault LED in the reset switch is kinda dim, so I\u0027m gonna boost that one by reducing the resistance to it.\u00A0I\u0027ve already run the circuit on a simulation, so I know it works, but I have one of two fault conditions not triggering the fault latch. I figure I either made a dumb mistake in the layout, and have to bodge a wire in, or I have a bad solder joint. Nothing too critical. Minus that one problem, nothing to serious. This is for one of my employers. It\u0027s used to test hall\u00A0effect (magnetic) commutation sensors used in brushless motors. I\u0027m particularly happy that the power supply worked, first try. As I said, it\u0027s my very first switching supply.

Since the schematic showed it as not connected, I did the same. I never even considered it during the design phase.\u00A0I couldn\u0027t figure out why the circuit was only getting 3 volts (straight off the pair of AA batteries), instead of the 5 volts it was supposed to generate. Discovered the problem because it would go away if I simply touched the shutdown pin. The residual electrical charge \u003Cem\u003Ein my finger\u003C/em\u003E was enough to activate the chip. Fixed it with a small resistor jumping it to the power source, to activate it whenever the power switch is turned on... That was a dumb mistake...

Somehow, when I decided to use the spare inverter gates to buffer the input, I SOMEHOW managed to leave half the fault detection circuit\u0027s inputs on the input side of the inverter gates... but took the other half and moved them over to the output side. What that meant, was that the circuit that was meant to detect if all three sensor inputs were logic high (5 volts) at the same time worked, but the circuit that detected if all three Hall sensor inputs were logic low (0 volts) would instead see the opposite, and so it would ONLY trigger when the other circuit was already triggering, and even then, it\u0027d give the wrong output anyway.

Granted, I tend to only get 8-24 hours in a month period. It\u0027s not full time. Still, I\u0027d say that I feel like I need to do about 50\u002B hours by the end of the month to catch up to where I\u0027d like to be... And the month is drawing quickly to a close. I\u0027ve already stated the problem with my current job. Having two people work a job that\u0027s clearly a three person job is \u003Cem\u003Estressful!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0They just don\u0027t grasp the concept!\u00A0At the end of the day, I am sore, I am tired, I have no energy left. I AM most definitely burning out, and losing my patience. At the end of the day, I have to make a choice... Do I go in to the other job, drive out there, work a couple hours, and leave at 9 or 10 PM (21-22:00 for those who use a 24 hour clock), head back into town, and then get up in the morning to work at 8 or 9, and have to repeat that for 3-4 days, cause I can\u0027t get enough hours free to just go in and power through everything in two days... Or do I just go home and fall asleep early, cause I got nothing left in me?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSure, I could power through. I\u0027ve done all nighters before. I\u0027ve done low sleep...

Sick for the entire month, never getting better. The other issue with going into the shop tired, is if I screw up, it could cost quite a lot. If a cable is $10 a foot for\u00A0the raw material, and you have a 10 foot cable... Maybe I get the cables assembled, only to discover that I miswired them, cause I was tired and swapped the yellow and white wires. Gotta redo an end then!\u00A0Say I\u0027m so tired, I screw up something else up and\u00A0the repair ends up leaving the cable short for it\u0027s minimum tolerance... That would be a loss of $100 on the spot. Boom! Gone!\u00A0That doesn\u0027t even count parts I couldn\u0027t reuse in assembling either end. If I am tired and I drop a brake assembly, for a different product... Oh bummer, there goes the smooth bore of the bearings. Gotta tear \u0027em out and replace them. If I cut down a wire on the assembly too short, or I solder every connection wrong cause I was tired and rotated a part 180\u00B0... Yeah, there\u0027s SERIOUS potential to screw up when tired, and at that job, \u003Cem\u003Escrew ups can be expensive\u003C/em\u003E.

But dang it! It\u0027s taking so long to work out the kinks! Even if it saves time in the long run, I strongly suspect we\u0027ll initially be slower at it... I just want this stupidity to end.
