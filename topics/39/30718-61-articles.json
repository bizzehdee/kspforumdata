We don\u2019t find the Captain \u2013 we keep right on walking till we hit the forward operating base. There\u2019s got to be\u003C/em\u003E something \u003Cem\u003Eto eat in this Kerm-forsaken wilderness, even if we have to eat it raw\u003C/em\u003E. He turned his head, surreptitiously checking the soldier to his left for any sign of limping, then quickly looking away. Oblivious to the attention from his sergeant, the soldier marched on, swearing in an undertone as he caught a tussock of grass with his toe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImperceptibly at first, the horizon began to lighten, the distant mountains emerging from their midnight veil. The weight on Chadmore\u2019s back seemed to lessen, as he looked up and found what he\u2019d been looking for. Far off to his right, a reassuringly familiar W-shaped mountain pass stood silhouetted against the pre-dawn sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlatoon \u2013 halt.\u201D The murmured command rippled down the skirmish lines, as the Kolan soldiers gathered round their sergeant. Chadmore turned on the spot, taking bearings on the mountain pass and other landmarks long since drilled into him. He spread out his map on a nearby rock and pulled out his flashlight. \u201CHold this. Everyone else \u2013 eyes out.\u201D Blinking against the sudden piercing brightness, he, unclipped his compass from its wristband, pulled out a coiled-up length of thin steel tape from its recess underneath and busied himself with his map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019ll do it.\u201D Chadmore straightened up. \u201CJust like this whole operation, good kerbals, we\u2019re going south. Another five or six klicks will take us into the designated sector, at which point we find the nearest lump of grass to hide behind and wait for the pickup. Let\u2019s move.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis troops nodded and, moving back into their skirmish lines, resumed their march. At dawn, when Chadmore finally called a halt, they found themselves in the midst of a vast expanse of almost featureless prairie, carpeted in patches of dense, bristly undergrowth that barely reached over their boots. Needing no prompting, they spread out into a loose circle around their sergeant and his radio operator, before dropping to the ground, rifles at the ready.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDelta Command, First platoon.

Bearings and points are as follows.\u201D Chadmore glanced at the pairs of numbers scribbled on the back of his hand and read them off, waiting for his compay commander to verify each pair before continuing. \u201CThere\u2019s not a lot of cover out here, sir. Would appreciate an evac, soonest.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CSit tight, Chad. ETA thirty minutes.

Then, at last, a cluster of dark specks appeared on the horizon and sped towards them. At a shouted order, the Kolan troops crawled into line, weapons braced against their shoulders. In the distance, the oncoming convoy fanned out and slowed to almost walking pace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COn your feet!\u201D Chadmore sprang up and raised a hand, rifle pointed at the ground, the rest of his troops following his example. They were quickly surrounded by armoured vehicles, the Kolan flag painted across their hoods. Hatches popped open and soldiers poured out, grabbing packs and kitbags from Chadmore\u2019s troops and slinging them aboard. Moments later, they shot off across the tundra, racing the rising sun, and leaving nothing behind but shallow dents in the undergrowth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time the convoy arrived, the Kolan forward operating base was abuzz with activity, soldiers hurrying to load the last of their equipment and ammunition into waiting trucks. As Chadmore climbed out of his armoured car, a lone kerbal walked over to the flagpole standing in the middle of the base. With a heavy heart, Chadmore watched the hand painted banners come to half mast and then lower, the flag of all Kerbin and a picture of a stylised rocket streaming fire, collapsing against the pole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPermission to speak freely, sir?\u201D He waited for a nod of assent from his commander. \u201CWhat\u2019s going on? Where are the reinforcements? And where in the seven smoking hells was our air cover out there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDenied, denied, and shot down, in that order.\u201D His commanding officer clenched his jaw. \u201CAfter the foul-up at Humilisia, we barely managed to hold the line at Foxham.

The healing vine twitched, crawling over his internal organs, the combination of pressure and ticklish movement making him queasy. Something slimy trickled over his stomach and he closed his eyes, resisting the temptation to look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA towel dabbed at the moisture. \u201CYou\u2019re doing fine, Professor. Another five centimetres unless I my eyes deceive me.\u201D Gentle fingers palpated the ridge around his waist. \u201CIf you manage to keep this up, the vine will be out in another three days.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne down, many more to go,\u201D said Erlin with a sigh. He tipped his head back, peering at the leaves over his head, the sigh taking on a note of wonder. \u201CAlthough\u2026 abrath af kerbal akhad.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe medic blinked. \u201CSomething, something, no kerbal?\u201D He unknotted the bandage wrapped around Erlin\u2019s lower torso and began to unwind it. \u201CCould you lift your back for me please?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe wouldn\u2019t trade places with any kerbal,\u201D Gusemy supplied from the corner. \u201CAnd I\u2019d hope not, given the trouble he put us all to, to get there.\u201D He threw a mock scowl at Erlin which didn\u2019t quite conceal the concern behind his eyes. The medic looked up disapprovingly at his flippant tone then, seeing his expression, offered him a faint smile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo indeed.\u201D He turned back to Erlin. \u201CThis is going to sting I\u2019m afraid.\u201D The dressing pulled away with a ripping noise and a muffled yelp from his patient. \u201CAhh, very good. Secondary swelling is down and the exit wounds are healing nicely. The medic removed a fresh dressing from his bag and unwrapped it. \u201CLittle bit of seepage still, so I\u2019ll put another of these on but I think it might be the last one you need.\u201D He looked up at the Kerm trunk behind the bed. \u201CYou can tell Obrinn that he\u2019s doing an excellent job.\u201D He pressed a second dressing into place and began winding a clean bandage around Erlin\u2019s middle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou should tell him yourself. You\u0027ve already Communed with Elton after all.\u0022 Erlin gestured at the leaf cluster over his head ignoring the medic\u0027s disbelieving look. \u201CI\u2019m quite serious. Obrinn worries about hurting me with his vines and he\u2019d appreciate a trained kerbal expert telling him that I\u2019m healing well and that everything is alright.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy\u2019s jaw dropped open. \u201CHe does what?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe worries about me. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve stopped Communing with him whilst he\u2019s moving the vines \u2013 he senses the pain and it makes him nervous and upset. Which then makes him clumsy.\u201D Erlin lifted his hands. \u201CYou can see the problem, I think.\u201D He sighed. \u201CAnd yes, Gus \u2013 the thought had occurred to me. If we could get the world in here to witness a Kerm getting upset about hurting a kerbal, it might solve a lot of problems.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think it would,\u201D the medic said soberly. He tied off Erlin\u2019s bandage, eyeing Obrinn\u2019s branches with a mixture of hopefulness and trepidation. \u201CI could speak to him now, if you\u2019re sure he\u2019d want to?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m certain he\u2019d want to.\u201D Erlin clasped his hands to his stomach and cautiously sat up. \u201CBetter if I don\u2019t join you, so you can talk without my thoughts getting in the way, but let him know that I sent you. He hasn\u2019t had a chance to Commune with too many other kerbals yet and I think he gets a bit shy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA shy Kerm?\u201D The medic shook his head. \u201CNow I really have heard it all.\u201D He lay down on one the beds left in the hut after Obrinn\u2019s awakening, tucked a pillow under his neck and resolutely lifted his head towards the waiting leaf cluster. Erlin and Gusemy watched him stiffen as the leaf hairs slipped under his scalp, and then go limp, an incredulous smile spreading across his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That looks like a good sign.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin glanced up at Obrinn\u0027s slowly waving branches. \u0022He doesn\u0027t seem too upset, no.\u0022 He sniffed. \u0022Bit more cinnamon than usual though. Curiosity maybe? Difficult to tell from out here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They don\u0027t have the easiest body language to read,\u0022 Gusemy said straight-faced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin gave him a look before lying back on his bed, wincing slightly as his bandages shifted with the movement. The two kerbals settled into a companionable silence, broken only by the wind chasing through the eaves of Erlin\u0027s hut and the rustling of Kerm leaves. Erlin\u0027s eyelids began to droop when a blast of cinnamon and an alarming creaking noise jolted him awake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy came to with a start, eyes widening at the outstretched branches and splayed open leaf clusters overhead. The clusters snapped shut before opening more slowly, waves of movement rippling across the ceiling, twigs and branches waving with them. There was a groan from the other bed and the medic sat up, rubbing his temples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What on Kerbin did you say to him?\u0022 Erlin\u0027s voice cut across the rustling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe received a peculiar look in reply, exasperation and laughter, vying with too many other emotions to read. \u0022You\u0027ve never had kerblets have you, Professor?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin blinked. \u0022No. Why?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe medic shook his head, muttering something inaudible. \u0022He\u0027s not shy you great... he\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Elonely\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s lonely. Of course he is - nobody to talk to but old kerbals. Well-meaning kerbals,\u0022 the medic added hastily. \u0022But kerbals nonetheless. Nobody like him to talk to - no Kerm.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Elton,\u0022 said Gusemy suddenly. \u0022You told him about Elton.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I did.\u0022 For a moment he medic looked defensive. \u0022He\u0027s the only other Kerm I\u0027ve ever Communed with - it was hard not to.\u0022 He frowned. \u0022Besides, I got the strong impression that I was only confirming what he already knew. Or thought he knew. It was all a bit vague.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin shivered, feeling the ghostly impact of Kerm shards slicing into his skull as a forlorn figure turned his back on him and faded away.\u00A0 \u0022It would be. I wasn\u0027t an-Kerm... I doubt we were linked for long enough for him to get more than a fleeting impression.\u0022 His gaze turned inward. \u0022And ever since Obrinn awoke, I\u0027ve been too taken up with him to think much about Elton.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe medic gave him a look but didn\u0027t answer. From his corner, Gusemy snorted softly. \u0022Didn\u0027t want to think about him you mean. Or Jonelle for that matter. Although I don\u0027t blame you. Too many awkward questions to answer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin jerked his head up, the half-formed protest on his lips wilting at the sight of Gusemy\u0027s sympathetic expression. He sighed. \u0022Yes. Far too many.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It might be easier if all three of you were there to answer some of those questions,\u0022 the medic offered. \u0022Both of you and Obrett.\u00A0 Obrinn asked me to tell you that he\u0027d very much like to speak to Elton, so it would probably be better if he knew who he - and Jonelle - were first.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy\u0027s jaw dropped open again. \u0022He wants to talk to\u003Cem\u003E Elton\u003C/em\u003E? And how in the name of the Twelve Pillars and all their wonderful ways is he going to do that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe received a shrug in reply. \u0022I have no idea - I\u0027m a doctor not a Kerm expert.\u0022 The medic raised his hands. \u0022But if we can\u0027t find somebody at Kerbin\u0027s premier Kerm research organisation who can help, then I don\u0027t know where else we\u0027re going to look.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin\u0027s voice was distant as he stared at the corner of his hut. \u0022Actually, Gus... If we could find the right species balance... Long lateral root systems \u2013 hmmm, an induced synomonic array might be better for long distance signal transduction. Bryophytes for preference for ease of maintenance.\u0022 He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u0022Not straightforward by any means and we\u0027d need to teach all three of the Kerm how to use whatever system we come up with...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin looked up, a slightly abstracted look on his face. \u0022Could you bring Halsy down with you this afternoon, Gus.

The wind keened through the radiator grille of Chadmore\u2019s car in a discordant wail that set his teeth on edge even over the sound of the engine. They sped up a shallow incline, swinging round to parallel the skyline.

We\u2019d just hoped you could spare a few more.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COur shipyards are working flat out to replace our losses at Humilisia and Foxham.\u201D Fleet Commander Gusden massaged his temples. \u201CBut the Kerm seed checkpoints are slowing us down, even with security exempted transport and some unofficial civilian help to move the necessary materiel.\u201D He looked up. \u201CYou\u2019ll get me and the Regionality plus supporting vessels and as many anti-aircraft capable ships as we could detach.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen between us we shall make that enough.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusden nodded. \u201CWe shall.\u201D He opened his cabin door. \u201CAfter you, Admiral.\u201D He led his Wakiran opposite number up to the Regionality of Kolus\u2019s main deck, where an honour guard of Kolan and Wakiran marines awaited them. Around them, resupply operations continued unabated, a steady stream of shells zipping down the highlines from one logistics support vessel and being hauled over to the magazine hoists by a bucket chain of sailors. Portside, a second shift of sailors were rigging the fuel lines from a second support vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne three-tone whistle sounded over the waves followed by a second, differently pitched one, signalling that two more ships in the taskforce were on station and ready to receive supplies. Out of the corner of one eye, Gusden watched yet another logistics support vessel heave to alongside the nearest Wakiran destroyer and, with a sudden flat boom from its air cannon, launch a guideline towards the combat vessel. Around them, the rest of the task force rode at anchor, by orders of both Gusden and his Wakiran counterpart, both flag officers chafing at the delay but unwilling to risk the additional complications of underway resupply with so many auxiliary vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a discreet cough, the Wakiran admiral saluted him. \u201CFair winds and Kerm speed, Gus. For Nordham Bay.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFor Nordham Bay.\u201D Gusden returned the salute. \u201CWisdom of the Kerm, Admiral. And may you have the strength to follow your course.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n---------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey drove through a sea of canvas, the few faces that turned to watch them go staring through them rather than at them. Civilians and soldiers alike huddled around their tents, ragged and filthy, ponchos mingling with Kolan and Wakiran uniforms. Elsewhere, figures lay on temporary cots, some whimpering or crying out, others white-faced and dead-eyed, too spent to notice their injuries or watch the silent work crew struggling to erect a marquee over them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClouds of black smoke stained the horizon, a backdrop to the distant lines of refugees still fleeing the burning city. A motley assortment of armoured vehicles fled with them, the larger troop transports picking up what few civilians they could, dropping them at the camp before turning around and going back for more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor an instant, images of an empty hillside and deserted highway dancing mockingly before Chadmore\u2019s eyes. \u003Cem\u003EThey faked us but good, Chad \u2013 and this is the price we paid.\u003C/em\u003E His knuckles turned white against his steering wheel. \u003Cem\u003EAll we can do now is try and make a difference. Stop things from getting worse.\u003C/em\u003E His thoughts flicked back to a trampled down swathe of tundra and a young officer with copper-brown eyes. \u003Cem\u003EAt least you got out of this mess, Valentina. I wonder what little brother Al has you doing now?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second convoy cleared the last of the roadside tents, Chadmore\u2019s armoured car in the lead. Turning off the main road, they drove across country, skirting around the outskirts of abandoned Groves and redfruit orchards, the ripening fruit providing an incongruous splash of colour against the sooty skyline. They reached the edge of the airfield, the terminal buildings and air traffic control tower still standing at the far side of the runways. Then, at a terse radioed command, they charged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tanks went in first, smashing down sections of chain-link fence, their tracks tearing up the runway and leaving chunks of ripped-up asphalt in their wake. The lighter vehicles poured through the gaps, racing around the perimeter and converging on the airport buildings from all sides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA salvo of rockets screamed low across the ground, slamming into the lead tank and bursting into flames. Another salvo ripped into the tank behind it, setting off its ammunition racks and blowing its turret skyward in a deafening explosion. The Wakiran crews returned fire, shelling jet blast deflectors and anything else that offered the slightest bit of cover to the enemy infantry. Heavy machine guns opened up with a roar, laying down a vicious suppressing fire. Soldier after Firesvarn soldier died in a ghastly mist of blood and fragmented bone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut where one soldier fell, another two rose up in their place. Coordinated salvos gave way to sniping, missiles slamming into the oncoming tanks from too many sides for their gunners to track. One by one, the heavily armoured vehicles went up in flames.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n--------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTen o\u2019 clock low!\u201D Chadmore wrenched at his steering wheel, the back end of his armoured car skidding out, studded tires squealing in protest. The staccato thumping of autocannon fire sounded over his head, his gunner reducing the Firesvarn machine gun post to a tangle of twisted wreckage and smashed concrete. \u00A0A fireball to his right marked the abrupt demise of another Firesvarn installation and then they were through, bearing down on the airport buildings. A Kolan vehicle hurtled off the runway, fishtailing wildly as its driver fought to avoid incoming fire from yet another direction. It struck a flat grey object and disappeared in an eruption of burning fuel and detonating ammunition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMines, mines, mines!\u201D Chadmore swerved, another Kolan vehicle exploding behind him. \u201CStay on the runways \u2013 they need those!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CIncoming!\u201D\u003C/em\u003E Chadmore recognised the panicked yell of his section leader. \u003Cem\u003E\u201CFiresvarn at our three!\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CI got something!

By the numbers \u2013 rolling retreat. Any sefflek coming home with ammo left will be answering to me!\u201D \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA thunderous detonation from outside cut off any replies from his troops. His vehicle lurched under him, the blast lifting it onto two wheels, fragments of shrapnel and concrete clanging against its armour. He felt something snap and the steering wheel went slack in his hand, the armoured car skidding sideways and flipping onto its roof. Chadmore just had time to register a choked-off scream from beneath his head, before everything went black.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n---------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey can\u2019t do this to you.\u201D His sister-in-law\u2019s voice caught in her throat. \u201CThey promised you a month off and you need it.\u201D She looked at her brother in law, his immaculately pressed uniform unable to hide the slump in his shoulders or the engrained creases at the corners of his eyes. \u201CGusden wouldn\u2019t let you onboard any of his ships, looking like that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGusden should listen to himself. How long has he been at sea now?\u201D The look in the other\u2019s eyes told him all he needed to know. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, sis,\u201D he said more gently. \u201CThat was unkind.\u201D He pulled his sister-in-law into a brief hug before bending down to pick up his kitbag. \u201CI just wish that either of us had the choice.\u201D He sensed a sudden tension in the air. \u201CWhat is it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt looks like you\u2019re getting escorted back to base.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFirst I heard about it.\u201D The officer turned to face the living room window and froze, weariness turning to sick despair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA black car with military plates was parked outside, the pennant of the Kolan Border Security forces flying from its hood. He watched the passenger door open and a uniformed kerbal climb out. Silent hatred convulsed him, hatred for the other\u2019s polished black boots, for the medals pinned to his dress sash, for the carefully sympathetic expression settling over his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a knock, his sister-in-law already in the hallway, waiting by the door for her guest. He heard a murmur of polite greetings followed by the sound of the front door closing and the scraping of chair legs against tiled floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlease sit down, ma\u2019am.

He barked a laugh. \u003Cem\u003EAnd the Kerm are what it comes down to in the end, doesn\u2019t it? \u003C/em\u003EHis brief bravado crumbled. \u003Cem\u003ESo, what in the First Grove are you doing?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe episode of \u003Cem\u003EEngines and Engineers \u003C/em\u003Eran through his head like a mantra.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u2026that\u0027s a big If, Tom and at the moment I\u0027m not about to promise anything either way.

Analysing the exhaust gases will give our scientists a lot of valuable data about the nuclear reactor and how well it stands up to being treated as a rocket. So, we\u2019ll trapping them and storing them somewhere safely underground.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThat\u2019s reassuring to hear.

As best I understand it, the hottest fission products are also the most unstable, so don\u2019t stay nuclear hot for very long. A few months maybe, or a couple of years. The reactor is still nuclear warm for many years after that \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t use it to heat my moss room.\u201D A polite chuckle rippled through the audience. \u201CBut most of the radioactivity is released in the first few months.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CAnd that\u2019s a good answer too \u2013 thank you Hanbal.

He straightened the blanket on his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003Ecot\u003C/abbr\u003E, pulling it taut and tucking it under the mattress. His hand reached for his collar insignia but then he shook his head. Unsnapping his belt holster, he withdrew his sidearm, unloaded it, and laid the ammunition and empty weapon on the centre of his bed. Then he turned on his heel and marched out of the room, not bothering\u00A0 to lock the door behind him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mess hall was emptying out as he arrived, the catering logistics personnel sweeping the floor and stacking the chairs.

As expected, he found Lieutenant Lenger and his troops gathered by a logistics support vehicle. They came to attention as he approached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAt ease,\u201D The officer inspected the LSV, water bowser already hitched, its beige-and-tan camouflage paint washed out by the glare overhead. \u201CMr Lenger, are we ready?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSir.\u201D Lenger pointed at the armoured personnel carrier parked two spaces back from the LSV, driver just visible through the forward slit window. \u201COn your orders, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery well. To victory, good kerbals. To victory.\u201D The officer watched Lieutenant Lenger and his troops climb into the back of the APC before swinging himself up into the LSV cab. Engines grumbling, the two vehicles pulled out of the parking lot and drove towards the compound gates, stopping in front of the armed guards barring their way. One of them, wearing a sergeant\u2019s insignia on his collar and a stony expression on his face, marched towards them, only to snap to attention as he caught sight of the officer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravely, the officer returned his salute before gesturing at the gates with a chopping motion. The sergeant turned and barked an order at her guards, who scrambled to obey. Moments later, the armoured convoy rumbled out of the compound, gates closing behind them, and turned onto the main road. They came to a junction and turned right, following the signpost to Balcabar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe officer stared into the night as the APC turned onto the Balcabar bypass, the eyes of some unidentified creature gleaming briefly from the side of the road.
