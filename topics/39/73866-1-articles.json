I can\u0027t believe we chose such a pretentious name. There is no way that will not return to haunt us. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur five days in interplanetary space have been rather uneventful so far. All systems operating normally, fusion drives haven\u0027t exploded, not even a stopped toilet.

Apparently the eggheads are working to create a, quote, foldspace drive.
