It was supposed to be few years mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would carried 1 manned and 1 unmanned Lander for every type of planet. In front you see big SUN shield, as protection against radiation and Sun when they reach the biggest influence of sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ny0H4WJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ny0H4WJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly I realized that even if I finished the ship, and attached fuel tanks and rockets, it would not have enough power to get it anywhere ( or it would take hours to even get to moon) because the ship was HUGE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least I have some nice screenshots xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DsOhRrE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DsOhRrE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YK6E1i7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YK6E1i7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5p9NUk7.png\u0022 alt=\u00225p9NUk7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krevsin","CreatedById":83150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T20:25:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enah, attach 5 clusters of 4 stock Nuclear engines to those docking ports and you are golden!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esure, it will take a while, but the Kerbals won\u0027t mind. just use timewarp to speed up the boring bits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estill, this is an amazing-looking ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T20:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThrust is pointless in space.
