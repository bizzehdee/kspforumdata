It might have been better to post the complete prologue, see what people thought of that and take things from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, it\u0027s a very interesting start. Lots of questions to explore and I can imagine the actual story going in lots of possible ways.

Well not the school part but work definitely cuts into the writing time! It\u0027s a bit cliched but I find it useful to keep a notebook handy, so even if I\u0027m not finding the time to actually sit down and write, I\u0027m still managing to scribble down any new ideas for the story as and when I get them. It\u0027s amazing what having a spare hour on the morning commute can do. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
