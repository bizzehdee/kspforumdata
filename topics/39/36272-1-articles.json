I\u0027ve been peeking on this forum for quite a while, only today I\u0027ve decided to actually make an account and participate here, to give you the people news about what I\u0027ve been working on recently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made many logs/journals/reports on many games including Kerbal Space Program, but only recently I\u0027ve decided to make one entirely public. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo this isn\u0027t a story, this is an ongoing space program (making it\u0027s first baby steps) and it\u0027s going big. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow I have links to a Tumblr account and a Youtube one. Already filled with some content, but what\u0027s bigger is the world behind it. One of the first thing I did on the tumblr account was to publish a map showing the only two nations on Kerbin. The whole world has already been created, and it\u0027s alive!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike other space programs, this one is not the main character, it\u0027s not the center of Kerbin, this space program is part of a Nation, in war with another one, and as a viewer, you can only see one side, and that is the side of the USKR. In a cold war with the UKS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbals are on a different time-scale, their whole world is smaller, but there are still some challenges, political ones, economical ones, at this stage most of the USKR population haven\u0027t even heard of the Official USKR Space Program, news are slowly coming in, people hear more and more about it, you are the people, witnessing the USKR Space program slowly grow up, going farther, giving better data, sending better pictures, better video quality, more people, better organisation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe earlier you join, the more progress you\u0027ll witness, and now is the time, because the USKR is still using solid fuel rockets to try to get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope I convinced you to take a look, and see you around!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialUSKRprogram/videos\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialUSKRprogram/videos\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://officialuskrspaceprogram.tumblr.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://officialuskrspaceprogram.tumblr.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
