He always found the floors that the offices were unsettling. The whole section was a stark matte white, straight lines, and right angles. He always felt that lines were too straight and the angles too right. A small part of him thought that something was wrong with geometry here. That, maybe, he could walk a circle here turning right only three times. Perhaps worse, walk the same loop backwards having to turn left five times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe walked past jars, each hand labeled with numbers in a precise script. He knew from previous trips they were filled beans. Occasionally there was a full jar with a small number. These were full of corn, rice, marbles, or something else. He paused in front of a new jar. It had two numbers on it. It was filled with peas. He shuddered at the thought of that fight, and that it could still be going on. Sometimes Mortimer and his staff scared him more than Katherine and her computers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe walked past one of Mortimer\u2019s computer pools. The synchronized, metronomic sound of their adding machines furthered his unease. He felt his steps begin to match the pace of the calculations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe walked into Mortimer\u2019s office. Mortimer looked up from the spreadsheet he was working on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood afternoon, Mortimer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMortimer paused. \u201CGood afternoon Linus. Those are Wernher\u2019s budgets?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes.\u201D Linus placed the folders on the desk. \u201CBoth actual and projected.\u201D He paused. \u201CI tried to clean them up. But, I don\u2019t know how much it helped.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMortimer opened one of the folders. His brow furrowed as he looked at the first few sheets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u201D he put the folder back. \u201CI would not fault your efforts, given the material you have to work with.\u201D He sighed. \u201CYour efforts are appreciated, even if for some they are unnoticed. If any clarifications are needed I will be in contact.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank-you.\u201D Linus turned to leave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0He rushed past the computer pool before his pace could match theirs. Not for the first time, he wondered how someone could work with this group and not be driven mad. He worried, next, they may already have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-16T10:00:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2019 10:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by steuben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
