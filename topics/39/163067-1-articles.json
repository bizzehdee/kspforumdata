No kerbal had left the home planet since the astronauts had returned from Minnmus Exploration Mission Two and, upon seeing the dead planet, knew that Kerbin was never meant for Kerbalkind. They fired off their last five rockets on an ill-fated colonization mission to Laythe- only to hear a signal from the survivors two hours after the escape burn was completed. They perished when their aerobrake at Laythe proved to be too zealous- and since then nobody had left Kerbin. Now, Station One had been completed, and it was time to bring back the bones of the colonization party...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwenty-five years after that, Station One was practically a derelict floating in orbit. The only kerbals who were still there were either hustlers, smugglers, gamblers, or anyone else who thought they could make a quick buck. Some of them did, some of them didn\u0027t, and some of them just sat around the distillery and had another ale. However, they all had one thing in common:\u00A0At one time or another, they had all been down on their luck- with one exception.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHudson Kerman knew that he was the luckiest kerbal alive when he got off the Number Nine shuttle to Station One and saw the sign advertising Jeb\u0027s Dropship Services. It said, \u0022No questions asked.\u0022 And that was why Hudson had come to the station in the first place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-05T02:22:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2019 02:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Confused Scientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Confused Scientist","CreatedById":179591,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-10T00:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia, serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:28px;\u0022\u003EBOOK ONE\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nChapter 1- Station One\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb floated in Centrifuge 4. Only number two still spun, and the station managers had even had to turn that back. Business had been slow for months;\u00A0ever since the Colossus II injection station had opened, passerby had decreased even more than usual. The Number Nine shuttle would be the first vehicle to visit in quite a while, and it would only carry three passengers- and two of them were just along for the ride before the shuttle went to Colossus II. Jeb wondered what the deal with the other kerbal\u00A0was- after all, the only thing that wasn\u0027t smuggled into the station was money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe spun around and floated up the ladder. Bill and Bob were waiting for him at the distillery. \u0022How\u0027s the ship?\u0022\u00A0he asked Bill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why should I care? It doesn\u0027t have anywhere to go,\u0022 he replied. Jeb sighed. It didn\u0027t cost very much to live at the station, but they hadn\u0027t gotten a customer in months. With Munbase Two construction booming, all of the big tug and dropship companies were expanding, building, and improving. The truth was, nobody needed Station One anymore, and nobody came. Even the Number Nine shuttle only flew to deliver spare parts to the rundown station. The shuttle was somewhere out there, and it must be closing fast, if it was going to-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA bang echoed through the station. Jeb recognized the sound as the old docking port, whose retraction systems had broke and now caused excess noise every time it compressed- which, at this point, was once every few months. There was no official schedule for the Number Nine shuttle anymore, and soon it might stop running entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new arrival would be crawling through the hatch right about now. Rumor had it that he was an engineer whose job it was to survey the station and find a reason to decommission it- it was costing the United Kerbin an obscene amount of money to keep it up and running. However, that might not be true- as Jeb rounded the bend in the centrifuge, he could see the shuttle unloading a Mark 15 lander and maneuvering it to an adjacent docking port. Clearly, it belonged to the engineer- \u003Cem\u003EWhat is his name?\u003C/em\u003E- and he wanted to go to the Mun. And Jeb could tell just by looking at it that it didn\u0027t have enough fuel\u00A0for the transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was sprinting toward the docking module to intercept the passenger on the way out. On the way there, he was mentally rehearsing what he would say to that engineer to get him to choose Jeb\u0027s Dropship Services.\u00A0There were other kerbals at this station who wanted to steal his business, and Jeb wasn\u0027t about to let that happen. He would intercept that engineer- Hudson, that was his name- and convince him that this kerbal he\u0027d never met before was the best option to get away from this station as soon as possible. He\u0027d have quite a time convincing Hudson to be his customer- after all, they\u0027d never met.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is why Jeb was so startled when he heard a strange voice say, \u0022Jeb Kerman- just the kerbal I was looking for.

However, more often than not we\u0027ll just cut your craft loose during transit-\u00A0 spacecraft coming out of Station One are subject to extreme suspicion from the cops. Now, let\u0027s take a look at your spacecraft.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHudson nodded. \u0022I am flying a mk15 lander, gross mass 17 tons. It has enough life support for the Munar transit, although it\u0027s a bit cramped. Normally, it has one and a half kilometers per second of delta-V, but because I\u0027m carrying some heavy cargo I need your services to get down to the surface.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob said, \u0022I see. And what is your cargo?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHudson winced. \u0022Uh... five hundred kilos of plutonium.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb flew out of his seat- literally. \u0022What! Why do you have that much plutonium? Where did you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eget\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eit? I\u0027m actually not sure that\u0027s even below critical mass for fission to start.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHudson sighed. \u0022Relax- it\u0027s all contained. In case you didn\u0027t know, there\u0027s a massive market for plutonium on the Mun- RTGs and reactors need topping off, and right now it\u0027s still cheaper to get it imported than to mine it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb accepted this. \u0022Okay. What is your flightplan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I need to get to Munbase in under two and a half hours.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll three crewmembers stared in disbelief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, I won\u0027t ask you \u003Ci\u003Ewhy\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0you need to get there that fast. That\u0027s why you chose Jeb\u0027s Dropship Services. However, you are going to have quite a bill to settle, once we get a course figured out. Bill?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022On it. The sooner we leave, the better. No matter what, we\u0027re going to be burning all of our fuel and getting some more at an orbital depot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I see. And Bob? Get started powering up the tug. Do a complete systems check, and then after that, start pumping some fuel onboard- we\u0027re going to need it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob floated away as Bill tapped at the computer. \u0022Okay, I got us a course, but we burn 94 percent of our fuel capacity on the way down, we\u0027re going to be suicide burning for something like fifteen minutes, and the whole thing in general is kind of risky. And we don\u0027t even land- Hudson, could your lander handle it if we dropped you, say, ten kilometers above Munbase while traveling at 350 meters per second?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHudson replied, \u0022Yes, I can kill the velocity in time. Now, how much is this going to cost me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb thought for a minute. \u0022Well let\u0027s see... there\u0027s the price of the fuel, for starters, and then the price for the upkeep of the spacecraft, a fee for crew operations, and then we start adding on to that. We begin with our personal base price- after all, you\u0027re paying extra for our \u0027No questions asked\u0027 policy.\u00A0Then there\u0027s a ten percent increase for risky operations-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s so risky about it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We burn up almost all of our fuel to tow a craft filled with plutonium right above Munbase. If either spacecraft has an engine failure, there\u0027s going to be a new crater for the geologists to pore over. Which, by the way, brings us to another ten percent increase for hazardous material transport, an extra five percent for giving us short notice before departure, and then there\u0027s a five percent spaceport tax on top of that- which gets split between Station One and the crew. That all comes out to...\u0022 Jeb tapped at a calculator. \u0022Four hundred twenty-nine thousand, eight hundred thirty-two kerbobucks.\u0022\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EToday is going to be a real payday,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0thought Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHudson didn\u0027t like that. \u0022That\u0027s highway robbery!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill tried to reason with him. \u0022None of the other tugs can get you to Munbase in time. Face it, you\u0027re just asking too much.\u0022 Bill wasn\u0027t a very good businessman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb, however, knew how to sell a deal. \u0022Tell you what- agree to this price, and we\u0027ll throw in our\u00A0passenger cabin for free- you don\u0027t have to ride in your lander.\u0022 In reality, this would barely cost Jeb anything on a three-hour voyage, and everyone at the table knew it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fine,\u0022 said Hudson. He took out his credit card and stuck it into the reader.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good,\u0022 Jeb said after he confirmed he was four hundred thousand kerbobucks richer. \u0022Now go and move your lander into position at our tug- we need to leave as soon as we can.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHudson floated away toward the docking adapters. \u0022Jeb,\u0022 Bill began, \u0022What in Kraken\u0027s name do you think his deal is?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No idea,\u0022 the pilot replied. \u0022No idea at all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe he\u0027s a government agent. After all, he needs secrecy, so he comes to us. And by leaving from Station One, he can avoid other kerbals and the larger dropship companies. Finally, he needs to get to the Mun in a rush, and he comes with a ton of plutonium-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What are you implying?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think there\u0027s someone on the Mun who better watch out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb stared at his crewmate for a moment. Then he floated up. \u0022Come on, we\u0027ve got a lot of work to do- thinking won\u0027t get us anywhere.\u0022 Indeed, it had never\u00A0gotten anyone from Station One anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-05T02:45:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2019 02:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Confused Scientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-12T10:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh - now this is getting interesting.

For starters, it\u0027s quiet. Even though you\u0027re zipping along at over six times the speed of sound, it\u0027s quiet. It\u0027s also calm; ocean scenery is best viewed from two hundred kilometers. And in some ways, it\u0027s very eerie-\u00A0even the dead ships still float along, with all their crew at their stations. Some still have automatic programs still running, and occasionally a ghost ship will dock with a space station or even land at a spaceport- and often the ground crew will have no idea what\u0027s happening. They\u0027ll open the hatch, and the crew will be sitting at their consoles, looking as if they had just fallen asleep...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed, space can do strange things to one\u0027s mind- experienced pilots call it \u0027krakensbane.\u0027 Jeb and company had their share of krakensbane, but luckily they were able to spend their time in at least partial gravity and avoid most of it. The less lucky ones float around for years at some orbital depot, until they lose first their bodies and then their wits. In rare cases, the ones stationed at the Mun, Duna, or even\u00A0Laythe go crazy, and it\u0027s cheaper to send replacements than it is to rotate out crew to prevent psychological breakdowns. At least, cheaper in a financial\u00A0sense; there is no cure for krakensbane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb, Bill, and Bob knew this all to well, and for years they had been hoping to return to Kerbin.

Thanks for the ride.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crewmembers in the cockpit didn\u0027t have any more time to worry about their passenger. \u0022Burn coming up in three, two, one, mark!\u0022 shouted Bob.

They were moving at over a kilometer per second; if their engines couldn\u0027t start the best they could do would be to cut Hudson loose and let him save himself. \u0022Full manual override enabled, throttles at full!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hundred feet behind him, twelve nuclear engines lit up and made the Munar landscape begin to glow. \u0022We only lost a few seconds,\u0022 explained Bill. \u0022We\u0027ll stop at eight kilometers, and we\u0027ll use up even more fuel- but we\u0027ve got enough reserve.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s good enough,\u0022 replied Jeb. For a full forty seconds the craft slowed even more until it was traveling at just four hundred meters per second, twenty kilometers above Munbase. Like all of the giant spacecraft, it had a sluggishness that made the landing seem like it was happening to someone else- it rotated slow, it accelerated slow, and so surely it couldn\u0027t be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0spacecraft- after all, you\u0027re stuck inside a rattling tin can! Indeed, Jeb felt like he was just sitting back as Station One as he gave Hudson his countdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ten, nine, eight, seven, six-\u00A0light up your engines, Hudson!- four, three, two, one,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Erelease!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 And just like that, Hudson\u0027s lander fell away from the dropship. It would be his responsibility to get down safe on a Munbase pad- the three kerbals aboard the tug were preoccupied with turning their spacecraft around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Rotating through ninety degrees, we have just about cancelled our vertical\u00A0velocity,\u0022 announced Bill. They were traveling sideways at one hundred meters per second, facing broadside to their velocity vector. \u0022Engines are realigning, here we go!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took nearly a minute to get up to orbital velocity. On the way there, Jeb took manual roll control and rotated the ship so the windows were facing down, so the crew could survey the exciting landscape they were flying over. Munbase Two\u00A0was located among a crater field- millions of years ago, asteroids had deposited the materials here that made mining in this corner of the Mun so profitable. There was iron, nickel, uranium, helium-3, and even water. The Munbase Two approach and liftoff patterns especially flew over some interesting\u00A0landscape, and so everybody in the cockpit had their eyes glued to the viewscreens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, it was no surprise that they had a good view of Munbase Two\u0027s explosion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-05T02:46:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2019 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Confused Scientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Confused Scientist","CreatedById":179591,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-17T23:01:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nChapter 5- Postmortrem\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tug was berthed at an orbital depot, and its crewmembers were inside, doing what kerbals have been doing after crises since time immemorial: refreshing the news.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Still nothing new... wait,\u0022 said Jeb.

With its cloaking devices activated, it was invisible to radar, and the crewmembers didn\u0027t have to worry about the Interplanetary Authority\u0027s dominant grip that was so strong there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have left the Munar sphere of influence,\u0022 said Bill. \u0022We will arrive at the Minnmus \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E in nine days.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBehind them, Kerbin presented a full disk to their windows. Jeb, Bill, and Bob all knew they might never set foot on that planet again. Indeed, this might be their last glimpse of it ever. Jeb pressed his face against the window, trying to memorize every last detail of the continents, the ice sheets, the clouds... all gone forever, to be replaced by either red dust or- hopefully- a terraformed beach on Laythe. Laythe was now fully habitable without an EVA suit, and it was a tropical getaway for Kerbin\u0027s elite. Still, Kerbin was where Jeb was born, and where he had lived the first half of his life. And now, he had gotten so close- the money from this mission would have got\u00A0them a ticket back home- only to have to go on the run. With all these thoughts bouncing through his mind, he craned his neck to look at Kerbin one last time before it disappeared forever behind the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EKraken\u0027s Spit\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0came out from behind the Mun, Kerbin was too small to make out any detail. Instead, the crew focused on their final stop before Duna: Minnmus. Bob had went to Minnmus a few decades ago, and it was where he had lost all of his money in a harebrained mining scheme. Still, Bob maintained that it was one of the nicest spots in the Kerbol system: the Mun and all of those other asteroid-things were ugly, and until recently, Laythe was cold, but Minnmus! The mining station Bob had worked at was at the edge of a large plateau, and he had a scenic overlook of the largest flats in the solar system. As a captured comet, Minnmus also had a very tenuous atmosphere, and at sunrise it would glow in majestic rainbow colors as the subzero geysers greeted the dawn. Now those days were gone, however, and the only place for the crew was in the interstellar void.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all the sentimentality of leaving their home planet, none of the crew remembered how a major Interplanetary Authority base- complete with radar that could not be fooled by cloaking devices-\u00A0had been established on Minnmus just two months ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-05T02:46:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2019 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Confused Scientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Confused Scientist","CreatedById":179591,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-30T18:11:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nChapter 8- Sabotage\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes, orbital warfare is carried out the exact way you hope it is- two ships with engines at full, performing daring maneuvers and risking everything to gain a tiny advantage in kerbalkind\u0027s most advanced battlefield.

A few minutes later, some thrusters lit up on the side of the dropship\u0027s fuel tanks, and Harriet Kerman knew it was time to act before her prey got away.

Normally, it would fry our electronics, but we\u0027ve got pulse guards to protect from radiation.

I hear something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb swore. \u0022We\u0027ve got maybe five minutes before we spin up to dangerous rotation velocities, and maybe twenty before we dump all of our propellant overboard through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports. Is there anything we can do?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well,\u0022 Bill began, \u0022there are manual cutoffs... but they\u0027re located on the ship\u0027s exterior, next to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports themselves. It would be a tricky EVA, but... I could do it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Great,\u0022 said Jeb. \u0022Suit up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHarriet Kerman started to get worried when she saw the kerbal jump out of the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EKraken\u0027s Spit\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eairlock. Were they abandoning their ship before it tore apart under its own rotational stresses? She watched as Bill grabbed onto a ladder and made his way to the first stuck \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E port. Soon he was at the bottom of the ladder but the port was still a good two meters away. Now came the tricky part, for he would have to use his jetpack to match the ship\u0027s rotation and open up a panel to close the valves, all the while avoiding the hot gases being expelled from the port. Still, Bill was a fantastic spacekerb, and within two minutes he had the port shut down. He even left an automatic valve so he could turn the port on and off from the cockpit if a similar situation arose again. Bill repeated the procedure for the other three ports, and then flew back around to the other side of the dropship, where the airlock was. Therefore, it wasn\u0027t too much of a stretch for Harriet to assume he\u0027d gone back inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut Bill hadn\u0027t gone back inside. Instead, he kept a low profile as he refueled his jetpack and crept toward the corvette. Every ship has externally operated fuel valves for use while at a spaceport, and Bill carried the end of a refueling hose across the void. The other end was already attached to the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EKraken\u0027s Spit,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and now he had to get this end over to the IA ship. Compared to shutting off the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports, hooking up the refueling hose was easy, and in under an hour his ship had a full load of fuel. However, Jeb and his crew weren\u0027t cruel- they had made sure the corvette would have enough propellant left to return to the Minnmus base before the life support systems failed. For although they were now fugitives and thieves, they were not murderers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-05T02:46:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2019 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Confused Scientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skylon","CreatedById":175317,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-30T22:06:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, this continues to be brilliant\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Confused Scientist","CreatedById":179591,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-31T19:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223135694\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022163067\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221501452398\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175317\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skylon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Skylon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, this continues to be brilliant\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.
