Obviously its really challenging to control the ship from a remote view. And if you watched this one to the end you see that it was pretty much boned by the time I got back to it. If I had the interface showing I could have orbited it, but I wanted to show the cameras.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly they are just for dramatic effect... It doesn\u0027t add much to game play... Although the Booster cam is a lot of fun - it mounts radially on any part of your rocket with one looking \u0027up\u0027 and one looking \u0027down\u0027, so you can get really cool \u0027Apollo\u0027 style stage separations and such. Haven\u0027t messed with it much yet. Still learning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
