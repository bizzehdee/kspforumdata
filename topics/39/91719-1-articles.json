Second I think it\u0027s very unefficient using rocket engines only next to that it\u0027s quite large guessing it\u0027s all fuel and thats why you have a one and a half stage plane. It would be way better to use as much jet fuel as you can while your still in the atmosphere. When you would have that it would be a full blown SSTO because there would be no need for dropping external tanks. I see you use B9 wich mean you have the large SABRE engines at your disposal, 2 of them usually do the the job \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.
