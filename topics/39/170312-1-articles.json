This debunked the KASA theory that computers get fried in space, and the achievement gave Keylon a cult following.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther, Keylon vowed to eliminate the automatic recovery option, and recover boosters manually. He claimed this would drop costs further, and demonstrate a new space age, where every Kerbal could access space at a reasonable cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, all eyes are on the next major space conference, as Keylon has posted a teaser of a much larger orbital rocket on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/7u2sih/new_video_up_tomorrow_maxing_out_my_125_reusable/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EkReddit\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RPX","CreatedById":182676,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-01T15:41:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMaking a splash.. or crash.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals marveled yesterday as KAS3X\u00A0successfully launched the Kerbin government\u0027s Proba satellite, meant for testing out the company\u0027s claims of having a functional reusable launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollowing the launch, the Bart 1 FT vehicle attempted an experimental propulsive landing at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to make recovery easier.

A section of employees at KAS3X wanted him out, and had successfully conspired in doing just that. Now he was stuck in this place, which was once a bustling unit of C7 Aerospace, but shut down due to the increased focus of the company on rocket-shaped truffles\u00A0rather than actual rockets. In a last-ditch conservation effort, some junkie named Jeb had bought out the facility for pennies on the speso, and was now trying to launch his own rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb was a nice fella, and had some experience in the air. He had flown in the Great Kerbin War, which was the two major factions on Kerbin, the Kommunists and the Flat Kerbinists\u00A0duking it out (The Kommunists won by using ICBMs to prove, rather effectively, that Kerbin was round after all). Following the war, he had taken to repairing whatever he could get his hands on, and had amassed a small fortune in service charges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeylon and Jeb took to each other quickly. However, Jeb\u00A0and his team were hell-bent on manned flying, and this made Keylon uncomfortable. He was aggressively innovative, but also very conservative when it came to Kerbal safety. To ease his fears, Jeb put together a parachute prototype, scrambled together his home-built rocket, took off and landed successfully.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MAAIsFl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MAAIsFl.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would work wonders. Keylon rapidly worked on a new rocket, based off of engines left in the facility. The team also reached out to Experimental Corp., which wanted someone to test out its new products in space for cheap. Experimental offered a capital infusion of 100,000 spesos, and asked them to fly their stuff to the Mun and Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor most rocket corporations, 100,000 spesos for this sort of mission is like asking for a kidney donation and paying a cent. The genius of Keylon, though, lay in utilizing minimal resources. He had developed software to predict rocket delta-v in his time at KAS3X, and it wasn\u0027t difficult to replicate it here. This made sure that minimalist rocket design was achievable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoon enough, the Bart 0.1 was born.

The agenda was simple: Debrief the world about the mission, and announce their next orbital launch attempt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027ve been in talks with a new customer: They want us to try for a Duna mission, as we absolutely should; Kerbalkind is known for it\u0027s rather self-destructive capabilities, and having a backup plan(et) is better than going extinct.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Does this mean you\u0027ll try for a Duna colony?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Absolutely. We\u0027re already past the planning stages; Duna is very similar to the Mun, and if we can put a Kerbal on the Mun soon we can start executing a Duna mission within two years of that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And what about a Mun mission?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s already on the manifesto; Experimental wants a Mun surface return and that\u0027s our next big step. Well, after a Minmus shot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother tremor went through the launch industry; no one had managed a successful Mun return on the first shot. Memories of Nyall Kerman and his Kapollo crew came to many a mind; their spacecraft had not had enough delta-V to reorbit after departing the Mun, and the rest was history. Since then, interplanetary exploration had become a no-go zone in the public eye, and no company wanted to pursue it either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBehind all this, there was another problem; there was no real launch customer for Duna. SM69 was in the middle of negotiations with Experimental for a Duna surface return, but Experimental was unwilling to spend big on a rocket to Duna. This annoyed Jeb and Keylon, but they decided to wait until the Mun-Minmus contract was complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo execute the contract quicker and cheaper, Keylon decided to go for the Minmus return mission straightaway. It was simple to engineer a launcher that reached \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and adding a second stage would give them the delta-V needed for Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne problem lay in the booster power; The initial engine used for the Bart 0.1 was too weak to push that much payload in a single-stack arrangement. Even removing the heavy gimbal equipment didn\u0027t help much. To solve this, SM69 strapped two Bart 0.1 cores to the original booster, which gave them the necessary thrust and also made adding delta-V easier. While they considered crossfeed, the tech was still in its infancy and too unreliable. The center core would thus use a gimballable engine with lower fuel consumption, and the side cores would be the ungimballable engines throttled up to full power to empty them earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome time into the design, Keylon added a new version of parachutes to the boosters and center core; He wanted to recover and reuse them if possible. Ideally, he would fly them back, and was replicating the software he used at KAS3X. One major hurdle was that he no longer had access to the trajectory computing core that KAS3X had patented; he\u0027d have to come up with another way to land them precisely on the pad. Since that wasn\u0027t happening fast enough to use on the main missions, he went with chutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter months of assembly and tweaking, the launcher rolled out to much fanfare. The tanks had been modified; the engineers had come up with a way to fuse two smaller tanks very strongly, and this would simplify launcher construction and avoid some serious structural concerns associated with the Bart 0.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make it easier for later review, a video was shot, although the quality was questionable:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/zJTD9dpP36E?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile this was another near miss for SM69, confidence was growing around all quarters. The company was the first private enterprise to fly by another body, and given some moar boosters would have landed.

Some new inductees were especially promising: Danzor was a field researcher candidate at C7, and could science the sh*t out of any mission; Valentina was a pilot who had commanded Klaxon One, C7\u0027s first capsule meant to fly experiments to low Kerbin orbit. She had also taken part in endurance programs at Whistance Academy, where her team put her in orbit in 42 seconds with no alpaca voodoo.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s initial team was now executing whatever Keylon drew up on his computers, or doodled on lunch menus. Bill, the lead engineer, was trying to salvage scrap engines, and applying his own tweaks to tailor them for certain upcoming roles, including removing the gimbal equipment from earlier. The engineering team was also closely studying launch data and developing newer parts to cope with increased launch demands. Bob, the head of research, was tasked with the Experimental side of things; he and his team would inspect the instruments that would arrive from Experimental Corp and certify them for flight. They also developed the science storage unit, a very helpful invention that stored as much data as needed and enabled them to take many observations with one instrument.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, after the Minmus episode, one would naturally expect a second attempt at a Minmus landing. However, Keylon had other plans, and declared the next mission to be a Mun return as planned earlier.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new vehicle, the Bart 0.3H(H for heavy launcher, or the one with boosters) would be much more powerful.

This was lighter, vacuum-optimized and had lower thrust, thus not needing any throttle limiter and would give much more delta-V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother typical rollout and liftoff later, this vehicle broke more speed records, and for the first time the launch was shot professionally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022v8SOXmH.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/v8SOXmH.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBooster separation with the almighty Korolev Cross.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225zhHCwI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/5zhHCwI.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOwing to the new propellant crossfeed capability, the core was able to orbit the Mun stack by itself.

The new engine didn\u0027t have an alternator, which amplified the problem.

Despite their best efforts, this couldn\u0027t be righted without battery power, and there was no power source. By all means, Jeb was stranded.
