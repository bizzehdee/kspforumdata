I actually think there\u0027s a pretty big improvement!\n\u003E Also, I\u0027M BACK! I haven\u0027t played KSP or been active on the forums in a year or so. Missed you guys \u003C3\n\nSpeakers screeched dire warnings to the hysterical crew of the HMSS Freya. The crew were running all over the space station, the terrified humans fearing for their lives.\n\nAnd for good reason too. Because these sirens were broadcasting a particular message - \u0022Missile Approaching\u0022.\n\nWith several decompressed sections sealed off already, whether crippled by Kraken fire or debris, the station could not handle one more hit. Only the bridge and a few habitat capsules remained, spinning a little in the void. A lone communications officer stood in the bridge, holding his place against the jostling mob.\n\n\u0022*Control to HMSS Freya, do you read me?*\u0022 the speaker queried, sparking into life. Jebediah Kerman, interrupted from morosely staring out the window, jumped and sent a reply. \n\n\u0022Affirmative, we hear you,\u0022 he said into his microphone, keeping his voice.\n\n\u0022*Thank God for that,*\u0022 the ground-based operative exclaimed, relief in his voice as he abandoned the last dregs of professionalism. \u0022*I thought you were gone as well!*\u0022\n\n\u0022As well?\u0022\n\n\u0022*You can tell the captain that HMSS Dummkopf is gone. We lost it on the radar about a minute ago.*\u0022\n\nJebediah swallowed and reluctantly activated his microphone to tell Control the bad news.\n\n\u0022The HMSS Freya is due to be hit in...\u0022 he paused to pull up a screen on his computer, \u0022Two minutes and thirty-four seconds.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Frak!*\u0022\n\n\u0022So this is it?\u0022\n\n\u0022*Yes. Human civilization is done.*\u0022\n\nJebediah bit his lip for a second and then thumped himself.\n\n\u0022HMSS Freya over and out.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Wait!*\u0022\n\n\u0022What? Hurry!\u0022\n\n\u0022*It... It was good knowing you, Jeb.*\u0022\n\n\u0022You too, Bob. Hope we meet again.\u0022\n\nAfter a second of reflection, Jebediah Kerman left his post and hurried to the captain\u0027s cockpit. The captain was immersed in his computer, muttering and jerking eerily. \u0022Somehow, somehow,\u0022 he seemed to be saying.\n\n\u0022Bill?\u0022 Jebediah ventured. The captain span his seat around to face Jebediah.\n\n\u0022What?\u0022 he demanded, fear and hope in his eyes.\n\n\u0022HMSS Dummkopf has fallen.\u0022\n\nThe hope in Bill\u0027s eyes resolved into anger. \u0022Damn it all!\u0022 he yelled at nobody in particular. He thumped his desk, pressing several buttons which didn\u0027t seem to do anything.\n\nThe captain turned to Jebediah again. \u0022I know what to do.\u0022\n\nA spark of clarity was lighting in the determined man\u0027s eyes. \u0022Jeb, my long standing friend, I have a job for you?\u0022\n\nSlightly intimidated, Jeb took a step backwards. \u0022Ah- what?\u0022\n\n\u0022Jeb, you could save the world!\u0022\n\n\u0022Tell me what to do, then!\u0022 Jebediah insisted, annoyed.\n\nThe captain punched a code into a panel in the side of the room and took out a small metal box, like a miniature safe.\n\n\u0022Take this box,\u0022 he told Jebediah, pressing the safe into his hands, \u0022Unlock it. Release it before you impact.\u0022\n\n\u0022Impact!\u0022 Jebediah was alarmed now. \u0022Bill, in a minute and a half we\u0027ll all be blown to oblivion!\u0022\n\n\u0022Not you.\u0022 the captain murmured. \u0022There\u0027s one escape pod left.\u0022\n\n\u0022Bill, are you out of your mind? That thing can\u0027t handle a reentry.\u0022\n\n\u0022I know.\u0022 Bill sighed, seeming ordinary again. \u0022Jeb, I\u0027m asking you to die alone to save the human race.\u0022\n\nThe communications officer was taken aback by the blunt statement.\n\n\u0022What\u0027s in the box?\u0022 Jebediah quietly asked.\n\n\u0022DNA. Protozoic goo containing human genes. There\u0027s a minuscule chance that this will ever work, but maybe one day some lightning will hit the right mud puddle...\u0022\n\nJebediah nodded, understanding. \u0022Very well, then, Bill.\u0022\n\nThe captain enveloped the short officer in a huge, smelly hug. \u0022I\u0027ll miss you, Jeb.\u0022\n\n\u0022*I\u0027ll miss you all,*\u0022 Jebediah whispered to the void.\n\nA million years after the end of human civilization, a bolt of lightning struck a mud puddle in a field.\n\nAnd behold, Jebediah Kerman (II) was born."}]}
