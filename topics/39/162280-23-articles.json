It kicks up gritty, alkaline dust, scouring the surface, shrouding the land in a sickly, yellow haze. Through this haze walks a figure, clad all in black, hunched over against the relentless wind. \uFEFF\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe roar all around it is eerie and hollow, the wind does not howl but screech. The sound is otherworldly, far too high, and yet empty, as if even the wind here is dying. For all its rage, and all its dust, it barely licks at the rags covering the forsaken form trudging through it. Yet here and there, the tug of a whisper is just enough to expose a glimpse of dry, weathered bone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe figure stumbles and falls on its endless course, sending up a puff of reddish-yellow dust that disappears into the haze. What\uFEFF\u00A0might once have been a gas mask covers its face, the rubber cracked, the dark lenses scratched to near opacity. It pulls a dark cowl farther over its head as it huddles on the parched ground, lest it see up. No, never look up. To gaze upon what writhes in the angry red clouds of the alien sky above... is to know madness.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI want to cry, but I cannot...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead the figure rises, lurches forward as if drawn against its will. Its bandaged hands scrabble, then find purchase. One ragged foot drags across the grit. The other follows. Onward, ever onward this lost soul trudges, the last walking thing in a world that has \u003Cem\u003Emoved on\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt passes a shape of some sort, a lump in the sand that has long since lost any meaning. Soon there is another. And then yet another. Out of the sepia murk ahead, a much larger shape now looms, void and without form. As the figure approaches, it materializes into a tall, broad structure. Ancient shipping containers, rusted and scoured until nearly unrecognizable, form a low wall. The figure lurches on, swaying, until it reaches the crumbling gate. Here, it stops and gazes; for an hour, for an eternity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore the half-collapsed sheets of metal lay piles of dry bones. A skull stares back, its twisted and deformed features half-buried in the dust. The figure does not raise its face, but sets off across the pile, half climbing, half wading, bones crackling near-soundlessly beneath its feet to join the uncaring dust. A slight push against the yawning gate sends it crashing to the ground with a reedy, empty sound; the hungry wind devours the dust it kicks up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithin is a courtyard before another withered structure, in the center of this courtyard is what remains of a tree. What it once was... no longer matters. Now, it is only a bare fragment of a stump. The ceaseless wind and abrasive dust have scoured its surface, opening fissures, and left haunting shapes like faces writhing in torment. The figure pauses only a moment before moving on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust beyond, bits of rusted metal or etched stone stick up from the ground on either side. What was once scrawled upon them has long since been erased. The figure stares long at these, as ages and eons come and go above.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI want to cry, but I cannot.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPast these, the markers become more simple, often worn away to bare nubs, keeping eternal watch over oblong mounds on the surface. Further still, there are no more mounds, only the tattered remains of shrouds, soundlessly rustling as the wind scatters their contents over millennia as the figure plods on. And finally, before this last wasting structure, there are not even shrouds, only vague clusters of bones the wind has not yet disbursed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe figure pauses here, casting its masked visage over all it has passed, unwilling to continue... and yet drawn inexorably on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside, the empty howl of the endless wind is lessened. The roof has collapsed here and there, but not yet enough to bury what has transpired. Here, in this haunted place, is the \u003Cem\u003Elast\u003C/em\u003E. Kerb\u2019s final inkermanity to kerb. Here, there are more bones... each one charred, or knife-scored, or simply broken open on a rock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sits, keeping eternal vigil here in this crumbling castle from his simple throne, holding his broken crown in his twisted hands: King Nothing, even his name long forgotten. His face is the most horrible of all, his features so deformed that he barely seems like a thing once alive. And yet, he is also the most piteous, his toothless mouth forever contorted in a wail of unknowable misery.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI want to cry, but I cannot.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ragged figure falls to its knees on the dusty floor, bones clinking with barely a sound.

Anywhere the sodden fabric touched it, for an instant burst into flame... and yet the metal-clad gem barely felt warm in her own hands.

He choked and gagged as his mind and body fought for control. His chest ached, his eyes burned, and his tongue tingled with a sensation like... bubbling.

Edgas could only lay there, drenched with sweat, his chest heaving and head throbbing. Time turned, aeons passed... and eventually, so did the horrible nightmare fugue, leaving only a crushing weariness that might have cemented him to the bed if not for his thirst. His tongue felt like a roll of rags in his mouth, his lips like sandpaper. His throat had clamped to a bare, wheezing pinhole that whistled with desert air between dry rocks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas blinked his still-burning eyes back into focus, and found his water glass had been knocked to the floor in his thrashing.

He leaned here on the polished railing for a time, still blinking, M\u00FCnlight from the glass ceiling above glimmering in the dim space. Despite his fatigue and thirst, he still marveled at the opulence of it. The M\u00FCn, veiled in gossamer clouds, cast stark, pale shadows across the cavernous room, glinting on golden accents, silhouetting carved wood. The velvety carpet beneath his bare feet felt soft as a pillow, and the marble floor below gleamed with silver accents and dark blood stains.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe breath seized in Edgas\u2019s parched throat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENo...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENo, they cleaned that...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stumbled backwards, hands raised in warding. The shadows across the room seemed to shimmer and crawl towards him. His back met something solid, darkness loomed over him, and an icy hand reached out and took his shoulder.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scream his tired throat had not let pass finally escaped.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas spun around, hands still raised, and\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Drew them slowly to his face.

Before him, a polished suit of plate armor stood impassively on a high plinth, one hand at its side, just about shoulder height, and the other grasping an enormous battle-axe. He glanced back toward the foyer, and saw his \u201Cbloodstains\u201D disappear as the shadows shifted again. High overhead, faint clouds still danced around the M\u00FCn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a while Edgas just stood there, expecting everyone else to erupt from their rooms at his midnight outburst.

Everywhere, bits of metal went flying and tumbling, flipping over the railing to the marble floor below, or bouncing... bouncing... BOUNCING! all the way down the wide, curving staircase, each thunk and crash and rattle echoing from the walls and reverberating down the halls.

Now this once-shining monument to the decadence and treachery of the New Ways had been wiped from the map, buildings torn away, freighters and warships cast here and there upon the rubble like the forgotten toys of a spoiled child. Why even here, in this very place where he now stood, there had once been endless canyons of skyscrapers... now there were only the scattered bodies that the tide brought every morning.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDmitri looked down in disgust at the one at his feet.

Still, this would not stop him. He had a knife, of course, but it had grown dull from these long years of hard use.

He might have gone \u003Cem\u003Eon\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0screaming, has some primitive, animalistic part of his mind not realized his hand still clutched a rock.

A moment ago, an Age ago, fire like the very bowels of all the Nine Hells raged down streets where once children played and shopkeepers hawked their goods, and the people fleeing before this tempest prayed for rain. And indeed, the rain did come, as if all the denied showers of years of drought were payed back at once.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt came in raging, screaming torrents down city streets and over manicured gardens. With no one left to turn the valves or open the sluice gates, the water pulled down fire-ravaged hills and distributed them as mud across those very streets and gardens, as if trying to erase that they had ever existed. In time, if there were anyone left to see, there would be nothing to see here at all.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet today, the solemn silence is broken by the sound of rapid, squelching foot-falls. A kerbelle rounds a corner, sliding in the thick mud, her own breath loud in her ears. She darts between windows and half-buried doorways, skitters, her head moving frantically as if seeking something. She looks back, gasps, and takes off down the entombed street. More sodden footsteps echo in the stillness. The kerbelle spares one last glance, finally loses her footing and goes sprawling face-first into the muck.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCoughing, groaning, she forces herself back up, pausing only a moment before turning down an alleyway. Right away, she realizes her mistake, but she cannot go back now. At the far end there is a door, half-hidden in a pile of garbage. She grabs the knob and twists, knowing it will not turn.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yet it does.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe flings the door open... but only a few centimeters. \u00A0Mud or debris or something \u003Cem\u003Eelse\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0blocks the way.

Edgas and Valentina looked at each other, but could only sigh. He grabbed his door handle and pulled... just to have it pop off in his hand. The flood of spiders, earwigs, crickets, and assorted other crawly things that emerged en-masse from it led to a \u003Cem\u003Emost\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0undignified bout of high-pitched screaming and dancing around, but they were understandably quite traumatized by the whole thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas stood there for a long time staring at the empty, pitted, rusted-to-paper thin bit of metal, as if unsure of what to do.

From the tall boots cobbled together from the dyed hides of a dozen unfortunate reptiles, to slacks cut just-so of dark fabric with no shine or sheen, to the suit jacket devoid of pinstripes or patterns, trimmed with onyx buttons, even the \u003Cem\u003Eshirt\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was black as night in deepest winter, beneath a wide-brimmed hat with no discernible line between it and the shadow it cast.

As he continued to speak, he began to casually unbutton and slip off his suit jacket, \u201Csee here now, y\u0027all have somethin\u0027 Ah want, but more important, mah employer has business with you lot. Seems y\u2019all been causin\u2019 some trouble,\u201D he hung it upon the outstretched arm of a nearby suit of armor, \u201Cand just bein\u2019 all unreasonable-like,\u201D he unpinned his cufflinks and hid them away, rolled his black sleeves to his elbows, \u201Ccain\u2019t have that, see.

It sliced through without even a sound, until the top half tumbled to the floor.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerb in black held the blade forth, pointing directly at Roland, \u201Cyou killed mah brother.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow his entire countenance shifted, the \u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0smile evaporating like a nightmare, but into something far, \u003Cem\u003Efar\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0worse. His lips pulled back into a snarl, his teeth grit together with such force that his face twisted into something savage and monstrous, \u201Conly \u003Cem\u003EAh\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0git to do that.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe snarl deepened, \u201CAh want a piece a\u2019 you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA piece you shall have,\u201D Roland\u2019s eyes narrowed. He stood tall, his back creaking and crackling, but only for a moment. He took his gnarled old cane in both hands, twisted, and with a \u003Cem\u003Eclick\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the top grip separated. From the other section it drew forth what looked like a pale, limp string, but with a flick of his wrist it grew straight, becoming a long, impossibly thin needle-like blade that almost seemed to be glowing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClaw-hand tucked behind his back, he held the sword before his face in salute, \u201Con guard.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two stepped forward, eyes locked upon one another. The kerb in black shifted this way and that, as if trying to circle. Each time found his path blocked. Each time, his face twisted into new and more unpleasant masks. He feigned a quick attack, and Roland merely stepped aside. Another sudden, half-pulled lunge, yet Roland was simply \u003Cem\u003Enot there\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0when the blade passed through. Roland, for his part, was replete with all the calm and serenity of the Empress herself, his face as blank and unreadable as a statue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0attack came with all the speed and ferocity the kerb in black\u2019s probes had lacked. He roared as he charged, taking his saber in both hands, a devastating sideways slice that tore the air as it passed. Roland parried, his own gossamer blade holding the other frozen in place for a fraction of a moment before deflecting it away. He dodged the return, spun into a counter-attack of \u003Cem\u003EKingfisher Circles the Pond\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0found his own attack deflected.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe led the dance from the first clumsy thrusts into practiced Forms, from \u003Cem\u003EThe Rose Unfolds\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0into \u003Cem\u003EArc of the M\u00FCn\u003C/em\u003E;\u00A0slipped into \u003Cem\u003ELow Wind Rising\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0spun \u003Cem\u003EThe Cyclone Rages\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0into \u003Cem\u003EDoves Take Flight.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0His opponent\u2019s Forms were... coarse.

She watched in horror as the two kerbs wrenched back and forth, gleaming white blades swishing through the air. The sound was maddening, like the \u003Cem\u003Eclink\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of ceramic plates bashing together, only without the shattering that her mind insisted \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0follow such a noise. Anything they touched that was not each other\u2014 a steel shield, a wooden beam, evan a marble column in the center of the room\u2014 the swords passed through with seemingly no effort, leaving a trail of destruction behind the combatants.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerb in black grunted and strained with each blow, veins standing out on his sweat-streaked forehead, yet Roland\u2019s face betrayed nothing. He might have been reading the M\u00FCnday paper over a nice cup of tea or perhaps going for an evening stroll. It was as if all the \u003Cem\u003Efeeling\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0he must be feeling was channeled away into some all-consuming Flame.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina wished she could do the same. Beside her, her hand on his shoulder, Edgas was a crumpled heap on the floor. She could \u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the raw emotion radiating off him like fever-heat. Grief. Horror.

Even to her untrained eye, one of them was losing. This black-clad kerb, this \u003Cem\u003EBeast\u003C/em\u003E... he was clearly outmatched, his motions slowing, his moves becoming more erratic and clumsy. Her own conscious mind still struggled to comprehend all she was perceiving, her conflicting senses battling back and forth for attention like the two kerbs before her, yet her \u003Cem\u003Ehyper\u003C/em\u003E-conscious mind, that still, small part of her that never slept, never rested, honed to a razor\u2019s edge by years \u003Cem\u003Esurviving\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in the harsh taiga was not so burdened.

She did not know the Forms, had never danced the Dance, but what she did have was long years of simply \u003Cem\u003Estaying alive\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in a world of things which sought to end her, not out of petty hate but simple hunger.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe did not know the Way of the Blade, but was an old master in the Way of the Pointy Stick, and in the end, a sword was not so different.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe came with such ferocity that the kerb in black was immediately staggered backwards, the victory wiped from his face and replaced by fear.

She parried, dodged, shrunk in upon her already smaller self before him. Then in an an instant, rose like Leviathan from the abyss, every muscle in her body driving her frame, and her fist, upward.

Now he drew Fire, funneling it into the little whisp of Air, as much as he could. He spun it faster, the vision before him spreading out into a swirling disc as he fed it more. With each long breath, each pulse, body motionless save for his eyes, he crushed the flows down again and again. At length the point in the center began to glow, fist dull red then yellow into white. He could feel the pressure pushing back against his will.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd, despite all that was and is and was still to come, his lips cracked into a little smile.

He seized it even tighter, forced it to his will. Now that the Conduit was open, he no longer needed the grail, and for the first time in his very long life, touched the Source as it truly was, pure and untainted. The beauty and ecstasy of it threatened to wash him and all that he was away, but he held fast. Without the grail and its protective buffer, he was no longer limited, and drew every bit of the Power he could. The... dangers no longer mattered.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe could feel it coursing through him, burning at every nerve ending in his body, washing over his brain like flames.
