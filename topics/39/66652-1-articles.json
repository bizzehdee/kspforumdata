Kerbals consume a large amount of calories each day but almost never get obese because the calories are burned through regular exercise and occasional fasting if the interplanetary ship runs out of food. The Kerbal\u0027s skin is green because a major part of the diet consists of animals that eat grass and obviously, grass itself, which is often served as a beverage to meat. I am speculating, but i think that Kerbals have a vast array of food animals and plants as we humans have. As such, a vast selection of meats, animal products, fruits, vegetables and other products is available on Kerbin, while outside of Kerbin the same things are consumed but often in packaged and lower-quality form; although Kerbals are starting to use more healthy ways of preserving food in space (such as salting meat instead of freezing it). Kerbals are well-known for \u0022semi-exotic\u0022 foods and beverages such as grass juice or space kraken filet (the latter is uncommon because it is extremely hard to kill a Space Kraken and preserve it\u0027s body prior to butchering). Steaks are often served with croquettes made from the Kerbal equivalent of Potatoes (Kotatoes. They obviously are green and not yellow). Meat comes from Kows, Kchickens, Kangaroos (K-Syndrome, i know, is impossible here), Keal, Keer and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, Kerbals have a food that is mainly based around meat and vegetables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERECIPES\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could include Kerbal recipes made eatable by humans.

Firstly, i agree with Mr President - Kerbin is a lush world and the kerbals have a rich and varied diet.

Essentially the kerbal equivalent of a taco chip. Crispy, triangular and served dusted with salt, sugar or assorted spice powders.

The nearest Terran equivalent would be a small bell pepper, although, luffa-eyes are generally juicer, sweeter and have a more intense flavour. Luffas are a distant evolutionary cousin of the kerbals that share many of their physical features, including their characteristic large eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKaya jerky. The Kaya was originally found in the colder latitudes of Kerbin and was much prized by early kerbal societies (and modern ones for that matter) They provide nutritious meat, strong bones and horn for building materials and a luxuriant hollow fibre wool, somewhat akin to yak wool on Earth. Their belly wool is particularly long and soft - in the wild it serves as a shelter for young Kaya calves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESapwood. Sapwood trees are insectivorous and have evolved long parallel grooves in their trunks, which accumulate a sticky, sweet sap for trapping insects. When collected and dried, the sap forms a hard, toffee like substance that can be enjoyed on its own or can be processed with water (or occasionally alcohol) to form a syrup. Various regions on Kerbin have their local speciality sapwood syrups, including the notorious smoky sapwood, which is widely believed to be flavoured with wet ash and is generally regarded as very much an acquired taste. Sapwood syrup is diluted with water or milk according to taste, to make a refreshing cold beverage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JakeGrey","CreatedById":61242,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T14:07:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAm I right in guessing that the grain crop that provides the flour for \u003Cem\u003Edjann\u003C/em\u003E chips is also used in Kerbin\u0027s thriving Real Ale industry?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T17:20:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JakeGrey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JakeGrey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAm I right in guessing that the grain crop that provides the flour for \u003Cem\u003Edjann\u003C/em\u003E chips is also used in Kerbin\u0027s thriving Real Ale industry?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeh - it certainly is. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Although in fairness, kerbal brewers are almost as enterprising as kerbal cooks and there aren\u0027t many grain crops that \u003Cem\u003Ehaven\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E been used in a Real Ale somewhere - with varying degrees of success.
