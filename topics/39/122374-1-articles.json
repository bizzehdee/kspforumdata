Keeping it in one place was tricky... hope I pulled it off satisfactorily.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EChoose what you want built next, the choices are 1. A helicopter to protect a base that has been taken (hide behind buildings, pop up and shoot) or 2. A fast tank with decent armor which may involve some config file editing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFull playlist here:\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLGF-28M603FfCi5clf9KbCCl5-T_yqV2d\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T17:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaha, nice.

Though it did require a lot of testing in KSP with armor and figuring out what is needed to get it to work. At first I though ablation was best but that stopped all damage until it reached 0 then it would be taken out. That sounds good but it wasn\u0027t very realistic as they ablation would slowly go down once you hit it and then would continue to go down regardless. Most of the calculations seem to be done on shell mass and collision tolerance. These are what are used to decide how much heat damage is transferred to the part. If the ammo is light then less heat is transferred, the opposite is true if it\u0027s a heavy shell. The crash tolerance reduces the heat damage further and that is like an \u0022Armor level\u0022 value it seems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
