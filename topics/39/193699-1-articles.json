At the front, an array of desk fans stuck together spun at a dizzying speed, funnelling air into the intake. At its heart was a combustion chamber in which propane gas was burnt with some of that air at high pressure, producing lots of heat. The remaining air was then forced through the back of the combustion chamber and accelerated considerably by said heat, producing lots of thrust and spinning a dynamo which powered the front fans. Because of its design, the combustion cycle could be shut down altogether for almost a minute at a time without a significant drop in thrust as residual heat drove the system, effectively producing thrust from nothing but air. It was also capable of running without any air at all by pumping oxygen gas into the combustion chamber. In theory, it would operate from sea level all the way to space.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EUnfortunately for Tina, three days before the Science Fair a joint venture between C7 Aerospace and the Rockomax Conglomerate had, to great pomp and ceremony, released the R.A.P.I.E.R. engine, an air-breathing multi-mode rocket that could operate from sea level all the way to space.

Hand sanitiser, a portable backup battery because \u003Cem\u003Esomeone\u003C/em\u003E never charges his phone, some breath mints, that sort of thing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhile we\u0027re on that subject...\u201D Dad interjected, sheepishly holding out his phone. \u201CSeven percent left.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CActually, since you brought it up, we\u0027re going to need to keep your phones in the safe. No phones, cameras or other recording or imaging equipment is permitted either inside the PAB or outside if the launch pad is in use by any other group.\u201D said Desdas, leading them over to a small office in one corner of the building with a row of lockers and storing their phones in one of them before signing it out on the record sheet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf you just sign in that box... Sorry, I didn\u0027t get your names.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMartin,\u201D said Dad, offering his hand which Desdas shook.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeanette,\u201D said Mum, doing the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDesdas. The grumpy looking one on the left is Lurim, the even grumpier one on the right is Richgan.\u201D He pointed to the two technicians as they returned to the PAB floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnfortunately Samlas is running a bit late, her first train was late so she missed the connection, but as soon as she\u0027s here we can sort out all the paperwork before we get started. In the meantime, we can try and peel the remnants of your thrust chamber off the back of that poor contraption and check if anything else is damaged; if I remember rightly, you\u0027re using a pretty standard fan compressor on the front, right?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis enthusiasm was contagious, and in minutes the entire group were hard at work removing the damaged sections of the DAGGER and examining the rest to ensure it was still in working order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBad news, I\u0027m afraid- your propellant tank valve is damaged.\u201D Richgan reported as he climbed back down the stepladder. \u201CBest case is it doesn\u0027t open at all, worst case it could explode. We\u0027re going to need a new fuel tank.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wasn\u0027t that surprising but Tina was still disappointed. More work to replace the tanks, followed by more work to get the compressor fans and air pipes fitted around it to feed air to the combustion chamber, as well as making a new chamber and nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think there\u0027s a small methane tank we can use, it should be the right size and it\u0027s still gas-powered so there shouldn\u0027t be too much trouble adapting the design.\u201D Lurim answered. \u201CWe could run the fuel lines round the chamber before leading them back to the top and injecting the fuel, use the liquid methane as coolant before burning it to prevent overheating.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMaybe on a bigger engine, but the chamber is the size of a drinks can so the tubes would have to be incredibly small and that could mess with the fuel flow,\u201D countered Mum. Everyone turned to her with expressions ranging from surprise to amazement. \u201CI wasn\u0027t always \u0027Mum\u0027 or \u0027Mrs Martin Kerman\u0027, you know- before that I was a systems engineer at FLOOYD.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo wonder you\u0027ve got a budding rocket scientist for a daughter!\u201D laughed Desdas. \u201COf course, that assumes she can plug the pipes in the right way round.\u201D Lurim and Richgan both snorted in amusement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAfter my time, Desdas, and besides that I worked in the maritime division, not aerospace. I sent an old colleague one of those cups with a novelty straw a few years back, but I had Tina draw arrows on it to show which way the drink was supposed to go. She found it hilarious, but her husband was aerospace and wasn\u0027t amused.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the technicians from another team joined in the conversation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI heard about that! My cousin works for FLOOYD as well, and that cup with the arrows on the straw found its way onto the company website\u0027s home page for three days before someone in senior management noticed and nearly had a heart attack. Nobody ever figured out who put the picture there either.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo THAT\u0027S why you wanted me to draw the arrows on it.\u201D said Tina. \u201CI didn\u0027t understand why you found that so funny.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe banter continued as they stripped the DAGGER down and removed the damaged parts, replacing them with genuine space-grade alternatives that made the few remaining original parts look decidedly shabby in comparison. By the time Samlas arrived with the paperwork they had a fully functioning air intake and fuel tank assembly with a few small pipes and wires dangling from the end where the thrust assembly would go. Most of them signed the forms straight away, but Dad took the time to read through the entire thing before signing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI work in insurance, and if there\u0027s one thing working in insurance teaches you, it\u0027s that you always, ALWAYS, read the small print before signing any legally binding documents.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile everyone else went over to a large drafting board to study the blueprints, Samlas asked Tina to stay behind and pulled out another set of forms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThese are patent application forms. They\u0027re pretty straight forward but if you need any advice or aren\u0027t sure about something, just ask. I deal with these on a daily basis so I could probably recite it to you from memory by now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTen minutes later the forms were complete and a copy of the designs was made to be included along with the information display from the Science Fair. Tina and her parents all signed the forms along with two of Darude\u0027s ground staff as independent witnesses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027ll get this sent away as soon as I get back to civilisation, then while it gets processed you\u0027ll have patent pending protection in case anyone tries to copy your design. I\u0027ll keep you up to date with everything as it moves along.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey shook hands with Samlas then headed back to the assembly hall to be greeted with the sight of the DAGGER belching smoke from the air intake, fans shrieking far beyond their intended speed until someone pulled the power and they spun down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFire alarms began to blare accompanied by red strobe lights scattered across the walls and ceiling and everyone headed for the main exit doors as a team of firefighters wearing breathing gear came in from a side entrance. They waited outside in the morning sun for a few minutes before being allowed back in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DAGGER looked rather forlorn, intake melted and charred and reeking of burnt plastic and\u00A0 singed electronics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFirst you dropped it, now you\u0027ve burnt it- are you trying to wreck it or something?\u201D Tina asked Johnbro, half serious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CActually, that was my fault,\u201D admitted Desdas looking suitably ashamed. \u201CI plugged the fans into the new power bus but misread the designs and thought it was 13 amps instead of 3. The fan overloaded, overheated and caught fire before we could shut it down.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow long until we\u0027re booked on the test pad?\u201D asked Johnbro.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTwo hours, which is still plenty of time to get this fixed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COK, boss,\u201D he turned to Tina, \u201Cwhat\u0027s the plan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSplit up into teams- one team makes a new air intake assembly, one team makes the combustion chamber and the other makes the engine nozzle. Once we\u0027ve built it all, we put it together and make sure it doesn\u0027t catch fire before we roll it out and test fire it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was strangely exhilarating to give instructions to a proper team of rocket engineers, in a real rocket assembly hall, to build \u003Cem\u003Eher\u003C/em\u003E rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTeam Intake consisted of Lurim, Dad and Johnbro, who between them scrounged up a small but potent motor and fan blades to go with it plus a shroud to funnel the air into the engine. Team Nozzle was Richgan and Mum, who between them turned out a sturdy and effective air-cooled nozzle with a truncated bell to improve low-altitude thrust. Team Chamber was Tina and Desdas, who couldn\u0027t resist the chance to get hands on with the novel design that Tina had produced; their efforts created a version which was made to micrometric accuracy by the 3D printer and as a result ended up being lighter and profoundly more effective than the tin-can-with-holes that had done the job before. One detail was added to the original design: a set of triangular fins for both aerodynamic stability and structural support on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith ten minutes to spare before their test slot, the DAGGER Mark 2 was ready and everyone took a well-earned break and drank copious amounts of water; even indoors, the heat of the desert sun combined with their physical exertions meant everyone was hot and sweaty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey donned safety gear- goggles, ear protectors and hard hats with fold down sections at the back to protect against sunburnt necks- and using a bright yellow transport truck brought the DAGGER out to the launch pad. Batteries charged, fuel tank filled with liquid methane and fins held to the launch pad\u0027s gridded floor with clamps, they moved back to the control booth a short distance away and prepared for the test fire. To Tina\u0027s surprise, she was put in charge of running the test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStarting the fans.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new and improved air intake assembly whirred into life, spinning up to a muted roar and blasting dust and sand from the exhaust vents at the sides of the pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFans at operating speed, air flow looks good.\u201D Desdas reported, watching the telemetry feeds closely for any signs of trouble. \u201CReady for engine start when you are.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEngine start in three, two, one...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe turned the dial to engage the fuel pump and hit the starter button, activating the spark generators inside the combustion chamber. There was a loud whoosh as the methane caught fire, building into a steady rumble as the engine span up to operating speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThrust is 10 kilonewtons and holding steady, ready for full throttle.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina gradually increased the throttle, feeling the vibrations in the floor as the thrust climbed higher and hearing the rumble build to a roar with the howl of the fans over the top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSixty percent power. Sixty five, seventy, seventy five percent. Holding at seventy five percent.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThirty seven kilonewtons of thrust, looks like we\u0027ll get fifty at full power. Telemetry looks good, thermal sensors are well within the safety parameters. Looks like that fuel cooling system won\u0027t be needed after all. Ready to throttle up when- hang on.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA loud clunk came from the launch pad, closely followed by another and then two more. The engine noise suddenly got much louder and when Tina looked out the window she saw the DAGGER climbing rapidly into the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbort test! Engage emergency abort procedure.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina slapped her hand down on the big red ABORT button and the DAGGER responded, feathering the fan blades and spinning down the motor, but the fuel valves didn\u0027t close and enough air was still flowing into the intake to keep the rocket running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThrottle to zero, arm the parachute.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrottling back the power stopped the combustion, but still the DAGGER kept climbing as residual heat created thrust from the air that was still flowing through the engine. As that heat dissipated, gravity took over and the ascent became a descent, triggering the parachute which deployed flawlessly to bring the DAGGER floating back down to the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTouchdown, and engine shutdown. Sensor data records saved and ready for analysis.\u201D Desdas turned to Tina and a smile crept onto his face. \u201CI can honestly say I\u0027ve never seen that happen before.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tension in the room broke and everyone began high-fiving each other, with the sole exception of Tina who was too caught up in the moment to notice anyone or anything else. Her hands were shaking uncontrollably and she wasn\u0027t sure if she was about to start laughing or crying, or possibly both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe had just launched a real rocket at a real launch site!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took a few minutes to let the rocket and launch pad cool down before they were allowed to retrieve it. As soon as they got there it was clear that the clamps had failed, apparently unable to take the strain of the rocket\u0027s thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStrange, those are 50kN clamps and we weren\u0027t even at 40 when they failed,\u201D commented Lurim. \u201CEither we got a dud clamp that failed early and overstressed the others, or we made a lot more thrust than the sensors recorded.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere are the sensors that calculate the thrust positioned?\u201D Tina asked. \u201CIf it\u0027s only reading the thrust from the combustion chamber it will under-report, there\u0027s the bypass air flow to consider too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COops...\u201D muttered Desdas, visibly blushing and not from the desert heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight everyone, let\u0027s get this thing back inside before someone gets heatstroke.\u201D Johnbro chivvied them back towards the PAB as the DAGGER was loaded back onto the transport truck and returned to its assembly point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey took a break for lunch to let any residual heat dissipate, enjoying the cold drinks and even colder air conditioning in the canteen. Word had gotten around about the straw with arrows drawn on it and a small crowd soon converged on them wanting to hear the tale first hand; someone turned up with a huge printed version of the FLOOYD website complete with the famous picture pride of place in the centre and a queue formed to get pictures taken beside it with two of the people who had made it possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe early afternoon was spent analysing all the data gathered from the test fire, and sure enough the thrust sensors were only detecting thrust from the combustion chamber itself and not the additional thrust from the air being fed around the outside and turning excess heat into more thrust via Meredith effect, or indeed the extra force that the much more powerful fan was generating as it forced air through the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore sensors were installed before a second, horizontal test fire was carried out with the engine throttle gradually increased from idle to full power to get a full picture of its thrust curve and to measure its specific impulse, followed by rapidly changing the throttle setting to measure its responsiveness and finally a maximum power burn with extra fuel being injected into the exhaust as an afterburner, producing a tremendous plume of fire and a deafening roar and boosting the total thrust to an impressive 140kN but burning through the remaining fuel reserves in seconds. Unfortunately, the afterburner test also damaged the engine nozzle so a replacement had to be made before the final test could be run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun was already setting behind the hills to the west by the time the repairs were complete and the DAGGER was wheeled out to the launch pad for a second time. Unlike the first test, the oxidiser tank was also filled and excess fuel was added to attempt a realistic vertical launch profile, launching in air breathing mode and switching to internal oxidiser when the air became too thin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPad One is condition red, Pad One is condition red. Test launch of DAGGER Mark 2 in progress.\u201D The loudspeakers blared, echoing across the launch complex. A large crowd had gathered, many of them staff who had clocked off their shifts and were either staying at the facility full time or were waiting to travel home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLaunch in five, four, three, two, one.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDAGGER launched with its distinctive rumble and buzz, accelerating smoothly and gaining altitude at a steady but increasing rate. It climbed into the sky on a pillar of blueish fire and a barely visible vapour trail, rising above the terrain shadow and catching the last rays of sunlight as it raced ever upwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEight thousand metres, we\u0027re at 0.93 Mach, switching fan geometry for supersonic flight.\u201D Desdas reported in the command bunker. Tina heard his voice through the headset but was standing on the bunker\u0027s roof, looking almost straight up to follow DAGGER\u0027s progress. Eventually it got too high and her neck started to hurt so she moved inside the bunker to watch the feed from a powerful telescopic camera that was tracking its progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTwenty thousand metres, six hundred metres per second, standing by to switch to closed cycle.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigh above, DAGGER\u0027s acceleration faltered as the fan blades struggled to cram enough air into the intake to fuel the combustion. Thrust dwindled almost to zero, then the oxidiser valves opened and fed the engine a new source of oxygen and it lunged forwards again, the fans shutting down and feathering to minimise drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CForty thousand metres, we\u0027re up to 1272m/s and approaching oxidiser depletion. Engine shutdown in three, two, one-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeprived of any source of oxidiser, the fire at the rocket\u0027s heart sputtered and died, fuel valves automatically closing. High in the air, DAGGER continued on its ballistic trajectory, sensors dutifully recording every parameter and relaying the information down to the radio mast on the ground. Darude had a tracking dish with a lot more transmitter power than the mast, but it was offline for maintenance after a sandstorm blew grit into the mechanisms where it caused havoc with the bearings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSeventy thousand metres, we\u0027re approaching maximum transmitter range. Descent profile armed, stand by for loss of signal.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTelemetry feeds started to stutter before dropping out completely leaving only the video feed from the ground, a radar altimeter readout and the camera feed from the DAGGER which now used the entire available bandwidth to continue broadcasting. Kerbin spread out below it, glowing in the last rays of the sun and with huge shadows across the terrain, Darude visible as a cluster of bright spots in the centre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEighty five thousand metres. We\u0027re in space.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA huge cheer went up from the spectators and the control bunker erupted with celebrations. Tina found herself being picked up and carried out the door before being deposited on the roof in front of the crowd, who cheered even louder. It was the single greatest moment of her life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it didn\u0027t last long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first she thought it was just the crowd\u0027s exuberance, but it quickly built until everyone could feel the ground trembling. The cheering was replaced by alarm and then fear as the shaking got worse, making the floodlights flicker as they swayed from side to side. A loud alarm klaxon began blaring accompanied by a frantic announcement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCode Red! Code Red! All outdoor personnel stay clear of the buildings, all indoor personnel take cover immediately. Code Red! Co-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe speakers were silenced abruptly as power across the complex suddenly died, plunging them into near darkness.\u00A0 There was a loud crack and then someone grabbed Tina and nearly knocked her off her feet before the launch pad flagpole came crashing down right where she had been standing. Panic gripped the crowd and they scattered in all directions as the ground shook even more violently, shattering windows and sending pieces of masonry tumbling from walls and rooftops. Tina threw herself down, covered her head with her arms and hoped desperately that it would all be over soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter what felt like hours but was really only seconds, the shaking subsided. Power came back on and most people picked themselves back up, although a few had been trampled in the panic and required medical attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBrace for aftershock!\u201D boomed over the speakers and anyone standing threw themselves back down again. The aftershock was even worse than the first, shaking the ground in all directions and lasting twice as long, but eventually it too subsided. A large fire was burning where the aviation fuel tanks had been and one of the PAB doors had collapsed, crushing the transport truck parked outside. Remarkably, everyone worked together, tending to the most seriously injured even if they had been hurt themselves, freeing two unfortunate technicians from a forklift which had been knocked on its side and partly buried by debris and creating a semblance of order as buildings were evacuated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA team headed out to the base\u0027s perimeter fence to check on the small group who had been camping out there for over a munth, protesting against nuclear technology in general and its use in space in particular, and returned shortly afterwards with several members of that group carrying first aid kits and offering their assistance, previous antagonisms forgotten in the face of the current crisis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA loud whumph made everyone flinch, but it quickly became clear where the sound had come from as the DAGGER floated down under its parachute and landed near one of the secondary pads. A small round of applause greeted its return, but attentions quickly returned to the tasks at hand and it was ignored after that, ticking as it cooled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe team from K.V. Roe had escaped with only minor injuries, and when Thombert appeared unscathed he reported that the Vulture was also undamaged. Seeing an opportunity, Tina stood on the command bunker\u0027s roof and shouted to the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEveryone! We have a transport aircraft with plenty of space that can carry all the injured to the nearest hospital.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA ragged cheer went up at her announcement and soon a line of stretchers was snaking its way across the complex towards the waiting plane, the walking wounded following close behind. The Vulture\u0027s cavernous cargo bay could fit them all in with room to spare and even had room to fit the flatbed truck with the DAGGER once again strapped down in its cargo bed. Thombert taxied the plane onto the runway and took off vertically at a much more sedate speed than he had that morning, setting a course for the nearest city.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey flew over several towns and villages at the fringes of the desert, many without power and with multiple fires burning, before landing in an open square within walking distance of a major hospital where a cluster of ambulances were waiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina and her parents were given a small room and after a short wait a young doctor came in to check them over. He gave Tina and Dad a clean bill of health, but was concerned about the bruises across Mum\u0027s stomach and requested an ultrasound machine. They struck up a conversation while they waited and the doctor was impressed by Tina\u0027s story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou actually managed to launch it into space? That\u0027s amazing!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt was, but right after that happened the earthquake struck and that really took the shine off of it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ultrasound arrived and he carried out the scan, at one point peering intently at the grainy image for several seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHave you thought of a name?\u201D he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe already gave it a name- DAGGER: Dual-mode Air-Guzzling Gas Engine for Rockets.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe doctor gave her an odd look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, I meant a name for your little sister.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWHAT!?\u201D Tina and Dad shouted at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLook just here,\u201D he pointed to a tiny smudge on the screen, \u201Cthat little bit there that\u0027s moving, can you see it? That\u0027s her heart; listen.\u201D He turned a dial and the machine began playing a rapid and distinctive thump-thump sound in time with the screen\u0027s movements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina turned to her parents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWha-?

I did NOT want to think about that!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, where did you think you came from?\u201D Dad asked her, which only made things worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNoooooo! My mind is ruined!\u201D she wailed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u0027re sure about this?\u201D Dad asked the doctor, who nodded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbsolutely. We can do a blood test to prove it beyond doubt, but I think this-\u201D he pointed to the ultrasound- \u201Cis pretty convincing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDad laughed. \u201CI always said that rocket was Tina\u0027s baby, but now I\u0027ve changed my mind. Just make sure you don\u0027t try and launch \u003Cem\u003Eher\u003C/em\u003E into space.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina sat down, trying to comprehend what had just happened. Yesterday, she was at the Science Fair hoping someone would notice her ground-breaking invention; today, she had launched it into space, survived a literally ground-breaking event and now she was going to be a sister. She suddenly realised that as thrilling as launching the DAGGER had been, it paled in comparison to the news she had just been given.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMaybe we could call her

They also claim that there was an active rocket test in progress at the moment the fault slipped, a claim which has been verified by a member of Darude staff; this staff member was keen to point out that the test in question was only a tiny fraction of the size of the Lindor 5 first stage that was tested at Darude over twenty years ago and which had no effect at all on the fault line.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina turned the TV off in disgust.

Why hadn\u0027t it failed after the four Acapello tests- including the static firing that gigantic Lindor 5 first stage at full power for its full three minute burn time straight at the ground- and why would a quiet day of only seven rocket tests whose combined thrust and duration was less than four seconds from the Lindor 5-1 be enough to trigger it?

A persistent trickle of ambulances kept arriving as rescue efforts continued, but only a few came with lights and sirens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason for that was fairly simple- after dropping off the Darude staff, Thombert had taken the Vulture and flown to various nearby towns, transporting dozens or even hundreds of people to hospitals in a single flight and greatly easing the pressure on emergency paramedics who were then free to focus on the most needy cases or help those freed from collapsed buildings, before eventually being forced to return to base before he ran out of fuel. Of course, the \u0027Children of Kaia\u0027 would see that as an action born of guilt for triggering the quake in the first place rather than a generous kermanitarian effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was another long and tedious hour before a doctor came round, checked her over and declared her fit to go home, closely followed by Mum and Dad. This became a problem immediately when they realised they weren\u0027t entirely sure where they were, had no means of getting back home and- most importantly for Tina- had to find both the DAGGER and its blueprints before going home as well. She was quite insistent on that last point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJohnbro, Desdas, Lurim and Richgan were also cleared to leave, and Tina was relieved to hear that the DAGGER was still safely stowed in the Vulture\u0027s hold and being guarded by Thombert. \u201CWith strict instructions not to let anyone near it until you arrive to collect it,\u201D Johnbro elaborated. \u201CNobody with two brain cells to rub together messes with Thombert, so it\u0027ll be perfectly safe.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blueprints, on the other hand, were gone; turned to mush when the quake had triggered both the water and foam fire suppression systems in the PAB and utterly ruined anything still inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter hearing that the crowd protesting outside were calling themselves \u0027(Da)Rude Awakening\u0027 and aggressively harassing anyone remotely connected to Darude, rockets or anything even tenuously related to space travel, Team Tina packed their Darude-issued overalls into a bag and walked out the entrance wearing normal clothes. The protesters paid no attention, until one of them spotted a rocket motif on the back of Tina\u0027s jacket as they were getting into a taxi and suddenly they surged forwards, transforming from peaceful protest to angry mob so quickly that the handful of police assigned to keep the peace could do nothing but try and avoid being trampled. The mob surrounded the taxi on all sides and began rocking it violently from side to side, screaming abuse and pounding on the windows, terrifying everyone inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter about ten seconds that felt more like ten minutes, things turned ugly: someone managed to pry a metal bollard out of the ground and turned it into a battering ram, smashing one of the side windows; a hand reached through and pulled the door handle, but couldn\u0027t get back out again before the door slid back and got trapped between the taxi\u0027s C pillar and the remnants of the window and badly lacerated; more hands reached in and grabbed Tina\u0027s jacket, hair, anything they could reach and dragged her screaming out of the car and into the heart of the mob. All she could do was try to cover her head as she felt her clothes being torn to pieces and then a blinding white-hot pain shot up her left arm making her almost black out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHospital security and the few police on scene pushed through the crowd and forced them back from the open taxi door and from Tina. Many in the crowd realised what they had done and scattered, with those two stubborn or stupid to leave corralled until police reinforcements arrived. Paramedics from the waiting ambulances came over to treat Tina and the unfortunate Kerbal whose arm had been trapped, taking both into the hospital.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina\u0027s arm was broken and her whole body was covered in scratches and bruises. A doctor gave her something to numb the pain and everything went very fuzzy for a while before she came back around and found herself in a bed with her arm straightened out and a heavy plaster cast applied. A TV was on in one corner of the room showing another news bulletin and she spotted \u201CSeventeen arrested after hospital protest turns violent\u201D on the scrolling headlines at the bottom of the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre you feeling OK?\u201D Dad asked. Tina hadn\u0027t noticed that he was sitting in a chair beside the bed and flinched away from his voice, making her arm throb painfully. Mum arrived with some new clothes and then had to help Tina put them on (which was\u003Cem\u003E extremely\u003C/em\u003E embarrassing) before leaving for the second time via a different entrance where the rest of Team Tina were waiting with another taxi. They got away with no trouble at all the second time round and were soon at the local airport where another protest was happening outside the main entrance. Everyone else got out the taxi, but Tina just couldn\u0027t do it, terrifying flashbacks replaying in her head. It took a solid ten minutes to talk her out of the taxi and only by forming a protective circle around her could she walk past the protest into the airport.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA small business jet was waiting for them and soon they were airborne and heading back home. The flight quickly became a competition between Dad, Johnbro and Lurim to see who could snore the loudest and almost everyone else fell asleep too, but every time Tina started to doze off she woke up again in a panic with her whole body trembling in fear. She tried listening to music on her phone, some soothing piano to calm her nerves, and it seemed to help as long as she stayed awake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe noticed a voicemail message was waiting from an unknown number, but when she played it she recognised Samlas\u0027 voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CHi Tina, it\u0027s Samlas here. Just to update you- I filed the patent application yesterday afternoon, and this morning Rockomax and C7 Aerospace applied to have the case examined by an independent expert. Nothing to worry about, it\u0027s perfectly normal for this to happen and with the RAPIER just hitting the market they\u0027re understandably rather twitchy about someone stealing their ideas; from what I\u0027ve seen there isn\u0027t anything to worry about and your design doesn\u0027t infringe any of their patents. I\u0027ll keep you posted on any new developments as and when they happen. Take care, bye.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first part of the message alarmed her, but the rest was more reassuring. It didn\u0027t surprise her that C7 Aerospace and Rockomax were on the lookout for people trying to copy their latest product, especially something as potentially game-changing as a multi-mode air-breathing rocket engine that could conceivably be used for single stage to orbit spaceplanes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe tried one more time to get some sleep but her arm hurt too much. She got up and headed to the back of the plane where a small fridge held a variety of drinks and a small selection of sandwiches, picking a bottle of water and a kale salad wrap. She didn\u0027t like kale, but its high nutrient and energy density made it ideal for space rations and apparently it would eventually be included on interplanetary ships as both an air scrubber and a source of food, so her plan was to eat it enough that she got used to it and could eat it on a regular basis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far this plan was having limited success, in as much as she no longer had to hold her nose while eating it to avoid gagging at the taste, but she was fairly certain that she would never enjoy eating it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the way back to her seat, she noticed Desdas was still awake and sat down in the empty seat facing him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat can I do for you?\u201D he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDistraction. Anything to avoid thinking about...\u201D She shook her head sharply, trying to shake away the bad memories. \u201CWhat is Project Elon? And why did you think I could help you with it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s Project Eeloo, not Elon. As you probably know, building a single stage to orbit, or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, aircraft requires an engine that works in atmosphere and in space, but the two are considerably different: an atmospheric engine can use oxygen in the air to avoid carrying internal oxidiser, giving it a much higher effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E than a traditional rocket, but that doesn\u0027t work once you get into the upper atmosphere so you need some form of rocket motor to get the rest of the way into orbit. The RAPIER- and your DAGGER- try to solve that problem by using air to supply the oxygen at low altitudes and then switching to an internal oxidiser supply at higher altitudes, but this is inefficient and the changeover point can be a bit, shall we say, unpredictable.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina remembered a particularly interesting afternoon when she got hold of an old oxygen tank and plugged it into an early DAGGER prototype to test that changeover, resulting in the rapid unplanned disassembly of both the DAGGER and Dad\u0027s greenhouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNow think about a planet like Eve- the atmosphere has no oxygen in it and the pressure at sea level is ten times what we have on Kerbin. No jets will work, and most rockets won\u0027t be able to function either or will have terrible efficiency as they fight against all that pressure. If we\u0027re ever going to get onto the surface of Eve and then get back out again, we\u0027ll need something different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s where Project Eeloo comes in. Instead of using combustion to provide power, Project Eeloo aims to use a nuclear reactor as a heat source and use the local atmosphere itself as a propellant, avoiding the problem of atmospheric composition completely. By using the local atmosphere as propellant, there\u0027s no need to carry fuel for atmospheric flight and atmospheric pressure isn\u0027t an issue as we can just dump excess intake air and keep feeding the engine only as much as it needs.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA nuclear engine that runs on air? That sounds a little bit too science fiction to be real.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, it\u0027s real all right. We made a prototype and had it running at full power for a good ten minutes using nothing but air and generating a decent amount of thrust. If we ever got one airborne and flying at speed, we think it could produce over two meganewtons of thrust under the right circumstances.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTwo meganewtons? How big is this thing?\u201D Tina was picturing a small power station with wings whizzing through the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027re aiming for a 2.5m profile with a maximum diameter of about three metres to give us space for additional cooling systems, and about 5 metres long without including the pre-cooler on the front.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was big. Bigger than even the Goliath turbofan that powered the largest airliners and heavy lift planes, taller than Tina\u0027s house if it was stood on its end (the engine, not the house) and surely so bulky and heavy that it would completely upset the balance of any aircraft that tried to use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf it\u0027s that big, why do you need my design? That thing would eat my DAGGER for breakfast just with the static suction from the intake.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s that contra-rotating air feeder system you developed that I\u0027m really interested in. Air coming through a shock cone intake and passing through a pre-cooler has to be slowed down by several times the speed of sound and compressed to feed into the engine, but that also makes it more viscous and rather difficult to control.\u00A0 If we could apply your design to Project Eeloo, we could get more air through the reactor more evenly and increase the efficiency while reducing the potential for overheating, which for a nuclear reactor could be, um, problematic.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, probably best to avoid that. What are you using for fuel once you\u0027re out of atmosphere?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLiquid hydrogen. Or at least, that\u0027s the idea, but that\u0027s even harder to deal with than compressed air and the fuel density is really low which limits the range.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo why use it then?\u201D Nuclear rockets were still rare, with only the LV-N \u0027Nerv\u0027 in use and even then only rarely, so for Tina this was an opportunity to learn something new.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLiquid hydrogen is a nuclear moderator and an effective coolant. When it\u0027s fed into a reactor those two things balance each other out and the reaction rate scales directly with the quantity of liquid hydrogen being added; it\u0027s very stable and very controllable, plus it heats the hydrogen by over two thousand Kelvin so produces a lot of thrust at very high efficiency.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, more hydrogen makes the reactor run faster but also cools it down faster to counter the extra fission?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s the idea.\u201D He looked at her in a strange way, she couldn\u0027t identify exactly what it was. \u201CYou know, I\u0027ve seen rooms full of grown adults who couldn\u0027t understand half of what I just told you. If you were a few years older, I\u0027d hire you right now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe finally realised what that look meant. Desdas Kerman, head of research and development at a reputable aerospace company and professional engineer, saw her as an adult, an engineer, even an equal. More than that, he had just told her that Tina, teenage schoolgirl and amateur rocketeer, had built something that an entire team of professional rocket engineers and nuclear physicists hadn\u0027t even thought of despite huge research and development in the very same area, and which he considered a technological breakthrough of such importance that he had had her and her scrap-built rocket flown half way across a continent to study it in detail. That realisation was profoundly moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s possibly the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, it\u0027s entirely true. There will always be a place for you in my team if for some reason your career as an astronaut doesn\u0027t take off.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina snorted. \u201CDad jokes?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDesdas looked at her blankly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAstronaut? Take off?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh... right. Totally meant that. I was just testing you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh-huh. One more question- how exactly are you going to sell the concept of a barely shielded nuclear reactor inside a jet engine spraying radioactive waste into the upper atmosphere to the public?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, we have a lot of safety systems built in to-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina interrupted him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDesdas, an angry mob almost \u003Cem\u003Ekilled\u003C/em\u003E me this morning because I was wearing a jacket with a band logo on the back that happened to include a rocket, just because they listened to some deranged conspiracy theory about rocket tests triggering that kerbquake. If you told them you were building a nuclear jet engine...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDesdas turned noticeably pale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEven though it would be greatly beneficial to the environment to replace oil-burning jet engines with ones that ran on just air, people are scared of anything remotely nuclear- if you told them MRI machines used nuclear magnetic resonance imaging they\u0027d never go to a hospital again, or worse, smash the machines to bits- and they\u0027ll believe whatever moronic nonsense fits their conspiracy-addled view of the world and dismiss any and all evidence that disproves it as part of that conspiracy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYour hand is bleeding.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe looked down and saw that she had clenched her fist so tightly that her fingernails had dug into her palm and drawn blood. Alarmed and slightly frightened by how angry she had become during that rant, she broke off the conversation and headed to the small toilet at the back of the cabin to get some paper towels to mop up the blood. It took several minutes of slow, deep breaths before her heart stopped racing and she felt calm again, and slightly embarrassed by the outburst.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen she returned to the cabin, Johnbro and Richgan had joined Desdas around the table and were setting up some kind of card game that required many packs of gummy bears and three packs of cards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u0027s with the gummy bears?\u201D she asked as she took the remaining seat at the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe don\u0027t have any chips and it\u0027s against company policy to use real money for any games or gambling-related activity while we\u0027re on the clock.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHang on- you\u0027re getting paid to sit in a private jet and play card games?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s a perfectly legitimate business trip, and we\u0027re not \u201Cplaying card games\u201D, we\u0027re \u201Cperforming a team-building exercise\u201D. There\u0027s a difference.\u201D Johnbro replied. Tina was not convinced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo what \u0027team-building exercise\u0027 are you doing, and can I join in?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEver played 9-card switch?\u201D He saw Tina shake her head and explained. \u201C It\u0027s pretty simple: everyone gets nine cards, then you can choose to swap up to four of them. The goal is to get two or more of the same card, or a run of consecutive cards, with more and higher value cards being better. Matching colours beat the same set when they don\u0027t match, and matching suits are even better; getting two identical cards, like for example two nine of diamonds, is a snap and beats most other sets, and three the same is a triple snap; the best possible hand is a straight triple triple flush, that\u0027s three triple snaps for consecutive cards of the same suit.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina was nearly cross-eyed trying to understand the straight triple triple flush but the basics of the game seemed simple enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd the gummy bears?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEveryone puts one, um, bear, in at the start of each hand. Once everyone has swapped cards, you can put more in if you think you\u0027re going to win, then everyone else either has to do the same or drop out. Of course, you can always put in more even if you don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to win to try and trick everyone else into dropping out but that\u0027s risky.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd try not to eat any of your gummy bears while you\u0027re playing, either.\u201D Added Desdas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalf an hour later, Tina\u0027s hoard included nearly a hundred gummy bears, most of a bar of chocolate broken into squares and a hastily scribbled IOU from Johnbro. Richgan had been eliminated twice; Lurim had joined but went all in on his first hand and lost immediately; and both Desdas and Johnbro were barely clinging on with two bears and one square of chocolate respectively. Their predicament was worsened considerably by the fact that Tina had twice resorted to essentially giving away gummy bears to keep the game going and the addition of the chocolate for the same reason, plus the fact that Tina was now regularly snacking on her pile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey were saved from any further humiliation by the plane arriving at its destination, where they were met by Thombert and the Vulture. The truck with the DAGGER on its back and a small car were driven out of its hold before the little jet performed it party trick, folding its wings and tail and driving into the Vulture\u0027s hold using electric motors in its wheels. The convoy of two drove out of the airport\u0027s perimeter and almost an hour later Tina watched as the DAGGER was- very slowly and carefully- lowered down by crane onto a wheeled platform and wheeled down into her workshop/shed. A quick exchange of email addresses and a round of handshakes followed before the K.V. Roe team drove off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven though it was still daylight, Tina immediately went upstairs and fell asleep in her bed fully clothed. For some reason, when the angry mob descended on her this time she fought them off by pelting them with gummy bears and slept soundly until the next morning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the second alarm didn\u0027t work, Mum had to go in and wake her up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u0027re going to be late at this rate.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLate for what?\u201D Tina tried to blink her eyes into focus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSchool, silly!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSchool?\u201D Her brain was still half asleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, that big building with teachers in it where you go to learn things.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo school on Sunday.\u201D She curled up again to go back to sleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CToday is Munday.\u201D Mum replied, throwing the curtains open and making Tina hide under the covers from the bright sunlight. \u201CMunday, fun day, time to get things done day! Get up!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was a quote from Tina\u0027s favourite book- when she was four.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot going to school. Sick.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u0027re not sick, it\u0027s just a broken arm. You write with your right hand anyway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHurts too much.

That\u0027s what Desdas and Johnbro were most interested in, and even if someone tries to steal the DAGGER it won\u0027t work without it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDad went outside to start dismantling the DAGGER while Mum helped her get dressed before driving her to school. It felt strange walking up to the school gates after the events of the last three days: everyone else was still talking about the Science Fair but to Tina that was a distant memory. Just before she reached the entrance she was cut off by Tebal in an electric wheelchair with her leg in a cast, her cohort of cronies running after her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, if it isn\u0027t lickle tiny Tina.

And tell Daddy\u0027s lawyer he should stick with weaselling out of speeding tickets and parking fines instead of picking fights with multinational aerospace corporations.

Tina walked past and headed into the school, feeling strangely elated. For almost a decade Tebal had been the bane of her school life, always teasing and taunting her because of her short stature, but now she knew that nothing Tebal could say to her would ever bother her again. She had built a rocket that had flown into space; Tebal was a spoilt rich brat and a petty school bully whose antics had finally come back to bite her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe took her seat for Geography 3B, but her mind was elsewhere. If she took some glass out of the greenhouse, maybe used an old washing machine or fridge with the innards removed to reduce weight and make some space, extended the intakes around the sides, added some control surfaces to the fins, then maybe, just maybe, it could work.

And of course, the obligatory BIG RED BUTTON which triggered the abort procedure- engine off, parachutes armed, fan to idle, control surfaces to airbrake mode. She fastened the seat straps as Dad followed her up the ladder and closed the hatch and locked it, gave her a thumbs up, then removed the ladder and retreated to a safe distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina started the fan first, spinning it up to operating speed and making the DAGGER vibrate slightly but keeping the blades feathered, before Dad started a countdown on his walkie-talkie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTen, nine, eight, seven, six- fan blades to power pitch, four, three- starter, two, one- ignition!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engine roared into life and built rapidly to takeoff power. Liftoff was flawless, the extra weight of the command pod making little difference to its rate of acceleration.

Or at least, she tried to. The control stick was unresponsive and no matter what way she moved it, nothing happened. This wasn\u0027t good: the controls had worked perfectly when she tested them yesterday, and all the other times before that; but since she was still fairly low and slow it wasn\u0027t too bad yet-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe speedometer said 522m/s and was still climbing, altitude already 6km. She had forgotten how much more powerful the engine would get as it gained speed and was now pulling a sustained 2.5g of acceleration. The DAGGER was slowly pitching over, but in the completely wrong direction, heading north and further inland instead of south towards the sea and the beach where she planned to land. Tina pulled the throttle lever back to idle only for it to snap off in her hand leaving the thrust set to full power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe immediately went for the big red abort button and slammed her fist down on it; with the extra force from the continued acceleration, she hit it much harder than intended and punched the button itself straight through the panel and out the bottom where it dangled by its wires, out of reach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAltitude 12km, speed 887m/s, engine operating nominally but starting to struggle with the lack of outside air. It was getting extremely cold inside the pod, causing both windows to freeze over and making each breath hurt. She was profoundly glad that she had installed that emergency oxygen supply, even if wearing a scuba mask while flying a rocket looked ridiculous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe should be panicking: hurtling at several times the speed of sound at an altitude most airliners could barely match in the completely wrong direction while sitting in a rocket-propelled fridge with no controls to speak of should have been absolutely terrifying, reducing her to a quivering wreck, but instead she was almost alarmingly calm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the engine flamed out due to lack of oxygen, she could retrieve the abort button and shut it down before cranking the handle that would deploy the control surfaces to their full extent and lock them there for air braking, deploy the drogue chute first and then the two main chutes mounted on the top the fridge/pod and near the back of the engine cowling between two of the fins. It would be an awkward landing, being stuck facing up and totally blind to what was under her, but still totally feasible. Then she would have to fix the throttle lever, find and fix the control issue followed by adding a more robust abort system, and now that she thought about it an engine gimbal mechanism wouldn\u0027t be a terrible idea...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the engine didn\u0027t flame out. Cruising at over a kilometre per second and 23km up, a delicate balance was found between the wings and the engine. At this altitude the engine was producing a fraction of its sea level thrust, only 4kN, but the air was so thin that 4kN was enough to keep the speed up; if it rose slightly, the engine faded more and the airspeed dropped slightly, resulting in the altitude decreasing and feeding more air to the engine which produced more thrust, causing it to level out and then rise again. Tracing a gentle wave across the sky, the DAGGER raced north above rolling hills and forested valleys, a tiny speck leaving a thin contrail behind it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was going to take A LOT of explaining. Tina could see a year of dish washing, grass cutting and house cleaning in her future. In the more immediate future, though, she could see a horrendous cramp in her back and a dull headache that might have been caused by the friction heating the nose cone, precariously close to her head. Head first was a good idea when launching vertically, but for landing horizontally it might prove to be... Problematic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, there was no denying that it was incredibly peaceful up here, the continuous whoosh of the air flowing around her and the dull rumble of the engine were as quiet as a whisper, the sky tinted a deep blue, like sapphire. She was floating far above even the highest cloud-tops, peaceful, calm, relaxed-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ELonely.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe started at the unexpected interruption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLonely?

Speed and altitude dropped steadily but slowly, giving Tina plenty of time to deploy the air brakes, scrape the ice off the windows and check her location. The last activity sent a cold chill down her spine as she realised just how far she had flown- almost to the equator in fact, and a few degrees to the east too.

The medical team arrived and scooped Tina up on a stretcher before whisking her off to the medical centre in the Astronaut Complex, then the engineering team arrived and began checking the DAGGER over for damage and any potential hazards like fuel leaks.

More or less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is why when the doctor tried to check her pupil responses again she suddenly lunged forwards and tried to kiss him.

Her head hurt, her face hurt, everything hurt. She tried to move but couldn\u0027t and when she looked down she was horrified to see her arms and legs had been strapped down to the bed with restraints. When the door opened she was sure it would be a group of black-suited agents wearing sunglasses ready to cart her off to some secret base for interrogation, or else a group of hazmat-suited scientists with pointy things to poke at her with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, it was just a young looking doctor who checked her vitals on a medical monitor then almost timidly approached her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m going to take those restraints off now, as long as you promise not to kiss me again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?

Small children are infuriating; everyone knows that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAND you threw up in Jeb\u0027s helmet too.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, no, this can\u0027t be true...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then she remembered it all, and wished furiously that the ground would open up and swallow her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn older doctor entered the room. \u201CSo, there\u0027s some good news and some bad news.\u201D She told her. \u201CThe bad news is, we found a small blood clot in your brain, most likely because of all that dangling upside down.\u201D She spotted Tina\u0027s terrified look and continued. \u201CThe good news is, we gave it a quick blast with that laser thingy and it\u0027s gone now. It\u0027s also good news for you, because it explains why you tried to kiss poor Lewwise here-\u201D she patted the young doctor on the shoulder, who blushed nearly as deeply as Tina- \u201Cand why you tried to pick a fight with two nurses, three orderlies and a fire extinguisher.\u201D Tina\u0027s blush shifted to a similar colour to said fire extinguisher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027ve already contacted your parents and they\u0027re on their way. I\u0027ve also been asked by the Director to give you this, and to tell you \u0027five 1s\u0027.\u201D She handed Tina a plain brown envelope, which she opened to reveal a glossy promotional leaflet for the Rising Stars program and an application form. A little thrill of excitement raced down her spine- he actually did mean it! This was her ticket to the Space Program!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA shadow loomed outside the window. The older doctor glanced towards it, did a double take, then her eyes widened and she grabbed the younger doctor and threw them both to the ground just before there was a tremendous BANG from outside. The window shattered an instant before something large and white crashed through it, accompanied by a shower of debris.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hatch opened in the large white thing and Jeb emerged from inside it, speaking with the excess volume of someone who\u0027s just witnessed a loud explosion at close range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWow, that little thing had some kick! That\u0027s the most fun I\u0027ve had in a rocket in years! Just don\u0027t tell Gene or-\u201D he spotted Tina staring at him. \u201CWell, hello again. Fancy meeting you here, heh. I\u0027ll just be... going...\u201D The door he was trying to open was blocked by the pod meaning he was trapped in the room. Tina spotted something on the floor next to her bed, stood and picked it up: it was part of the DAGGER\u0027s thrust chamber, and then it all made perfect, terrible sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe advanced slowly towards Jeb, who was still smiling but looked decidedly nervous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou... you \u003Cem\u003Estole\u003C/em\u003E my rocket?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe smile was slipping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou stole \u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E rocket?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shot a pleading look towards the two doctors, but neither of them moved to help him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd you crashed it!?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb was cornered now, but Tina\u0027s IV stand had snagged on the corner of the bed and she couldn\u0027t get any closer without either removing it or damaging herself. It was a comical sight: Jeb, fearless astronaut and test pilot, cowering in a corner from an angry teenager.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn emergency team forced the door open and tried to get into the room but were nearly flattened by Jeb as he clambered over the pod, through the door and disappeared down the corridor at triple speed with \u201CYou better run!\u201D echoing down the corridor after him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe broke it...\u201D Tina said sadly, looking out the hole where the window had been at the debris field scattered across the road all the way down to that bridge in the middle of the R\u0026amp;D complex. True to form, Jeb had tried to fly under it, but on this occasion he misjudged the DAGGER\u0027s top-heavy design and couldn\u0027t make the turn before clipping a wall and losing part of one wing, sending him hurtling out of control down the road, bouncing and breaking more parts off before crashing through the window of the medical centre at the south end of the Astronaut Complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was little hope of repairing the damage as the fuel tank had ruptured and blown out, obliterating everything in front of the central bulkhead in front of the combustion chamber in an instant. The chamber itself had shattered on impact, the rocket nozzle cracked into pieces and one of the fan blades was now buried in the wall of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, ninety metres up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe broke it...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that work, all that effort, the tests at Darude and then her flight that morning, now so much scrap and shrapnel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe noticed a strange sound from the corridor beyond her room, something that sounded like \u0027ow-ow-ow-ow-ow\u0027 getting louder and louder until two Kerbals walked in and Tina\u0027s mouth dropped open. Gene entered first, one hand firmly grasping the back of Jeb\u0027s spacesuit and towing him along backwards in an uncomfortable and undignified way. Jeb looked like he desperately wanted to be somewhere else- in fact he looked exactly like a misbehaving child who had just been given a good telling off. He couldn\u0027t meet Tina\u0027s eyes, and some part of her found it incredibly funny.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI didn\u0027t mean to crash your rocket.\u201D He said, staring at the ground in front of her feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd?\u201D Gene prompted him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd, I shouldn\u0027t have taken it without your permission.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd, it was wrong of me to do that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd?\u201D Gene looked like he was struggling to keep a straight face; Tina immediately understood why and only just managed to keep her own face neutral as she thought of her reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd, I\u0027m very, very, very...\u201D Jeb took a deep breath. \u201CSorry.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina took a step forwards and Jeb tried to take a step back but a sharp shove from Gene propelled him forwards again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLook at me.\u201D Jeb\u0027s eyes flicked up to her face, then back to the ground. \u201CLook at me, Jebediah.\u201D He reluctantly obeyed, looking just like a scolded child.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m not angry with you, Jeb. I\u0027m just-\u201D she desperately suppressed a giggle and managed to keep a straight face- \u201CI\u0027m just... \u003Cem\u003Edisappointed\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene was making an odd, high-pitched whine and his face had turned a strange colour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery disappointed in you, Jebediah. Now go stand in the corner and think about what you\u0027ve done.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene seemed to explode, and one look at his face was too much for Tina who started laughing hysterically too. The two doctors joined in, and after a while Jeb saw the funny side and laughed as well, though his was a slightly nervous laughter as if he expected everyone else to suddenly turn serious. Just when they seemed to be stopping, Gene and Tina would look at each other and start laughing again until there were tears running down both their faces and Tina had an uncontrollable fit of hiccups, which only made things worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell now, young-\u003Cem\u003E giggle\u003C/em\u003E- young lady, Jeb here has agreed to fully reimburse you- \u003Cem\u003Echortle\u003C/em\u003E- for the costs of your rocket.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was clearly news to Jeb, but for once he said nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CReally?

Then I\u0027ll personally see to it that the funds are deducted from Jeb\u0027s wages directly and sent on to you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHiccups defeated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat is an excellent sugges- \u003Cem\u003EHICCUP\u003C/em\u003E!\u201D She clapped both hands over her mouth. Hiccups- 1, Tina- 0. She spotted a jug of water and a glass, poured herself a glass of water, then thought again and just drank straight out of the jug in another attempt to suppress the hiccups.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAn excellent suggestion. I can send over a full schematic by tomorrow.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, since we\u0027re all in agreement.\u201D Gene ignored Jeb, whose face said he was anything but in agreement, and turned to the two doctors. \u201CPlease ensure miss Tina here is provided with lunch and that her clothes are returned to her when they\u0027re cleaned.\u201D Tina blushed brightly, but nobody seemed to notice. \u201CJeb, you are dismissed.\u201D Jeb couldn\u0027t get out of the room quickly enough. \u201CI look forward to meeting you again, Tina, although possibly not under the same conditions.\u201D Tina blushed even brighter, and Gene gave her a wry smile before leaving. He was half way down the corridor when he heard a tremendous HICCUP! behind him and chuckled to himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout half an hour later a messenger arrived to tell Tina that her parents\u0027 plane was on final approach and to reunite her with her newly-washed clothes. She got dressed as quickly as she could, glad to be rid of the scratchy and horribly thin medical gown she had been wearing before, and then followed the younger doctor- Lewwise, she remembered- along to the main cafeteria for a plate of \u0027extra-hot five-bean chilli surprise\u0027, which she demolished at a speed that left everyone around her amazed, and even went back for seconds, which was unheard of. Nobody had seconds on chilli surprise day!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe didn\u0027t even hear the plane landing, but Lewwise got a message on his pager and led her towards the rear entrance of the Astronaut Complex towards the waiting jet. Just as they were about to walk out the door, Tina heard a familiar voice behind her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDid you think you could just leave without saying hello?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe turned around, a big silly grin spreading across her face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVal!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWho\u0027d you expect?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina only just stopped herself from running over and hugging her, wary of embarrassing herself in front of another Space Program legend, and instead walked over and offered her hand for a handshake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIs it true? Did you really crash a rocket through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E skylights right in front of Gene, Morty, Jeb and that school tour?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, yes, but-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd did you really puke in Jeb\u0027s helmet in front of them too?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlushing furiously, Tina said nothing, which made Val laugh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd then to cap it all off, after Jeb stole your rocket and crashed it, Gene actually dragged him- by the scruff of his neck, no less- back to you and made him apologise?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes! He looked like a kid who got caught raiding the cookie jar, and I told him I was very disappointed in him and- GET BACK HERE!\u201D Jeb had appeared round a corner, spotted Tina and immediately turned on the spot and raced back the way he had come, leaving a confused looking- Bob? Bill?- standing in the middle of the hall. \u201CDo NOT make me come over there!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob/Bill made the connection and laughed. \u201COh, Jeb, you\u0027re in trouble!\u201D The only reply was loud footsteps disappearing at a run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll make sure he gets reminded of his misdeeds at least once every, hour? Is that too lenient?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHour and a half. He did apologise, after all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFair enough. So what exactly made you think it was a good idea to try and drop a rocket on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt was an accident. The controls didn\u0027t work and it just flew until it ran out of fuel. I couldn\u0027t even see where I was going when the chutes opened. Just pure blind luck.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTina, threading a needle first time is luck; flying a rocket plane for nearly half an hour with no controls only to drop straight through an eight-by-two-metre window on top of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E... The odds of that happening are astronomical- and believe me, I know a thing or two about that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina smiled, but it faded as a memory resurfaced from the flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVal, when you first went up there, did you ever feel...\u201D She struggled to find the words to describe what she had felt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLonely?\u201D Val finished her sentence. \u201CJust you, all alone in a tiny tin can, hurtling through the sky at ridiculous speeds with nothing but those pessimistic voices trying to make you doubt yourself?\u201D Tina was startled at her insight. \u201CFirst time, second time, and every time since. Doubting yourself is just part of being Kerbal, Tina; down here it\u0027s easy to drown them out, but up there with no distractions, you have plenty of time to think and that\u0027s when they rear their ugly, metaphorical heads.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow do you deal with them?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal\u0027s smile looked slightly sinister. She made a twirling motion with her finger in the direction of Lewwise, who obediently turned around and began intently studying the pattern of scuff marks on the floor. Val leaned in close and whispered to Tina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI give them all spectacularly rude names, and whenever they try to talk to me I throw every swear word I know at them.

That was not the answer she had expected at all!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course, I never actually say anything out loud. Except that one time I accidentally called Gene an \u0027Arstotzka\u0027, but as far as I know that\u0027s just a type of cheese from somewhere up north.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CErm, Val?\u201D Lewwise broke into their conversation. \u201CIt\u0027s really... not.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen what is it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn response he came closer and whispered something to Val, who suddenly blushed brightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E\u201Coh\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeeking a quick change in subject, Val turned back to Tina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo are you going to rebuild your rocket?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe thought about it for a moment before coming to the logical, if unpalatable conclusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo?

She was a little apprehensive at first, but it was soon clear that they were far more interested in hearing about what she had been doing at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and how she had got there in the first place, than telling her off for flying away and making them worry about her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI met Director Gene Kerman and he said he\u0027d give me the scholarship to pay the entry fees for Rising Stars, but only if I got five grade 1s in my exams.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, in that case I\u0027m putting you two in charge of making sure she gets those grades.\u201D Val blinked, then added: \u201CWow, I just had this really weird feeling of d\u00E9j\u00E0-vu.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMe too,\u201D Dad added, \u201Cand for some reason I\u0027m thinking about Minmus sorbet.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSome things never change.\u201D Said Mum. \u201CAnd while we\u0027re on that subject, why don\u0027t you explain to Tina why her controls didn\u0027t work.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDad blushed and stammered, \u201CEr, we don\u0027t even know that that that was the problem. That was too many thats in that sentence, I know that much.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis electronics genius,\u201D Mum pointed her head in his direction, \u201Cdropped the walkie talkie when you launched and then stuck the batteries in the wrong way round. He was also in charge of putting fresh batteries in your control joystick last night and must have put them in the wrong way as well.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou don\u0027t know that!\u201D Dad protested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, why don\u0027t we go and have a look at the DAGGER and prove it one way or the other.\u201D She spotted Tina\u0027s expression. \u201CTina, what\u0027s wrong? What happened? They told us the DAGGER was intact when it landed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt was, until Jeb stole it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe did what?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd then he crashed it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe did what!?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd it got smashed to bits.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMum spotted Jeb trying to sneak past by hiding behind a janitor with a cleaning trolley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJebediah Kerman, you get over here RIGHT NOW, YOUNG MAN!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb bolted back into the corridor and there was a loud crash as he knocked over a second cleaning trolley in his haste to escape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s alright, he\u0027s going to pay for it when I send a schematic over; Director Gene said so. Apparently he\u0027s also a distant relative of Desdas and already heard about me and the DAGGER.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSee? It all worked out well even if I did put the batteries in wrong. Which is not an admission of guilt, just so you know.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal looked at her watch. \u201CWell, it\u0027s been great to see you again, Tina, and I look forward to seeing you around here more often in future.\u201D With a final flurry of handshakes, Team Tina turned and headed towards the waiting plane and were soon airborne and heading home again. It was at that point that Tina discovered why nobody ever had seconds on chilli surprise day as she felt something deeply unpleasant happening inside her; she spent most of the flight locked in the toilet at the back of the cabin, emerging just before landing looking dishevelled and slightly traumatised.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took her a while to realise that they weren\u0027t driving home. Her suspicions were aroused when neither of her parents would tell her where they were going but they seemed to be heading to the beach where she was supposed to have landed. They parked in a deserted back street and walked through the dunes towards the beach, and as they got closer Tina could hear loud music and see a large kite that looked suspiciously rocket shaped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen they crested the final dune, and Tina\u0027s jaw dropped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe entire town seemed to be there, spread across the whole beach. There was a large stage setup in the middle just in front of the water with speakers blasting music; at least a dozen vans and trailers selling burgers, hot dogs and ice creams; hundreds of children swimming or splashing around in the sea; a fifty-a-side game of football- the proper football where you actually kicked the ball instead of that weird version with the body armour- which was slightly complicated by the fact that there were at least four different balls in play at any given time and nobody seemed to know whose team they were on; and huge screens scattered around which were showing a hundred different views of the DAGGER\u0027s launch that morning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone on the beach spotted her arrival and within seconds the beach erupted with cheers and applause. Before she had a chance to react, she was lifted off her feet and carried through the crowd towards the stage as thousands of people chanted her name. Waiting on the stage was the town mayor and the police chief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEveryone!\u201D The mayor\u0027s voice boomed out through the speakers but was barely audible over the noise of the crowd. \u201COur very own junior astronaut, Tina! Who built her own rocket out of junk and scrap and blew up a Science Fair!\u201D There were a lot of laughs, but by now almost everyone knew the story of what had happened at the Science Fair and the laughter wasn\u0027t aimed at her. \u201CWho rebuilt said rocket overnight, took it out to a test range and fired it into space!\u201D A loud cheer went up from the crowd. \u201CWho was so impatient to join the Space Program, she had to fly that very same rocket straight to the Kerbin Space Centre and make her case directly to the Program\u0027s director.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big screens played a video, obviously recorded by one of the kids from the school tour, showing the DAGGER come crashing through the ceiling and Tina\u0027s extremely undignified arrival. Fortunately for Tina, it didn\u0027t include any of the conversation that had happened just after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhose rocket was so incredible, even the famous Jebediah Kerman, test pilot and Kerbonaut, couldn\u0027t last more than three minutes at its controls before, well...\u201D The mayor pointed up to the screen above their heads and a video from a camera on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E roof played, showing Jeb\u0027s disastrous attempt to fly under the R\u0026amp;D bridge and the audience gasped at the impressive fireball that resulted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u0027t worry, folks, I\u0027ve been assured that he walked away from that unharmed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo he didn\u0027t.\u201D Tina interrupted. \u201CHe RAN away, as fast as he could, and had to be dragged back by the scruff of his neck to apologise for stealing and crashing my rocket.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd cheered even louder than before. The mayor waited for the noise to die down slightly before speaking again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHowever...\u201D There was a chorus of boos and jeers. \u201CHowever, even Kerbonauts are required to obey the law. Chief Dibella, over to you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe police chief walked up to the microphone and waited for the booing to quiet down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMartina Kerman, this morning you were observed in operation of what eyewitnesses described as, and I quote, \u0027A Spaceship\u0027. I need to see a licence and registration for said vehicle.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina saw the chief wink at her, out of view of the audience, and understood where she was going with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut Officer, the documents were in the rocket when it was destroyed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat is no excuse, young lady. Operating a spaceship without a licence or proof of ownership is a serious criminal offence.\u201D More booing and jeering from the crowd greeted that statement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m afraid there\u0027s only one thing for it. Prepare the slide!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA number of generators sputtered into life and the big screen behind the stage split in half and folded away to reveal a gigantic inflatable slide extending out into the water and inflating to its full height. Chief Dibella guided Tina to a small changing room hidden behind the stage where she changed into a wetsuit before being escorted to the top of the slide by a pair of police sergeants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe slide was a lot steeper when seen from the top and Tina suddenly felt nervous. The whole slide was swaying slightly in the light breeze and the far end of the slide was visibly moving with the waves. A cameraman appeared to provide the video and audio feeds for the big screens, clipping himself onto a safety line to avoid falling off the narrow platform at the top of the slide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two sergeants grabbed an arm and a leg each and prepared to throw Tina down the slide, but then paused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre we going on three?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep, sounds good.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COK, in one-\u201D they swung her out over the edge and back again, \u201Ctwo- wait a second.\u201D They dropped her unceremoniously to the floor. \u201CIs that one, two, three and then go or one, two, go on three?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne, two, go. That\u0027s what we said- go on three.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI always thought it was one, two, three, go. Maybe we should count backwards instead?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, HURRY UP!\u201D Tina told them. She saw a look pass between them before they picked her up again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAaand, THREE!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey hurled her down the slide. She accelerated at a dizzying rate before hitting the ramp at the end and flying up through the air. She screamed in terror and exhilaration in equal measure, seemed to hang in the air for ages before dropping into the sea with a tremendous splash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe surfaced several seconds later and a huge cheer went up from the crowd. Someone paddled up to her on a paddle-board wearing a lifeguard\u0027s uniform and after blinking sea water out her eyes she recognised him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDarryl?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe responded by diving off the board and into the sea- totally unnecessary as she was barely a metre away, but it looked good from her vantage point - and reappeared behind her. She was quite happy to let him push her towards the board and help her up onto it before he joined her. He knelt down to keep the board balanced and began paddling towards the shore with Tina sitting behind him clinging on to his waist. She found that to be a very enjoyable experience even when people in the crowd started wolf-whistling to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore huge inflatables were deployed and soon there were queues waiting for a turn on each one; everyone moved aside to let her through and somehow every time she splashed into the sea it was Darryl who picked her up and carried her back to shore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater in the afternoon they ended up sitting with Darryl\u0027s family eating hot dogs and having a wide-ranging conversation about everything from rocket launches to rocket salad and on occasions venturing into contentious territory, such as the correct order of ketchup and mustard application on hot dogs- Tina and Darryl both argued that ketchup should come first, but Darryl\u0027s parents and sister Marta were adamant that mustard should precede ketchup. It also turned out that Tina\u0027s dad and Darryl\u0027s dad were in the same pub quiz team so he passed on a message to Tina that her parents had gone back home and gave her strict instructions to be back before it was dark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun was beginning to set by the time they left the beach, and they were some of the earliest to leave. They walked back into town until they reached a point where Darryl\u0027s home was to the right and Tina\u0027s was to the left and split up, with Tina and Darryl continuing towards her house together. At some point along the way he started holding her hand and an unfamiliar but pleasant tingling sensation spread up her arm and then out through her whole body. She confided in him about that strange feeling that had come over her during the DAGGER\u0027s flight and he listened attentively without making any patronising or \u0027helpful\u0027 comments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn no time at all they were standing outside her front door and to her surprise she was reluctant for the walk to end. They just stood for a while, facing each other and holding both hands, then at some unspoken signal they kissed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat little tingle when he had first held her hand paled into insignificance next to the incredible rush of sensation that suddenly surged through her. Each second felt like hours, every nerve felt like it was extra sensitive and conscious thought was just along for the ride.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil they heard the door being unlocked and broke apart suddenly before it opened. Darryl said \u201CSee you on Munday.\u201D then turned and\u00A0walked away, and Tina just said \u201CBye.\u201D and watched him leave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe felt... different. Different in a good way. She felt like she was floating above the ground instead of standing on it. Not even the rush of hurtling down that huge slide could compete with what she was feeling now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe walked inside, completely missing the look on Dad\u0027s face that on any other occasion would have provoked embarrassed outrage, walked upstairs to the bathroom, peeled off the wetsuit and stood under the shower marvelling at how she could feel every individual little jet of water and every drip from the nozzle that didn\u0027t work right, every little grain of sand stuck between her toes, every crystal of salt in her hair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe wandered through to her room afterwards and was asleep almost as soon as her head hit the pillow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDad chuckled to himself as he climbed into his own bed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe love bug has bitten at last.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike you\u0027re one to talk, Martin. How many years did it take you to pluck up the courage to ask me out?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt wasn\u0027t talking to you that scared me, it was the thought of having to talk to your mother. I once saw her scowl at a bottle of milk and it instantly turned into cheese!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMum laughed quietly. \u201CI admit, she can be a bit intimidating at first, but once you get to know her... She\u0027s still terrifying.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStill, better for Tina to get it out of her system now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe\u0027s dead set on going to space, Jeanette. She could be gone for weeks or munths at a time; if she gets assigned to one of those interplanetary missions they\u0027re talking about, she could be away for \u003Cem\u003Eyears.\u003C/em\u003E I worry that one day, she\u0027ll have to choose between her love for someone here, and her love for space. And no matter which choice she makes, she\u0027ll regret it for the rest of her life.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo do I, Martin, so do I.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#353c41\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont style=\u0022font-size:11pt;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/193699-audacity-memoirs-of-a-kerbonaut/page/2/\u0026amp;tab=comments#comment-3797218\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 6\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-31T22:17:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2020 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpellchecking edit\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerballingSmasher","CreatedById":195689,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-31T16:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am giggling SO much right now... please... keep being so funny...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-31T20:03:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like Jeb needs to work on his fridge logic. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what a great 10K\u002B word way to end the weekend!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GuessingEveryDay","CreatedById":203507,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-31T21:03:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait.
