My name is Nauthy and like all of you I\u0027m addicted to this lovely little game. So much room for creativity and exciting explosions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been doing a LP of the game over at my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/nauthygames\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EYouTube channel\u003C/a\u003E and I\u0027d very much like to hear everyone\u0027s opinions on my creations, the latest of which is the Kerbozord. It\u0027s been heavily inspired by mecha anime and, obviously, everyone\u0027s childhood favourite show, Power Rangers.

I had a few more ideas after last night\u0027s episode, which I\u0027ll be showing off in the next video. So hopefully you enjoy what you see and come back for more! Next up I will be making it all purrdy as well as a bit more mobile. I\u0027m well aware of its...issues, heh.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also be interested in seeing other peoples\u0027 attempts at building mecha; there\u0027s some cool stuff on Reddit and these forums, but I can never get enough of giants robots! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don\u0027t know if this is the right place for it, but I\u0027d very much like to do some collaborations with other commentators, be it on KSP or another game.
