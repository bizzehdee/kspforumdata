Multiple failures across different unconnected systems, no obvious cause that he could see or feel - it just didn\u0027t make sense. \u003Cem\u003EC\u0027mon Wilford\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0he told himself, \u003Cem\u003Eyou know this capsule. Figure it out\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0He toggled his microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CControl, Moho 3. I\u0027ve got a serious problem here. Check that - serious problems.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio hissed in his ear. Wilford went pale as yet more warning lights flickered on, indicating failures within the communication systems. Frantically he scanned the control panel, trying to find somewhere - anywhere - to start. He could feel the G forces wrenching him \u003Cem\u003Esideways\u003C/em\u003E against his seat and he knew the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E was tumbling out of control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CControl - I hope to Kerm you can hear me. I\u0027m dropping the main stage to restore command authority.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnbelievably the radio crackled into life.\u00A0\u201CNegative, negative, Moho 3. Mode 1 abort! Mode 1...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was too late. Auxiliary engines ripped off the sides of the booster, pinwheeling away into the sky and leaving ruptured fuel lines and torn mountings behind them. The main fuel tank creased and then crumpled under the offset forces, setting off a catastrophic series of explosions that raced up the booster towards the capsule. Wilford just had time to feel the flames licking against his legs before everything went mercifully black.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford sat bolt upright in bed, heart pounding and sweat pouring off him. For a moment he just sat there, shaking as the last minutes of the nightmare flashed before his eyes. He glanced over at the clock and groaned. Too early to be awake, too late to get back to sleep. Resignedly, he climbed out of bed. \u003Cem\u003EMight as well grab a cup of something hot\u003C/em\u003E he thought to himself. \u003Cem\u003EHope nobody finished off the djeng sachets because this really is not the time for caffeine\u003C/em\u003E. He pulled on his clothes and padded down to the canteen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMorning, Wilford\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStartled, Wilford spun around to find Jeb regarding him knowingly from the corner of the room. \u201CJeb?\u0022\u00A0he exclaimed in bewilderment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWorrying about the flight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford decided that this wasn\u0027t exactly the best moment to admit to having \u003Cem\u003Enightmares\u003C/em\u003E about the flight. \u201CYes,\u0022\u00A0he admitted reluctantly. He opened the cupboard to look for a mug, glad that the cupboard door was hiding his face. \u201CYou want a cup of \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E too, Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust a black coffee for me if you don\u0027t mind.\u0022\u00A0Jeb yawned. \u201CBetter make it a strong one too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe spoon clinked against the side of the mug as Wilford stirred his drink. He cautiously sipped it and added a dash more water, before topping off the coffee and carrying both mugs over to Jeb\u0027s table. Jeb swept his papers together and dumped them unceremoniously onto the chair next to him. Wilford caught a quick glimpse of an eclectic mix of pages from the flight plan, engineering notes and diagrams of various components of the \u003Cem\u003EMoho\u003C/em\u003E booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford took a long slow drink of \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E as Jeb watched him sympathetically.\u00A0\u201CIt\u0027s going to be fine,\u0022\u00A0he said firmly.\u00A0\u201CYou\u0027re an excellent pilot, Wilford - heck I \u003Cem\u003Esaw\u003C/em\u003E your simulation scores for manual re-entry and they were better than mine.\u0022\u00A0Wilford blinked as he looked up from his mug. \u201CPlus you\u0027ll have the entire team watching your back during the flight.\u0022\u00A0Jeb smiled wryly. \u201CSpeaking from personal experience, there\u0027s nothing quite as reassuring as Genie\u0027s voice in your ear telling you \u0027we\u0027re working this but you\u0027re still Go\u0027, when you\u0027ve got a\u00A0panel full of lights telling you the exact opposite.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford still looked troubled. \u201CI know, Jeb - I saw the flight control team in action and they were great. There\u0027s just not much they can do about...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb interrupted him gently,\u00A0\u201Can exploding booster, cracked heatshield or stuck parachute?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford nodded dumbly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb took a swig of coffee. \u201CAll I can say is that everyone building the Moho 3 is sweating the details at least as much as the flight control team.\u0022\u00A0He looked at Wilford thoughtfully. \u201CI was watching Ribory and Seanan building the heat shield for Camrie\u0027s flight. Everything looked fine to me but Ribory had obviously spotted something. She drilled out the entire section of shield that she\u0027d spent the last two hours on, picked up that caulking gun and just set to work again.\u0022\u00A0Jeb swirled his mug absently as he went on.\u00A0\u201CI saw Ordun machining the mounts for the wiring looms for the Moho 3 and they were a work of art. Then he polished them just to make sure. I was curious because these were loom mounts for Kerm\u0027s sake - there was no need to make them to those tolerances, never mind shine them up to the point where you could use them as a mirror. Ordun just looked at me. \u0027There\u0027s a bunch of things that could go wrong with this machine, Jeb\u0027 he said \u0027but I can tell you that none of them are going to happen because of parts that I\u0027ve made.\u0027\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked intently at Wilford. \u201CYou \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E this already,\u0022\u00A0he said \u201Cbecause you\u0027re no different. Everyone building these ships has that same attitude and it\u0027s a big reason why I - and probably Camrie too - climbed into that capsule.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe all build them, we all fly them,\u0022\u00A0murmured Wilford.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly,\u0022\u00A0said Jeb. For a moment there was a faraway look in his eyes. \u201CAnd it\u0027s because of that that I honestly believe that we\u0027ll get out there one day.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford saw the expression on Jeb\u0027s face. \u201CTo the stars?\u0022\u00A0he asked quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb snorted gently. \u201CNot unless somebody re-wrote the laws of physics whilst I wasn\u0027t looking, \u201C he said.\u00A0\u201CNo, I was just talking about the planets. Duna, Jool, even Eeloo - we\u0027ll get to them all eventually. He grinned.\u00A0\u201CJust the planets? Trust me - there\u0027s plenty to keep us busy in the Kerbol system for now, without needing to find other stars to explore!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford twisted his fingers together anxiously. \u201CI want to see them too, Jeb, I really do. That\u0027s why I dropped my name into that basket. It\u0027s just that closer we get to launch day, the more the reality of how to get there has been weighing on me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded. \u201CI\u0027m not going to lie to you,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CAt the moment, it\u0027s still a risky business. But when the recovery team fish you out of that capsule tomorrow and haul you up onto the boat, I\u0027m going to be there asking you just one question; \u003Cem\u003Ewere the risks worth it?\u003C/em\u003E He looked at Wilford reflectively.\u00A0\u201CI think I already know the answer to that but right now, it might surprise you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford was silent for a moment. \u201CJeb,\u0022\u00A0he said tentatively, \u201CSuppose we do manage to re-write the laws of physics one day. Would you climb on board that first starship?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn a heartbeat, Wilford, in a heartbeat.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford pushed his chair back and got to his feet. \u201CThanks, Jeb. I\u0027m going to take a shower and think things over.\u0022As he walked over to the door, a thought struck him. \u201CBy the way - how come you were down here this early too?\u0022\u00A0As he pushed the door open, Jeb\u0027s voice floated quietly across the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy, for the same reason that you were, Wilford - for the same reason that you were.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford barely noticed the rapping on his helmet but managed a determined thumbs up as Bob squeezed his way out of the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E and sealed the hatch. He took a deep breath as he glanced round, making particularly sure that the abort handle was well within reach. Actually, after the hours spent he\u0027d spent in the simulator, the entire capsule was remarkably familiar and Wilford was confident that he could pick out any control on any panel with his eyes shut. He steeled himself and flicked on the radio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMoho 3 to Control. Hatch sealed, requesting primary comms check, over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney\u0027s reply came back promptly. \u201CReceiving you loud and clear, Moho 3. Please switch to backup antenna and repeat, over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they worked through the pre-flight checklist, Geneney was reassured to hear the clipped radio messages from the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E become gradually less and less tense. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u0027s it, Wilford\u003C/em\u003E, he thought, \u003Cem\u003EJust treat it like another sim and you\u0027ll be fine\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor his part, Wilford was thinking the same thing. The interior of the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E really was almost like the inside of the Whirligig, the cool air blowing over this face from the environmental systems was at the perfect temperature and he knew from the relaxed tones of the flight control team that the countdown was going well. He could almost persuade himself that this was just another simulation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlmost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen Geneney\u0027s report over the public address loop broke the spell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CT minus five minutes and counting. We have transferred power to the booster and the transfer is satisfactory.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA shiver ran down Wilford\u0027s spine and he could feel his pulse begin to climb. Reflexively he checked the position of the abort handle again.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EC\u0027mon Wilford\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0he told himself,\u00A0\u201C\u003Cem\u003Eif you were going to duck out of this, you had your chance when you were talking to the boss this morning.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CT minus two minutes and counting. Guidance control and launch sequencing transferred. Tank pressures nominal. Moho 3 - all systems are Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe could hear the thumps and rattling outside as the umbilicals disconnected from the booster. He braced himself as the final moments of the countdown raced past in a flurry of systems reports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CT minus 40 seconds - we have launch commit. T minus 20. T minus twelve, eleven, ten, nine...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford braced himself against his acceleration couch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIgnition!... and lift off!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTower clear!\u0022\u00A0He could barely hear Geneney\u0027s voice over the noise of the engines but the instrument panel was reassuringly free of warning lights and the booster didn\u0027t seem to have bumped into anything. Wilford checked the readouts for the LV 905s but everything looked nominal. The familiar thunder of the LV-T20 filled his ears and the g-meter swung upwards as the pressure on his chest built up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForty seconds into the flight, the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E went supersonic. Everything went suddenly quiet as the spacecraft raced ahead of the noise from its own engines. Wilford could hear the status reports from Mission Control, athough he could barely manage a grunt in reply as the rocket tore through the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMoho 3, your trajectory and guidance are Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInwardly, Wilford agreed. The booster was performing beautifully. The pitch and roll program had started right on schedule and according to the \u0027navball\u0027 attitude and direction indicator, he was right on course. Even the acceleration wasn\u0027t all that bad. In fact, compared to Tomcas\u0027s centrifuge, the real thing was positively benign. Slowly but surely, the tight knot in the pit of Wilford\u0027s stomach began to unwind, although he made a mental note to thank Geneney later for keeping everything businesslike and not filling the comms loop with excess chatter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMoho 3, standby for LV9 shutdown and detach.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford tensed. This was where Jeb\u0027s flight had gone wrong, although he knew that Bill and Richlin had been working hard on redesigning the decoupler systems, particularly the synchronising trigger circuit that had failed during Jeb\u0027s flight. Everything had worked for Camrie\u0027s flight aboard the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 2\u003C/em\u003E but even so, he was relieved when the sudden jolt and four sharp explosions from outside signalled the departure of the four lateral boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CControl, this is Moho 3. Clean shutdown and detach.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford was certain he could also hear a note of relief in Geneney\u0027s voice. \u201CCopy that, Moho 3. We read all four boosters gone.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral long minutes after the lateral boosters fell away, there was another sharp crack from above, as the protective shroud over the capsule was jettisoned. Sunlight poured in through the window and Wilford got his first glimpse outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey it\u0027s getting \u003Cem\u003Edark\u003C/em\u003E out there!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney chuckled. \u201CYep - you\u0027re starting to run out of atmosphere Wilford. Stand by for staging.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite himself, the knot of tension inside Wilford was slowly turning into a knot of excitement. Only two other kerbals in history had even had a chance to see what he was about to see. He was suddenly very glad indeed that he hadn\u0027t ducked out of the flight and more than a little humbled at the thought of all of his friends and colleagues on the ground who had devoted themselves to giving him that chance. Especially when he hadn\u0027t done anything special to deserve it other than having his name drawn out of Jeb\u0027s old waste paper basket. As the last litres of fuel drained out of the main tank, he glanced over at the abort handle, silently praying that he wouldn\u0027t need to use it after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vibration from the LV-T20 disappeared as the first stage shut down. Wilford mentally crossed his fingers, as he watched the indicator panel. Then, suddenly, he sensed the explosion far below him as the main decoupler fired and the last but one light on the panel winked out. He jerked forward against his harness, only to be shoved firnly back into his couch as the second stage engine lit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CControl, Moho 3. Second stage ignition confirmed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E soared out of the atmosphere, now flying almost along the curve of the horizon as it climbed up to orbit. Inside the capsule Wilford barely noticed the long push from the LV-905. His attention was wholly focused on his instruments and the mission clock as the engine roared silently in the almost vacuum. Sunlight washed through the capsule window, throwing distracting, jagged shadows over the interior surfaces. For a moment Wilford was almost tempted to take manual control and roll the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E to one side. \u003Cem\u003ESomething to bring up with the flight control team when I land,\u003C/em\u003E he thought to himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C30 seconds to loss of signal, Wilford. Good luck.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, Gene. Everything\u0027s looking good up here. Better than good in...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStatic buzzed from the radio as the\u003Cem\u003E Moho 3\u003C/em\u003E flew over Barkton\u0027s radio horizon. Wilford switched it off and turned back to his instruments. Velocity was right on the calculated flight profile, fuel reserves were looking good, capsule attitude was holding steady. Then, with one final crack of pyrotechnic bolts, the second stage shut down and separated from the capsule. The final light on the indicator panel winked off as the automatic systems fired a burst from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters to pull the capsule safely away from the spent booster. Wilford blew out his cheeks in a great gusty sigh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHe was in space.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment, he couldn\u0027t see a thing. Then the guidance system pitched the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E into its nose-down orbital attitude and Wilford \u0027s breath caught in his throat as he got his first glimpse of his homeworld from orbit. Not even the pictures that Jeb and Camrie had brought back from their flights could compare to the real thing. The thin glowing line of the atmosphere around the edge of the planet seemed like a terribly frail barrier between his home and the harsh vacuum of space. And no cartographer\u0027s map or kerbonaut\u0027s camera could ever hope to capture the sheer iridescent colours of Kerbin so vividly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking back on his flight, Wilford would ruefully admit that it was just as well there were no flight plan objectives for that first orbit. He turned off the cabin lights and just sat transfixed as the familiar oceans and continents sailed past \u003Cem\u003Eunderneath\u003C/em\u003E him. As the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E sped towards the terminator, the colours of the landscape shifted subtly as the sky faded into twilight. Wilford watched in awe as the lights came on across Kerbin, from the faint but regular glow of the Kerm groves to the brilliant but scattered jewels of the larger kerman towns. Then, as his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he realised that the stars were coming out around him, first in their thousands and then in their hundreds of thousands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor an all too brief time, Wilford floated serenely above the world as the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E raced around the night side of Kerbin. Then the stars began to fade and the first tentative fingers of dawn reached out across the sea. Moments later, a brilliant flare of light heralded Kerbol\u0027s emergence over the horizon and the ethereal beauty of an orbital sunrise shone through the capsule window. Wilford could just make out The Crater drifting past beneath him, the dawn light casting mountain sized shadows over the sea. He shook himself. If that was The Crater then he should be coming back into radio contact with the Space Centre any moment now. He clicked the radio on and Geneney\u0027s voice filled the capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CControl to Moho 3. Come in Moho 3.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMoho 3 to Control. Receiving you loud and clear, Control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood to hear you, Wilford. How\u0027s the ship?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPerfect, Gene, just perfect.\u0022\u00A0Wilford was silent for a moment. \u201CUmm, I don\u0027t know if Jeb is in the bunker at the moment but you might want to tell him that the answer is a definite yes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAhh copy that, Wilford. Whatever that meant it sure put a big smile on Jeb\u0027s face. You might also want to keep your eyes peeled for a large thumbs up heading up to orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney blinked in surprise as Wilford\u0027s laughter echoed over the radio. \u201CSounds like the perfect time to try out the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E then, Gene, if I\u0027m going to be making evasive maneuvers any time soon. Right - I\u0027ve got the flight plan and checklists here. Rotation and attitude holding tests first. Switching to manual control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeling keyed her microphone. \u201CLooking good, Flight. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E override is in, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on manual, point two clockwise roll initiated.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWheeeee! Hey, Control this is \u003Cem\u003E super!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney frowned and quickly flicked through to a separate channel on his console. \u201CFlight to Capsule Systems. I need an atmosphere check Ribory.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reply was prompt. \u201CMy thoughts exactly, Flight but oxygen partial pressure is normal. I think we just have a very happy kerbal up there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you.\u0022\u00A0Geneney switched back to the air to ground loop in time to catch the end of Wilford\u0027s comment. He still sounded elated, although thankfully, the slightly manic tone had disappeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSay again, Moho 3. We\u0027re getting some transmission noise here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy, Gene. Roll thrusters performing nominally and I\u0027m seeing zero offset rates on pitch and yaw. Cancelling roll now!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford fired the anticlockwise roll thrusters, watching the navball and rate indicators closely. As the direction indicator showed him returning to level flight he deftly applied a tiny burst of additional thrust and released the controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRoll cancelled, Flight. Residuals are damping nicely. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to HOLD.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood. Proceed with pitch and yaw tests.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E spun slowly through space, first about one axis then the other, before returning to its original orientation. On board, Wilford was jubilant. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E was performing far better than he had expected and his little craft was crisp and responsive to the controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, this is Moho 3. Rotation and attitude hold tests complete. No problems moving between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modes either - whatever Bill did to the guidance system seems to have worked. Pass on my thanks to the Booth Crew too - this is a breeze after flying the Whirligig!\u0022\u00A0There was a pause.\u00A0\u201CMy panel is clear, Control. Ready for orbit raising burn at next periapsis?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CConfirmed, Moho 3\u00A0and good luck. We\u0027re seeing all systems Go and forty seconds to loss of signal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E flew into darkness again but Wilford was too busy to look out of the window on this orbit. Deftly he worked the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E controls, swivelling the capsule around with delicate bursts of monopropellant. Satisfied at last, he let the automated systems hold the spacecraft in its new orientation and waited for the clock to tick down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThree, two, one and burning!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe pushed the handgrip firmly forwards, settling gently into his seat as all four \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters fired. The velocity indicator started to climb, as the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E pushed itself out onto a new orbit. Wilford kept the translation control pushed forward, one eye watching the velocity indicator, the other scanning the attitude rate indicators for any sign of trouble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd shut down. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to auto. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E override off.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a minute, Wilford wondered what he was doing, talking to himself over the far side of the world. Then he shrugged. Nobody was going to hear him after all and if it helped with the checklists then so be it. He checked the controls again. Everything looked fine but he would need to wait another forty minutes for the proof. As the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E raced into daylight once more, Mission Control were ready with the good news.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNice burn, Wilford. We\u0027re tracking you in a 180 by 350km orbit, no change in inclination.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot precisely what we had in mind, Gene,\u0022\u00A0Wilford replied cheerfully,\u00A0\u201Cbut what\u0027s a couple of kilometres of apoapsis between friends.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEither way you\u0027ve just set a new altitude record.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford laughed. \u201CI suppose I have at that, although hopefully it won\u0027t be a record for very long. Oh wow - it\u0027s high enough to make a difference though! I\u0027m seeing way more of Kerbin from up here. I hope the camera is working because this is spectacular!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell the good news is that you can enjoy the view for an orbit or two. Given that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E seems to be working so well, we\u0027ve got a small experiment that we\u0027d like to try. The flight dynamics teams are just running the numbers now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COK, Wilford, we\u0027ve got an unscheduled change for the flight plan. Ready to take this down?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CReady and waiting, Gene.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford\u0027s mind raced as he jotted down the numbers. It was a straightforward attitude change but it would leave the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E in a slightly odd orientation in space. Shrugging slightly, he switched the spacecraft back to manual control and set to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd attitude hold. Not sure what I\u0027m supposed to be doing here, Gene. Hang on a minute though - that\u0027s a pretty bright star...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford blinked hard and peered intently at the blue-green speck floating in the middle of the capsule window. Then everyone in Mission Control heard the dawning realisation in his voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COhhhh. That\u0027s no star, Gene! Minmus, repeat - I have Minmus!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the background he heard the cheering from Mission Control and even over the radio he could sense the grin in Geneney\u0027s voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat was the plan. You\u0027ve just made the flight dynamics team very happy indeed! So what does it look like from up there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust a small greeny-blue dot to be honest, Gene. But dammit - Minmus. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m seeing it with my own two eyes!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany hours and many orbits later, Wilford stretched, rolled his shoulders as best he could in the confines of his harness and pushed himself back into his couch. The flight had gone better than he had dared to hope, the capsule systems were holding up well and every objective on the flight plan had been neatly ticked off. Inclination changes, altitude changes at different orientations to test the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E translation along different axes and best of all that naked eye observation of Minmus. There was just one task left to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorking with practised ease, Wilford brought the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 3\u003C/em\u003E into position for the final burn. He glanced at the navball one last time and carefully checked the periscope display, nodding in satisfaction to see Kerbin lined up neatly along the manual orientation reticle. Then once again, it was just a matter of waiting for the right moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the retrofire sequence began, Wilford smiled peacefully up at the window, taking in one last glimpse of the stars before they faded our behind a lambent curtain of ionised gas. He had just been where only two kerbals had ever gone before, he had seen things that no kerbal had ever seen before and now, he knew, he was going home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut he would be back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral minutes later Jeb watched from the deck of the recovery boat as the familiar orange parachutes blossomed into the sky. \u201CGood flight, Wilford,\u0022 he murmured to himself, \u201Cgood flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=635374\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 16\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 :: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=647829\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EFan Art\u003C/a\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-12T20:26:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2019 08:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"[ Jeremy ]","CreatedById":33887,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T06:39:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWilford the nervous comes out as Wilford the brave!

Last I checked, First Flight has just about scraped over the NaNo target and I\u0027ve been plugging away at it fairly steadily since June. Trying to cram all that into one month - yeah. Or rather - no. Not for me at any rate. I can\u0027t honestly claim any actual knowledge here having never tried it but it seems to me that NaNo is partly a wake up call, as to quite how much text goes into a novel and partly about the discipline of sitting down and banging out the words. Editing comes later if at all, unless you are really quick at getting the words down and have time to edit as you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaffeine tolerance - ouch. I was there or thereabouts at one point with coffee (thank you all-night lab sessions) but decided I\u0027d better cut back for various reasons, the kidney pains being something of a hint. Mind you, the coffee in question was courtesy of a mate in the next lab along. This was the guy they\u0027d send all the visiting Turkish and Middle Eastern professors to, so that they could get some real coffee rather than this suspiciously liquid stuff that was the only other thing on offer. So relying on it for caffeine \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E hydration probably wasnt a smart move in retrospect (although I suspect Bob would approve \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow - back on topic.
