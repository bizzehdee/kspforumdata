It rotates at 35deg/s to simulate sea level gravity (using the Persistent Rotation mod to keep the station pointed at the Sun and rotating through timewarp). All the docking ports are actually connected! Call it luck or skill, but somehow I managed to align everything and make this work.

Although 302 at one time would be pretty expensive, I believe he is talking about the fact that each additional kerbal you add to your space program costs more to hire in the astronaut complex. In my career mode, I think I\u0027ve got around 12 or 15 kerbals, and the next one would cost me ~1 Million just to have available for use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Generalstarwars333","CreatedById":151938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T03:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr.
