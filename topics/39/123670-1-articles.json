His teacher spoke \u0022John, we have to talk about this morning.\u0022 John turned his gaze to his teacher. \u0022Look Mr Kerman I\u0027m sorry. The guy called Jeb stupid.\u0022 Mr. Kerman sighed \u0022John, I know you admire Jeb but punching Nilrod just for calling him stupid. Come on that\u0027s a little much.\u0022 John\u0027s eyes darted across the school yard to Nilrod surrounded by Kerbalinas. \u0022John??\u0022 Mr. Kerman said. John turned back to his teacher. \u0022I\u0027m sorry, what more do you want me to do?\u0022 Mr. Kerman sighed yet again. \u0022Just don\u0027t do it again, okay?\u0022 Mr. Kerman stood up and opened the classroom door. \u0022Now get out of here, You\u0027ll miss the landing.\u0022 John grinned and rushed out. \u0022John!\u0022 Valentina called out as she ran up beside him. \u0022Hey Valentina\u0022 John said as she caught up with him. \u0022I heard you punched Nilrod.\u0022 Valentina said. \u0022How\u0027d you hear that?\u0022 John asked. \u0022Um you did it in the Cafeteria at lunch, everyone saw.\u0022 Valentina replied. \u0022Well he deserved it.\u0022 said John \u0022I don\u0027t doubt it.\u0022 Valentina said. John arrived at the bus stop. \u0022Hey you coming over tonight to watch the landing?\u0022 John asked. \u0022No I think ill stay at home and listen to my father complain about me going out with you. Of course Ill be there.\u0022 Valentina Laughed. \u0022See you later tonight.\u0022 john said with a smile as he stepped on the bus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ten feet\u0022 Jebediah Kermans voice echoed through the TV. John sat on the floor his eyes fixed on the screen. His arm draped around Valentina the entire living room of twenty or so Kerbals silent as everyone waited. \u0022Two and half down.\u0022 Bill Kerman\u0027s voice called. \u0022Contact light\u0022 Called Bill through the tv set. \u0022Okay engine stop.\u0022 The tension in the room could be cut with a knife as everyone waited. \u0022Uhh Kerbin Tranquility base here, The Eagle has landed.\u0022 with those words everyone in the room began cheering. The screen switched to a view of mission control, Kerbals shaking hands, jumping up and down and a few running wildly around the control terminals swinging their ties above their heads. John\u0027s living room quieted down as the kerbals at mission control took their seats again as they prepared for the first steps. Snacks were passed around the living room as everyone waited to watch the first Kerbal walk on the Mun. A few minutes later the screen flickered and switched to a camera on the lander. Movement could be seen as Jebediah stepped out the hatch onto the lander\u0027s ladder. He began to slowly step down the ladder one rung at a time as all of Kerbin stared silently into TV. screens. John squeezed Valentina\u0027s hand as they watched. Finally Jeb stepped off the Ladder onto the Munar surface. Kalter Kronkites voice called out. \u0022Jebediah is on the Mun, Jebediah Kerman a thirty eight year old Kerbal standing on the surface of the Mun. On this July twentieth nineteen hundred and sixty nine\u0022 Jebediah Kerman pressed his foot into the Munar soil and echoed his famous lines \u0022That\u0027s one small step for Kerbal, one giant leap for Kerbalkind.\u0022 As John\u0027s face slowly turned to a smile a tear of joy rolled down his cheek. He knew exactly what he wanted to do with his life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter Two \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgram Director Fimlin Kerman strode into the office of flight director Gene Kerman. Gene stared out over the Kerbal space complex. \u0022Gene, where is everyone?\u0022 Fimlin asked. \u0022They\u0027ve been here and gone Fimlin, your late again.\u0022 Gene replied. Fimlin gave a light sigh as he laid the weather reports for the next few days out on the table. \u0022If we don\u0027t choose from one of these four days we won\u0027t get a chance to launch the mission this year. Kongress will never approve a second mission while the first is still sitting on the pad.\u0022 Gene nodded picking up the papers and skimming through them. \u0022One of these four?\u0022 Fimlin sighed lightly \u0022We must choose one.\u0022 Gene chuckled and set the papers back down \u0022We can\u0027t launch under these conditions.\u0022 Fimlin nodded lightly \u0022Normally no we couldn\u0027t. But I\u0027ve talked to Wernher and he says that the Cerura could launch in these conditions. Besides, we only came up with these new fangled safety regu, regu...\u0022 Gene frowned \u0022Regulations?\u0022 Fimlin nodded \u0022Yea those. We only came up with them last week.\u0022 Gene gave a Fimlin a disappointed look. \u0022Okay, We launch on Thursday.\u0022 Fimlin grinned collecting his papers. \u0022I\u0027ll let everyone know.\u0022 He said as he rushed out the door. Gene sighed and looked out across the complex to the launch tower where several engineers were banging a solid rocket booster with a mallet \u0022Safety regulations, whose idea was that anyway.\u0022 He scoffed taking a sip of koffee from his rocket ship shaped mug. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher Von Kerman ran aimlessly around the lab as he chased a large blob of goo as it slid away from him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Get back here you!\u0022 He said in a heavily thick accent. Fimlin walked through the door and grabbed the blob as it slid past him \u0022Got him.\u0022 Wernher rushed over and grabbed the goo quickly stuffing it into a science container. \u0022Thanks for that, I\u0027ve been chasing him for about half an hour.\u0022 Fimlin smiled. \u0022Happy to help, also I need a favor.\u0022 Wernher nodded \u0022Ja Ja what is it?\u0022 Fimlin poked the locked up goo a few times with his pencil. \u0022If Gene asks the Cerura can launch in Thursday\u0027s weather.\u0022 Wernher looked at him confused \u0022But the Cerura needs perfect conditions.\u0022 Fimlin turned. \u0022We either launch Thursday or we don\u0027t launch.\u0022 Wernher pondered for a moment \u0022Ahhh yes of course the Cerura can launch.\u0022 Fimlin grinned \u0022That\u0027s good news. Now go load the science containers into the payload bay.\u0022 He said turning to leave. \u0022I will after this.\u0022 Wernher nodded and set back to work pouring random chemicals into beakers and mixing them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJohn Kerman sat at the desk in his room at the astronaut complex playing on his computer. Bargon Kerman walked in \u0022Whatcha playin?\u0022 John stared intensely at the screen \u0022It\u0027s this new Indie space simulator called NASA space program. It\u0027s pretty cool. You control these little guys called Humans and launch them into space.\u0022 Bargon nodded. \u0022Sounds epic. Anyway\u0027s the launch is Thursday so get your affairs in order.\u0022 John nodded as he pressed the launch button on his computer. He frowned as the launch escape tower fired but the rest of his rocket failed to launch. \u0022Damn staging.\u0022 He said with a sigh as he turned off the monitor and walked over to the closet to pack his bags. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-25T09:23:44Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2015 09:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yuri kagarin56\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
