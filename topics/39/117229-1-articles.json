Now, I\u0027ll be writing some stupid little KSP-related comedy stories *as well*! Hooray!\n\nSo, this may become a series, or it may not. It all depends on how well-received this stuff is. So if you like it, please say so! And if you think that it\u0027s possibly the worst thing you\u0027ve ever seen, say that too! Only say it a little more nicely than that, for pity\u0027s sake.\n\nRight. Here we go.\n\n~~~\n\n**Wernher von Kerman: Build Supervisor!**\n\nThe sun was shining with all of its might into the dusty confines of the VAB. Crates had been piled into an especially cobwebbed corner. Someone had written \u0022Ferfurt is a Bum\u0022 with his finger on a grimy window. The dust bunnies were now the size of small oxen, and they were ready to engulf any Kerbal who unwittingly reached for the #21-315 wrenches at the wrong time.\n\nIt was a normal day at the KSC.\n\nAnd yet, within the dusty and rusty building, a small team of Kerbals strove to make one final rocket. They wanted to recapture a tiny bit of the glory of this place; they wanted to restore its legacy. Or maybe they just wanted to fly Ferfurt into space and leave him there. Ferfurt really *was* a bum.\n\nThis team was led by Wernher von Kerman. Greying and constantly wheezing, Wernher was nonetheless the most qualified Kerbal to help the team. His love for building rockets had been partially replaced with his love of waving his cane about, muttering, and using the restroom. But his passion for rocketry was still strong, and all of the Kerbals respected him for it. Or at least, they pretended to.\n\nNow, Wernher wanted his team to get up far earlier than would generally be considered sane. He would have used a bugle to awaken the sleeping builders, but he needed to catch his breath after standing up. So instead, he lit a match and threw it, assuming that the floor would have enough pyrotechnic crud on it to get things going. He was right. A suspicious brown stain on the floor disappeared with a loud CRACK, throwing little bits of dust bunny through the air.\n\nThe builders woke up with a start and yelled some things that are not polite to discuss, so I won\u0027t discuss them. Wernher just smiled a gentle, wrinkled smile and said, \u0022Get up, ya lazy bums! When I was your age, we all got up at five thirty *sharp*. (Wheeze.) We didn\u0027t just lollygag about. That\u0027s the problem with kids these days. They\u0027re just so - mumble mumble \u003Csub\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Emumble\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\n\nThe day had begun. It was time to start building.\n\n\u0022Alright... um... Mr. Wernher.\u0022 (The Kerbals had realized quite early on that Wernher was to be called *Mr.* Wernher, and perhaps Mr. Wernher, *sir* if you wanted to get along well.) \u0022What will we be doing today?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, um, that\u0027s a good question. Say, what was your name again?\u0022\n\n\u0022Calrie, sir.\u0022\n\n\u0022Say again?\u0022\n\n\u0022CALRIE, SIR.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, okay. Like the shell.\u0022\n\n\u0022Not cowrie - you know what? Never mind. What are we doing today?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, let\u0027s see. (Wheeze.) We\u0027ve done the capsule, right?\u0022\n\n\u0022Sir, we did that a year and a half ago.\u0022\n\n\u0022Okay, how about the boosters?\u0022\n\n\u0022We\u0027re actually done with pretty much everything, sir. All we need to do now is get the thing out on the pad and launch it. The rocket\u0027s *right there*. I think... um... I think you need your glasses.\u0022\n\n\u0022Okay. Say, have you figured out who\u0027s going up yet?\u0022\n\n\u0022We... um... we were thinking of sending up Ferfurt. Sir.\u0022\n\nWernher wheezed and squinted at Calrie. Then he looked across the room at Ferfurt, who was sitting bolt upright and smiling a chipper smile. \u0022Hello, sir! How are you doing this fine morning?\u0022 he said, standing up to reveal his pressed pants and immaculately clean shirt. \u0022It\u0027s great to see you.\u0022\n\nAs I said, Ferfurt was a *bum*.\n\n\u0022Are you sure you want to launch him?\u0022 Wernher shifted a little. \u0022Back in my day, we only sent up the slovenly and misguided youth. Ferfurt, on the other hand...\u0022\n\n\u0022Sir, we thought that - um - sending Ferfurt up would be a good way to show that nowadays, astronauts have sophistication and taste.\u0022 Calrie had practiced this excuse at least a few dozen times. Apparently, this practicing had paid off. Wernher bobbed his head up and down and growled, \u0022Alright, we can do that.\u0022 He paused. \u0022I need to use the bathroom. Give me a minute.\u0022 He wandered to the restroom at about the speed of the average glacier, wheezing as he went.\n\nAs soon as the door was closed, Calrie yelled to the others, \u0022Guys, guess what? Ferfurt\u0027s going up!\u0022\n\nThe room exploded into cheers. Even Ferfurt murmured a \u0022How nice!\u0022 and offered an encouraging smile. The VAB may have been grungy and filled with homicidal dust bunnies, but now it was also filled with a bunch of very happy Kerbals. For once, the old building seemed bright and festive, and the project seemed almost worthwhile.\n\nAnd then Wernher poked his head out of the door and yelled, \u0022Quiet!\u0022 (Wheeze.) \u0022Why are you yelling like that?! Back in *my* day...\u0022\n\n~~~\n\nSo this is the first chapter. Once again, let me know what you think about this stupid story!

As such, he had lost his German accent after a few years. Keep in mind, too, that these events are taking place dozens of years after the KSC was shuttered, and that Wernher would have had plenty of time to lose his accent in the interim.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, I like the part about the dust bunnies. But about Ferfurt. Is he a bum in the human sense, or what?\n\nWhen I say \u0027bum,\u0027 I don\u0027t mean a person who carries about his or her possessions in a shopping cart and sleeps under overpasses. Rather, I\u0027m using slang for a part of the body that is also known as the posterior or the *gluteus maximus*. There\u0027s a three-letter word that\u0027s used to refer to this part of one\u0027s body and also to donkeys. Whenever you see the word \u0022bum,\u0022 you can substitute in the other word in your head. I don\u0027t mind, but others probably do. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T22:29:41Z","Content":"In reality, this little fun story made my day.\n\nIt\u0027s not stupid.\n\nThank you."}]}
