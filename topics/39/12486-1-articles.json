I figured that since my series of short stories got pretty good feedback, I\\\u0027d go ahead and start a bigger story. And so, without further ado, I present...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EIt Escaped\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EChapter One: Onto the Surface\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you\\\u0027re looking for a story. Maybe you want action, or horror. Or maybe you\\\u0027re more of a fan of adventure and romance. Whatever the case, you\\\u0027re here, seeking something to entertain you for a few minutes before you move your attention to another matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, sorry to disappoint you, but this story isn\\\u0027t like that. This is a record of true events, as experienced by myself. If you get this transmission, don\\\u0027t send anyone back to this godforsaken moon; there\\\u0027s only death left now. My name is Marcus Kerman, and I\\\u0027m still out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0027Bzzt... Landing sequence initiated. Killing horizontal velocity. RCS thrusters activated.\u0027\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027About time...\u0027 I muttered. \u0027Stupid Mechjeb messed up my flight schedule. Why couldn\\\u0027t they just let me pilot the damn thing myself?\u0027 Within a few seconds, the craft had settled on the ground of the Mun base\\\u0027s landing pad. The Mechjeb\\\u0027s indicator turned from green to red, signifying that it had turned off, and I pressed the button that opened the exit hatch. A grinding noise sounded, followed by the opening of the small door.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I climbed out of the small lander shuttle and onto the Munar surface, I was greeted by a short, relatively bulky man with a stubbly chin and glasses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Ah, professor Marcus Kerman,\u0027 the man said. \u0027I never thought I\\\u0027d see you back here!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Hello, James,\u0027 I replied, shaking his hand. \u0027Believe me, I never thought it either.\u0027 I glanced up, where I could see the slow rotation of Kerbin in the distance. It was nighttime, with my home nation of Lunus facing towards the Mun, and I could almost picture my family asleep in their home. \u0027I trust you brought me all the way up here for a reason?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yes, of course,\u0027 James Kerman replied. He was an esteemed astrophysicist, scientist and astronomer, the brains behind the first Minmus landing and the construction of the Mun base I was now standing next to. \u0027Our miners have finally opened up a crack on the ground.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis news surprised me. Several years earlier, scientists had observed that the Munar surface was made of an extremely hard stone, multiple times more so than even diamond. The earliest notice of this had occurred on the first crash-landing on the Mun, wherein the exploding shuttle hadn\\\u0027t made a single crack in the ground. Ever since, mining companies had been shipping workers and bases up constantly to try to harvest the strange material for profit. None had succeeded, even with the most cutting-edge (Excuse the pun) technology available... Until now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027How\\\u0027d you do it?\u0027 I asked curiously. \u0027I thought the soil was impenetrable.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Up until now, yes,\u0027 James replied. \u0027We managed to set off enough explosives in a small enough area to break off tiny chunks of the rock, which we substituted into our drills. It worked like a charm; We\\\u0027ve got a trench three meters deep and twenty meters wide mined out already.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Sounds interesting,\u0027 I said. \u0027Have you analyzed the composition yet?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Well, we do know that it\\\u0027s nothing like what we have on Kerbin,\u0027 James responded. \u0027Just wait until you see it yourself, Marcus. It\\\u0027s amazing, and going to be worth a fortune once we get it shipped back home.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe arrived at the entrance to the base, a giant glass dome built into one of the Mun\\\u0027s natural craters. The miracles of science had increased in leaps and bounds in the last decade or so, and it was reflected here; inside was a fully independent, self-sufficient ecosystem with air, water, and food. As I watched, a rocket took off from a launchpad located outside the dome, heading back towards Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Here we are,\u0027 James said as we reached the trench. Miners wandered around inside the hole, hacking away at segments of rock, while drills slowly wore away at the earth. The rocks were transported by the bucketload towards what I guessed was a processing facility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJames picked up a small chunk of stone from the edge of the trench and showed it to me. \u0027As you can see, it looks just like normal stone. But it\\\u0027s hundreds of times harder and more powerful,\u0027 he noted. \u0027Amazing by all accounts.\u0027 c\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I watched, a more hollow sound emanated from where one miner was working away. He pulled out a chunk that seemed lighter-colored than the others around it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I got another one!\u0027 The man said, holding it up. James walked over and took the stone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027What is that?\u0027 I asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027This,\u0027 James said, smiling, \u0027Is why you\\\u0027re here.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EChapter Two: Into the Rift\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJames and I stood in a small laboratory, looking at the glass case in which the rock from earlier now lay. As I watched, a miniature drill pierced the surface of the stone. Immediately, a dark-colored gas began to seep from the puncture, billowing out until the case was entirely full. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027What was that?\u0027 I asked, bewildered. \u0027Is it toxic?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027We have no idea what it is,\u0027 James replied, looking almost as confused as I felt. \u0027And no, it\\\u0027s not toxic, at least as far as our tests have proven. We haven\\\u0027t made anyone inhale it or something dangerous like that. Tests so far show that it appears to be made up of absolutely no known element; just like the rock, this is something we\\\u0027ve never seen before. It looks like a gas, yes?\u0027 I nodded. \u0027Watch this.\u0027 James pressed a button on a handheld remote and the drill retracted from the case; once it was out of the case, it appeared to be covered in a thick, tar-like substance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027As you can see,\u0027 James continued, \u0027It possesses the attributes of both a solid and a liquid.\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027So why isn\\\u0027t it filling the entire room?\u0027 I questioned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027We believe it is the specific type of rock found on the Mun that keeps the material from spreading.\u0027 James pointed to the drill, which I now noticed was tipped with the rock that had been mined from the Mun\\\u0027s surface. \u0027It somehow keeps the material glued to itself and unable to spread. And yet, the specific type of other rock the material is found in does not, which is why it could escape in the first place.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027So, what does this all mean?\u0027 I asked once more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027It means that we\\\u0027ve discovered something new. Something unknown and unimaginable up to this point. Does that not excite you?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Of course it does,\u0027 I replied. \u0027But I\\\u0027m not a scientist. Why did you call me up here?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Because we\\\u0027ve found something beneath the surface,\u0027 James responded. \u0027It appears to be a series of tunnels, all full of this gas. We\\\u0027ve sent a robotic probe in to map out the tunnels, but the gas has another strange attribute in that it seems to stop our contact with the probe. What we want you to do is go in there, get the probe out, and bring it back so we can manually find out what it mapped.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027And how do you know I\\\u0027m not going to die from the gas?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I\\\u0027m not an idiot, Marcus. We have a specially-designed suit made, as well as an oxygen tank and various other goodies. You\\\u0027ll have everything you need to go get it.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I\\\u0027m still not sure about this,\u0027 I said, worried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Come on, Marcus,\u0027 James replied. \u0027You\\\u0027ll be fine. It\\\u0027s not like there\\\u0027s some monster down there that\\\u0027s going to kill you. We just need you to get that probe back.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Fine,\u0027 I grumbled. \u0027I\\\u0027ll do it.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout an hour later, I was suited up in the specially-designed apparatus that James had designed for delving into the tunnels. It looked suspiciously like a normal spacesuit, but it had several Mun rocks built into the suit to keep the gas from spreading, should the suit break and let any in. I was standing in front of the entrance to the tunnels; a large trapdoor made of the Munar stone, presumably to keep the gas from getting out into the base. A guard opened the trapdoor, and I climbed down into the darkness...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFar away, back in the science lab, the gas, which had seemed to be still but was actually pushing powerfully on the glass chamber, finally shattered its container and began to engulf the room in darkness. People screamed but were cut off as the gas accumulated in their lungs and began to choke them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tunnels were completely dark, save for the beam of my flashlight as it swept through the air. However, the light couldn\\\u0027t make it more than a few feet before being swallowed by the wall of gas, so I might as well have been blind. Luckily the tunnels were relatively straightforward; there were no intersections or sudden drops, just a uniform line down deeper into the Mun\\\u0027s crust. All the while, the gas became thicker and thicker, until my flashlight beam could only go an inch or two before ending. My oxygen tanks had nearly run dry, and I hadn\\\u0027t seen any sign of the probe. Heck, I didn\\\u0027t even know what the probe even looked like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027James, what did you get me into?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust then, my helmet began to crack and the gas began to seep in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anomalous_Matter","CreatedById":24939,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-11T13:33:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApparent lack of interest and writers\\\u0027 block have culminated in a request to lock or delete this thread.
