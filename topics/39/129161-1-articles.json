The aircraft and the rocket are both reusable but\u00A0i haven\u0027t included the\u00A0rocket re-entry, maybe in the next video where i put the fuel to use\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/3L9bDFpeiU4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/3L9bDFpeiU4\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
