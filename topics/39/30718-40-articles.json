She watched the younger kerbal carefully cut a drinking straw into small pieces and the older, no less carefully, wind a strip of wet paper around a wire frame. Smiling to herself, she waited for Joenie to finish before closing the door behind her and putting down her bags.\u00A0The clank of bottles managed to do what an opening door could not, and Joenie looked up inquisitively. \u201CMummy!

Resignedly, Gerselle watched her dig her hand into the washing bowl and retrieve a fistful of dripping paper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot as much as that, Joenie. Look.\u201D Enely demonstrated with his own, smaller handful. Joenie dropped her wad of paper back in the bowl, giggling at the soggy, splattering noise it made, before picking up a clump of strips between finger and thumb and moulding them onto the growing model. Gradually, with the occasional patient suggestion, the wire framework acquired a more-or-less even shell of papier-m\u00E2ch\u00E9.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t you put the last bit there, Joenie? There you go - perfect!\u201D Enely surveyed the finished model, feeling obscurely pleased with himself. \u201CI\u2019ll just go and wash out the bowl and then we can make the grooves. Gerselle looked up from stirring her saucepan to see a bulbous, grey\u2026something standing on a square of cardboard.\u00A0Enely caught her eye with an embarrassed little smile. \u201CIt\u2019ll look better once it\u2019s marked, spined and painted.\u201D he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo you like my kerbahusk, Mummy?\u201D said Joenie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s very good, sweetheart,\u201D said Gerselle, \u201Cbut what is it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s a cactus, Mummy - we\u2019re learning about deserts at school, remember!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, yes - of course you are.\u201D Gerselle smiled. \u201CAnd I think I know who\u2019s going to take in the best homework on M\u00FCnday.\u201D She cast an amused half-smile at Enely, who shrugged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m Hazachim. If there\u2019s one thing I do know about, it\u2019s cactuses.\u201D He picked up a paintbrush and turned to face Joenie. \u201CA real kerbahusk has big grooves running down it - like this.\u201D He gouged a channel in the still-pliant papier-m\u00E2ch\u00E9 with the brush handle. \u201CAnd the bits between the grooves are are covered in spikes.

He could just hear Jonton\u2019s voice from next door, punctuated by indistinct questions from Joenie. He took two mugs out of the cupboard and arranged them on a tray, the coffee burbling away behind him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNight night, Enely!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe turned to see Joenie in her nightdress, clutching a book with one hand and Gerselle\u2019s hand with the other. \u201CPeaceful night, Joenie.

You couldn\u2019t bring me a mug too could you please?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely hid his surprise behind a show of fussing with the tray. \u201COf course. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201D He hurried through to the kitchen, returning with the first mug that came to hand. Jonton raised his eyebrows at the \u003Cem\u003ETwelve Riders\u003C/em\u003E logo printed on the side but decided not to say anything. He took the full mug from Enely and sipped it cautiously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAhhhhh, that hits the spot, as Fredlorf would say. Funny - it\u2019s been forever since I wanted anything but plain water but that coffee just smelt right tonight.\u201D He grinned. \u201CGot a kick to it too after so long without. Shall we see what\u2019s going on in the world?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely nodded and switched on the television before settling into one of Gerselle\u2019s new sack chairs with his own mug of coffee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201C\u2026so, plenty left to do in Kerbin orbit, Bob?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CVery much so - and then the real work begins.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CI think that probably counts as one of the biggest understatements we\u2019ve ever heard in this studio, Bob.

Then we\u2019ll be taking a break from the M\u00FCn to focus on Minmus. We\u2019re planning at least two crewed flights, maybe three if all goes well. After that, we\u2019ve got some big plans for Pioneers 7 and 8! We\u2019ll be using a much bigger lander, so the crews will be able to take a lot more supplies with them to the M\u00FCn and stay on the surface for longer. Incidentally, building a bigger M\u00FCn lander will also give us some valuable experience in building a Duna lander when the time comes. We\u2019re also thinking about sending a rover to the M\u00FCn for long range surface EVAs.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CYou mean a car, Bob?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBob laughed. \u201CNothing so grand I\u2019m afraid. More like a small buggy, probably not much bigger than a tik-tik, although it will be battery powered.

The Mark 2 trainer doesn\u2019t look a lot different on the outside but the fly-by-wire system - the computer and sensors that control it - have been completely overhauled and re-qualified. We\u2019ve been working extensively with the Kerbin Air Accident Board to make sure that none of our previous mistakes were repeated.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CSo are you saying that the KSA accepts responsibility for the accident?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThe KAAB report is on the public record,\u201D said Bob calmly. \u201CThe KSA fully accepts its conclusions and is working around the clock to fulfil it\u2019s recommendations. We\u2019re completely reorganising our crewed spaceflight operations and rescheduling our major crewed programmes to make sure that we can dedicate all our resources to them. Right now of course, we\u2019re expanding those resources to cope with the demands of Project Starseed but until then, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ll be running a single munar programme at a time\u2026\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CM\u00FCn buggies.\u201D Jonton shook his head. \u201CI\u2019ll bet young Gildas can\u2019t wait to see those!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019d like to see them too,\u201D said Enely, \u201CI wonder how they\u2019ll get them to the M\u00FCn?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGet what to the M\u00FCn?\u201D said Gerselle, closing the door behind her.

Enely walked over to the television and muted the volume. \u201CSo the\u2026 \u003Cem\u003Eseffleks\u003C/em\u003E have finally managed it,\u201D he said, throwing himself into his sack chair. \u201CThe one Regionality that hasn\u2019t been fighting - probably because nobody in their right mind picks a fight with Firesvar - and now these,\u201D Enely\u2019s jaw worked \u201C\u003Cem\u003Ebjedla\u003C/em\u003E idiots stuff a cactus straight\u2026\u201D He broke off. \u201CSorry.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou need to teach me some Hazachim,\u201D Gerselle observed, \u201CIt sounds like the perfect language for moments like these.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton sighed. \u201CI have some sympathy for their goals,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut planting new Groves without care or thought to the \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E ones around them? I can\u2019t imagine a worse thing to do for their own Kerm, let alone the others.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can,\u201D said Enely bleakly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton looked at him. \u201COf course you can,\u201D he said softly. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, Enely.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t care,\u201D said Gerselle, \u201Cbut nobody is planning to lock their seeds away in a freezer and just forget about them. And if we do end up taking them to Duna, they\u2019ll need to travel in cold storage anyway - I can\u2019t see anyone building a spaceship big enough to plant Kerm in.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Enely. \u201CNot if those M\u00FCn ships are anything to go by.\u201D He stifled a yawn. \u201CAnyway, I think I\u2019ll go to bed. Thank you for the company.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think I will too,\u201D said Gerselle, gathering up the coffee mugs and following him out of the door \u201Cand hope for better news tomorrow.\u201D\u00A0Once Jonton was out of earshot she beckoned to Enely. \u201CCoffee?\u201D she whispered, \u201CWhen did he start drinking coffee again?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely looked at her silently. \u003Ci\u003EDoes she know? She must know\u003C/i\u003E. \u201CForgive me,\u201D he whispered back, \u201CI\u2019ve been trying to find the right time but it\u2019s difficult to talk about. The first time I communed with him, the whole experience was so strange that I didn\u2019t think anything of it. I thought it would just go away but\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle stared at him. \u201CA barrier. A soft patch?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely nodded frantically. \u201CYes, exactly that. A soft patch - and it\u2019s getting bigger.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou think it has something to do with the coffee?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t think what else it would be.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle gripped his shoulders. \u201CYou\u2019re communing again tomorrow\u2026\u201D It wasn\u2019t a question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes - yes I will.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next morning, Enely lay down on his usual bunk feeling as though he\u2019d swallowed a handful of especially restless caterpillars for breakfast. Jonton hummed to himself, leaves rustling in the morning sunlight, as he finished his morning exercise routine, stretching his arms over his head and cracked his knuckles. \u201CRight then - nematodes! Ready to get started?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely wedged another pillow under his head in reply and let his forehead brush against the waiting leaf cluster. White light unfolded in his mind, brighter than usual and somehow faster and sharper. \u003Cem\u003EProbably the caffeine\u003C/em\u003E, he thought. \u003Cem\u003EI should\u00A0tell him - too much caffeine could make this difficult.\u003C/em\u003E Then the white light faded into a muddy brown mindscape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe first thing to know about nematodes,\u201D Jonton began, \u201Cis that I have to ignore most of them. When you can get up to a couple of million microscopic worms in a square metre of soil and Kerm knows\u2026\u201D He broke off with a rueful cough. \u201CActually, the Kerm doesn\u2019t know how many species. Anyway, there are too many to keep track of, let alone control. The good news is that most of them will just get on with it.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe muddy brown faded into a blotchy sandy colour. \u201CBacterivores\u2026\u201D Dark green patches spilled over the blotches. \u201CFungivores.\u201D Dark grey strands zig-zagged over the green and sand, sprouting ever denser tangles of filaments and turning the mindscape back to its original mud-brown colour. \u201CAnd the tangled webs of predators that feed on them and on each other. That part I can control to an extent, or rather I can poke at the webs to nudge them into the right shape. If I think too hard about what I\u2019m doing it all starts to go wrong - that was the big mistake I kept making to begin with.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA regular array of ragged, lighter green dots appeared. \u201CNow \u003Cem\u003Ethese\u003C/em\u003E,\u201D Jonton said enthusiastically, \u201Care the rhizospheres and this is where things get really interesting!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely listened to Jonton\u2019s increasingly detailed explanation of plant root environments and nematode balances with half an ear, whilst surreptitiously searching for the soft patch in Jonton\u2019s mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026and this is a beautiful example! Normally, these would be a serious pest but when they start chewing up the gingergrass roots, the damaged roots exude a group of pheromones which attract the right predatory nematodes to feed on the parasites. With a bit of encouragement, a bit of gingergrass can keep the whole field clean of the little swines!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EActually, that does sound interesting. The Berelgan researchers will be all over this kind of data. Maybe they\u2019ll even be taking gingergrass to Duna\u003C/em\u003E. Enely stopped short. \u003Cem\u003EOh my\u2026\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe soft patch yawned open, revealing an iridescent membrane underneath. Oily swirls of colour rippled under the surface and as Enely leaned closer he made out snatches of sounds and scents and even the occasional word. The swirls seemed to sense his presence, darting towards him, growing thicker and richer, stretching the membrane to a translucent shimmer. Words became mumbled fragments of sentences, their meaning lurking just out of reach. Then, quietly, as if heard from the next room, two words echoed though Enely\u2019s head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;Help me\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd then a voice asked me to help it,\u201D said Enely. \u201CDidn\u2019t you hear it too, Jonton?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton shook his head. \u201CNot a thing. I haven\u2019t heard any voices for a long time,\u201D he added wryly, \u201Cand even then, they weren\u2019t really talking to me so much as over me.\u201D His eyes widened. \u201CThe shards\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle\u2019s eyes met his. \u201CThe shards,\u201D she whispered. \u201CThat might\u2026\u201D She gnawed on a fingernail. \u201CI think there\u0027s only one thing I can do, love,\u201D she said aloud. \u201CStop trying to keep the shards intact and just let them melt. Put all the pieces back together, give the Kerm its voice and let it concentrate on mending the Grove.\u201D She saw Enely\u2019s confused expression. \u201CSomething Jonton said to me before\u2026before he went an-Kerm. I\u2019ve never forgotten it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely gaped at them. \u201CThe shards happened when your Kerm shattered, yes?\u201D He saw Jonton wince. \u201CYou let them go, let them become \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u2026\u201D He closed his eyes. \u201CBut what\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut what if they didn\u2019t?\u201D finished Jonton. \u201COr not completely. Like oil and water maybe. Even if you shake them together really hard, they don\u2019t stay mixed forever.\u201D He bowed his head. \u201CI remember what it was like after the shattering. Never being quite sure who or what I was, trying to hold onto the kerbal parts of me and being too terrified to sleep because that\u2019s when the voices were strongest.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe were both terrified,\u201D said Gerselle quietly, \u201CI was terrified that your mind would melt with the shards and that I\u2019d never get you back again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooking back, I think it did,\u201D said Jonton slowly. \u201Cbut the kerbal part of me had had more practice at being \u2018me\u2019 - if that makes any sense - and held together somehow.\u201D He swallowed hard. \u201CThe Kerm part of me had no idea, no practice at all. When I let go of the shards they must have fallen apart completely.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely\u2019s eyes snapped open. \u201COnly now they\u2019re pulling back together again and crying out for help!\u201D He rocked back on his heels. \u201CThat\u2019s what the voice reminded me of! Older - how could it not be older after all it had been through - but still like my Kerm!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThunderstruck silence greeted him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle opened her mouth and then closed it again. \u201CWhat did Gusemy say about going an-Kerm?\u201D she said faintly. \u201CThat nobody could condone the destruction of Kerm minds on a global scale? So what happens if the Kerm mind survives?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u2019s eyes met hers \u201CIt could be the answer we\u2019ve been looking for. Break the Law of Thirty Seven in every Grove and have the Keepers volunteer to go an-Kerm. The new an-Kerm pull back their borders, make room for a newly planted Kerm and then, when the time comes, separate again, leaving an intact Kerm behind.\u201D He shivered. \u201CAlthough put like that it sounds beyond crazy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd instead we might start a second Age of Madness,\u201D said Gerselle \u201CMaybe we were just lucky, Jonton - and being lucky once is too slender a peg to hang the whole of Kerbin on.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTwice,\u201D said Enely quietly. He looked at Jonton. \u201CYour Kerm already survived one shattering back in the Age of Madness. It must have or it wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u2019s leaves twitched. \u201CIf it was communing at the time\u2026what happened to my kerbals?\u201D He swallowed. \u201CIf the Kerm survived did their minds break into shards instead?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey might have pulled together again,\u201D said Enely lamely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis doesn\u2019t sound right,\u201D Gerselle said slowly. \u201CI felt your \u003Cem\u003Escars\u003C/em\u003E, love, the first time we Communed - and I felt the \u003Cem\u003Eolder\u003C/em\u003E scars underneath.\u201D She pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201CBefore\u2026before us, I think your Kerm was just a Kerm. You\u2019d \u003Cem\u003Eremember \u003C/em\u003Eif it had ever been an an-Kerm before. So the only way that the scars make sense is if they\u2019re healed wounds from \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E shatterings. You let go of the shards and they knitted back together. Which explains how you learned to look after the Grove - your Kerm mind was still there somewhere.\u201D She threw up her hands. \u201CDon\u2019t ask me what happened after that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u2019s leaves rustled around his head and a sudden gust of cinnamon blew through the room. \u201CJoenie,\u201D he said quietly. \u201CYou remember when I was retreating from Patbro\u2019s daughter\u2019s\u2026\u201D He snapped his fingers. \u201CFrom Tivie\u2019s new Grove?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle nodded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI never told you at the time but I nearly gave in. Not because of the pain, although help me that was bad enough, but because in the end I just couldn\u2019t fight thousands of years of Kerm instinct howling at me to stop. It was Joenie who got me through. I remembered her pummelling my trunk with her little fists, telling the \u2018bad tree\u2019 off for hurting me. She was the anchor I needed and she helped me to remember the promise I made to everyone, that this an-Kerm would rather retreat than fight.\u201D\u00A0Jonton\u2019s voice trembled. \u201CIt was barely enough and I felt it tear something inside me. There were times after that where I\u2019d be checking the fields, find that everything was fine, and have absolutely no recollection of doing the work myself. I put it down to muscle memory - a sign that looking after the Grove was becoming automatic. Of course I took this to be a good sign.\u201D Jonton gave Gerselle and Enely a twisted smile. \u201CA sign that I was becoming a proper Kerm.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhich you were in a way,\u201D said Gerselle softly. \u201CAnd that gives me an idea for helping the Kerm \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E getting you back, Jonton Kermol. She looked at Enely. \u201CIt would need both of us though and your part could be painful.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat do I need to do?\u201D said Enely. \u201CI\u2019ve already lost one Kerm - if I can do anything to help another, I will.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTwo anchors,\u201D said Gerselle. \u201CWe both commune with Jonton. I help him remember what being kerbal is all about - give his kerbal self something to hang onto and rally around. You do the same for his Kerm self.\u201D A hard lump of self-loathing settled in the pit of her stomach. \u201CBy showing it your Kerm. Young, newborn almost and untouched by kerbal thought. Trying to share it\u2019s world with you.\u201D She saw Enely\u2019s expression. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, Enely - truly I am. But I don\u2019t know who else to ask.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother gust of cinnamon filled the room.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a long minute Enely stared at his feet unable to meet her, or Jonton\u2019s gaze. \u003Cem\u003EWhen she said painful\u003C/em\u003E\u2026Then he lifted his head, a haunted look in his eyes. \u201CI will do this,\u201D he said. \u201CI will keep my word and do this.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton bowed his head in silent acknowledgement. \u201CWe should speak to Erlin,\u201D he said. \u201CThe Berelgan will need to know about this anyway and they\u2019ll be able to help us with the other arrangements.\u201D He looked at Gerselle. \u201CWe do things properly this time, love.

Gerselle lay on her bed, already wearing her band, a thick skein of multicoloured wires emerging at the nape of her neck and snaking across the floor to an equipment trolley. Enely settled himself on a nearby bunk and watched the other medic at work on Jonton\u2019s forehead, beads of perspiration trickling down his neck as he threaded an electrode pad through the gap between two Kerm leaves and delicately pressed it into place against the an-Kerm\u2019s skin. Clumps of grey-flecked hair lay scattered on the floor around them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first medic walked over to the equipment trolley and plugged in Enely\u2019s band. He pressed a button, waited a moment and then leaned forward to peer at a dense array of lines beginning to scribble their way across one of his monitors. He glanced at Gerselle\u2019s monitor then looked up at the two kermol. \u201CYour bands are working nicely. How do they feel?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ELike somebody\u2019s knuckling the sides of my head\u003C/em\u003E, thought Enely. \u201CNo worse than you\u2019d expect,\u201D he said. Gerselle grunted in agreement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey do feel a bit tight at first but most people get used to them in a few minutes,\u201D the medic said soothingly. \u201CAnd they\u2019re a lot better than hooking all three of you up the the old-fashioned way.\u201D He gestured at Jonton, who was canting his neck to one side to allow yet another electrode to be glued to the side of his head, the coloured wires threaded between his leaves in an uneasy sculpture of biology and technology. His medic carefully inspected his work before joining his colleague at the monitors, an obvious look of relief crossing his face. He blinked at the third screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COhhh-kay. I think this is working.\u201D He tapped the side of the monitor and checked the plug connecting it to Jonton. \u201CDefinitely got brainwave activity you\u2019ll be happy to know but it\u2019s not like anything I\u2019ve ever seen before. According to this you could be asleep, communing, having a fit\u2026 Kerm I don\u2019t know.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat bedside manner needs a little more work,\u201D his colleague noted, apparently to himself. He smiled reassuringly at Enely and Gerselle. \u201CEverything looks just fine from here so please just relax and start whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle lifted her head up to the waiting leaf cluster, Enely following just behind her. Their EEG traces shivered and then went abruptly berserk.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFamiliar white light filled her mind, washing away the sleep room ceiling. She sensed Enely joining her, his nervousness mirrored by her own, churning up the lambent mists around her. Mists that flowed over and around long gone scars before swirling away into darkness and fear. Instantly her own unease spiked into fright which rebounded off Enely\u2019s already heightened nerves and magnified, lashed back at her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPractice and experience overcame instinct. Gerselle clamped down on her own roiling emotions, absorbing the fear and burying it beneath the surface. Cautiously, she extended her awareness through their slender, fragile link, reaching out to her partner, recalling the intensity and the joy of their first communion and letting it wash over them both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIt\u2019s all right my love.

One of the medics got up, moving quickly from patient to patient, checking pulses and noting eye movements before moving on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo of the three monitors settled into a set of steadier rhythms, punctuated by irregular bursts of activity. Erlin stared at the complex rhythms on third screen in fascination. Each cycle of the underlying waveforms perturbed into a smaller and smaller copies of themselves, turning to fuzz as the detail passed beyond the ability of the screen to display. Gradually two of the glowing traces strengthened, shimmered and shifted, each mirroring a trace on one of the other screens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second medic blew out his cheeks in relief. \u201CThey\u2019re in!

He sent a last wave of reassurance to Jonton, before closing their link down to a bare trickle of sensation. For a moment he floated in the darkness, breathing deeply, gathering himself for the task to come. Then he re-opened the link, letting his thoughts skip lightly over the surface of Jonton\u2019s awareness. Probing for the flaw in the the other\u2019s memories, softly calling out to it, careful not to disturb the an-Kerm\u2019s link with Gerselle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flaw found him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLarger than ever before, the membrane ballooned out towards him like a shimmering, iridescent soap bubble, thought patterns flickering beneath it\u2019s surface. Slowly, Enely let his own thoughts brush against it, opening himself to it, letting himself sink into receptivity. The bubble puckered and swirled in response, ripples racing across it, reflecting off hidden lodes of deeper thought. The puckers deepened into folds and rilles, lodes became tendrils, probing at the bubble, stretching it to bursting but unable to break through. Memories of scents and fragmented images billowed from the surface, both edged with frustration and pleading. Enely saw Joenie hurtle past, saw images of faces and a flag, saw himself and Gerselle sitting on cushions, placing pieces on a game board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;help me\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGritting his teeth, Enely plunged into his past, tearing through half-healed scabs, ripping through times of sorrow and loss, reliving moments of pain and grieving. Reaching for happier days; for a mental picture of a smiling kerbal used to greet a new Kerm. Reaching for a barrage of scents and a medley of coloured blotches and swirls; the chatter from an infant Kerm sharing it\u2019s world for the first time, untouched by contact with kerbals. Enely imagined himself cupping his hands protectively around those few precious memories, shielding them from the raging bubble, holding them up to its helplessly writhing surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGradually the lashing tendrils slowed, the fragmented images sucked back beneath the surface, retreating into quiescence. The bubble quivered, folds and rilles slipping into new patterns, frustration giving way to curiosity, pleading to expectation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely smiled and opened his hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith relief, Gerselle sensed Enely drifting away. She paused for a moment, checking that their link was still there if needed, then turned all her attention to Jonton. \u003Cem\u003EMy Jonton.

Remember the sights of your Grove, my love. Walking the fields, seeing the crops, the colours of the flowers, the earth beneath your feet and the blue skies above you.

I\u2019ll help you.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 Gerselle dipped into her own memories; herself standing by a gate, watching Joenie scampering down a lane towards a grey robed kerbal, who dropped to his knees and swept her into his arms.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly, tentatively, a mirror image of the same scene trickled down the link. In the distance a kerbal by a gate, a kerblet sprinting down the road as fast as her little legs could carry her. A lurching drop, the pavement suddenly a lot closer; then an explosion of green and an armful of squirming toddler and excited babble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same scene washed over her again. Fainter this time and blurred, like a picture of a picture. The link wavered and Jonton\u2019s tentative image fell apart, blowing away like dust. \u003Cem\u003ESorry, love.\u003C/em\u003E Jonton\u2019s mental voice sounded abashed. \u003Cem\u003EI remember that day - of course I do - but I shared it with my trees\u2026 with my Kerm I mean.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI could see you remembering\u003C/em\u003E, Gerselle replied.

Every\u00A0memory that Gerselle chose echoed between herself and Jonton, leaving mere after-images and fading reflections behind. The first sight of Joenie curled up in the bottom of her pouch had triggered the strongest reaction yet and for a moment, she thought the tiny, wrinkled figure, so newly born as to be barely recognisable as a kerblet, would be the anchor they sought. Then it too fell apart; a memory caught between two mirrors, reflections of reflections receding into a sparkling mote of dust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIs there anything you didn\u2019t share with that Kerm, Jonton Kermol?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSilence answered her question.

Music played in the background as a scrubbed and very much younger Jonton, accompanied by his own chosen companions, stepped into the clearing. He joined her in the centre, the ring of Witnesses closing behind them. All the right words in all the right places.

Other writers might not be as relaxed though, so best to check first okay? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plecy75","CreatedById":158708,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-23T12:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsorry about that, i\u0027ll get that cover page in ASAP. i just hope it\u00A0doesn\u0027t take\u00A0forever to design! i would never sell someone else\u0027s work, even the thought of it makes me sick. i just can\u0027t stand plagiarism. i just wanted to do something nice for everybody, since a bunch of posts in the\u00A0forums aren\u0027t exactly the best platform to be reading a quarter-million-word novel on. it also makes it easier if you want to sell it yourself eventually! what image would you like on the cover page? also what exactly should i put in the copyright information?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-23T12:42:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2016 12:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plecy75\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-23T16:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh wow.
