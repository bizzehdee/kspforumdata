It was a fitting end to a \u003Cem\u003Eperfect\u003C/em\u003E night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he sat, his father\u0027s constant refrain rang in his ears: \u0022Study hard, Eli, and one day you\u0027ll walk on the Mun!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll his childhood he had dreamed of nothing but becoming an astronaut--his father had made sure of that. While other kids played catch, Eli built rockets and learned to fly planes; models at first, but soon enough Eli\u0027s father had his son behind the stick of his lemon-yellow Piper Cub. After graduating, Eli signed up for the air force. He became a fighter pilot, then a test pilot, and after a few close calls found his way into the space program. He volunteered for the most dangerous tests, trained and studied harder than anybody. When he was finally picked for a Mun landing, Eli hardly felt surprised; in his mind, every day of his life--every ounce of his being--existed only to bring him to that moment: hands trembling, unfolding the letter from command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince that fateful winter evening, his life could only be described as grueling. He was training even harder than before. Command wanted him in peak physical condition for the flight, much more than the orbiter crew. He had to master a variety of controls and practice endless scenarios for every \u0027anomaly\u0027 the engineers could come up with. He even had a session with an Air Force shrink whose job was apparently to train Eli to meet his end with dignity, should he find himself trapped on the Mun with no means of rescue. But every hour--no matter how miserable--moved him inexorably closer to launch day, and this thought propelled Eli forward with manic energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was launch day. Sleep had escaped him the night before, and before dawn Eli stepped out of the quarantine barracks to sit and gaze at the starry sky. It was the most incredible feeling, seeing the Mun hovering above the horizon and knowing that within a few hours time, it would be something more than a light in the night sky. It would be a \u003Cem\u003Edestination\u003C/em\u003E, and he would be streaking toward it as fast as any man has ever traveled. The morning was a blur of checks and re-checks. Not until he was strapped into his seat did the reality begin to sink in. It settled on Eli\u0027s chest like a heavy weight. This wasn\u0027t a boyhood daydream. It wasn\u0027t a simulation. He was sitting in the world\u0027s biggest roller coaster, and in a few moments he\u0027d set out on the wildest ride of his life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one of the shortest. When the first stage cut out he was certain that something had gone horribly wrong, but a peek at the instruments and the calm demeanor of his crew mates proved that they were quite on trajectory. Eli marveled at the power required to lift a skyscraper (for that is how it had seemed on the pad that morning) to the very edge of space in what felt like mere seconds. He tried to lean forward to get a better look out the pod windows, hoping to take in the view from this altitude, but he had barely moved an inch when the second stage began pushing them into a stable Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon the second stage, too, had expended itself, and the third stage gently put them on course for the Mun. They were cruising now, and despite their tremendous speed, the journey took place in complete serenity. If not for the lack of a planet stretching out beneath them, it could have been any of Eli\u0027s test flights. Under the pretense of testing the reaction wheels, the crew periodically turned the craft from the Mun to Kerbin and back. Finally, Eli had seen his planet like few had ever done before: It was like an enormous, round painting, with rough, dappled blotches of green, tan and brown paint atop a canvas of brilliant blue, covered in wispy brushstrokes of slowly shifting white. It took up the entire window the first time he saw it, and yet seemed far too small and distant; for the first time in his life, a vast gulf separated him from everything he had ever known. Since then it had grown ever smaller as the Mun loomed larger and larger ahead; each time the craft rotated, his heart skipped a beat at how much each world had changed in the hours they had been turned away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was close enough to make out tiny mountains and valleys on the Mun now. Jagged edges and perfectly domed craters jutted up here and there; there was no wind or water to soften this world\u0027s harsh visage. Nothing moved or changed on the landscape which would have been quite at home among Dante\u0027s hells. It had a strange, forbidding beauty; yet, despite all the years Eli had looked forward to this day, he could not shake a feeling of great foolishness--that he had been mad to trade the beautiful, blue, living world behind him for the barren gray waste that lie ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut such thoughts had to wait. They had reached the Mun, and the next few hours were spent following endless checklists. Decelerating into a stable equatorial orbit, detaching the Mun lander, carefully docking, and before Eli knew it he was shaking hands with his crewmates and sliding into the cramped lander. As his crewmates--his friends--closed the hatch, he caught their faces one last time. For a second, he was back in the sappy psychiatrist\u0027s office.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wherever you find yourself, Eli, you will not be alone. As long as you keep them in your heart, your family, your comrades, your nation will always travel with you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then they were gone. Eli pulled out the pre-landing clipboard from beside his seat and began checking off each step: Batteries, fuel, RCS, engines one, two, three, four, ascent engine, thrusters, oxygen, scrubbers, reaction wheels, landing legs, navigation, radio... soon he had reached the end. Everything checked out. He reached the descent node. Fired the engines. It was happening. He was landing on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was all he\u0027d ever dreamed, Eli reminded himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything went smoothly until the final descent. As he hovered a hundred meters above the surface, watching the dust scatter as the lander slowly crept downward, one of the engines suddenly gave out. Eli\u0027s had trained for this; moments later he had switched off the opposite engine and killed his rotation with some well-timed RCS bursts. Unfortunately, he was now descending fast and the two remaining engines would never stop him in time. As he hit the ground, he heard a loud \u003Cem\u003Ecrack\u003C/em\u003E, several \u003Cem\u003Epops\u003C/em\u003E, and the terrible creak of twisting metal reverberating through the cockpit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor what felt like hours Eli sat in stunned silence. He was alive. The instrument panels all showed good readings, and there were no obvious fuel leaks. He took a deep breath to steel himself for whatever he found outside, turned the handle, and pushed open the hatch. Blackness. He could just make out a faint patch of gray past the bottom lip of the opening; the landing lights seemed to be working. Still, for safety he tapped the button near his shoulder and the tiny pod was filled with the piercing white of his headlamps. Eli unbuckled his safety harness, grabbed the handles on each side of the opening--his hands were sweating inside their thick gloves--and pulled his way out of the tiny pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe regretted it almost immediately as shooting pains ran up and down his back. Eli had repeatedly complained about the seat\u0027s shock absorbers, though the engineers had assured him that they would work much better in the Mun\u0027s gravity. Engineers. The pilot\u0027s natural enemy, they only listen to their slide rules and think every contingency can be planned against from a drafting table in an air-conditioned office.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe immediate adversary, though, was the lander itself. It was tipping precariously as he stood leaning out of the pod, and seemed fit to topple the moment he climbed out. Eli sat back in his seat, wincing as fire shot up his spine. He was more than five meters off the ground; normally he would have no problem leaping such a distance and tumbling to safety, but he couldn\u0027t risk tearing his suit on knife-like rocks below. He picked up his clipboard again, held it in front of his head, and dropped it. Slowly, comically, it pirouetted down before gently coming to rest on his lap. This is the Mun, Eli reminded himself. Gravity works differently here. It may look like a two-story drop, but here it was no different than hopping of the back of his pickup truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/16310-The-Chance-of-a-Lifetime-%282-2%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E(continued)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-06T18:15:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2012 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by pushingrobot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AncientAstronaut","CreatedById":36093,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-06T20:59:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was REALLY good.
