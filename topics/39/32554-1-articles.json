These Kerbals \u0022volunteered\u0022 to be the first when it was determined that a return trip was not going to be possible. However, upon landing and review of the fuel situation, it would have been possible to return to orbit and redock to the transport ship. However, the car transport would not have enough fuel to go back down to Duna to leave the car on the surface for further remote study. So the return mission was abandoned. Four Kerbals went on this mission but only two could volunteer to be first to set foot on another world. So this honor goes to Richbas Kerman and Nadgan Kerman for their heroic patronage in helping Kerbalkind find its way into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECar with lander and transport ship after dumping the RCS fuel module (which later was determined to be a mistake).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/576739673108444860/EA88F985F2CA89E2E7E5613C8811EBCB7944B4E2/\u0022 alt=\u0022EA88F985F2CA89E2E7E5613C8811EBCB7944B4E2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECar on decent for aerobrake and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/576739673108453040/8D36B7E2A4F60A70CC4264A8064AC46AD1EF24CE/\u0022 alt=\u00228D36B7E2A4F60A70CC4264A8064AC46AD1EF24CE\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna Car 1 on surface of Duna with lander.
