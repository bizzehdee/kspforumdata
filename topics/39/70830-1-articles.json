Merely half a year after the discovery of the direction known as \u0027up\u0027, we have come to understand our place in the universe. Now it is our turn to explore what lies above. Kerbals from around our great nation have gathered together to begin launching rockets up to learn what it is that comprises this \u0027outer space\u0027. To learn more about the USKK\u0027s space program, we interview its founder, Jebediah Kerman.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah followed Erdan Kerman onto the set. He had never really liked the media\u0027s aggressive nationalism, but felt it was a necessary evil one had to put up in order to inform the public. The only reason he was even here was because of Bob. While normally the timid kerbal never spoke up or forced his opinion on anyone without prompting, he was quite vocal on matters of national security and passing knowledge onto the people. It was Bob\u0027s idea to schedule this interview, and explain the goals and intent of the USKK\u0027s space program, to raise awareness of the imminent launch. \u003Cem\u003EIt\u0027s not as if it needs much explaining\u003C/em\u003E, Jeb thought to himself,\u003Cem\u003E the population is ecstatic about the program. Ah well, it should make this interview easier then.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright, we\u0027re on in twenty seconds. Are you ready, Jeb (may I call you Jeb)?\u0022 Erdan asked, settling into his seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Absolutely, and I\u0027m as ready as I\u0027ll ever be,\u0022 Jebediah responded, taking a deep breath and attempting to project an air of excitement and good cheer. While it had only been six months since he\u0027d begun this crazy venture, it felt more like six years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027re live in five! Four! Three! Two! One!\u0022 The cameraman\u0027s countdown reminded Jeb of the ground-breaking launch tomorrow, and this served to cheer him up more than any number of breathing exercises.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good evening, and welcome to the United News Network! My name is Erdan Kerman, and today I have a very special guest on the show, Jebediah Kerman, founder and director of the USKK\u0027s space program!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb looked towards the camera, and gave a little wave, only to stop when he saw the cameraman shaking his head at him. It appeared that there was a specific etiquette to follow when appearing on camera. \u003Cem\u003EAnother reason to dislike this interview\u003C/em\u003E, he thought, making a mental note to get Bob back for this somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So Jeb, what prompted you to found the space program? Why divert our resources into space travel, when so much more economic opportunities exist in conventional air traffic?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb had prepared for this question, but he didn\u0027t expect it to be the first off the bat. This was going to be a long interview.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well Erdan, it\u0027s not that the economic opportunities don\u0027t exist, but we simply haven\u0027t discovered them yet. No machine nor kerbal has ever even \u003Cem\u003Ebeen\u003C/em\u003E to outer space, let alone explored it for any meaningful amount of time. We\u0027ve looked outwards with telescopes, sure, but we still know very little about what lies beyond our atmosphere.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Very well-reasoned, I for one am sure that there are plentiful ways we can learn new things from the great beyond. Now, can you give us any more details on how you founded the space program? Where is the launch site located?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There\u0027s an interesting story. You see, originally the space program was going to be a military project. You know what that means, everything classified, nobody would be allowed to see the launches, that sort of thing. However, a very generous grant from the private sector allowed us to buy an old research and development base off the government and set up shop there. We\u0027ve built rocket construction facilities, crew training grounds, and even an aircraft hangar on the premises! I\u0027ve some pictures here, actually!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/o17ZDT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2910/14441213513_f3e30e0d62_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002214441213513_f3e30e0d62_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Here I am, this was taken by Bob when we first drove out to the space centre\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nFRXmP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3912/14234582187_310ae8df6f_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002214234582187_310ae8df6f_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bob took this as I walked towards the main building.

This sure beats my apartment, ha ha!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing full well that the newscaster possessed a seaside mansion a couple of kilometres from the studio, Jeb neglected to comment. Erdan continued:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So you mentioned that the launches will be public, and I hear that the launch site already has plenty of kerbals camping out, ready for tomorrow\u0027s launch! What has got the public so interested in your vision?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, I have learned that if you mention going to the Mun, suddenly you\u0027ve got half the nation wanting to tag along!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Speaking of \u0027tagging along\u0027. Which kerbals has the space program selected? I certainly hope you aren\u0027t just going to grab any old kerbal off the street!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Definitely not. Since we still know so little about the effects of the zone beyond our atmosphere, we have elected to send unmanned probes before kerbals. They will allow us to gather valuable data about the effects of outer space so that we can plan subsequent missions accordingly.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So you aren\u0027t going to be launching a kerbal tomorrow?\u0022 Erdan seemed disappointed, and Jeb suspected that many of the kerbals watching would be as well. He decided to divert their attention, quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Unfortunately, no. But kerbals are being trained as we speak for the eventual manned mission. It shouldn\u0027t take long before we are ready to launch kerballed craft, we just need to analyse the probe data first.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022As for these kerbals in training, are you one of them? Actually, are you even allowed to share that information with our audience?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this, Jebediah chuckled. Erdan had evidently covered highly-classified stories in the past. \u0022Yes, I am allowed to share who these kerbals will be. In fact, I even have pictures of them here! Now first of all, as the director of the program, there\u0027s no chance I\u0027ll ever get to fly a mission; I simply have too much to do! Fortunately, the kerbals we\u0027ve chosen are excellent candidates. Here we have Rondred, Erdrin, Jorfred, and Donnand Kerman,\u0022 Jeb said, revealing his photos to the camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nYwGiy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2926/14423204842_117f8c7a94.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214423204842_117f8c7a94.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nG9Y1U\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3912/14237901300_a26a33bddc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214237901300_a26a33bddc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nG9Yf9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2902/14237902068_11337a8406.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214237902068_11337a8406.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nG9Y9s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5035/14237901738_0248a11d8b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214237901738_0248a11d8b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022My, my, Jeb, these look like excellent candidates to go to space!

The rocket engines and fuel tanks are surprisingly simple in design.

I am confident that tomorrow\u0027s launch will be completely successful, and not even the sky is the limit after that!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Simply fantastic, Jeb! I can tell you that I will definitely tune in for the launch tomorrow! Our glorious USKK is about to enter a glorious new age of exploration and development, all under your capable guidance! I do have one last question before you go, though. Do you ever feel pressured, with this enormous amount of responsibility hanging over your head?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I have to say, Erdan, I\u0027ve dealt with a lot of responsibility over the years, and I feel like this is just another small step for me. Besides, I have the excellent Bill and Bob to help me along; they take over the tasks I can\u0027t manage.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I see.

That\u0027s why I\u0027m here, I need to talk to Bilfrod.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ah, he\u0027s right this way, down in the garage.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJenfry\u0027s garage had been converted into a small, but surprisingly well-equipped research lab. Harried techs rushed around, analyzing spreadsheets and testing prototypes. In the centre of it all stood Bilfrod Kerman, who as Chief Scientific Advisor of the CKFN had been tasked with overseeing the space program\u0027s research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bilfrod, you\u0027ve got to give me something, the boys at the VAB are getting impatient. Where\u0027s our payload?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, we hammered out a working prototype, but unfortunately we\u0027re not going to be able to launch it,\u0022 responded Bilfrod, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What? I thought the probe core performed admirably when we tested it on the ground! What\u0027s wrong?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s quite frustrating, actually. We launched a sounding rocket the other day with a test platform, just to check that the systems will work when we launch for real. However, we found that when the electronics reach the upper atmosphere, the increased radiation cooks their systems.\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E Right now we\u0027ve been focused on hardening our electronic systems, but it is taking a while.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Radiation, you say? Can\u0027t you just stick a some shielding onto the probe and call it at that?\u0022\u0022It\u0027s not as simple as that; with all the countermeasures we have to put in, we\u0027ll either have to totally redesign all our hardware, or end up with a box that has so much shielding it would be kerbal-rated.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Huh. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6Which of these two approaches would take less time?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Normally I would recommend the new tech, but it just so happens that one of my interns built a mock-up of a manned rocket, and with minimal effort we could modify it so that a kerbal could survive the trip. However, it would be far heavier than the probe core we were planning to send up.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t worry about the weight, the boys at the VAB are itching for something to do. Building a rocket which can take this capsule into orbit will be just the project they need. How long will it take to rad-proof this capsule?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027d say maybe a week or two. We still need to vacuum-test it, make sure it can survive long-term exposure to outer space.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Damn, the USKK is launching tomorrow. And this is compared to how long for the redesigned tech?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, that would take months. I\u0027ll get one of the drones, err interns on it though, we\u0027ll eventually want to send probes up there, won\u0027t we?\u0022\u0022Definitely. Okay, thanks Bilfrod.

Managing an entire space program\u0027s policy as well as check up on individual teams is far too much for one kerbal to handle.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanford sighed heavily. \u0022He is right about that; I\u0027ve been a nervous wreck ever since we started. But let me promote some members of my own staff at the space facility; I know some great people who would be perfect for managing the program.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m sorry, Dan. I can\u0027t let you do that,\u0022 said the General, \u0022The President said you\u0027re brilliant at managing the space centre, and commends you for the performance of the teams so far. However, even the best-run program will fall apart without a clear goal in mind. And besides getting a rocket to space, you don\u0027t seem to have one.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, uh, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Precisely. He\u0027s not happy that the engineers are scrapping the ship they just built and are constructing another rocket, and says you need someone to keep a watch over your spending. Bilcas Kerman, the Economics Advisor, is just the kerbal for the job. You\u0027ve already got Bilfrod working on research and development, and I,\u0022 The General thumped his chest proudly. \u0022I will keep an eye on the USKK and shape our program\u0027s goals to match and exceed theirs.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe President had evidently given this plan a lot of thought, and try as he might, Danford couldn\u0027t disagree with the General. The last few months had taken their toll on him; having expert kerbals take care of administrative tasks and cut through red tape would simplify his life immensely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fine. I can see the his logic behind this decision, and I can\u0027t really think of a better solution,\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t you worry, this is for the best. You\u0027ll be able to spend more time doing the things you are good at, and we\u0027ll be able to get a leg up on the USKK at last! Speaking of which, their launch is tomorrow. The President wants to know when our rocket can be launched?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m afraid not for another three weeks, but we will launch a kerbal when we do\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this, the General gave a double-take. \u0022You\u0027re sending someone up there? My people tell me the USKK hasn\u0027t even considered a kerballed launch yet! Are you sure it\u0027s safe?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Absolutely. My engineers have been able to get nearly 100% reliability out of their engines, and their designs keep getting better and better. We might not beat the USKK into space, but the first kerbal up there will be from the CKFN.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I see... I congratulate you on your ingenuity, but in the future, you should keep the President or myself in the loop when deciding on our payloads. That reminds me. You\u0027ll need to attend our next staff meeting, Thursday at noon.

A single Big Red Button, covered by a plastic safety case, lay in front of him. Now, most other kerbals would be able to handle this position. They would await the launch and enjoy the show, only pressing the button if they were told. Not Rondred. For his entire life, he had been pushing buttons, whether the metaphorical buttons of his parents and teachers, or physical buttons in vehicle cockpits. He loved pushing buttons. As such, when confronted with such a Big Red Button that was just begging to be pressed, Rondred faced a very difficult decision. Should he press the Button, feel the satisfaction, and deal with whatever consequences resulted? Or should he leave the Button be, and forever wonder what it did? A difficult choice even at the calmest of moments, and this moment was anything but calm. Rondred struggled to recall exactly what the job of the Range Safety Officer was, but was unable to remember specifics. Did it have something to do with large explosions? Then again, given by how many explosions came from the Vehicle Assembly Building these days, it seemed like explosions and rockets went hand-in-hand.

It merely rose towards the heavens bearing the collection of electronics which would ultimately orbit the planet. The probe was nothing fancy, it would simply receive radio signals transmitted to it and emit a response, but as no other object had ever been to orbit before it, this probe was very special. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransmissions originating from the Mission Control station, relayed through the three massive dishes of the Tracking Station, found the little rocket and commanded it to pitch itself over forty-five degrees relative to the horizon. A few moments later, the first stage engine used up the last few drops of fuel and promptly flamed out. In response, carefully-placed pyrotechnics (the engineering team found out first-hand what happens if one fails to use caution when placing them the preceding day) detonated and the second stage engine was exposed to the thin air of Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere. With only a second\u0027s delay, it fired up, and \u003Cem\u003EAether 7\u003C/em\u003E continued on its journey skyward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/nYoj54\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2925/14421569155_11f20c8ce3_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002214421569155_11f20c8ce3_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDonnand Kerman was not having a good day. Not only had the X8-67 gauge gone red, but the X3-DF8 gauge too, and the X7-56a gauge as well! In fact, his entire control panel was flashing red. Donnand was on the verge of telling Barfnal this, but realized that no one else in the control room seemed to be reacting to alerts on their control panels. In fact, the catastrophic failure seemed to be localized to only his panel. Recalling something Barfnal had said, he ducked underneath the console, where the acrid smell of burnt plastic met him. The main fuse had burnt out, and by the looks (and smell) of it, some of the insulation along the wire had been scarred as it did so. Donnand yanked out the burnt fuse, grabbed a replacement from its box, then shoved it into place. With great relief, he noted that all the gauges had returned to normal. He certainly hoped Rondred was having a less stressful time at his console.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry as he might, Rondred could not ignore the button. Besides it being his job (or what Gene thought was his job), the Button was the most pressable button he had ever encountered in his life. Big, flashing, and smack-dab in the middle of the console, this Button needed to be pressed. Who would ever find out? he thought to himself. Gene\u0027s not looking this way, just go ahead and give it a push! And so push it he did, carefully easing back the cover and depressing the large, round Button. He was not disappointed; the Button emitted a massively satisfying ka-thunk as he pushed it, activating the delicate electronics hidden inside his console.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadio waves propagate at the speed of light, a speed far greater than any human or kerbal mind can comprehend. As such, the following series of events took place in much less than the blink of an eye. As Rondred pushed the Button, a signal was sent through his console, off to the tracking station, and off in the general direction of the rocket, via one of the radio dishes. Upon arrival, the signal was quickly decoded, the rocket understanding its message: \u003Cstrong\u003ESELF DESTRUCT\u003C/strong\u003E. This information prompted the very rudimentary computer on board to send an electronic pulse through a very specific wire, on its way to another carefully-placed series of explosives. Unlike the decoupler, these would precisely tear the ship apart, leaving nothing but dust in their wake. And as the electrons vibrated their way through the wire towards this deadly payload, let\u0027s consider what was happening to this particular portion of the rocket the preceding day:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E17.4 hours ago\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6so then I said to him: \u0027How hard can rocket science be, anyway?\u0022 said Gregbro Kerman, one of the Vehicle Assembly Building\u0027s rocket construction workers, as he was working on the fuselage of Aether 7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ha ha ha, you\u0027re hilarious, Greg!\u0022 howled his partner, who was holding Gregbro\u0027s welding gear. \u0022You ought to quit your day job and become a professional comedian!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know, I considered that for a couple of years.

The insulation of wire upon which the self-destruct signal would travel had been completely melted off, exposing the inner wire. This bare copper now touched the outer hull of the rocket, which had been connected to the negative terminal of the onboard battery.

This isn\u0027t like a probe, where in a failed launch the only casualty is money.

For once, I find myself agreeing with Danford.

Bob was too, but over a different issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The CKFN accomplished this before us? How is this possible? I thought they couldn\u0027t even get a probe past the upper atmosphere?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman, the kerbal who had delivered the news, expanded on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022From what I read, the issues they had with their probes drove them to desperation, launching a capsule aboard a beefed-up rocket. They build very nice ships, so I\u0027m not surprised it went off well.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027ve got to match their achievement. Do we have a rocket which could lift a kerbal?\u0022 responded Jeb, still half in shock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Theoretically, we have a heavy-lift vehicle designed for a large probe, but it would take some time to be ready to fly. Besides, we can\u0027t just throw away our plans for the probe exploration program. You and I spent weeks hammering out that schedule!\u0022 Bill responded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb\u0027s right, Bill,\u0022 Bob cut in. \u0022We have to beat the CFKN at any cost. If they have the capacity to launch payloads as heavy as a kerbal, they can launch weapons and drop them on our defenseless nation!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh come on, Bob, you\u0027ve been listening to too many \u0027Blue Threat\u0027 broadcasts again, the CKFN is not a threat!\u0022 exclaimed Bill, throwing his hands in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You can never be sure,\u0022 Bob folded his arms and leaned back in his chair. Jeb, on the other hand, jumped out of his seat and began scribbling on a blackboard. \u0022Maybe if we lengthen Aether\u0027s body, attach side boosters, we don\u0027t have to design a whole new craft\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re missing the point, Jeb. We\u0027ve got a warehouse of probe parts and scientific instruments designed for them. We had a schedule!\u0022 Bill said, annoyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The schedule be damned! We have a race to win! If they get kerbals to the Mun while we\u0027re still messing around with probes in orbit, we might as well not even be trying,\u0022 shot back Jeb. \u0022It might be challenging, but we\u0027ll discover so much along the way!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I still don\u0027t like it,\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Let Jeb decide, Bill, he\u0027s the Director of the Space Program, after all,\u0022 Bob pointed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t like to pull rank on you guys, but we have to do something. We have the technology, and the brains behind it. We can do this!\u0022 said Jeb, still excitedly scribbling away on the chalkboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fine. You\u0027re right, we won\u0027t develop much new tech in Low Kerbin Orbit. But I still don\u0027t feel right about this. Aether 7 was pushing the limits of the engineers\u0027 capabilities. How on Kerbin will they build a bigger version?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t worry about it, Bill. You\u0027re the one who keeps telling Gene how the crews are better than he gives them credit for.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Maybe you\u0027re right. We\u0027ll have to keep an eye on them though; we can\u0027t have any more incidents like Danbro dropping those decouplers again. This includes during launch, too! I don\u0027t like the number of our sounding rockets that exploded mid-flight!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh relax, Bill. We\u0027ll sort it out. Besides, it was only the first couple of ships that exploded, we fixed that issue for the last batch. Alright, I\u0027ll inform the VAB, let\u0027s start building a rocket!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill caught Bob\u0027s arm as he was leaving the room. Jeb had already rushed off to Werhner Von Kerman\u0027s lab, his arms full of rocket sketches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How did you find out about the CKFN\u0027s difficulty with probes? Last I heard, it was still classified, both by our government and theirs. They don\u0027t even release the full details of their launches to their citizens, for devs\u0027 sake!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6I-I was told about it, because I\u0027m uh\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6part of the space program,\u0022 Outside of Jeb\u0027s presence, Bob became a much more timid kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t think you understand exactly how secret this is. The number of hoops I had to jump through to discover it was staggering. The USKK government is keeping their knowledge of the CKFN space program very, very highly classified. Now, I don\u0027t know if you overheard this while Jeb and I were talking or something, but you\u0027ve got to be careful. There\u0027s no telling what might happen to you if you\u0027re discovered with knowledge beyond your position. I think you\u0027re a good kerbal, and have been a real help to the space program so far, so don\u0027t go trying to hear things that aren\u0027t meant for you. Got it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Y-y-yes sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Great.
