Not having a lander I decided the best course was for a low level high speed fly by. Well...umm...not accounting for the increased gravitational pull of Eve I took an ill advised EVA and was ripped from my ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Re entry was rather warm but amazingly my suit and pack saved me from doom. I am therefore requesting that you send a rescue mission at your earliest convenience.
