Please, take a seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe President has, against my advice, asked me to brief you on the \u0022Jeb Incident\u0022 and all subsequent happenings. I must remind you that what you are about to see and read is marked \u0022ultra top secret\u0022 and any breach of this secret will result in your instant arrest and or termination without trial. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease click \u0022I UNDERSTAND\u0022 to continue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(click)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, Director. First, the infamous \u0022Jeb Incident\u0022 near the planet EVE. You, along with most other civilians at the time were told that Jeb Kerman had damaged his spacecraft resulting in a multi trillion dollar rescue mission. It was reported that the accident was the result of faulty hardware on the space ship. that was a lie told out of necessity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebefore Jeb blasted off on that mission, he was the smartest Kerbal alive, or at least, one of them. Since his return, he has been reduced to being a gibbering idiot, more interested in shiny objects and making rash decisions without thought to the consequences. It was reported that this may be the result of the accident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, we, at the Kerbal Intelligence Agency, know better. We investigated every facet of this case and the conclusion is unmistakable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not our Jeb, this is an imposter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we discovered that fact, other facts them fell into place, and a wider, more alarming situation became apparent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough of the double talk, what you are about to see and hear will frighten you to the very core of your being, but it must be told. Stay strong, Director.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoughly, about four years ago, our race was discovered by a super race of beings in an alternative universe. These aliens call themselves HUMANS and they are barely sentient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore to the point, Director, they found that they could control us. That being the case, a group of humans called \u0022Squad\u0022 developed a portal to our world that would allow any humans to control us, via a piece of software they call a \u0022game\u0022. They are, with this game, able to manipulate time itself, you, for example, have probably died a million times in as many as half a million different \u0022games\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elet that sink in for a minute. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see the problem here, right, we have lost all control over our own destiny, we are hardly free and we have become pawns in some .... \u0022star trek\u0022 situation. We even have evidence that entire wars have been fought using us as pawns, we are pacifist, so this is really disgusting, to think we were involved in some form of \u0022star wars\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what happened to Jeb? We are not sure, but we believe that his intelligence was sucked out of his brain and placed is a device called a \u0022mechjeb\u0022 so humans can automate the space ships containing our bodies. We did suspect that a human had replaced Jeb so we took action to discover the truth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe inserted Valentina Kerman to keep a close eye on jeb and to ensure no mishaps took place with \u0027stupid\u0022 Jeb at the controls of any vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, what you heard is true. One of our mostly closely guarded secrets is that Valentina is an agent of the KIA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next fact may startle you somewhat. We believe that you are being controlled by the humans to run the K.S.P. for them. Everyone thinks that Kerbals design these great planes and space ships, but in reality, it is the humans doing the thinking for YOU and letting \u0022you\u0022 design these ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe President wants you in the picture so you can help us figure out a way to stop the humans destroying our culture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need to find a way to close the portal between these two worlds and end our suffering, not that we really know we are suffering, but we must be. Your task is to discover what you can about this portal even though you cannot see it or sense it, it sounds impossible, but you MUST try... our very lives depends on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe thank you for your service and now ask that you leave before the humans notice you are missing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEpilogue...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe director walked slowly out of the \u0022White House\u0022 deep in thought....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The guys are not going to believe this, not one bit, but they must be told, but how do you tell your comrades at Squad that the kerbals are onto them? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Director got into his car, and travelled back to KSP HQ. He entered his office, walked to the wall, pressed a hidden button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe world dissolved around him and then, he was standing at squad HQ....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey guys, you ain\u0027t going to believe this, but I think the little buggers are onto us.... \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Part two... soon.. or maybe never.... not sure yet....)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
