Not problems like \u0027what is the Mun\u0027, because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of astronomy.\u0022 Bill took a sip of and then set down his Mountain Dew, and continued to play his arratiug. \u0022I solve practical problems.\u0022 Some meteors fell from the sky, showering the immediate area with debris. \u0022For instance, how am I gonna stop some big mean meteroid from tearing me a structurally superfluous new backend? The answer:\u0022 A small rocket shot out of the ground towards a particularly large rock. \u0022Use a booster.\u0022 Then a particularly humongous rocket began falling from the sky towards the area. \u0022And if that don\u0027t work...\u0022 A very large rocket with an Advanced Grabbing Unit swooped the rocket debris out of the sky. \u0022...Use more Booster.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Like this: Tri-leg mounted little ol\u0027 rocket designed by me. \u003Cem\u003EBuilt\u003C/em\u003E, by me. And you best hope... It\u0027s pointed at a rock falling towards you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill was never a competent Kerbal. Nor was he as competent astronaut. Nor was he... competent at all. But for some strange reason he was absolutely genious at putting together rockets out of whatever strange junk and scrap metal Jebediah could find for him.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"montyben101","CreatedById":74173,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T22:07:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EErr are you okay?
