Starting off, I like the intro and the music is fitting and works pretty well throughout the video. The initial launch sequence is really cool, but it then comes to an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion. Then there are the odd jump cuts, like when the Kerbals arrive and the exterior is just \u0027open\u0027 all of the sudden. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s because you built it or what but its just really jarring, and most of what you did suffers from odd cut choices. I get that the video is about them going to another planet, but it skips pretty much everything relevant such as arriving at Duna, entering the atmosphere, etc... I also assumed the Kerbals were AT Duna because you never implied there would be a second mission, so when it pops up it seems completely out of the blue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver all I think you\u0027ve shown you have the eye for some good shots, but you\u0027ll want to work on tying it altogether into a unifying video. And as a last critique, \u0027opinions\u0027 only has one \u0027p\u0027. I think this probably encourages more people to actually look at your thread, but it also represents yourself badly if you are serious about making content.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xetalim","CreatedById":64539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T17:55:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got to say, this is some pretty good cinematic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe view of the base was pretty boring in the beginning, but the launch was awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you make more!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T18:09:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENicely done! *claps*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"008agenta","CreatedById":95894,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T22:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou should check out my new one then, its very dramatic \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEJqZEEXV-w\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEJqZEEXV-w\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nahim","CreatedById":78568,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T03:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E.
