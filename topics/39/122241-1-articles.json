Now, only two large nations remain, The United Kingdoms of Kerbin\u0027s North, the UKKN, and the Domain of the Grand Republic of Tau, the DGRT. The UKKN\u0027s territory spans over nearly all of the northern part of Kerbin, with the DGRT having most of the rest of Kerbin. The rest of the land is either in the process of resettlement or uninhabitable. The UKKN and DGRT have 2 land borders, both with a demilitarized zone to prevent surprise land invasions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe UKKN is a seven-man dictatorship, where seven different people lead the country, though they are limited by multiple documents to prevent oppression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DGRT is, as their name suggests, a republic. Every five years, 101 representatives are elected by the general populace, who make decisions. There are also local governments. The main body decides on countrywide things, while the local governments allow an area to tailor itself to its particular needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two nations were the main aggressors during the Great War of Kerbin, which absorbed absolutely every nation on Kerbin by its peak. It was actually a three way war at one time, where a lesser alliance tried to attack the two aggressors, but failed, leading to the areas being absorbed by the UKKN and DGRT. At the war\u0027s end, only they stood, their allies having been absorbed, and border areas lay dead. Now, both nations have recovered from the severe problems caused. The nations seem equal in power, but that won\u0027t stop anyone from seeking world domination...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrent Designs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are the designs utilized by the two nations, listed in order of date created. Only craft mentioned in the story will be listed, I\u0027m not writing a whole armory report! I may end up making some in KSP, so remember to check back here from time to time!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 UKKN Designs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMiK-23 Musketeer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Musketeer was completed shortly after the end of the war. It used to be the fastest plane in military service, but was beaten by the K-17 Javelin. It isn\u0027t the most maneuverable plane, but carries a heavy armament and has a fairly long operational range. It is still in second-line service, but is being replaced by the newer Ku-35.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKu-35 Kraken\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kraken is a fairly new design, utilizing newly developed Vector turbojets. It isn\u0027t quite as fast as the Musketeer it is replacing, but is twice as maneuverable, and carries both anti-air and anti-surface weaponry. It is slated to become the standard in the UKKN arsenal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPAK-KA (IN DEVELOPMENT)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe PAK-KA is currently undergoing airframe testing. It uses the new Mark 2 form factor, allowing it to have two engines rather than one, as well as carrying a heavier weapons load. It is showing signs that it could be the most maneuverable aircraft ever built.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina-Class Battleship\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Valentina is the UKKN\u0027s latest design. It combines four turrets of triple 16-inch goodness with a speed of 35.2 knots, as well as being well armored. It is a force to be reckoned with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDGRT Designs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nK-11 Cloudmaster\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe K-11 was the DGRT\u0027s staple fighter during the final third of the great war. It was a low-altitude dogfighter, using a Mule turbofan engine, rather than a Whiplash turbojet. It was great at the time, but has been relegated to training duties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nK-17 Javelin\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Javelin is the DGRT\u0027s current fighter. It is currently the fastest operational military aircraft, as well as being quite nimble. It carries a powerful, but short-lived, armament. It has the DGRT\u0027s standard of 400 fuel units per engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nK-22 Valkyrie (LIMITED DEPLOYMENT)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Valkyrie is undergoing field testing, almost ready for full deployment. It also uses the Mark 2 form factor, like the PAK-KA. It was the aircraft that inspired numerous innovations, such as Vector turbojets, ECM jammers, and the Mark 2 form factor itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKV-12 Ghoul\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Ghoul is a disappointing VTOL aircraft currently in use with the DGRT amphibious forces and navy. It is incredibly hard to pilot in hover mode, as well as during the transition from hover to air modes. Its controls are also very unusually mounted, making it a pain to use. It carries only a very light armament, as well as being slow and not particularly maneuverable. Despite this, it did cause innovation, introducing maneuvering jets and internally-mounted VTOL engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKV-18 Wraith (PLANNED)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Wraith is to be the successor of the Ghoul, and is to use the new Mark 2 form factor. This will allow it heavier takeoff weights, better performance, and much higher speeds than its failed predecessor. No work is to be done until the K-22 Valkyrie is completed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter One: Sky in Flames\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How long until the flight is ready? Asked Valentina Kerman II, head of the UKKN air force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Twenty minutes,\u0022 answered Bill Kerman, her adviser and second-in-command.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excellent, the DGRT will never know what hit them with out new Ku-35 planes.\u0022 Replied Valentina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you sure about a surprise attack? Last time we did this we nearly destroyed Kerbin!\u0022 said another kerbal in the meeting room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The DGRT is still using their Javelin fighters, they stand no chance against our air force. They\u0027ll be reeling in shock from the destruction of their squadrons, and we can systematically destroy their military installations. The 500 pound bombs on the Ku-35 will make short work of all their ground assets.\u0022 Valentina explained, \u0022With no air power, they\u0027ll be a pushover.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbals in the meeting room began to squabble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But What about the K-22 Valkyrie they\u0027re making? It trumps the Ku-35 in every way!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Relax, we have the PAK-KA! Once that\u0027s on the scene, they\u0027ll fall like flies!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But that\u0027s not supposed to be ready for testing for another year! They\u0027re finishing trials of the Valkyrie already!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022QUIET!\u0022 Yelled Valentina, \u0022We\u0027re ten minutes from go time. If we were going to cancel now, it wouldn\u0027t reach them until they were halfway to the DGRT. Now, we discuss battle plans. It\u0027s already happening, we need to be ready...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, at a DGRT airbase...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah walks out to his K-17 Javelin. He calls out to the new pilots, \u0022Come on, let\u0027s go! It\u0027s time for the routine air sweep near the border!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Coming, boss!\u0022 Yelled Bob Kerman, a new recruit of the DGRT air force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027re the odds we meet a UKKN invasion flight?\u0022 another newbie jokes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022None! They probably haven\u0027t even made a new plane since the war!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new pilots continue to talk and joke around as they get strapped in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah radios the control tower to request permission for takeoff, which is granted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stay safe, chief!\u0022 says the coordinator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe group of six Javelins is given the green light, and one by one, they take off. They form up in a loose triangle, and fly out towards the border.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack at the UKKN...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe squadron of 13 Ku-35s takes off from the UKKN, heading toward the border as well. They are armed to the teeth, with air-to-air missiles, bombs, rockets, and cannons. They form a large V formation before continuing on. They enter radio silence, and ascend to cruising altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the DRGT side of the border...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA young kerbal by the name of Edby Kerman is sitting atop his watchtower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nothing ever happens out here... It\u0027s so boring. Why couldn\u0027t I be assigned to the other border? They said that the enemy would probably come from over there...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, numerous black dots become visible in the sky. They were on the radar prior, but Edby didn\u0027t care to look at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, what are those? The air sweep isn\u0027t supposed to be here for fifteen minutes... And they\u0027re coming from the wrong direction... Wait... There are 13 of them... There\u0027s only supposed to be six. Did I not get a memo or something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbal sits there, wondering why everything is so strange. Meanwhile, the dots get closer, their shape now visible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, those aren\u0027t Javelins! They\u0027re not K-22s or K-11s, either! It\u0027s the UKKN!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbal hurries down the ladder to his radio, he grabs the headset and screams into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I see a bunch of planes incoming and they can\u0027t be ours! The UKKN sent planes at us! Scramble the fighters or something! I can already see them!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA kerbal responds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you sure they\u0027re not the Javelins that are flying a sweep? Or the flight of Cloudmasters back to be scrapped?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m certain! There are 13 of them, and they are coming right for me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright Edby, I hope this isn\u0027t the little kerb who cried kraken. I\u0027ll let command know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdby runs to the nearby AA gun, and yells at the kerbals to get their guns primed and loaded. He then rushes back to the watchtower, and turns on his targeting radar, to get a better idea of just what the strange craft are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That Edby...\u0022 The kerbal on the radio sighs, \u0022I bet he needs glasses. There are supposed to be 13 Cloudmasters going through, I bet they\u0027re just giving him a scare. Command doesn\u0027t need their time wasted...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, Gergen! Stay in formation!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah rubs his temples. Except for Bob, none of them are taking the flight seriously. He\u0027s already had to stop them from doing aerobatics, and he\u0027s extreme annoyed, when his radio crackles to life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, Jeb? I\u0027m getting the emergency signal from watch station five. Did they say they were having a test?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was Bob. Jebediah looks at his display, and, sure enough, station five is broadcasting an emergency signal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, there isn\u0027t a test. I hear Edby runs that station though, and you\u0027ve all heard how many false alarms he\u0027s given off. Let\u0027s check it out though. Everyone, tight formation! We\u0027re going to watch station five.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdby is staring at his radar display, looking up every minute or so to get a look at the incoming planes. He can\u0027t identify them, they don\u0027t look like Musketeers, and are definitely not a DGRT design. He looks over to the AA gun emplacement, where the guns are up and pointed at the aircraft. He sighs in relief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They actually listened to me, for once. Let\u0027s just hope these are scouts...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What in Kraken are those?! I can\u0027t recognize them!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah orders his wingmen to go into combat formation. They set their course to intercept the unknown squadron.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course we arrive at the same time as their sweep... At least they\u0027re probably only Javelins...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDongas Kerman lets out an annoyed sigh, and signals his men to go into air combat formation. They form a zigzag pattern, and accelerate to flank speed. He activates his fire control computer, and turns on the tracking radar. He sets the radar to target one of the Javelins. Jebediah\u0027s Javelin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m registering a lock! Break and be ready for missiles!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah screams into his radio. He flicks on all weapons systems, and prepares to deploy evasive maneuvers. One of the cadets, who had joked about them encountering a UKKN force, freezes in fear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I see a missile! Look out, Jeb!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob peels away from Jeb\u0027s plane, which suddenly shoots up to a higher altitude. A missile whizzes by, and explodes in a cloud of chaff Jeb had deployed. The DGRT recruits start to panic, and start to fly very sloppily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dang it, he dodged it. Wait, that symbol... It\u0027s Jebediah! Look alive, they\u0027ve got an ace in the skies!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDongas enables the maneuver assistance system, and flies directly at Jeb, determined to take out the DGRT\u0027s best pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You won\u0027t get away from me this time, Jeb! Not after what you did to my last squadron!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, the AA gun below opens up, and one of the UKKN planes starts smoking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Edlu, break off and head home. Don\u0027t stay here waiting to flame out!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe air is filled with missiles going every which way. The UKKN planes seem impossible to hit as they start engaging evasive maneuvers, and three of the DGRT recruits are knocked out of the sky: Gergen, Erlan, and Danhat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come on, Bob and Chadfry ! Don\u0027t let them get the better of you!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, Jebediah nearly clips Dongas\u0027 fighter. He sees who it is, and tenses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s Dongas! I knocked down a bunch of his wingmen in the war! Be careful, he\u0027s an ace!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah radios back to base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is Jeb, we\u0027ve met a squadron of hostile aircraft! Gergen, Danhat, and Erlan are down! It\u0027s some new plane, we can barely hit them at all! We\u0027re going to try to disengage, send up more planes!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven though Jebediah wasn\u0027t an officer, his word is taken as an order by many, due to his status as the highest scoring pilot in the war. Andas Kerman responds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?! UKKN planes?! Roger that Jeb, we\u0027ll scramble some Javelins and send out a search party for your men!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, we need at least twenty Javelins in the air NOW! Head to the coordinates I\u0027m sending to your computers! Get going, it\u0027s the UKKN! This in NOT a drill! Move it!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe airbase goes from seemingly deserted to a madhouse. Planes taxi out from their hangars onto every nook and cranny on the airfield, kerbals are running every which way to get to their planes. The control tower is overloaded with takeoff requests, and planes are shooting off the runway at breakneck speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebdiah is pulling a hard maneuver when he sees a missile smack into Chadfry Kerman\u0027s fighter, and it explodes violently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Chadfry, no!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb yells into his radio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bob, it\u0027s just you and me. Just stay alive, don\u0027t try anything risky! I\u0027ll see if I can get them to leave you alone! Run if you get the chance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob is glued to his seat, pinned down by the G-forces he\u0027s enduring. He slams his fist on the emergency power button, releasing extremely high-grade fuel into the turbine, giving him more power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come on, hold together!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe jerks the stick this way and that, narrowly avoiding missiles. He is struck in the wing by a gun round, but it luckily doesn\u0027t hit anything explosive or important. He\u0027s almost constantly hitting the countermeasure button, the sky is full of heat decoys and chaff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bob, get going! nobody\u0027s on you!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob looks back, then peels off as he confirms Jebediah\u0027s words. He makes a beeline for the base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Base? This is Bob Kerman, I saw Chadfry get blown up! I\u0027m returning on Jeb\u0027s orders, and my wing is hit!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Roger that Bob, we\u0027ll be ready for a hard landing. Reinforcements are on the way!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDongas finally gets Jeb in his sights, and hits the missile release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EClick.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No! I\u0027m out of missiles! Dang it, I was never good with guns!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time Dongas switches to gunnery mode, Jeb has left his crosshair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aha! Got you, you dirty UKKN slug!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah watches as his last missile slams home into a UKKN Ku-35, blowing its jet clean off. He switches to his cannon, and guns down a second plane. It turns tail and shakily glides towards home hopelessly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Another down! Y- Oh crap!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah notices Dongas right behind him. His gun comes to life, peppering Jeb\u0027s tail. He pulls hard to the right, shaking Dongas off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not this time, Don! It\u0027s your turn to be downed!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah lines up the shot, and releases a burst of 20mm fury. Dongas evades the majority of the shells, though one clips his wing, knocking a chunk out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh for Squad\u0027s sake, let\u0027s get out of here! Jeb\u0027s not going down. He won\u0027t follow us over the UKKN.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDongas\u0027 squadron turns for home, and Jebediah does as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I can\u0027t believe it... Those dirty UKKNs! Now Chadfry\u0027s dead, and Gergen, Danhat, and Erlan are MIA. They\u0027re no better than criminals, attacking out of the blue like that!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah sees the reinforcements on the horizon. He radios them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Keep this place locked down. They\u0027re gone now, after 3 got knocked down, but four of our guys went down as well. Be careful, they\u0027re in a new plane that\u0027s almost impossible to hit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Roger, Jeb. We\u0027ll take it from here. Fly safe!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnming turns her radio on silent for a moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Four downed? That\u0027s two thirds casualties! What in Kraken are they piloting?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe turns the radio back up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright guys, we\u0027re facing superior craft. We need to be on high alert, and don\u0027t take your eyes off the horizon. Stay vigilant!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater, at the UKKN base...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022WHAT?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina is furious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022THREE Ku-35s down? Are you men BLIND?! They were piloting JAVELINS, for Squad\u0027s sake! JAVELINS!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pilots recoil in fear. Val has a notorious temper, and even Dongas doesn\u0027t dare say a word until she is done venting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Erm, Val? Three were downed because Jeb was there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s eyes widen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jebediah? As in, the best pilot of the war? What was HE doing on a routine sweep? Dang it, worst timing possible!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill pipes up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, what do we do now? We just lost the element of surprise, and their best pilot is still in the skies.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We cut our losses and send a bigger squadron.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile at the DGRT base...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb hops out of his lightly damaged fighter. He approaches the control tower. Andas exits and meets him halfway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bob got here just fine, though he almost crashed, he had a fuel leak.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank Squad. I was worried about him. But we have a bigger problem. The UKKN has a new toy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You told me, what\u0027s it like?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s too maneuverable for our heavier missiles, and even our light ones usually miss... Even with gunfire it\u0027s hard to hit with just a single bullet...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I see. I\u0027ll let command know, you take a breather in the break room, Bob\u0027s there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAndas heads to his radio set to relay Jeb\u0027s message. Jebediah heads to the break room, where he finds Bob sitting on the couch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You okay, Bob?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, I\u0027m okay, Jeb... That was the scariest thing I\u0027ve ever been through...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Same here. I\u0027ve never seen a UKKN plane fly that well. Let\u0027s hope the Valkyrie is ready. It\u0027s a real beauty to fly, plus it has better missiles.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let\u0027s hope.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter Three: Gunboat Diplomacy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamdos Kerman watches the video footage captured by Jebediah in awe.

We need to be ready for anything, even a land offensive, or a seaborne invasion.

Be ready.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDongas Kerman is leading the UKKN force again. He is determined to succeed after the disastrous first attack.

He just appeared out of nowhere! How?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah activates the newly developed anti-radar countermeasures on the K-22. He drops off of their radar again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two forces close to within sight.

The UKKN takes some losses, but not as many. Jebediah tries fruitlessly to prevent the downing of his comrades, knocking down UKKN planes as fast as he can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, I want anyone who isn\u0027t an ace or veteran to run back to the airfields. We can\u0027t be taking so many losses!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Jeb sends these orders, about half of the force turns for home, accelerating to maximum speed. Of the 24 planes that began the fight, 7 have been shot down, and 8 have turned back. Only 9 are left, Jebediah, Anming, Corbin, and, surprisingly, Bob are among them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bob, I said turn for home. Don\u0027t kill yourself trying to stay here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb, I\u0027m not leaving. If it weren\u0027t for you, I\u0027d have died during that first attack, and I intend to return the favor, eventually.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just don\u0027t get killed!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat was previously a by-the-book engagement has turned into an all-out dogfight. Flares are spread across the sky, making Kerbol look dull by comparison. The cannon fire sounds like a massive, airborne chainsaw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come on, let\u0027s get this done! They only have one fighter that matches us, pick up the pace!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDongas is frustrated with the management. They\u0027ve refused to let many veterans fly, Dongas himself had to bribe one of them to be on the fly list. He\u0027s commanding a force of kerbals who, for the most part, haven\u0027t seen combat. This was what killed the UKKN in the first war.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb runs out of missiles. He switches to his cannon, and gets ready for classic dogfighting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This should be interesting. It is the most maneuverable thing I\u0027ve flown.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe UKKN force begins to overpower the DGRT fighters, as they run out of missiles quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If you don\u0027t have missiles, turn tail. Guns are nearly useless against things that can turn faster than you can.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnming and two of her wingmen turn for the airfield. Bob has but one missile left, and Corbin has only two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeven of the 30 UKKN planes have been shot down, three by Jebediah, two by Anming, and another two by Corbin. Bob is aiming his last missile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, it\u0027s all or nothing! Missile out!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob\u0027s missile barely clips one of the UKKN planes, but the fragments hit the fuse of one of its bombs, blowing it apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022YES! My first air kill!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright Bob, you\u0027re out of missiles and should have left already. Congrats on the kill, but you have to go, NOW.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright Jeb, stay safe!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob flies towards home as well. Only five DGRT planes remain, Jebediah, Corbin, and their wingmen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I hate to say it, but with Jeb here, they have us outmatched unless we drop our bombs over the water. Let\u0027s lead them to the navy, shall we?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDongas and his men turn towards the nearing UKKN fleet. Another plane is shot down as they do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are they... Running?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I doubt it, probably regrouping. We should definitely chase them down if we can, though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they follow the UKKNs, the navy comes onto radar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh Squad, they\u0027ve got ships inbound! We won\u0027t survive concentrated anti-air attack from a whole fleet, we better get back to base. I\u0027ll radio command.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DGRT unit heads for home, and Jebediah switches his radio to the command channel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Command? This is Jebediah Kerman. Confirmed nine air kills. Three by me, two by Anming, two by Corbin, one by Bob, and one by Alney. Confirmed eight of ours down, another three possibly going down before making it back. We only managed to survive due to the fact that this was a veteran squadron, though, they seemed like newbies. But we have a big problem. There\u0027s an enemy fleet incoming, and 21 of theirs are still in the air.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A fleet!? Roger Jeb, I\u0027ll relay the message! Get back safe!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA short while later, Jebediah lands on the airfield, and hops out of his Valkyrie. The head engineer that had talked to him beforehand, Bardun Kerman, runs up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How\u0027s the Valkyrie, Jeb? Any problems? Shortcomings?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, unless you can strap more missiles to it safely, no, nothing wrong. Far better than the Javelin, and really hard for them to lock on to.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excellent! I also heard you scored three air kills. With such a great success, it\u0027s sure to go into mass production. Great job up there!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe now-ecstatic kerbal rushes back to where he came from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the command bunker...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A fleet!? Dang it, Edgas, get those ships to sea already!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They\u0027re going as fast as they can! I\u0027m sure we can get at least ten worthy ships oceangoing within the time we have!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027d hope so! If not, we\u0027ll be done before we\u0027ve even gotten started!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbals are all tense. They know that if the fleet is successful, the capital is sure to fall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the UKKN flagship...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdmiral Bardin Kerman stands in the bridge of NKS (North Kingdoms Ship) Valentina, named after the first Valentina Kerman, who was one of the best gunnery captains of her time. The air force director was also named after her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022With the enemy aircraft beaten off... despite the casualties... we should be able to bombard their capital effectively, afterwards putting ashore the commandos to finish things up. Prepare the main guns! We will be arriving within two hours!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lowly shiphand on the ship next to the Valentina thinks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can we really win so easily?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter Four, Part One: Full Steam Ahead\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is TNV (Tau Naval Vessel) Krakenbane, requesting permission to arm weapons.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrand Admiral Alcas Kerman, one of the DGRT\u0027s greatest naval tacticians, but quite young, had recently been given command of the TNV Krakenbane, an aging but fearsome ship that had just been upgraded. The behemoth of a ship was the largest to date, showing in its speed of only 28.9 knots. This was not a problem for the ship, however, as it mounted four turrets, totaling 8 19.5 inch guns. Just one of these shells could sink a cruiser, a single broadside enough to sink another Krakenbane class, if such a ship existed. The shells themselves had recently been replaced, gaining stabilizer fins, higher efficiency explosives, and a more refined penetrating head. This terrifying main armament was supplanted by an astounding 32 6 inch guns, meant for use against lighter targets, such as destroyers or cruisers. Instead of anti-aircraft guns, it mounted a large, 32-tube vertical missile array, each tube having one reserve missile, for a total of 64 anti-aircraft missiles. Underwater, swiveling torpedo mounts for anti-sub operations, anti-torpedo sonar decoys, and ECM units had been installed with the upgrade, giving it near-immunity to submarines and antiship missiles, the Krakenbane\u0027s only worries beforehand. Many doubted even the mighty Valentina class of the UKKN could match the behemoth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is Edgas Kerman, permission granted. Official permission also granted for unrestricted engagement and command of naval and naval aviation assets.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlcas has the ship turned to the heading of the last sighting of the UKKN naval force. He is in command of a ragtag group of scrambled ships, only one of which was new.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, fleet. I know you are short on information, but know this. The enemy is superior in number and overall quality. That won\u0027t change for another 48 hours while the main force steams from Daz Seaport. Unfortunately, we are absolutely required to engage. If the enemy is allowed to shell Tau and deposit troops, this war will be over before it has even begun. We must fight them, we must keep them occupied, we must beat them when our reinforcements arrive. We must defend our great capital Tau, and all of the people who live there. We must succeed! We will succeed! Take them to the ocean floor. Take them with your own hull to the seabed! Take them to the very realm of the Kraken itself! By Squad, we will send those dogs running like the cowards they are! Hear me, fleet! WE! WILL! WIN!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other ship captains offer a hearty cheer at the admiral\u0027s words of encouragement, and the makeshift fleet forms up for combat, full steam ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know, it\u0027s probably disappointing that I came up with so little, so late.
