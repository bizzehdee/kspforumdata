One of the senior computers came down in the opposite direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey, Linus,\u201D she said. \u201CWernher still hiding atop his mountain?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHi, Cammy,\u201D Linus said. \u201CNo. He comes down once in a while. But, I\u2019m still doing his running around.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CToo bad. Eventually you\u2019ll get out to where somebody appreciates your talents.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus shrugged. \u201CPerhaps. I\u2019ve got to drop these off,\u201D he waggled the bundle of folders in his hand. \u201CSee you around.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSure Linus\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus continued down the hall. He walked past a couple of empty meeting rooms. The remains of complex equations were on the blackboards. They were annotated with an arcane symbology known only to the computers themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe wondered, as he always did in these halls, if it would be possible to use machines to do the work. He knew that a couple of the computers worked with a couple of techs in electrics to build an electronic analog computing machine. They figured that it would be useful in the simulator. It would probably increase the accuracy of orbit calculations as well. If it could be shrunk down by a factor of a hundred it might be useful on the rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, the computers were an important piece of feedback. They could and did provide simpler or more elegant equations based off the ones they were given. Machines wouldn\u2019t be able to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHiya Linus,\u201D a flirty voice called.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus looked around, disturbed from his thoughts. It was Chadlie. A couple of the other computers were with her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHello, Chadlie,\u201D Linus said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMmm, my that looks like a big request.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus looked at the bundle of a half dozen manila folders. \u201CNot really. Most of this is from design and sim. Wernher has a couple in here as well.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo. I was telling my friends here about your slide rule and your skill with it.\u201D Chadlie said. \u201CThey don\u2019t believe me.\u201D She pouted slightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the other two giggled girlishly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s nothing special. It\u2019s about his long,\u201D Linus held his hands about 30 cm apart. \u201CWide enough that I can do two at once on it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the other two arched one of her eyebrows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf I\u2019m lucky, with the right set I can sometimes do three.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of them giggled girlishly again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere see? Straight from the horse\u2019s mouth,\u201D Chadlie said to the other two. She turned back to Linus, \u201Cyou\u2019ll really have to show it to me some time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CReally it\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary.\u201D Linus shuffled uncomfortably knowing that he had missed something. \u201CWell, I must get this up to Katherine.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, Linus,\u201D Chadlie said. \u201CSee you around.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus quickly walked down the hall. It always seemed to be longer than the building. Chadlie was part of the reason he didn\u2019t like going to the Computer Corps. The other sat at the other end of the room he just entered, the Computer Hall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKatherine Kerman looked up from her desk when Linus stepped into the doorway. Her sharp look pinned Linus to the doorway. She relaxed when she recognized him. Only then did he feel safe to enter. There were stories about kerbals who had crossed her. Some of them had survived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus walked up to the dais the Katherine\u2019s desk sat on. As he walked by some of the computers looked from their work. They quickly went back to it. A couple followed Linus with their eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKatherine was a demanding kerbalina. But, she would support those who met her standards, or were working towards them. Despite her demands the Computer Corps was loyal to her because of her support, and that she demanded more from herself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo, Mr. Linus,\u201D she said. \u201CWhat have you brought us today?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFour requests from Design and Simulation, and two from Wernher,\u201D he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKatherine frowned. \u201CLet\u2019s see the ones from Dr. Wernher.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus placed the stack on her desk. She pulled the two from Wernher out. The rest she handed to a clerk that had stepped over. She flipped through the two requests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat kerbal barely knows math.\u201D She leaned back in her chair an exhaled slowly. \u201CThank-you Mr. Linus. I will see you when he sends back his corrections and clarifications.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes. I\u2019ll bring them as soon as possible.\u201D Linus turned and walked out at pace just short of a run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-15T15:03:43Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2017 03:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by steuben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T09:43:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoor Linus...:)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting twist though, using Computers in the original sense of the word.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
