Recently I\u0027ve begun working on enlistment into the Air Force, to begin the next step to my ultimate goal of becoming an astronaut. With that, I have had a genius idea. With HOCgaming\u0027s recent charity water polar expedition, I decided I wanted to do something similar. I have decided to go to the Mun, but without time acceleration, and with only IVA, and to live stream it for charity. But, I was going to develop a whole space program style development to where I can locate the best landing site, and the best scientific analyses (granted fake science, but just something interesting I can do to help keep it entertaining) I will launch probes, and develop lander\u0027s and orbiting spacecraft. How it would go is I would develop a series of probes, developed with stock parts, one series to take photos of the surface going both in an equatorial orbits, and polar orbits. A small series of landing craft, and rovers, each one with their own experiments and equipment. Then, when I have selected a landing site, and developed the lander and orbiting spacecraft. I will live stream the launch, the orbital transition, the landing, and the return, for a charity group, using only IVA, and no time warp. Tell me what you think, I will launch the Pilot mission soon. Stay tooned to see what the plan is.
