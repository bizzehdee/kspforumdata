There was the United States of Allertse, a bustling capitalist democracy, which was allied with Albuka. There was the Socialist Repubic of Onreivni, a communist dictatorship that ruled much of Kerbin and controlled Pyramidia. Finally, there was the Great Commonwealth, a grouping of several tiny nations that was a feudalism in all but name, and was allied with Meroc Island.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was one other nation that refused to ally with anybody. This was Pockgrato. It was too small to be a superpower, but too big to require protection.
