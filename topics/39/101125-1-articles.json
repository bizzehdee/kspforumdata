It features one, and only one piece of background music, Interstellar Original Score Track 13 \u0022Coward\u0022. Erm, it\u0027s relative easier to make, because, really, it\u0027s pretty easy to fill in 8 minutes. \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/PjYuh6uDSKE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nNow this part is copied down from my YouTube video description, feel free to read it, if you want to know more. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s actually pretty ironic that my background music is called \u0022Coward\u0022, while my video is basically telling an exactly opposite story.\n\nDidn\u0027t feel like I did a very good job on matching the background music with the video part. \n\nActually, must of the audio, including most of the engine AFX and all the explosions, are added after recordings. \n\nThe track I used (Coward) was kind of hard to use as BGM, as it\u0027s too plain in the beginning, and there\u0027s too much stuff going on in the back. Oh well. I tried to used some other tracks, like \u0022I Can Get It Back\u0022 (Ronin, Zack Hemsey), \u0022The Way\u0022 (The Way, Zack Hemsey), S.T.A.Y. (Interstellar, Hans Zimmer), Imperfect Lock (Interstellar, Hans Zimmer), Terraforming (Man of Steel, Hans Zimmer), but surprisingly none of them worked out as well. Some are too short, or too long, or too plain for this. Well, since I filled the whole track with footages, I\u0027ll just assume Coward is the best piece for this, I guess.\n\n-----Music Used: -----\n\nInterstellar Track 13 \u0022Coward\u0022 -- Hans Zimmer\n\nPoster, if anybody is interested in. \n\n![bS5LmEH.png?2](http://i.imgur.com/bS5LmEH.png?2)\n\nHigher resolution: [http://i.imgur.com/bS5LmEH.png](http://i.imgur.com/bS5LmEH.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wavechaser","CreatedById":125058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T23:53:25Z","Content":"-----Reserved-----"}]}
