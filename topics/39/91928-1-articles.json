I was thinking of doing mod reviews, devnotes overviews, game update information and mission reports. I was also hoping to maybe do some interviews (or co-casts) with streamers or other people from the community (popular mod developers maybe?). I would be putting episodes out on hopefully a weekly basis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is something people would like and I would be more than happy do work on this. I know there already is one but there is always room for more (because you can never have enough KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I am aware that this is not a stream, but I would probably end up hosting this at my stream as well which can be found at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/atpistolz4pandaz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.twitch.tv/atpistolz4pandaz/\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the curious I made a pilot this evening for fun. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3iR9Sc6WQv9TWJyVFozRmN5azQ/view\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3iR9Sc6WQv9TWJyVFozRmN5azQ/view\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-04T06:35:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2014 06:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by pistolz4pandaz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded pilot and link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
