After upsetting the God Alternis\u0027s pet Space Kraken, he decided to smite the Kerbals. Unfortunately he missed them, and ended up splitting the Kerbal Star System into an alternate realm. A few of the Kerbals were dragged into this realm, but they had no space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore long, they found that the natives of this kerbin were somewhat more intelligent than normal Kerbals, but thoroughly less optimistic. It was only with the inspiration of the Prime Reality Kerbals that these new, Blue kerbals were able to start their space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the voyages of Kerbalkind into the next realm, a space of new horizons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the next exciting episode of New Horizons: The Kerbal Dream, the space program attempts to pick itself up after an embarrassing flirt with bankruptcy. Will the space program be able to accomplish the Serran orbit return that it must do to be seen positively in the eyes of the public again? Can the science gathered be applied to the construction of better spaceship parts? Find out in the next exciting episode of New Horizons: The Kerbal Dream. Notice: The time is merely an estimate. It could happen at any time tomorrow, or even not at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe eventual goal of the space program is to put a self-sustained Kerbal base on every planet in New Horizons, and return a Kerbal from each planet within reason. All in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so a few things have changed since the pilot episode Saturday. Blue Kerbals, a neat backstory, and bankruptcy? That last part wasn\u0027t part of the main stream, it was part of the Bonus Round(a short extra section of me playing the game). Just upgraded the VAB, rescued a Kerbal, and accepted some Serran contracts. A few more mods have been installed as well, including the most game-changing one: A life support mod.
