I\u0027ve had this one laying around for a while already.

Sadly, it\u0027s 3 state (center, up, down) and not proportional. So might swap this for something custom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Place for 3 dials. Currently not hooked up. First one has a cheap hobby servo in it. The dial holders are 3D printed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The center joystick was bought at a flee market (1.5 euro)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The panels are laser cut 6mm ply. Painted with two layers base coat of gray. Looks perfect for the job, and cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Single ArduinoMega2560 hooked up to all the switches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the wood was cut at my work. The dial face and holder was 3D printed at work. Yes, I\u0027m privileged, got a laser cutter at work, 3D printer at home, tons of 3D printers at work, and Lathe and a cnc milling machine at work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, the costs for building this for myself was less then 20 euros. With the throttle control being the most expensive part. But that\u0027s because the wood was free (waste material) as well as the Arduino.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the software side, I started with KSPSerialIO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66393-Hardware-Plugin-Arduino-based-physical-display-serial-port-io-tutorial-%2817-Dec%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66393-Hardware-Plugin-Arduino-based-physical-display-serial-port-io-tutorial-%2817-Dec%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut quickly figured that I wanted to do most stuff from the plugin side, and as less as possible on the Arduino.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my code became: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/daid/KSPSerialIO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/daid/KSPSerialIO\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I lost the Arduino code.

(Done)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Allow viewing of your ship from a telescope camera on another far away ship (WIP, sort of works, view is blocked trough planets, but sometimes acts up)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Allow viewing of your ship from KSC telescope. (Not done)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Force one of the above cameras when available, disabling the default camera (however, it could be that no camera is available, due to no cameras on the ship, and all other cameras blocked by planets)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note, it\u0027s still quite buggy, I do not recommend using this version of the mod in this state)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow. For the panel. I have the following controls figured out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Left most red/green buttons, 4 of them, used to cycle cameras.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Right most red/green buttons, 2 of them, used for time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Throttle lever is used for throttle up/down, but only in stage mode. Switching to docking mode sets the throttle to 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Joystick is used for yaw/pitch/roll (top button switches between yaw/roll as in most flight sims). In docking mode the joystick controls lateral controls, with the joystick fire/top button doing forwards/backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* 6 switches next to the joystick control: SAS/RCS/Gears/Solarpanels/Lights/Breaks. All on/off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* \u0022Master switch\u0022 is the staging switch. Makes a lot of noise when you close the cap. The cap also resets the switch. So it acts more like a button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The next 6 switches. One of the switches between staging and docking mode. The other 5 control the auto-pilot mode. If all 5 are disabled, then it\u0027s simple stability assist. Else, you can set every auto-pilot mode. 4 of them set prograde,radial,normal and target. And then there is the \u0022alternative\u0022 switch, which sets the mode into the other direction (so normal becomes anti-normal, etc...). And the \u0022alt mode\u0022 switch sets stability assist to maneuver node (if available).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* 10 top switches are mapped to the custom action groups. However not sure if this will stay this way. Also the 4th switch is not working, might be a broken wire...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I use NanoGauges:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84409-0-90-0-NanoGauges-tiny-ana1og-gauges-for-kerbalnauts-0-5-24-303\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84409-0-90-0-NanoGauges-tiny-ana1og-gauges-for-kerbalnauts-0-5-24-303\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor all the information needs. I\u0027ve been slowly adding a few gauges that I miss. (Time till Ap/Pe for example)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow. This allows me to control most of the flight aspect of the game. But, I still miss a few things to fly a perfect mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a test mun landing yesterday to see how well it worked. And ran into a few things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a nice mun intersection I needed to setup a maneuver node. While \u0022burn at mun rise\u0022 still works, you still need the map to verify the final orbit. As the nano gauges Ap/Pe gauges do not go that distance. And do not tell me I have a capture. I should add a gauge that shows a SoI change, and time till SoI change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I want to add a maneuver planning mode to the panel, not sure how to do that yet. But I still have the 10 top left switches. Currently these are mapped to the custom action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, camera setup is extremely important. I had no camera view that showed if my solar panels where unfolded and not ripped off. As I flipped the wrong switch during assent, and I wasn\u0027t sure if they had unfolded and ripped of, or that they where fine. When I got into orbit, and my telescope satellite was in view, I could verify that the solar panels where fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking. I have a docking port on the lander. But I could not undock, as my camera setup did not put the docking port in view. Not sure how to handle this. Could setup action groups for the docking ports, but that\u0027s hard to remember which group is which docking port. And not sure what will happen if you dock multiple ships together. Could also just setup my cameras better. Finally undocked by using the mouse in telescope view. But I want to set this up so I do not need the mouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Better photos will follow later, with bottom photo showing all the hotglue on there)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrOnak","CreatedById":104432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T10:56:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESubscribed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the explanation of your goals, it has an interesting twist (getting rid of keyboard/mouse \u003Cem\u003Ecompletely\u003C/em\u003E) to most other controllers out there, including mine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hakan","CreatedById":92934,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T13:10:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESubscribed, too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, if this is successful, it would be something like my dream project for the last year or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHook up the laptop to my beamer in my man cave, and use just my controller to fly missions on THE REAL BIG SCREEN \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hakan","CreatedById":92934,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T13:12:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Daid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Daid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I want to give it a bit more realistic experience, I\u0027m modifiying the Hullcam mod from:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46365-0-90-Hullcam-VDS-0-90-update-Updated-16-Dec?highlight=hullcamvds\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46365-0-90-Hullcam-VDS-0-90-update-Updated-16-Dec?highlight=hullcamvds\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECode for the modified Hullcam can be found at:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/daid/KSPHullCamera\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/daid/KSPHullCamera\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you consider merging your changes with the \u0022original\u0022 Hullcamera?
