A little lake--too small to be visible from Map view--was spotted and appeared to be the best thing to aim for, as shoreline is often the lowest and flattest terrain around. Also, Bill and Bob were in need of baths after having soiled themselves sweated profusely throughout the flight...and Jeb was eager to discover whether he would be able to swim decently in his full flightsuit, or would instead flail around and eventually drown. (It sounded fun and exciting to him either way.)\n\nThe boys got out and walked down to the beach.\n\n\u003E ![B-BSea1.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v440/KevinTMC/B-BSea1.png)\n\n\u003E ![B-BSea2.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v440/KevinTMC/B-BSea2.png)\n\n\u003E ![B-BSea3.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v440/KevinTMC/B-BSea3.png)\n\nSince the lake is at sea level, Jeb was determined to call it a \u0027sea\u0027 and not a \u0027lake\u0027. Also, he wanted to do something nice to honor his intrepid crewmates, who had screamed all the way displayed their customary bravery and were too freaked out to do anything had been as helpful as always on this voyage. Furthermore, since he couldn\\\u0027t possibly choose between his two friends to give one of them top billing, Jeb decided to use just their initials rather than their full first names.\n\nAnd so, KevinTMC and Jebediah Kerman would like to present to you...the B.B.
