Having to deal with a computer that struggles playing KSP, much less recording anything limits me significantly- so I feel like changing that. I would like to assemble a team of 2-3 people who will help turn my stories into something beautiful \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0.
