It was his dream to one day pilot those aircraft and go the the United Kerbin States to see the Statue Of Kerbal. Anyway, back to the present. In New Kerbal begging was illegal and \u201CKoppers\u201D would wander around trying to locate street kerbals like Jeb. The street corner he was on at this particular moment would be his last street corner as there was a Kopper top about to wander around the corner to make an arrest. As Jeb looked around he realised that there was a Kopper sprinting towards him. He grabbed his pack and started to run TOWARDS the Kop. the Kopper was put off by this and decided to pull his taser.
