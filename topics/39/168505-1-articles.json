I\u0027m playing Unmanned before Manned, and the mod unlocks rover tech at Engineering 101, and since I had an contract from Space Penguins, Inc., I decided to deploy a rover I dub Runny Rover. It\u0027s more of a test of technology and proof of concept, but I like seeing the name in the tracking station so I decided to make it a permanent mission, roving around Kerbin. The picture is slightly large, since I took it at 1920x1200 and scaled it down. This view is of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E from over 3km away. I\u0027ve also stuck a solar panel on it, so around noon its producing the most power. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is small because I haven\u0027t upgraded literally anything there yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KN8AlC4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KN8AlC4.png\u0022 width=\u0022923\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-13T06:04:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2017 06:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Unturned_Fighter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
