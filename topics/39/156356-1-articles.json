Though these objects have been mostly a passing curiosity, recent spectral analysis has revealed that these asteroids are made largely of rocket fuel, leading many entrepreneurial Kerbals to start referring to them as \u0022moons we haven\u0027t met yet\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 Occasionally, a scientist will suggest reclassifying Kerbin as a planetoid because \u0022 it hasn\u0027t cleared its neighborhood of all these asteroids\u0022, but they often disappear mysteriously soon after making the suggestion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENebulae\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNebulae are widely regarded as stars and planets that just haven\u0027t gotten it together yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENECKTI\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/span\u003EE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E administration has been adamant that recent rockets whose launches resulted in \u0022cloud shaped conflagrations\u0022 did not, in fact, \u003Cem\u003Eexplode\u003C/em\u003E.

Rockets were naturally difficult during this time, but Kerbalkind persevered. Many stone structures remain from the Neolithic Era including the desert ziggurot \u0022pyramids\u0022 and (we presume) the great stone monoliths strewn across Kerbin. The helmeted monkey heads on these monoliths are hypothesized to represent deities or creators, but the exact intentions and techniques of the monolith\u0027s builders are yet to be discovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENeolithic Matrilineal Origin\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen studying the genetics of mitochondria and chloroplasts from Kerbals across the planet, Cann Kerman discovered that absolutely everyone shares a single lady from the Kerman tribe as a distant ancestor. This was quite a shock to Cann\u0027s mother, who was just preparing for a family get-together. Apparently there was no other way for it, and the entire Kerbal race was obligated to attend as \u0027extended family\u0027. In honor of the discovery and Ms. Kerman\u0027s legendary crustless cucumber sandwiches, the Kerman family name was unilaterally adopted.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENeon\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of the many chemical elements, Neon is characterized by not having any interesting properties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENeptune\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA planet from a popular space game, Neptune is a large blue gas planet with an icey core.

Unfortunately, the high pressures at sea level stifled the engine\u0027s thrust, causing rockets to gently tip over and \u0022kinetically disassemble\u0022 rather than launch. At the sight of the enormous cleaning bill, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E administration declared that any further attempts should be made \u0022on another planet far far away\u0022, but rumors are spreading of an intrepid aviator who recently made a NERVA launch from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENeural Networks:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo heads are better than one (for spreading the blame), but in neural networks two heads can help make better decisions, too. Neural networks use thousands of simple decision making nodes called \u0027neurons\u0027 connected to each-other in just the right way to accomplish a job at hand. At their best, neural networks can make outstanding leaps of intuition that their programmers could never dream of, while at their worst Neural Networks are wildly inefficient devices for making decisions by electronic committee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENeutrinos\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile observing nuclear reactions, Pauli Kerman noticed that much of the energy from his reactions was going missing. He hypothesized that the energy was being embezzled by tiny invisible mystery particles called neutrinos which \u0022are emanating from the sun and going straight through us all the time... EVEN NOW!\u0022 And, against all common sense, he turned out to be right. Tin foil hat sales tripled overnight, and the discovery spawned a storm of patents for devices designed to harness this hidden energy from the sun. Unfortunately, progress never made it past paper because no one could find \u0022a Jool sized planet made entirely of lead,\u0022 which would be necessary to capture the energy of these fleeting particles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENeutrons\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe lightest known gas, Neutrons are quite unstable on their own and tend to settle in to the nuclei of normal matter in much the same way as water tends to settle in to hydrate many minerals and natural materials. Neutrons are ever-present in the world around us, being responsible for about half the weight of everything, which is generally considered a lot. They stick strongly to atomic nuclei through the strong force and don\u0027t have any electric force to repel them apart, which gives them the ability to form in great masses called Neutron Stars (see main entry for more). They are also magnetic without having any electric field, which is considered \u0022weird but definitely not the weirdest thing we have to deal with.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 Though Neutrons are generally responsible for holding matter together, occasionally when too many soak into something, the matter will fall apart like a cookie soaked with too much milk creating enormous amounts of thermal energy in the process. If this energy is applied to rocket fuel, it can be heated and ejected at enormous speeds without ever bothering to burn it (See also: NERVA).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 Also, because neutrons are the lightest known gas, they\u0027re often attempted for use in blimps and dirigibles, generally with disastrous results. Proponents of neutron gas dirigibles cite that later blimp designs using evaporated Hydrogen rocket fuel for gas and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E propellant for paint didn\u0027t fair much better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENeutron Stars\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 (also redirected from Pulsars)\u003Cbr\u003E\nNeutron stars are enormous spinning lumps of neutrons, which (owing to their magnetism) emit jets of particles and light. If this jet points towards Kerbin, it can be seen as a regularly blinking light or a regularly ticking radio signal coming from an otherwise dark part of space, and is commonly called a Pulsar. When Jocylyn Kerman first heard the steady \u0027tick tick\u0027 of a pulsar coming from across the cosmos, she called her colleague at the Baikerbanur Cosmodrome who famously said \u0022Don\u0027t answer the beacon! It might be an alien trap!\u0022 Jocylyn, who famously had a different interpretation, responded by tapping her foot along with the tick saying \u0022A one... A two... A one two three four!\u0022 and proceeded in rocking out by drumming with anything she could get her hands on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 Experiments into the nature of these pulsars soon revealed they would lay down many kinds of musical beat if asked nicely, including: 2/2, 3/3, and even 4/4 time. However repeated requests for 2/3 jig time always yielded negative results. It appeared aliens didn\u0027t like being jaunty. While Jocylyn Kerman was the first to hear the beat of the pulsars, many others soon listened in leading to their widespread popularity and the subsequent science fiction trope of aliens from dark planets leaving behind steadily pulsing beacons for us to find. Since then, pulsars have been shown to be naturally occurring Neutron Stars, but the stories and the search for alien life continues to this day (for more information, see SETI and Duna: Unconfirmed \u0027Wow!\u0027 Signal).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 Neutron stars are formed when a normal star collapses at the end of its life. Star collapses can\u0027t normally squish their particles into neutrons because their particles obey the fundamental law: The Schrodinger Equation... Except when sometimes they decide not to listen and just collapse into neutron stars anyways. Noted scientist Bohr Kerman is reportedly quite upset and still attempting to levy legal action against these law breaking stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-11T21:59:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2017 09:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Cunjo Carl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skylon","CreatedById":175317,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-04T19:16:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you don\u0027t mind this too much.

This was supported by the images relayed from the NST and so a mission was planned to discover more. This was imaginatively named the Search For Extra-terrestrial Life Probe-I (SFELP-I), due to the team\u0027s love of ridiculous ACRONYMS (Amazing Contractions Read Only Near Young and Manic Scientists), and was planned to land on Laythe and relay readings. Not only did it show that Laythe had sustainable water and a magnetic field, but also that the atmosphere containing high levels (19.3%) oxygen. This suggested that life could be present, as oxygen supplies would have to be renewed for levels to be this high. To portray the looks on the scientists\u0027 faces as they heard this news, many documentaries describe the look of a slightly mad Aye-Aye who has been told that they \u003Ci\u003Emay, \u003C/i\u003Ein fact, be able to buy sweets with the change they get from doing Mum\u0027s shopping.
