Plus I had one compact fighter that I could fit in there in groups of four, hence the hangar size. But I am also very much of the opinion small is the way to go. Not only do you get much less lag, it also makes tactical sense: a distributed amount of medium ordnance across medium ships will make most of your shots count, while fewer bigger ships with heavier weaponry would \u0022waste\u0022 their massive weapons on an enemy that can absorb more damage (by number of shots as with the right missile one hit is one kill) and still fight back effectively.
