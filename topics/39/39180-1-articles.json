I did it with voiceover to make it easier to follow and explain what I was on about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not done this much(this is my fourth-ever video), so the file is not well compressed (3.2 GB for 9-odd minutes of 1080p), and it took half the night to upload. And then youtube apparently stripped the voiceover track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty apparent that MSI Afterburner is saving the game audio and the voice audio (which are captured separately) into different audio tracks, and the voice track got stripped by youtube for whatever reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I need to change the vid file so the audio\u0027s all in one track, evidently, and ideally chop the size down because I\u0027d really rather not spend another 7 hours uploading it again. But I haven\u0027t got a clue what to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have GIMP for Images. Audacity for Audio.

Only thing is that it will only output in WMV format (I think) which is a little annoying but it uploads to youtube fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should be looking at a much smaller file size after running it through movie maker (while keeping the HD res). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want more control but still not as tricky as VirtuabDub, you can get a trial version of Sony\u0027s Movie studio Platinum and use that (for like 30 days).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IWantSumCrusha","CreatedById":42473,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T18:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, with video im no expert. But when doing my timelapses on youtube i dont have the money for all the fancy video editing stuff, so i use camtasia studio 8. Ive yet to have an issue which wasnt solely me to blame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E the previous reply mentioned movie maker, which i strongly suggest you dont use as its aweful \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E camtasia is like midway between movie maker and vegas, it can do allot and is easy-ish to get the hang of, but isnt capable of all the high end things that the pro\u0027s software can do. It does cost money but is waayyy cheaper than the fancy stuff, and you\u0027ll easily be able to drag and drop your audio and visual files and alter to your liking to then render it out in any presets (including straight to youtube) or adding your own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As i said i do timelapses so i usally have about 5-6GB of 720p video i speed up loads, and add music over the top. Once i\u0027ve rendered it the file has one audio track and 1 visual track, provided you rendered to a file that has that (eg .AVI or .MP4). Other than recomend you get a video editing software there not much else i can say.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
