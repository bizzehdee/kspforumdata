I like to write the amount of science I will receive for returning the sample back to Kerbin. Each box is big enough to write in two values, one for when you transmit the experiment back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and one for when you recover the experiment on Kerbin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe eagle-eyed among you will notice that I neglected to include any Asteroid situations, and that is because I forgot when I was making it and I am too lazy to go back and redo it. Let\u0027s just say I wanted to keep it \u0022Biomes only\u0022. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003EI also neglected to include the mini biomes in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, that is because there are far too many and you have to be really desperate if you are scrounging for those science points. It\u0027s like part clipping, use it, but don\u0027t abuse it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave fun and happy science hunting!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
