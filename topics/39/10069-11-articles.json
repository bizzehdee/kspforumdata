So a single orbit, as in one revolution around the body, is by far not sufficient to map the entire body. Many orbital revolutions are required for this, depending on the desired resolution. A polar orbital trajectory is desirable as it covers the entire body, but it gives a much higher amount of data points over the poles, so you may want to gradually change the orbital plane closer to the lower latitudes once you have sufficient polar data.\n\nIf all you want to do is mapping, then Innsewerant\\\u0027s ISA Mapper might be more what you want. The telemetry plugin can be used to gather mapping data, but that is only one of many sensors, it\\\u0027s not specialized for this task.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThat, and what togfox said just seconds ago ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-30T01:55:24Z","Content":"Thanks Corax. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I\\\u0027ll have to mention this in journal #3.\n\nI\\\u0027ve never actually mapped Kerbin as those datapoints were provided by others in the KGSS community (mostly Dani) and I think she used Innsewerants ISA mapper.
