Be creative, and add humor and background details. Note, this is not a fanficition, it is just a thread for KSP\u0027ers to share their stories of their agencies. No need for suspense or drama.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, here is mine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The National Astronautics Agency was founded by the goverment of the United Proviences some decades ago. The agency progressed quickly, beginning its first launch with the Minimus Project, followed by orbital flights and spacewalks with the Gilly Project, which lasted some six spaceflights on the Gilly Rocket, which produced many science. Soon after the Gilly rocket, the changes in the NAA Adminstration, and Parliament ended the NAA efforts in manned spaceflight, spending the 10% of the manned spaceflight budget to give all the astronauts a year-long luxury cruise around Kerbin, while utilizing the remaining 90% to do research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Planetary Probe Project, headed by the Director of Interplanetary Science Thomas A. Kerman, has sent probes to the Mun, Outer Corona of the Sun, Jool, and Eve respectively, and aims for a probe landing on Duna in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the Great Union of Socialist Nations had followed up with it\u0027s own space program, and had launched a Kerbal to orbit the Mun around the same time the \u0022Horizon 3\u0022 probe arrived in orbit around Jool. Desperate to regain it\u0027s former superioty in manned spaceflight, the United Proviences quickly followed with the launch of the \u0022Nedfred and Scott\u0022, a military spacestation that orbited Kerbin in high orbit-which was highly sucessful, which President Madfield used to his advantage to win a second term as POTUP (President of the United Proviences), followed by a successful probe launch to Eve. The Great Union then replied with a moon landing-that blew up on the surface of the Mun while attempting to return to Kerbin, killing all three spacenauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealizing the race was at it\u0027s climax, the National Astronautics Agency sent Bill, Bob, and Durfrey (Jeb was station commander of Nedfred and Scott, and could not make it) on a hastily assembled craft that was launched past the Kerbin SOI, heading for a year-long trip onto a Eve flyby mission. The craft has returned from Eve orbit (Making Bill, Bob, and Durfrey the first Kerbals to enter orbit of another planet and return safely to Kerbin), followed by landing a probe onto Duna followed by a orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhats your story?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-27T19:53:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2013 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NASAFanboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dynamo","CreatedById":16626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T21:22:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh dear. I\u0027ve been writing an entire AAR about the origin of my program based on my first playthrough of career mode as a prequel. I can\u0027t fit that in a post, but i\u0027ll give a back-cover background:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilt off private funds of a directorship, what was a private atmospheric research association quickly became a multinational agency for space exploration and contracting. Field Dynamics was born in the Gardian flats, where it was built as a private research firm into the relatively new technology of rocket propulsion. As its \u0027soundings\u0027 reached new and daunting heights, it became clear that the agency could face a new directive: the exploration of space. As the Field Dynamics grew into a bustling company, it gained popularity, experience, and achievement as it first moved into orbit, conducting experiments for the betterment of Kerbal technology and corporate firms worldwide. Field Dynamics showed its full prowess in time, however, when it became one of the few and only private firms to land Kerbals on the Mun, and maintain that capability. The firm then spent a long time contracting payload orbit services, crew rotations, and design assistance, and its design wings created several civilian and military designs for licensed produciton and direct sales that further catapulted the company to a worldwide status. These sales and contributions built what is now the Volantis Space Center as it is known today, where the modern Field Dynamics has grown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, Field Dynamics stands amongst the foremost space programs in technology and capability, pushing the boundaries of private-based exploration and engineering as its IPV program reaches beyond Kerbin with investor based funding and research contracts facilitating the colonization and study of the entire Kerbal system and the many secrets it holds for Kerbalkind, or for whoever writes the next check.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T01:01:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWe will return you to your regularly scheduled 23-hour daily marathon of \u0027Gee, I Sure Love Xackylvania\u0027 in just a few minutes.

Here i go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SKSE or Skaltan System Enterprises started as a small rocket design company founded by Skajhul Kerman on the start of the mun watchers era, The Goverment of Cobaltistan Started to try between different rocket agencies but none of them were enought for their \u0022Awesome ideas for space\u0022 so the last person they could contact was Skajhul, He accepted the contract and started to propose some of the lifters, Lots of them failed making angry the nation, Hopefully he finally made a first model, The DOS-7N (Double Opportunity Sender or simply DOS). after the launch of the first model and the acceptable ascent profile (Including possible failures) It was later used as a standard launch vehicle for about 4 years. When those 4 years passed DOS-7N had more variants like the DOS-8 and DOS-9 Interplanetary rockets, They made it to Eve and Duna, But at cost of massive resourcess, it was like the end of the Young Skaltan System Enterprises, until an Retired Kerbonaut of the agency Halsey Kerman proposed to the workers and CEO a great mission known as the lowest budget mission on Story or \u0022The Mighty Go Mun!\u0022 Final Mission of SKSE. At this point the Goverment of Cobaltistan had already fired every kerbal working on the KSC, but they werent able to stop them to build the Mighty Lander Rocket 1 of 3 a 10 meters high rocket capable of reaching LKO whit its small but powerfull \u0022Mighty Engines!\u0022. Hours passed after the launch of the \u0022Mighty Lander\u0022 the rocket gained the attention of the nation and the goverment was forced to keep the SKSE funding to continue, Sadly they dont give funded them whit big Rocket parts but they gave them enought duct tape and tools to make the \u0022Mighty Pusher Mun Transfer Module!\u0022. it docked whit Mighty Lander and at the next day it was equipped whit four fuel tanks for the trip, it touched mun and got back to \u0022the Mighty Pusher\u0022, showing that small rockets can have Mighty Potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd years passed again A sub division was founded the ERI or Eskalento Rocketeer Industries actually being lead by the savior of the company \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A1Halsey Kerman!.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe designed new rockets after the Mighty like the new Rocketeer series and families: Rocketeer Titan(RTitan); An kerbsoviet Space Shuttle booster-alike launcher but whit enought resourcess to softly land on Mun!, The Rocketeer Valent (RValent DOS); an redesigned version of the DOS series now compatible whit a modernized and safer staging and separation system purposed to only reach distant planets around Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESKSE and SKSE-ERI are still on the go to new horizons from Moho to Eloo!.... but actually Cobaltistan wants a Space shuttle Valent on a redesigned RTitan, Halsey is a great lead designer at ERI and we know that those \u0022Mighty\u0022 Feelings will come back someday and show the power of the kerbal mind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
