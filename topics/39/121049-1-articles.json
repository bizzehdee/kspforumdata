I don\u0027t normally look at these shows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I get in and see a guy, I assume is Aki, trying to land his ship on a planet that looks like a hunk of cheddar cheese. I\u0027ve never seen the planet before. I\u0027ve only been to Kerbin and the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, he\u0027s hurtling toward the planet and quickly tries to slow his craft down via staging with chutes. He programs all his data into some mod and waits for something to happen, but nothing happens. His lander separates from the main ship and seconds later, smashes into the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOL. The look of bewilderment on his face was priceless and I got a good laugh out of it! I needed that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe seems like a nice guy, and I\u0027m sure he\u0027s a great KSP player. I just happened to catch his broadcast at an unfortunate moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it was pretty funny. I\u0027ll check it out again sometime. =)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
