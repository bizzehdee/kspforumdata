Enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbals\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals are possibly the most backwards, sideways, and upside-down space-faring species in the entire galaxy, and that\u0027s really saying something. Their primary export to the rest of the galaxy is large explosions, though frequently said explosions never escape the confines of their planet. For whatever reason, Kerbals are utterly obsessed with three things: space flight, snacks, and science. Even their solar system\u0027s naming schemes reflect this, with each planet being named for a type of scientific instrument, each moon named for a type of snack, and reportedly they\u0027ve nicknamed their sun for their local term for delta-V. If you ever encounter a Kerbal in your travels, be sure not to mention any of their favorite things unless you wish to hear them rant for hours on end about them in great detail. Should the Kerbal you meet be named Jebediah, you may as well just turn around and start running now. You might outrun the explosions that way, but don\u0027t bet on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelated Entries:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals-\u0026gt;Legends-\u0026gt;The Space Kraken\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals-\u0026gt;Legends-\u0026gt;Jebediah Kerman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals-\u0026gt;Beverages-\u0026gt;Jeb\u0027s Coffee\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals-\u0026gt;Toxic Substances-\u0026gt;Jeb\u0027s Coffee\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals-\u0026gt;Disturbing-\u0026gt;Hazing Rituals-\u0026gt;The Coffee Strainer Exercise\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals-\u0026gt;Local Lore-\u0026gt;The Kerbal Solar System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Space Kraken\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Before Kerbalkind had even understood that the depths of space were in fact a vast void of mostly nothing interspersed with the occasional mass of something, they had a legend about the night skies above. This legend was that of the Space Kraken, a fearsome beast which would consume anything trying to escape the confines of the planet Kerbin. The local lore stated that the Space Kraken was the unholy spawn of a particularly unpleasant-yet-beloved Kerbal snack called \u0022bop\u0022, which consists of dried seaweed and tree bark mixed together in a fashion that completely fails to appeal to any sort of appetite. Escaped from this nasty concoction, the Space Kraken swore revenge upon Kerbalkind for their horrible invention and departed for space. There, it would wait for Kerbals to develop space flight, and then destroy anything they sent into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The fearsome tales of the Space Kraken still exist even today, though some say that the beast was slain and that its corpse resides, in poetic fashion, on the distant Joolian moon of Bop. Others believe that the Space Kraken cannot die, and continue to fear even looking up into space, lest the Space Kraken eat their eyes out and give them \u0022star blindness\u0022. In these modern times, most Kerbals know that \u0022star blindness\u0022 is actually caused by staring at the sun with a telescope for too long, a favorite pastime of Kerbal astronomers long ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJebediah Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It\u0027s not entirely clear how one particular Kerbal became so famous, but Jebediah Kerman has become something of a symbol for his people throughout the galaxy (for good or for ill; often the latter). Relatively little is known about this particular Kerbal, save three things for certain: he owns a scrapyard that produces much of the Kerbal Space Program\u0027s equipment, he insists on piloting the first ship built in any endeavour to go into space, and he is utterly unflappable for more than 2 seconds at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Editor\u0027s Addenum: It has come to our attention that there is a fourth thing known about Jebediah Kerman which should not be omitted by any means: he is prone to causing spontaneous and quite impressive explosions which have been known to engulf entire worlds in flame for weeks. Rumors that he has been contacted by the band Sunsmasher for a job as the pyrotechnician for their next concert cannot be confirmed, but it would not surprise anyone if it happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJeb\u0027s Coffee\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Purportedly invented by Jebediah Kerman in a fit of inspiration and apoplexy, \u0022Jeb\u0027s Coffee\u0022 is actually a mixture of liquid fuel and oxidizer with a dash of monopropellant. It has been banned on over 16,000 planets throughout the galaxy, several of which have never actually even heard of what it contains. Kerbals are known to drink it during space flights, which might explain why they seem to be able to survive indefinitely within the depths of space. Jeb\u0027s Coffee has been shown to halt a large number of fundamental biological processes, including eating, digesting, sleeping, breathing, and blinking. In many species it has also been reported to be severely fatal if ingested in any quantity, although Kerbals seem to be able to drink gallons of the stuff without any ill effects. Excluding the almost total shutdown of all of their vital bodily functions of course, but strangely this does not actually inhibit them very much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Coffee Strainer Exercise\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This article has been redacted due to crimes against all life everywhere in the known universe. The actual exercise itself is somewhat more unbelievably unpleasant than what used to be written here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Kerbal Solar System\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in the mists of time, forgotten to all but a handful of Kerbals who are believed to actually be lying about their age, the Kerbal solar system was formed. It was many billions of years later that the Kerbal race actually emerged, hence the discrepancy in the claims of one Rodemy Kerman that he personally saw the birth of the sun and that it was, in his own words, \u0027pretty neat\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of questions of origin, the Kerbal solar system is formed primarily of at least 7 planets and 9 moons, although there is some debate about how accurate this count is given that Kerbals are notorious for mistaking grains of pollen, specks of dust, and other such common detritus for planets and moons as well. It was several million years before any of them actually realized that \u0027that strange floating disc in the sky\u0027 was in fact a moon, despite the fact that they had already identified several planets and moons by this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first planet that Kerbals readily identified was their closest neighbor, which they named Eve (after the ancient Kerbal tool for measuring the distance between the top of a really tall cliff and the bottom; the term roughly translates to \u0022really big rock with a wristwatch strapped to it\u0022). Its miniscule moon was dubbed Gilly, after the Kerbals\u0027 favorite snack food (a sort of gelatinous flavored substance which is believed to cause hyperactivity in young Kerbals, but actually just causes severe gilly addiction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, the Kerbals also realized that there was another planet further in from Eve, and dubbed it Moho (named for another ancient Kerbal scientific instrument that had been used in times of old to gauge how hard the wind was blowing; the term roughly translates to \u0022piece of cloth tied to a stick and jammed really hard into the ground\u0022, though strangely this is considered to be completely different in concept from a flag).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next planet and moon discovered by Kerbals, much to their shock, was in fact further away from their sun than Kerbin. Prior to this, Kerbals had long believed that Kerbin was the most distant object in their solar system, mostly because none of them wanted to actually look too closely at the night sky due to fears of \u0022star blindness\u0022. This new planet was called Duna, after the most beloved Kerbal scientific instrument of the age (which, when translated out, means \u0022really cool thing that everyone needs to have but nobody is really sure what it does\u0022; this instrument makes an awful lot of noise every few minutes and flashes very interesting light patterns, but even Kerbal scientists have yet to discover what purpose it serves in spite of having invented it themselves). Orbiting Duna was a good-sized moon, which the Kerbals named Ike (after a fatty form of snack food which Kerbals eat religiously; the Church of Ike was founded specifically for the worship of these small, round, flat discs, in fact).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter discovering that planets existed beyond Kerbin, the Kerbals then discovered that another small planet existed further out from Duna. One particularly clever Kerbal scientist decided to call it Dres, after the scientific instrument formerly used to measure water depth (which translates to \u0022extremely heavy rock with a Kerbal tied to it\u0022; use of dreses has fallen out of favor in recent years with the recent discovery of the principle of buoyancy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond Dres, a large gas giant was discovered, which surprised the heck out of the Kerbal scientific community since, according to Dr. Munbus Kerman, \u0027we were pretty sure nothing that big existed anywhere\u0027. This gas giant was named Jool, after the old scientific instrument utilized to measure the viscosity of gilly (which translates out to \u0022sticking your finger in the goop and seeing how thick it sticks to it\u0022; despite better instrumentation existing today, the use of jools to measure one\u0027s gilly viscosity remains very popular indeed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbiting Jool, it was discovered, were no less than five moons. Laythe (named for a fizzy drink that tastes almost, but not quite, entirely unlike gilly mixed with ike), Vall (a fizzy drink that tastes exactly like gilly mixed with ike), Tylo (a hard candy which tastes nothing at all like gilly or ike, but an awful lot like bop), Bop (a truly nasty combination of seaweed and tree bark which nonetheless Kerbals love to pieces), and Pol (a concentrated mixture of laythe and tylo, often used by adolescent Kerbals to play pranks on their parents by pouring it into their morning coffee).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne particularly cheeky Kerbal scientist pointed out that there was another planet even further out from Jool, and was promptly ostracized for it, as Kerbal society demands of its scientific discoveries. However, when a planet actually was found to be there, the scientist was apologized to and given a year\u0027s supply of minmus, which is also the Kerbal societal standard for this sort of thing. The planet was named Eeloo, after the long-used scientific instrument which measures the passage of time (which translates, strangely, to \u0022piece of rock tied to a string that is swung over one\u0027s head rapidly until it hits one in the face\u0022; primarily eeloos are used to pass time quickly more than they are to measure the passage of time; even though that\u0027s not what they were meant to do, they\u0027re exceedingly good at it regardless).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals then focused their attention locally, and discovered to their shock that there were in fact moons orbiting their planet. The first one discovered was named Minmus (after a form of sugary, rubbery plastic-like material that Kerbals for some reason chew when they\u0027re nervous). Perhaps most embarrassing, however, was when they realized that the large disc in the sky they always had so much trouble not looking at when trying to find other planets was in fact a moon. They promptly named it Mun, after the world-famous confectionary dessert which is comprised of sixteen layers of various seafood dipped in sugar, laythe, vall, and gilly. For reasons unknown to anyone else in the galaxy, Kerbals are very fond of making mun, even though they absolutely refuse to eat it since it tastes like sicky-sweet fish covered in seaweed and tree bark.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZingidyZongxxx","CreatedById":58363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T03:41:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is great!

Its primary use amongst primitive spacefarers is as a means of speeding one\u0027s escape from the horribly oppressive and life-giving atmosphere of the planet one finds oneself on. Its primary use amongst advanced spacefaring races is strapping them on top of one\u0027s spaceship and firing them like a missile at other nearby ships for fun.

However, one brave Kerbologist and his assistant managed to corner a Kerbal long enough to interview him on the details of Kerbal biology. The results were very disturbing and not at all fit for print, and thus the editor has taken the liberty of adjusting this article to be less outright offensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Kerbals are born from trees as fruit, and mature over the course of six weeks into full-grown adults. When they die, they release a cloud of spores which, assuming they don\u0027t explode in the depths of space or on an inhospitable world, will spread out and plant new trees for new Kerbals to be born from. This has led to a worldwide boom of the Kerbal population, a problem which is primarily addressed by launching the excess Kerbals into space under chalked-up stories of space travel. One might argue that this is not a very cost-effective means of population control, mostly because it is not, and one would find that the Kerbal government does not actually care. This is mostly because the Kerbal government consists of three dried-up pieces of seaweed tied to a tree branch which the Kerbals consult by nibbling on. If the Kerbal in question fails to keel over in pain, it is assumed that the answer was \u0022no\u0022. As this has never happened, every single decision any Kerbal makes after consulting with the government is considered to be approved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The editor would like to remind you that sections of the above paragraph had to be changed because the actual biological processes of Kerbal reproduction are quite a bit more horrifying.

These two people have, over a painstaking timespan of three days, assembled a conclusive biological origin of the Kerbals from their earliest ancestors to present. While some might question the accuracy of such results, it\u0027s highly unlikely that anyone would bother given that the species in question are so explosively inclined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The first life found on Kerbin, going by fossil records, were in fact a form of micro-bacteria which, when viewed under a microscope, greatly resemble Kerbals. (Editor\u0027s Note: The previous line has been found to be incorrect. What was actually found was a failed attempt at miniaturization by Kerbals, which they promptly buried in shame and hoped nobody would find.) The life cycle on Kerbin appears to have gone from bacterial life immediately to simple sea life, in spite of the biological improbability of this ever happening. (Editor\u0027s Note: The previous sentence is also incorrect. We actually have no idea whatsoever where life started on Kerbin, because we cannot find any life on Kerbin smaller than simple sea life.) This sea life then promptly and impossibly transformed into several species of seaweed, as well as developing into a number of varieties of insect. (Editor\u0027s Note: The previous sentence is, unsurprisingly, also completely wrong. Nobody has been able to trace back the origins of either the plant or insect life on Kerbin either.) Land-based plants, insects, and of course Kerbals, then proceeded to evolve from this sea morass by some form of magic. (Editor\u0027s Note: The previous sentence is so amazingly incorrect that we have since fired our resident Kerbologist. Applications are currently being accepted for the post. Thank you.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (Please disregard the entire previous paragraph. My predecessor was completely incapable of stringing a coherent sentence together, let alone providing useful information. I will endeavour to be more helpful.) The actual origins of the Kerbal species have recently been uncovered during an extensive two-week session excavating the actual fossil records on Kerbin. This involved actually going to Kerbin, something which the previous Kerbologist had never actually done. Having been there myself, I can now understand why; I nearly got blown up three times and was strapped to an SRB twice before I realized what was going on. Let me tell you, Kerbin is not a place you ever want to visit if you value your life or your limbs... And don\u0027t even think about ordering any of their local snacks. I tried some bop, and let me tell you, I still throw up just thinking about it. Who the heck combines seaweed with tree bark, I ask you?

We have hired back our first Kerbologist, for while he is completely wrong about everything, at least he can stay on subject.) After another two days of research, the truth about the Kerbal species origins has been uncovered! They\u0027re actually the descendants of a hyper-intelligent race of pan-dimensional beings which briefly settled on Duna before deciding that it didn\u0027t have enough life-supporting atmosphere for their tastes. The remaining handful which had not asphyxiated then migrated to Kerbin and terraformed it with their local technology, and in the process accidentally created the Kerbals. Reportedly they\u0027re currently looking for some sort of answer to the Ultimate Question of some sort. Best of luck to them in their endeavour!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (Editor\u0027s Note: It was discovered that our previous Kerbologist made everything up, just like last time. We\u0027ve re-hired the second Kerbologist, since at least he backed up his claims with actual research.) Cheeky bastards, those Guide writers, hiring me and then firing me and then hiring me right back again. Guess we know who the REAL best Kerbologist in the galaxy is, hm? That\u0027s right, me! Oh yes, they wanted me to discuss the origins of the Kerbal species. Well, I took some time during my \u0022extended vacation\u0022 from the Guide to compile more information on them by returning to Kerbin. What a miserable little planet that is! But I do like ike. It\u0027s so delicious, it\u0027s no wonder they made a religion around it. I should really bring some in to the office tomorrow. Where was I? Oh yes, the origins of the Kerbal species! According to the fossil records, which I so painstakingly compiled because I\u0027m the only one brave enough to set foot on Kerbin, TWICE no less... Actually, let me tell you a little something about how much trouble it is to set foot on Kerbin. Have you ever tried to stand on a planet that\u0027s ten times too small for its gravity level? No? Well let me tell you, it\u0027s not comfortable at all!

As such, the Editor himself has written the following after extracting the facts from our recently-fired Kerbologist over the course of a sixteen-hour rant on Kerbal annoyances.) The Kerbal fossil records show that Kerbals did not evolve at any point in the history of the planet. This is mostly because the Kerbals dug up all of the fossils they could find and ground them down into a fine powder so that they could be used as fuel for their SRBs. Their thorough campaign has eradicated all historical records for their planet, and as such, nobody will ever know the true origins of the species. Although the story about pan-dimensional beings sounds a lot more plausible now, since it seems inconceivable that any species so daft could ever evolve by chance, so let\u0027s go with that one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-07T17:45:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2013 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRender\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-07T18:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was much cooler.

But one subject nobody ever wants to broach (for good reason, as it turns out) is Kerbal religion. This is mostly because the Kerbal outlook on mythology is considered to be as far from sensical as is actually possible. However, a brave Kerbologist did manage to extract from one Bill Kerman the full theological pantheon of Kerbal religion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It should be noted that Kerbals do in fact have 3,000 distinct religions. However, 2,995 of these religions are simply offshoots from the Church of Ike, founded in protest to the addition or subtraction of various substances to the snack food of choice of this faith. As such, this article will only focus on the five primary religions of Kerbals: Ikeism, Harvestroianism, Sunshipping, Seaformistry, and the Church of Treerock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To begin with, the best-known and widest-spread Kerbal religion is that of Ikeism. Roughly 65% of all Kerbals (occasionally as much as 75% when the space program is taking a break from launching recruits into outer space) worship the fatty snack food known as ike. The actual tenets of Ikeism remain something of a mystery to non-Kerbal and Kerbal alike, as there are no actual texts for this faith. This is assumed to be the primary reason why there are so many divergent branches of Ikeism. The one consistent belief amongst all branches of Ikeism is that ike is really tasty, however. While some variants insist that ike must be eaten in strict moderation, others that it should be not eaten at all, and most that it should be eaten constantly, no Kerbal seems to want to establish a branch of Ikeism which states that ike is actually not really all that great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The main reason why, of course, is that ike hate is the explicit dominion of the Church of Treerock. This particular sect is dedicated to the worship of bop, and fears the mythical Space Kraken above all else. A very penitent faith, the Church of Treerock insists that all technological advances are evil and will draw the ire of the Space Kraken, and that Kerbals are best suited to simple practices with technologies derived from rocks and trees instead of modern scientific instruments. Prior to the discovery of the Mun and Minmus, the Church of Treerock was very popular, and almost every Kerbal was a member. When it was discovered that the long-standing belief of held by the Church\u0027s higher-ups that the Mun was a piece of moldy cheese was in fact incorrect and that the Mun was a moon, however, membership declined severely. Today the adherents of the Church of Treerock mostly spend their time in the mountains eating bop and being miserable, as most Kerbals did in the times before space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Harvestroianism is the second-most-popular Kerbal religion, mostly because the majority of Kerbals not part of Ikeism don\u0027t want anything to do with the Church of Treerock and aren\u0027t really that crazy about ike. This particular belief system holds that the entirety of the Kerbal solar system is a computer program devised by hyper-intelligent pan-galactic beings, and that Kerbals came to be after these beings vacationed on Duna and decided they\u0027d like to make a proper intelligent species. The vast majority of Harvestroianists follow this faith simply because membership guarantees one asylum from the Kerbal Space Program\u0027s test pilot programs due to a conflict of belief and goals. Harvestroianists believe very strongly in not killing oneself in the pursuit of space, while killing oneself in the pursuit of space is the charter goal of the Kerbal Space Program. In spite of this, a number of Harvestroianists are members of KSP Ground Control, mostly because they\u0027re the only Kerbals who actually know how to operate any of the spaceships which Kerbals launch so frequently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Sunshipping is by far the most primitive of all Kerbal religions, and has had its membership drastically reduced with the advent of space flight. The Sunshippers believe that the sun is the source of all life on Kerbin, and that their ultimate goal should be to get closer to the sun. Sunshippers are thus very keen to offer up their services as test pilots for Kerbal Space Program missions involving launches into the sun. The remaining surviving members are reportedly actively recruiting under the sanction of KSP itself, mostly because the Kerbal population is seen to be too large and throwing Kerbals into the sun is an expensive-yet-convenient way of correcting this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The final faith of Kerbalkind is Seaformistry, and it holds the distinction of being the only faith which is held by exactly one Kerbal. Decsis Kerman believes that all life on Kerbin is actually an illusion caused by giant hologram generators found at the bottom of the sea on Laythe. His provocative letters concerning how the Kerbal government has secretly implanted all of the brains of Kerbalkind with special antennae that are beamed instructions from synthetic brains stored in cities on the far side of Pol are seen as quaint and amusing, but taken seriously by none. An expedition to the far side of Pol is nonetheless listed on the Kerbal Space Program itinerary, \u0022just in case\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-07T21:36:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2013 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRender\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T05:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell worth the read.
