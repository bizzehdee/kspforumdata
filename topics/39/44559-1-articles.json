I\u0027ve been working for a few weeks to design and assemble some hardware for Duna. The idea is to be able to establish a temporary base, mine it for kethane which I can burn or refine on the surface or launch to an orbital refinery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the construction it became clear that these craft would not be able to land by conventional means. So, I have devised three none standard landing schemes that would be fun to watch succeed or fail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already delivered everything to orbit so it is just time to bring these things out of the sky on and onto the rusty red surface.
