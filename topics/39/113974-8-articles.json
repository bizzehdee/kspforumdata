After many hours, the people seemed to have finally gotten their fill of her, and were now milling about aimlessly, pointing and staring at the various sights around the Space Center. \n\nA tremendous roar went up from the crowd as an aircraft thundered past overhead, its engines shaking the ground, a thin trail of white smoke following behind. It pulled up abruptly, pirouetting about its own axis several times before flying back the way it came, inverted. \n\n\u0022Let\u0027s get a big round of applause for Kerbonaut Jorrigh Kerman demonstrating the Kr\u00FCnian-built Oskar EW-5894 *Fleischgewehr* advanced trainer!\u0022 An announcer echoed over the loudspeakers, \u0022but keep your cameras out, folks, we\u0027ve got a big surprise coming up for you in just a few minutes!\u0022\n\nThe crowd obliged on both counts, Valentina just took a deep breath as another drop of sweat plopped into her left eye. How did these people *live* like this? Sure, people grumbled about the humid Ussari summers but that was *nothing* like this! She hadn\u0027t stopped sweating since she\u0027d arrived, even with seemingly every building of any size having air conditioning. Which was also strange. And this sun... she could feel it searing her skin just standing here!\n\nStill... it hadn\u0027t been all bad, so far. Saying her goodbyes to Igor and Junior Lieutenant Kerman had gone fairly smoothly, even if the good Junior Lieutenant *had* looked as if he was about to jump ship and claim asylum for a moment. But ultimately, he had decided that several hours trapped in a confined space with an aerophobic behemoth was less daunting than pledging allegiance to a fruit-filled confection. Hmm, she was going to have to ask someone about that bit, too. \n\nThe speakers echoed once more, \u0022ladies and gentlekerbs, Kerblings of all ages! The Kerbal Space Administration is proud to bring you the shining pinnacle of aviation! Please turn your eyes skyward and welcome Captain D.N. Kerman flying the Layland L-1011 spaceplane!\u0022\n\nA hush drew over the crowd. With everyone else, Valentina looked up, straining her keen eyes. Nothing to see but clouds and--\n\nIn an instant, something black and pointy flashed by silently overhead. The shockwave came a moment later, scattering anything not held tightly and nearly lifting Valentina clear off the ground.\n\n\u0022How \u0027bout that sonic boom!\u0022 The announcer gushed. Valentina was holding her head, wondering if she had permanent hearing damage now. Bizarrely, the rest of the crowd just seemed amused. The dark, vaguely triangular shape shot up into the sky at an incredible rate of speed, long bluish trails of fire spitting from its engines.\n\n\u0022This cutting edge design from the good folks at Layland Heavy Industries has already distinguished its self as the fastest aircraft ever made, and the first to fly into space and return in one piece. Mostly. Watch Captain D.N. as he makes a low pass over the water!\u0022\n\nStraining to see over the other people, Valentina raised up on the tips of her toes but could see nothing but necks and hair. Was *this* the new KSA spacecraft? That didn\u0027t seem likely, they weren\u0027t exactly being secretive about it.\n\n\u0022Lookit that rooster tail! The L-1011\u0027s afterburning propellium engines can send it to the edge of space and beyond on their own, but this bird is packing one extra punch over the L-1010 model!\u0022\n\nAgain the sleek form raced upwards, then circled the Space Center and turned back for another pass over the crowd. Just as it flew over the launch pad, a tremendous explosion rocked the ground, Valentina could feel the heat from the blast on her face, then she saw the aircraft shoot skyward on a pillar of fire.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s all perfectly safe, folks, the L-1011\u0027s hypergolic rocket engine runs on fuels that are nearly harmless to Kerbals!\u0022\n\nValentina put a hand to her face. These people really were quite mad. At least dinner last night had been... pleasant, if a bit awkward. It had been just her and the KSA Kerbonauts, the \u0027cargo,\u0027 as that obnoxious *P\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI* had put it. That gorgeous, dimpled *P\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI*. Being little more than cargo, that she could relate to. But there had been no mention of the incident, just pleasant conversation she\u0027d only struggled a little to keep up with. \n\nEdmund had regaled them with thrilling tales of his time flying rescue missions for the Kleptogart Coast Guard. Jorrigh had spoken candidly about his own time in space, and once Valentina had begun comparing notes the exchange had quickly broken down into a bizarre hodgepodge of broken languages and emphatic hand gestures that amused everyone to no end. It had been an odd path from the deserts of Gerin to the Kerbal Space Center for Jerdous, as he had explained, and Burdous just spent most the time pouting, when he wasn\u0027t threatening people with a soup spoon, which was also odd. \n\nSpeaking of soup, the meal had been quite pleasant, too. Some things had been familiar, some things not, but Valentina had eaten heartily. She hadn\u0027t the heart to tell the chef about the borscht, though, he had obviously tried very hard. But it just wasn\u0027t the same without beets. Finally, with a full belly and feeling quite optimistic, she had retired to a room that looked very much like her room back at the Cosmodrome, and slept the sleep of the utterly exhausted. \n\nAnd then today happened. \n\nAbove, three aircraft shrieked by in tight formation while the announcer prattled on. \n\nValentina was used to bureaucracy, the Union ran on it, but she had expected this place to be... different, somehow. Instead, it seemed like *everyone* needed her to sign something here! First was the immigration and customs paperwork, then nondisclosure agreements, safety wavers, and very formal diplomatic documents that used as many words as possible to say absolutely nothing. That was all well and good, but the *people!*\n\nIt had started last night, just the odd request here or there, but today with the crowds it had come in a torrential wave after the speeches and ceremonies. They were all *very* polite about it, of course, but it had been long hours of slow moving lines. Everyone wanted her to sign *some*thing, pictures of herself, mostly, but also books with lots of other signatures, a myriad of merchandise from something called a \u0027gift shop,\u0027 and one very odd fellow who wanted her to sign his--\n\nValentina shuddered, despite the baking sun. She\u0027d been sure to wash her hands very thoroughly after that. And burnt the pen. \n\nNow, the flow seemed to have ebbed, and she found herself mostly alone and unnoticed among this jostling crowd of sweaty bodies. This whole \u0027open house\u0027 affair was really quite strange, its self. All these people just wandering around the Space Center with almost no supervision! The more sensitive places were simply roped off, and there didn\u0027t seem to be any crowd control squads at all, just ordinary police officers zipping about in their strange little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s. And with the near-constant barrage of high-performance aircraft streaking by overhead, she thought the whole thing must be some sort of thinly veiled display of martial prowess. \n\nThe doors to the familiar-looking \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E stood open, and Burdous\u0027s rocket inside, well... it just looked quite tiny in the massive building. Valentina had never had a good look at any of the Foreigners\u0027 rockets before today, all the film she had seen was grainy or blurry. Seeing it now, the same design that had launched Sir Kerman and poor Edmund... she thought it might be the *ugliest* thing she had *ever* seen. Not at all like the sleek, modern Ussari rockets. It almost looked like it had been cobbled together from junk one might find lying by the side of the road. And why would they need such a huge building to support it?\n\nThe KSA was also expanding, that\u0027s what someone had said. If the Kommissar wanted her to uncover information on a new and presumably larger spacecraft, it would presumably need a larger launcher as well, she supposed. But, from what *else* she\u0027d heard, the KSA wasn\u0027t having much luck with that part at all. One thing they *did* seem to have no trouble with, was recruiting new Kerbonauts. The lower floors of their Kerbonaut Center had been practically crawling with young, slightly bewildered faces last night, while the top ones were nearly empty. It did seem like quite the production, but what could they be up to, being so far behind the Union in actual technology? In fact--\n\nSomething tugged on her pant leg. \n\nValentina looked down into an enormous pair of bright, intense eyes. Hiding behind the eyes was a tiny face. \n\n\u0022Aw you da thpathekerb?\u0022 Said the face.\n\n\u0022Um...\u0022 Valentina mumbled, trying to translate.\n\nA tiny hand tugged on her pant leg again, \u0022my bwudda\u0027s gonna be a thpathekerb.\u0022\n\nShe didn\u0027t have much experience with Kerblings, how was she supposed to respond again? \u0022Well... isn\u0027t that...\u0022\n\n\u0022\u0027E gonna go up inna thpathe an bwing me back a M\u00FCnwock.\u0022\n\nThe face nodded very solemnly, \u0022\u0027e *pwomithed*.\u0022\n\nWhat was it one was supposed to do with children again? Give them candy or some such? The Kerblet seemed to be expecting some sort of response. Valentina was saved from any further contemplation of her complete lack of maternal instinct, however, as a voice rose over the din of the crowd.\n\n\u0022Anna? Anna?!\u0022\n\nThe horde parted before her and a figure suddenly emerged, \u0022*Anastasia Kerman!*\u0022\n\nIn a single fluid motion, the figure, who sported a towering cylindrical hairdo and gaudy cat eye sunglasses nearly as wide as it was tall, swooped the little Kerbling up into her arms, \u0022how many times have I told you not to go wandering off like that, you little dickens!\u0022 She tickled the little one\u0027s belly eliciting a happy squeal.\n\nValentina had thought it was perhaps a trick of perspective at first, but no, the child\u0027s eyes really *were* that large. She pointed a tiny finger at Valentina now.\n\n\u0022Thpathekerb, mummy!\u0022\n\n\u0022Who? Oh. Oh! *Oh!*\u0022 The mother clapped the unoccupied hand to her cheek, \u0022ohmigarsh it really *is* you! Oh my, oh my, such an honor miss Kermaniva!\u0022\n\nKermaniva?\n\nValentina smiled warmly, and opened her mouth to reply, but the strange lady spun around and emitted a sound that could challenge a Converter in both volume *and* shrillness, \u0022Herb? Herb?! Herb! Get *over* here! It\u0027s *her*!\u0022\n\n\u0022Coming dumpling,\u0022 came a weak, placating voice. The crowd parted again and another figure emerged. Only a moment ago, Valentina had thought this lady\u0027s voice was the only thing that could rival a Converter for loudness, but this fellow\u0027s *shirt* would have far exceeded that, the grotesque jumble of colors likely would have burned the eyes right out of her sockets had it not been mostly covered by enough camera equipment to survey a small planet. \n\n\u0022Yes, pumpkin?\u0022 The owner of the unfortunate shirt said.\n\n\u0022Look, Herb, it\u0027s *her*, that Ooski spacekerb lady, get a picture!\u0022 She of the tall hair and hideous sunglasses pronounced in a slightly less shrill tone.\n\n\u0022Well Illbedarned, so it is!\u0022 He raised the monstrosity around his neck, which revealed its self to be but a single camera sprouting lenses and flashes like black plastic tentacles, \u0022say cheeeeeeeeeesedoodles!\u0022\n\nThe mother sidled up next to Valentina and held the child up between them.\n\n\u0022Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesedoodles!\u0022\n\nValentina was never quite sure exactly what happened next. She thought she might have witnessed the birth of a new star or perhaps a the death of an old one. The entire world disappeared into brilliant, blinding light in a cacophony of clicks and pops. As the light faded, afterimages of strange colors and shapes remained burned into her retinas as the bizarre family continued their exchange oblivious to her blind groping.\n\n\u0022Herb, have you seen the boys lately?\u0022\n\n\u0022Gosh, Schnookums, no, not since Ed said they they were going to take that load of bags from the gift shop back to their room.\u0022\n\n\u0022Blah, all the way back to that Kerbonaut building? I \u0027spose we should we go find them, then, it\u0027s stickier than a RatSquirrelFish\u0027s tush out here, dontchaknow!\u0022\n\n\u0022Right you are, Loviedumplins!\u0022\n\n\u0022Come on sweetie, let\u0027s go find your big brother.\u0022\n\n\u0022Biwwy!\u0022\n\nThe voices soon disappeared back into the greater bedlam, leaving Valentina to rub her aching eyes and contemplate her likely permanent blindness alone. Her eyesight returned in time, mostly, annoying electric floaters still persisting everywhere she looked. Somehow, she had blundered along to a large roped off area just in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. A growing press behind her stalled any thought of going elsewhere, as the loudspeakers once again echoed to life.\n\n\u0022We\u0027d like to thank all you folks for coming out here today to welcome our incoming class of Kerbonauts and to see all that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E has to offer. For our grand finale, please give a warm round of applause for world-famous daredevil Ebil Kerneival performing his signature stunt: skydiving without a parachute!\u0022\n\nWait, *what?!*\n\nThe crowd sent up a tremendous cheer as high above a small plane droned into view. As Valentina watched, a small, Kerbal-shaped form fell from it in a frilly white suit. A drumroll thudded out from the speakers, and the the cheer became a hush, the form plunging toward the heat-shimmers of the concrete below. Valentina stood transfixed, unable to look away from the tragedy about to unfold. The figure foundered, tumbled for a moment, then landed squarely on its helmeted head and *bounced*.\n\nShe gasped. The white-clad figure landed again, and was still. Murmurs began to ripple through the spectators. \n\nThen the figure popped up and waved, albeit a bit unsteadily. \n\n\u0022I\u0027m ok!\u0022 It said in an equally unsteady voice, and the crowd exploded into cheers.\n\n\u0022Never underestimate the impact tolerance of the Kerbal head! Ebil Kerneival, everyone! Thanks again for coming out to see us and everyone have a safe drive home!\u0022\n\nValentina stood in the roaring crowd, feeling quite dazed herself. These people weren\u0027t just mad, they were positively *crazy!*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-11T23:17:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2020 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T09:15:19Z","Content":"\\*deafening applause\\*\n\nAnd that, right there, is a chapter written by somebody having a ton of fun doing it!

He and Valentina stepped out into High Bay One, a significant if otherwise unremarkable distance above the floor of the VAB. Just ahead, a pair of technicians in white coveralls were having a very animated conversation with a large white helmet sticking out of a very small hatch in a conical shape. \n\n\u0022I know, but battery three keeps dropping too low. We\u0027re going to have to pull the entire buss and bench check it, something must\u0027ve got borked on the install,\u0022 said the still unseen owner of the helmet.\n\n\u0022If you say so, chief, but that\u0027s gonna delay the rollout,\u0022 said one of the technicians. \n\n\u0022You just get the buss pulled, *I\u0027ll* handle the tests, we can get this pig back together before third shift,\u0022 said the helmet. \n\n\u0022Afternoon, Burd,\u0022 Gene said with just a hint of extra amicability, \u0022buss B still being a pain?\u0022\n\n\u0022I knew it was gonna bite us to update the electrical subsystems this late in the game,\u0022 came the voice from the helmet, \u0022it\u0027s causing more problems than it was supposed to fix!\u0022\n\n\u0022We can come back later if you\u0027re busy with the capsule...\u0022 \n\n\u0022Huh?\u0022 The helmet twisted awkwardly around, revealing a familiar unhappy face whose eyes locked onto Valentina, \u0022oh, it\u0027s *you*. Playing tour guide again, Gene? That\u0027s all right, I was just leaving.\u0022\n\nThe helmet wiggled around again, then popped loose, \u0022here, Burbles.\u0022\n\nThe other technician took the helmet, and stepped back. Burdous thrust one arm through the narrow hatch, then the other, then began a sinuous wriggling motion, slowly emerging from the tiny space like some sort of bulbous, oddly graceful insect emerging from a cocoon. Valentina could only stare in awe.\n\nHe stepped up to her and thrust a space-mitten at her, \u0022don\u0027t touch *anything*, got it?\u0022 then moved to a nearby workbench and began stripping out of his pressure suit. \n\nGene looked mortified but nodded to Valentina, \u0022go on, have a look. Everything\u0027s on the table, remember?\u0022\n\nValentina glared at the obnoxious spacekerb for a moment, then gingerly crouched and stuck her head inside the capsule, careful not to touch *anything*. Once again she stared in awe. Nightmarish, claustrophobic awe. The capsule didn\u0027t look that bad from *outside*, but the *inside* was completely filled with equipment. She thought even *she*, with her small frame, would have trouble squeezing into it, even without a bulky pressure suit. \n\n\u0022You go to space two days like this?\u0022 She looked at Burdous, \u0022you are brave Kerbal.\u0022\n\nHe sneered back at her, \u0022well *some* of us don\u0027t need luxury to get our jobs done.\u0022\n\nValentina frowned, she hadn\u0027t meant it like *that*, \u0022we have no luxury, we put equipment on service module, no need for land. Sphere is better use of space, also. This like, what is word? Sardine can.\u0022\n\nSurprisingly, Burdous turned to Gene, \u0022there, you see? I told you we should have gone with the Spud.\u0022\n\n\u0022A bit late for that old argument, isn\u0027t it Burd?\u0022 He sighed. \n\n\u0022I\u0027m just saying,\u0022 Burdous said, hanging his pressure suit on a rack, \u0022there\u0027s a reason these Ooskies are putting twenty tonnes at a go into orbit and we\u0027re still struggling with *five*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Not the time, Burdous.\u0022\n\n\u0022That\u0027s fine, I\u0027m done,\u0022 he turned to the technicians, \u0022Burbles, I\u0027m gonna hit up the little Kerb\u0027s room then grab us some coffee, page me when you\u0027ve got that buss out.\u0022\n\n\u0022Right, chief,\u0022 the other fellow said, not looking up as he began unscrewing panels. Burdous disappeared into the elevator. \n\nGene turned to Valentina with a worn look, \u0022again, I\u0027m sorry about that.\u0022\n\nValentina looked thoughtfully toward the elevator, \u0022he is like D.N., yes? Big wash bag?\u0022\n\n\u0022Wash bag?\u0022 Gene blinked, \u0022oh you mean d-ouch, my shin!\u0022 A small rock bounced off the wall, fell through the floor grating, then pinged its way down through the rafters and uprights.\n\n\u003Cbonk\u003E \u0022\u003Cem\u003EOw!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u003C/bonk\u003E\n\nHe looked up from rubbing his leg, \u0022anyway, Burdous, he\u0027s... selective. That sort of comes along with genius, I\u0027ve found. You have to find a way to relate to him on *his* level. You might be surprised how loyal he can be, once you do.\u0022\n\nValentina again looked to the elevator, \u0022indeed...\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, we probably shouldn\u0027t pester the crew if they\u0027re working on the capsule. I\u0027ll show you the launch pad and fueling systems next, their crews should probably be clocking off shortly...\u0022  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nGene did make for an amusing tour guide, Valentina thought as they made their way down through the bowels of the building. She had finally realized why everything seemed so familiar here, it was because it *was*. The layout of the Space Center, even the general architecture, was nearly identical to the Cosmodrome. She had the thought that if she could cut down through the concrete pavement and measure the thickness, even that would be the same. But the similarities ended there. Everything about the Cosmodrome was ordered and mechanical, but this place... it seemed like chaos lurked just beneath the surface, like a dead log covering a nest of rotbeetles that would writhe and scatter if exposed. The Kerbonaut Center... the aircraft facilities... the Administration building... everywhere she had been today, she could *feel* it. People running around busily, but somehow oblivious to it. \n\n*Oblivious? Or just... \u003Cu\u003Eaccepting?\u003C/u\u003E*\n\nShe pushed the thought away, as they stepped out into the late afternoon sun. Gene... he looked very tired. Somehow, she suspected, he always looked like that. But... she had her own job to do, too. \n\n\u0022...so the pipelines come in from the tankers off shore, they never even have to dock, and the propellium goes right into those big storage tanks there,\u0022 Gene pointed as they walked outside, \u0022all triple-walled, ridiculously strong. The fueling crews come from Exast, of course, no one knows the industry better. I\u0027ll introduce you if we get a chance.\u0022\n\nBurdous had said something about their rockets having trouble, but... how to broach the subject... diplomatically...\n\n\u0022Um, tell me, Gene... Mr. Burdous, he say the rockets have trouble...\u0022\n\nGene looked at her quizzically. \n\nNope, that wasn\u0027t the way. How about...\n\nShe smiled and gestured toward the towering VAB, \u0022is very large building for so small...\u0022 and winced. \n\nAfter thinking for a moment, Gene\u0027s shoulders fell just a hair, \u0022full disclosure, right? Well it\u0027s... complicated. The Rockomax Conglomerate has been our primary contractor ever since the pre-KSA days when J--\u0022 \n\nHe seemed to choke on his breath for an instant, \u0022...when... spaceflight first seemed possible. They\u0027ve built nearly all our launch vehicles.\u0022\n\n\u0022When... J--?\u0022 Valentina asked curiously. \n\n\u0022We, um, we don\u0027t talk about that. It\u0027s also... complicated. Anyway, Rockomax has had some, er, delays, producing an uprated launcher. In the mean time, Layland\u0027s been courting us pretty heavily. That\u0027s why J.R.\u0027s here. They financed this whole facility in exchange for the KSA handling the flight operations and systems management of their spaceplane program.\u0022\n\n\u0022Did someone say spaceplane?\u0022\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419S \u0417\u0414\u042FS*, not *this* one again.\n\n\u0022Afternoon, Dean, fellas,\u0022 Gene said with a grin.\n\nThe pilots had again managed to arrange themselves like they were in a publicity photo, \u0022you were just about to tell the Ooski here that five of the last six Rocko-klutz test launches failed, right? And the sixth failed *spectacularly?*\u0022\n\nGene\u0027s jaw clenched before he spoke, \u0022that\u0027s a matter of public record, I\u0027m sure they know.\u0022\n\n\u0022And yet the Widowmaker sets records *every time* she flies, or at least every time *I* fly her,\u0022 D.N. said, flashing another winning smirk.\n\n\u0022There\u0027s a reason it\u0027s *called* the Widowmaker, Dean,\u0022 Gene said flatly.\n\nWhy did they tolerate such insubordination here? Whatever the situation was, this *P\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI*\u0027s behavior was just not proper! Valentina stepped up to him, noting he seemed taller today.\n\n\u0022Your plane has put how much in orbit, how you say, fly-boy?\u0022\n\nHis expression darkened. Even his sneer was gorgeous.\n\n\u0022You need to remember who you\u0027re talking to, girlie!\u0022 He poked a finger at her. \n\n*Girlie?!* Valentina resisted the urge to see how far back she could bend that finger before he noticed.\n\n\u0022In my country, Kerb have respect for superior,\u0022 she glanced down, \u0022and he does not wear high heel.\u0022\n\n\u0022They\u0027re elevator shoes!\u0022 D.N.\u0027s voice cracked with rage as he took a step toward her. \n\n\u0022*Dean...*\u0022 Gene now stepped up, a hint of something dangerous in his eyes. \n\nD.N. held his stare, and spoke without breaking it, \u0022come on boys, let\u0027s hit the highway.\u0022\n\n\u0022To the danger zone?\u0022 Waterfowl offered helpfully. \n\nD.N. turned to him, \u0022what? No! What kind of ridiculous response is that?\u0022 He looked at the rest of them, \u0022c\u0027mon!\u0022 Then they stalked off in formation. \n\nGene sighed, \u0022I\u0027m--\u0022\n\n\u0022--sorry about that, yes, this I know,\u0022 Valentina stared after the others. \n\nHe put a grateful hand on her shoulder, \u0022so where was I? Oh, the launch pad, I\u0027ll--\u0022\n\nAn explosion suddenly rumbled the ground from the direction of the research center, followed immediately by a \u0022woohoo!\u0022\n\n\u0022Heads up!\u0022 Yelled a nearby worker.\n\n\u0022*Line drive!*\u0022 Screamed another. Gene grabbed Valentina and pulled her to the ground just as something sparked once, twice, across the pavement then embedded its self in the nearby wall of the VAB, a tiny flame still burning on one end. \n\n\u0022All clear!\u0022 Came a third voice. \n\nGene sighed once again, pulled himself and Valentina up, then stepped over to the jagged metal something jutting out of the wall. \n\n\u0022Y\u0027know what?\u0022 He said, blowing out the tiny fire, \u0022that\u0027s enough touring for one day. C\u0027mon, I know just where to blow off some steam.\u0022\n\nValentina gaped at him in horror, \u0022blow off?! Even for rocket center, is too much blow off here!\u0022\n\n\u0022What? Oh, it\u0027s a just a figure of speech, nothing dangerous there. Well, not usually.\u0022\n\nGene quickly requisitioned one of a small fleet of open-air vehicles parked by every building at the Space Center, Valentina thought they were called \u0027golf carts.\u0027 It seems people here really *did* drive everywhere, it was very strange. He drove them to a clump of low, stucco-covered domes at a far edge of the facility, parking in a lot already filled with an absurd collection of kars, each one seemingly trying to outdo the next with its own ridiculous collection of nonsensical tail fins and bubble canopies. Before they even reached the door, Valentina could hear raised voices and pulsing baseline thrumming from within. There was a sign over the door in some sort of writing far too stylized for her to read, featuring a carving of a bizarre looking reptilian creature. \n\n\u0022Welcome,\u0022 Gene raised a hand, \u0022to the \u0027Grieving Burrick,\u0027 the finest non-alcoholic bar east of... well, pretty much anywhere.\u0022\n\nValentina wrinkled her brow, \u0022non-alcoholic?\u0022\n\n\u0022No alcohol allowed on the Center grounds,\u0022 he said, \u0022besides, you really wouldn\u0027t want to get a crowd like this liquored up.\u0022\n\nFrom inside there was a crash, and then a cheer. Valentina eyed the door uncertainly. \n\n\u0022*You* should be all right,\u0022 Gene pressed a hand against it, \u0022only watch your step, this place can be a little rough.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, yes yes, I know of this,\u0022 she smiled, \u0022is wretched hive of scum and villainy, no?\u0022\n\nGene paused, and put a thoughtful hand to his chin, \u0022well, not really, they\u0027re pretty decent folks, it\u0027s just... Well, you\u0027ll see.\u0022\n\nHe opened the door, and they descended into darkness.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-19T08:27:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2016 08:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T08:39:01Z","Content":"... and because the old .25 save that started all this still runs, the latest in KSA technology:\n\n![oQldY5Z.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/oQldY5Z.png?1) ![67WmpF8.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/67WmpF8.png?1)"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T09:25:29Z","Content":"The Grieving Burrick sounds like a place that would have something akin to the Cubi Point Catapult.

The hapless Kerbal\u0027s panicked eyes darted back and forth while he held the microphone up as a futile shield. The jeers grew a moment more, then a long crook reached out from off stage, hooked the poor fellow around the neck, and quickly removed him before he could cause any more aural damage. \n\n\u0022Ferfry, everyone!\u0022 a rather familiar sounding deejay announced, \u0022give him a big hand.... and maybe he\u0027ll promise never to do that again.\u0022\n\nThe crowd complied with laughter and half-hearted applause. Valentina could only stare with a vague sense of bewilderment and horror. The odd little building was apparently quite a bit bigger on the inside. An expansive main floor below the entrance seated perhaps two hundred Kerbals at an assortment of tables, the stage was set into an alcove flanked by large monitors to the left, and the bar its self ran along the opposite wall, its extravagantly carved shelves showcasing an incredible variety of... not liquor, secured behind thick glass. From the ceiling hung an equally incredible variety of aircraft: mostly models, a few realistic-looking parts here and there, and a very, *very* realistic looking space capsule over the center of the bar, complete with scorch marks on its heat shield and flanks. \n\nBelow in the sea of bodies, Valentina could see clumps and groups of virtually every division of the space center. White-clad technicians, their scrubs in various states of removal, maintenance crews in their dungarees, the button-down shirts and loosened ties of the engineers and administrators, scientists, who insisted on wearing their lab coats even here, and of course the largest cadre, the cadets in their pale blue jumpsuits. \n\nThe sheer number of them had surprised Valentina shortly after her arrival, and all so *young*. Before she left home, the first triad of the \u0022New Nine\u0022 Ussari Kerbonauts had arrived, not old by any means but all well-seasoned in their fields. These cadets looked barely out of secondary school, and if her few interactions thus far were any indication, selection standards were just a bit... generous. Gene had said the Administration wanted them young and malleable, the rest of their education and training funded by this Layland Heavy Industries again. Not all would go on to be Kerbonauts, of course, they would be engineers and scientists and mechanics. And janitors. A space program still needed janitors. There *was* a certain kind of sense to it, Valentina noted, but it was all so strange! She also noted, with a bit of satisfaction, that the ratio of females was much higher among them, too. But why--\n\n\u0022Come say hi to Ol\u0027 Sam,\u0022 Gene suddenly snapped her out of her ponderings, \u0022I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be anxious to meet you too.\u0022 Gene led the way through a stream of patrons and bustling waitresses to the middle of the bar below the space capsule, where a wrinkled old Kerb with a bushy handlebar mustache and vest a bit more impressive than Gene\u0027s was busy polishing a glass. \n\n\u0022Well now, Gene Kerman! Bit of an odd night seeing *you* in here,\u0022 the bartender said with an enormous smile. \n\n\u0022Bit of an odd day, Sam,\u0022 Gene replied, \u0022I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve yet--\u0022\n\n\u0022My stars...\u0022 The old fellow said softly as his eyes fell on Valentina, \u0022if\u0027n it ain\u0027t the lady \u0027erself.\u0022\n\n\u0022Is pleasure to meet you, mister Sam, she began, offering a hand. \n\n\u0022Oi, now, none o\u0027 that, \u0027s never been anythin\u0027 but Ol\u0027 Sam... even when I weren\u0027t so ol\u0027,\u0022 he said with a wink. \n\nThen to Valentina\u0027s great surprise, he took her hand and lightly kissed the back of it, \u0022sure if\u0027n I ain\u0027t charmed as a school lad t\u0027 make yer acquaintance, mum.\u0022\n\nShe felt warm color rush to her cheeks, and blurted out the first thing that came to her mind, \u0022what... what is this place?\u0022\n\n\u0022The finest karaoke bar this side of... well also pretty much anywhere,\u0022 Gene answered. \n\nValentina\u0027s lips moved just slightly as she turned the unfamiliar word over in her mind, \u0022but... the Kerb, he did not carry key, he very off key. Sound like yak in heat.\u0022\n\nOl\u0027 Sam slapped a hand to his mouth and tried to conceal a snicker, \u0022quite the wit, this one.\u0022\n\nGene shot him a look, then explained, \u0022well, that\u0027s sort of the point. What better way for a bunch of engineers, scientists, and pilots like this to relax after a long day than to ridicule each other\u0027s complete tone deafness?\u0022\n\nValentina stared blankly at him, \u0022you are very strange people.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yar, that they are, mum, that they are,\u0022 Ol\u0027 Sam said with that same endearing wink, \u0022best ye not tarry too long, Gene, \u0027fore it gets stranger still.\u0022\n\nAs Valentina paused yet again trying to decode Ol\u0027 Sam\u0027s odd accent, a display on the wall behind him caught her eye. In a case of *very* thick glass, surrounded by more space-like memorabilia, was a pyramid of photographs of people she recognized. Sir Kerman was at the top, followed by Jorrigh and D.N., with more open spots on the next rows. Big block letters at the top spelled out \u0027WALL OF FAME,\u0027 but... who was that fellow *above* Sir Kerman? In the picture was a Kerbal  with short-cropped hair that had begun to recede just a bit, bright, wondering eyes, and a beguiling smile holding a dated-looking pressure helmet. \n\n\u0022This Kerb in photo,\u0022 she pointed, \u0022who is he?\u0022\n\nOl\u0027 Sam\u0027s constant smile ran away from his face, \u0022now, we don\u0027t talk \u0027bout \u0027im, mum. Bad memories, that.\u0022\n\nBefore she could respond, Gene broke in, \u0022er, so this old bar\u0027s been in your family for generations, *right* Sam?\u0022\n\n\u0022Yar, that it \u0027as,\u0022 and just like that the smile was back, \u0022brought o\u0027er brick b\u0027 brick by me ol\u0027 da\u0027 from Suth\u0027Mork back when I was a lad.\u0022\n\nValentina kept a polite smile, but wondered. These people were indeed very strange, but perhaps not all that different, it would seem. There were things even here that... this, we do not speak of. But there were no political officers to monitor such things, or at least none that she had seen. Why would--\n\nA sudden chorus of voices from down on the main floor drew her attention, \u0022Gene!\u0022\n\nGene waved back to the Kerbonauts, who were waiting at a table down near the front and securing an extra pair of chairs. \n\n\u0022So what\u0027s yer poison tonight, then, eh?\u0022 Ol\u0027 Sam asked.\n\nGene gave Valentina a considering look for a moment, then replied, \u0022make it a round of witch\u0027s toots, Sam.\u0022\n\n\u0022Comin\u0027 roit up,\u0022 a serving tray appeared on the bar, followed by a hexagon of short glasses. Then a bottle, followed by another and another and another, each deftly twirled through the air and caught with a muted clink, depositing a dram of liquid in each glass without so much as a drop being spilled. A final bottle spun higher than all the others... only to be caught a centimeter above Ol\u0027 Sam\u0027s hand by Gene. \n\n\u0022Uh-uh. The *good* stuff,\u0022 he said with a smirk.\n\n\u0022Nothin\u0027 gets by you, Gene,\u0022 Sam smirked back as he turned and retrieved an ornate bottle from another especially thick glass case. A final aerial flourish and splash of liquid, then he produced a bucket spilling thick, white fog from behind the bar. Tongs were tossed up into the air, caught behind his back, then plink, plink, plink, plink, plink, plink. Valentina stared in awe at the six glowing, bubbling, billowing green drinks.\n\n\u0022\u0027Arf dozen witch\u0027s toots, with the *good* stuff,\u0022 the old publican winked. \n\n\u0022Thanks, Sam,\u0022 Gene said, taking the tray, \u0022put it on my tab.\u0022\n\n\u0022Now would that be the tab yer still ain\u0027t paid since ye first walked in here three years hence?\u0022\n\n\u0022No, the other one.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yer ain\u0027t paid that one, neither.\u0022\n\nGene just smiled, motioning to Valentina as he beat a hasty retreat toward the table. Three hands and a scowl were raised in greeting.\n\n\u0022Gene, Valentina! Didn\u0027t expect you two on a Joolsday night.\u0022\n\n\u0022Hi guys!\u0022\n\n\u0022*Privyet Valentina!*\u0022\n\n\u0022Did you touch my capsule? You better not have touched my capsule.\u0022\n\n\u0022Nice to see you too, Burdous,\u0022 Gene rolled his eyes, then sat and replied to Edmund, \u0022bit of a long day. Don\u0027t plan to stay for the festivities, thought our friend here could use a drink, too.\u0022\n\n\u0022What... is it?\u0022 Valentina said absently as she lifted the glass, watching the green fog drift down over her fingers. \n\n\u0022I\u0027ve found it best not to ask,\u0022 said Jerdous cautiously, \u0022it\u0027s not alcohol, but beyond that... heck, I\u0027m the scientist and *I* can\u0027t even figure it out.\u0022 This brought a round of laughter from the others, except Burdous, who had gone from scowling to glowering. \n\nValentina shrugged, then took a sip from the bubbling glass. It was... well no, it was more like... actually sort of... no, not that either, perhaps... no, certainly not that... maybe... no...\n\n\u0022Kinda just blows your mind, doesn\u0027t it?\u0022 Jorrigh grinned.\n\n\u0022I... I do not have words, in any laguage...\u0022 she trailed off. It certainly was *not* liquor, that much was sure, and certainly *was* quite good, even of the fog made her want to sneeze, but beyond that...\n\n\u0022Like *he* said,\u0022 Edmund nodded to Jerdous, \u0022probably best not to think about it too much. It hasn\u0027t harmed anyone yet, whatever Ol\u0027 Sam puts in it. Well probably not, it *is* always real dark in here.\u0022\n\nValentina sipped at her drink, still trying to comprehend the strange sensations. The fighter pilots must be here too, she noted, up on stage Tin Turkey was singing about an iron eagle and occasionally dodging flying bottles, it was very strange. Her eyes again drifted up to the singed, conical space capsule hanging above it. Was it perhaps from Sir Kerman\u0027s histroic flight? She asked the others about this. \n\n\u0022What, Chadvey\u0027s capsule?\u0022 Jerdous answered, \u0022oh no, the Royal Omork Museum and the Kerbsonian are still arguing over who gets to keep *that* one. It\u0027s getting pretty heated, actually.\u0022\n\n\u0022You can say that again,\u0022 Edmund only said once, \u0022might even come to blows. Maybe they\u0027ll sell tickets! Ever seen a couple of stuffy old nerds duke it out?\u0022\n\n\u0022Hey, I resemble that remark!\u0022 Jerdous shot back. \n\n\u0022I will *stab* you with this!\u0022 Burdous brandished a spoon. \n\nJorrigh just looked confused. \n\nEdmund chuckled, \u0022now I would certainly never accuse either of you of being stuffy. Or old.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yeah, you\u0027ve got that part locked up for all of us,\u0022 Jorrigh offered helpfully. \n\nEdmund opened his mouth. \n\nEdmund closed his mouth. \n\nValentina tried to conceal a giggle behind her glass. The setting was certainly strange, but at least the company was amusing. \n\n\u0022At any rate,\u0022 Gene finally said, \u0022that capsule pre-dates the KSA. It even predates the Kleptogart space program. It was the first craft to return living things from space. Well, technically. That poor squirrel was never the same. Or the rat. Or the fish. And then they got loose and--\u0022\n\nRoaring cheers from the crowd cut him off. Valentina frowned, there certainly were a *lot* of distractions in here. Perhaps that was the point?\n\n\u0022That\u0027s right, ladies and germs. You know what time it is!\u0022 The deejay chided over the speakers. A thundering rhythm began, as at every table, the gathered Kerbals began banging their glasses down and stamping their feet in time.\n\n*Boom-boom thud. Boom-boom thud. Boom-boom thud*.\n\nValentina\u0027s head whipped back and forth in confusion, then a chant joined in over the resounding cadence.\n\n**Trial by fire! Trial by fire! Trial by fire! Trial by fire!**\n\nAfter a moment, the chant died away into even louder cheers, punctuated by whistles, cat calls, and other exclamations that sounded very uncouth indeed. As Valentina craned her neck, a terrified-looking young cadet in blue appeared on the stage, her eyes wide with fright, clinging to the microphone like a lifeline. \n\n\u0022Ladies and gentlekerbs, please welcome to the stage.... oh you\u0027re going to *love* this.... put your hands together for Lolli Kerman!\u0022\n\nThe roar from the crowd was deafening now. At every table, even Valentina\u0027s own, an assortment of coins and bills piled into the center. \n\nShe spun around to the others, \u0022what... what are they going to do to that poor girl??\u0022\n\n\u0022What *in-deed*,\u0022 leered Burdous, wagging his eye... bulges in a most unsettling way, and earning himself a swift jab in the ribs from his brother. \n\nEdmund winked at her, then leaned back, cradling his slung arm, \u0022just watch...\u0022 A quick flick of his eyes... did he just share a glance with the bartender? Ol\u0027 Sam looked completely disinterested behind the bar, busily polishing a glass with the barest hint of a smile on his face. \n\nValentina could only stare helplessly at the trembling cadet. A slow jazz piano riff oozed from the speakers, tempering the howls of the audience only a hair. The cadet squeezed her eyes shut, raised the microphone, and took a deep breath...\n\n\u0022You had plenty money nineteen... twenty two... you let other Kerbelles make a... fool of you... why don\u0027t you do right... like some other Kerbs do?\u0022\n\nHer voice faltered for only a moment, then settled into a deep, sweet, rich tone like dark molasses. The howls and cat calls evaporated just as quickly. \n\n\u0022Now if you had prepared twenty... years ago... you wouldn\u0027t be a-wandering now from... door to door... why don\u0027t you do right... like some other Kerbs do?\u0022\n\nEvery pair of eyes in the room stared, transfixed. Every jaw hung open. Except Ol\u0027 Sam, who was widely smiling to himself in the back, polishing his glass. \n\n\u0022Get out of here... and... get me some money too...\u0022\n\nThe cadet\u0027s eyes were still screwed tightly shut, the microphone quivering in her grip, but she sang out full and warm and smooth, filling the room beyond the tinny sound of the speakers. \n\n\u0022Why don\u0027t you do right...\u0022 for just a moment her voice dipped down into throatiness and gravel, then soared up, hinting at a well of sheer power just barely tapped as the piano rose to a crescendo, \u0022like some Ker-heeeeeeeeeerbs...\u0022\n\nShe let the rest stretch for a breath before sliding into a single perfect, beautiful, fragile note that rang on and on and on while the piano flourished a half dozen more bars.\n\n\u0022...doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...?\u0022\n\nThe last vibrations of sound died away, the bar standing in utter silence, then the crowd exploded again into cheers and whistles louder than ever before, but, with a distinctly different tone. \n\n\u0022Wow...\u0022 Said Gene.\n\n\u0022Humuna...\u0022 Said Jerdous.\n\nJorrigh was clapping his hands ecstatically over his head, then stuck his fingers in his mouth and tried to whistle, but succeeded only in slobbering all over Burdous, who didn\u0027t seem to notice.  \n\nLolli Kerman, eyes still shut and grinning from ear to ear, hopped down from the stage and made her way to a table of other cadets, passing through a veritable gauntlet of other Kerbals slapping her outstretched hands or patting her on the back. Patting her *only* on the back, Valentina noted significantly. \n\n\u0022What just happened...?\u0022 She said distantly. \n\n\u0022Sort of a rite of passage around here,\u0022 Gene explained, \u0022they\u0027ll respect her now. All the new folks go through it sooner or later.\u0022\n\nNext to him, Edmund was also grinning from ear to ear as he gathered his winnings with his good arm, \u0022what\u0027d I tell you, boys? Always bet on the mousy ones.\u0022\n\n\u0022You cheated!\u0022 Shot a sneering and slightly damp Burdous. \n\n\u0022Did not.\u0022\n\n\u0022Did too!\u0022\n\n\u0022Did not!\u0022\n\n\u0022So help me, I will stab you with this!\u0022 Burdous waved a spoon at Edmund. \n\nEdmund opened his mouth, then his grin, incredibly, widened, \u0022well, lookie who\u0027s coming this way...\u0022\n\n\u0022Um... Miss Valentina?\u0022 Said a voice so high pitched it was nearly ultrasonic. Valentina turned to see a familiar pair of tightly shut eyes and an enormous, if nervous, smile. \n\n\u0022Ohwow... Um... you\u0027re such a role model to all us girls... you inspired all of us to join the space program here... um... could I please have your autograph?\u0022 Squeaked Lolli Kerman, holding out a book in her still-trembling hands. \n\nValentina felt her cheeks flush just a bit, \u0022*D\u0414*, yes, of course. I am honored.\u0022 She took the book and pen. \n\nAbout this time, Burdous leaned across the table, doing that... *thing* with his eye... bulges again. \n\n\u0022So, *Lolli* Kerman is it?\u0022 He leered, \u0022can I have a--*gak!*\u0022\n\nLolli Kerman had reached over the table, grabbed him by the *tongue*, and pulled him halfway across with it, \u0022finish that sentence and I\u0027ll rip your tongue out and strangle you with it, mmkay?\u0022 The bright, friendly smile on her face never changed. \n\nBurdous emphatically nodded assent, making a variety of choking noises. \n\n\u0022Awesome sauce!\u0022 She squealed, wagging her head back and forth in time. She released Burdous\u0027s tongue, grimaced at her hand, then wiped it off on his hair. Speechless, Valentina handed her back the signed book.\n\n\u0022Oh thanks eversomuch, teehee!\u0022 Lolli Kerman cheeped, then scampered off back to her table. \n\nThe Kerbonauts could only stare in wonder, except for Edmund, who chuckled as he counted his winnings, \u0022yup, she\u0027ll do *just* fine around here.\u0022\n\n\u0022Wow.\u0022 Said Jerdous absently. \n\n\u0022I ink I in uth,\u0022 said his brother. Jerdous sighed, and pulled him off the table back into his seat, then jabbed him in the ribs again. \n\nGene put a hand to his face, \u0022Burd, as your boss I think should advise you that your accidental death and dismemberment policy will *not* cover *that*.\u0022\n\n\u0022I \u0027on\u0027t \u0027are.\u0022\n\nJerdous jabbed his brother yet again, \u0022and pull your tongue back in, you creep.\u0022\n\n\u0022Pthbthbthbthb,\u0022 said Burdous. \n\nValentina had a hand to her mouth trying to contain a roiling giggle fit, when, quite suddenly, all the mirth drained away. She whipped her head around, looking off towards... what? Anxiety. Fear. Rejection. *That* way. It almost felt like... no. No, whatever it was vanished as quickly as it had arrived. \n\n\u0022Valentina?\u0022 Jorrigh asked with concern, \u0022you ok? You just got really pale.\u0022\n\n\u0022I... I am fine, I...\u0022 Deep in her gut, something burbled unpleasantly, \u0022um, where is... how you say, little Kerb\u0027s room?\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, it\u0027s that way,\u0022 he pointed, \u0022by the big propeller.\u0022\n\n\u0022Er, no,\u0022 Edmund interjected, \u0022you\u0027ll want the *other* one, next to the pressure suit.\u0022\n\n\u0022Thank you,\u0022 she said, rising quickly, her stomach spasming, \u0022I will--oof!\u0022\n\nThe impact knocked her backwards a step, and sent someone else reeling onto another table, smashing it into kindling.\n\n\u0022Sorry! Sorry! Excuse, please--\u0022\n\n\u0022Watch where you\u0027re going, Ooski!\u0022 D.N. hauled himself up from the floor and stalked towards Valentina, \u0022are you flarping *blind?!*\u0022\n\nIn an instant, Edmund was between them, stopping the enraged Kerbal with a hand on his chest, \u0022easy now, Dean, it was an accident.\u0022\n\nD.N. looked down at the hand, then glared back at Edmund \u0022get your hand off me, old man!\u0022 He tried to push past but got nowhere. \n\n\u0022Old man?! You\u0027re like five years younger than me!\u0022 Edmund growled, \u0022you need to *back* it up a notch, son.\u0022\n\n\u0022Move your hand or *I\u0027ll* move it!\u0022 D.N. snarled back, \u0022right now you\u0027re ego\u0027s writing checks--\u0022\n\n\u0022Your body can\u0027t cash?\u0022 Waterfowl offered helpfully. \n\nThey both spun to him, \u0022^N^\u003Csub\u003EN\u003C/sub\u003E^O^\u003Csub\u003EO\u003C/sub\u003E^!^\u003Csub\u003E!\u003C/sub\u003E\u0022\n\n\u0022Gentlekerbs, gentlekerbs,\u0022 Gene stepped in with placating hands, \u0022let\u0027s all calm down now...\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s head snapped back and forth between the other two, \u0022uh, please, is my fault, very sorry--\u0022\n\n\u0022Box his ears, Ed!\u0022 Burdous yelled out.\n\n\u0022like to see you try!\u0022 D.N. slapped the hand away.\n\nEdmund chortled, \u0022son, I could *still* whoop you with one arm tied behind my back.\u0022 \n\nHe shrugged his shoulder and swung his slung arm behind him, \u0022just so happens I have one, too!\u0022\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t let him talk to you like that, Dean!\u0022 Shouted Garter Snake. \n\nJerdous slammed a hand down on the table, \u0022clobber that little d--ouch, my shin!\u0022\n\n\u0022Gentlekerbs, *please!*\u0022 Gene begged. \n\n\u0022My fault! Is my fault!\u0022 Valentina pleaded. \n\nD.N. shoved Edmund, \u0022come at me, bro!\u0022\n\nEdmund shoved him back, \u0022you stuck up little midget!\u0022\n\n\u0022Geriatric never-was!\u0022\n\n\u0022Pedantic dwarf!\u0022\n\n\u0022Geezer!\u0022\n\n\u0022Pipsqueak!\u0022\n\n\u0022YOUR MOTHER!\u0022\n\n\u0022BAR FIGHT!\u0022 someone in the back yelled, grabbed a bottle, and smashed it over the head of the nearest Kerbal. And then, well, all hell broke loose. \n\nValentina was roughly shoved to the ground as the entire room instantly dissolved into chaos. Various appendages flew this way and that, the table next to her was shattered by two people busily pummeling each other. Cries and screams filled the air. She was too shocked to move, could only dodge fists and kicks luckily meant for others. A hand closed around her shoulder, and she spun around, her own fist raised in defense, only to find Jorrigh\u0027s face grinning at her. \n\n\u0022Wow, rough night, eh?\u0022 He said. \n\n\u0022What... what in *P\u0426TI\u0419S \u042C\u0414LD P\u0414T\u0417* just happened?!\u0022\n\n\u0022Usual Joolsday night bar fight,\u0022 he shrugged, \u0022although it is kinda early. We should prolly scoot before it gets *real* ugly.\u0022\n\nHe pointed behind her, \u0022door\u0027s that way. Stay low and keep your head down. Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ve got your back.\u0022 He smiled brightly. \n\nWith no other obvious course of action, Valentina did as he said, crawling on her hands and knees past demolished furniture and brawling Kerbals. The sound system was thumping out something about a barroom blitz. Or maybe it was ballroom. She couldn\u0027t tell over the din around her. \n\n\u0022Oh! Ai! Not the face! Not the face!\u0022 \n\n\u0022Keep going, were almost there,\u0022 Jorrigh said behind her, \u0022just to the left.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ow! Not *there* either!\u0022\n\nSplinters of a smashed chair rained down on her, \u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022No, your other left!\u0022\n\n\u0022Which way?\u0022\n\n\u0022That way!\u0022\n\n\u0022This way?\u0022 \n\n\u0022No, the other way!\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\nConfused, Valentina stuck her head up to try and get bearings, only to have a bottle smashed over it. She slapped a hand to the wound, cringing against---\n\nThat... didn\u0027t hurt?\n\nShe picked up the broken bottle neck. It looked just like glass, but when she gave it a firm squeeze, it crumbled into harmless little rounded bits. She gaped back at Jorrigh. \n\n\u0022Sugar glass!\u0022 He grinned, \u0022you didn\u0027t think we used *real* bottles, did you? That could really hurt someone!\u0022\n\nValentina rolled her eyes, this night was already far too weird to go on questioning. The two crawled their way through the rest of the pandemonium, finally reaching the stairs and gingerly squeezing past two Kerbals taking turns slamming each other\u0027s heads against them, then escaped into the muggy night air. \n\n\u0022Don\u0027t stop yet!\u0022 Jorrigh called, pointing to the south where dozens of flashing blue were bearing down from the sky, \u0022cops incoming!\u0022 \n\nThe pair sprinted off towards the space center proper, finally ducking behind a large spherical propellant tank. \n\n\u0022The police,\u0022 Valentina panted, leaning back against a girder, \u0022will they... will they take them all away?\u0022\n\n\u0022Huh? Naw, they\u0027ll just taze one or two and the rest will scatter,\u0022 huffed Jorrigh, \u0022but they\u0027re probably pretty miffed about their chess game getting interrupted.\u0022\n\nValentina turned and looked back towards the bar. Dark figures with raised truncheons were rushing into the doorway from the scattering of VTOLS now surrounding the lot. \u0022Don\u0027t taze me, bro!\u0022 Actinic blue light flickered in the darkened entrance for a moment, \u0022aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!\u0022 then many more figures began steaming out of a half dozen other exits like enraged ants.\n\nShe looked back to Jorrigh, \u0022you... do this often?\u0022\n\n\u0022Every week.\u0022\n\n\u0022But the bar... the damage...?\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, it\u0027s all old movie props, more breakaway stuff. Ol\u0027 Sam keeps the important things locked down,\u0022 he smiled back in the dim light, \u0022he\u0027ll have it ship shape again by morning.\u0022\n\n\u0022You are all quite mad.\u0022\n\nJorrigh scratched at his cheek thoughtfully, \u0022well... we can\u0027t drink on post, so I guess someone figured out that beating the tar out of each other every week has pretty much the same effect, right down to the headache the next day.\u0022\n\nShe leaned her head back against the metal beam, wondering if he could see her eyes roll in the dark. But... there was a certain kind of sense to it. Even if--\n\nValentina gasped, and spun her head around. There, right *there*. Off in the direction of the Kerbonaut center. Sadness. Such crushing sadness. But... the feeling... it was... \n\nAgain, the strange sensation evaporated. \n\n\u0022Miss V?\u0022 Jorrigh stepped closer, \u0022you all right?\u0022\n\n\u0022Miss V?\u0022 She raised an eye... bulge at him. Jorrigh just shrugged and grinned again.\n\nValentina shut her eyes, and leaned back again, \u0022I am just tired. Such strange people...\u0022\n\n\u0022Hmm, you should probably go get some rest then, you\u0027ll be fine from here. I better go see if anyone needs help limping back.\u0022\n\nShe smiled at him, \u0022yes, rest sounds nice. You are a good Kerb, Jorrigh Kerman.\u0022\n\nHe waved, and trotted back off towards the bar. She watched him for a moment, then began walking back to the Kerbonaut center herself, her mind still reeling over the night\u0027s events. That strange feeling... that little ball of emotion... \n\nBah, probably just her imagination, or whatever was in that drink. Just as well too. The feelings... they felt like they weren\u0027t even *hers*.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-27T08:40:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2016 08:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-27T21:43:19Z","Content":"\u0022At any rate,\u0022 Gene finally said, \u0022that capsule pre-dates the KSA.
