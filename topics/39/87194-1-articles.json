It\u0027s me again, the dragon guy. This time I\u0027m going to tell you the tragic tale of the bumblebee who wanted to go to the Mun but couldn\u0027t, because his friends wouldn\u0027t let him.

However, I then felt that it would be better off without one, so I decided to just make it an independent video instead, with the special bumblebee as the main character.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made this just for fun.
