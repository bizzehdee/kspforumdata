Then I started to wander the Twitch streams and saw everyone was streaming in english..., and I though: well, it\u0027s a game made by (mostly I think) people who speak spanish, there must be spanish people around, and they might enjoy it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possibility is just stream in english and have some fun in the process=)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
