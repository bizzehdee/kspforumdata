I am open to suggestions for mods and missions and i may post my .craft files for download if there is enough interest. Mechjeb will fly most flights, I am no killer pilot and all of these missions-except certain landings perhaps, were computer flown to an extent at least. i will simulate closed and open loop guidance in certain ways (discussed later)\n\nI am currently building up the KSP build so that i can run right through my mission list. where possible missions will be launch on their \u0022real date\u0022 using info from the Real Solar System Wiki (which i hopefully plan to use) with day 1 as the 1st of January 1951.\n\nMajor Mission Screenshots will be posted here for you all to see ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Mission List (WIP)**\n\nSputnik 1 \n\nExplorer 1\n\nVostok Program\n\nMercury Program\n\nGemini Program\n\nLuna Program\n\nLunokhods\n\nSoyuz Program\n\nApollo Program\n\nSpace Shuttle Program\n\nGPS Satellites \n\nISS\n\nall three mars rover missions\n\n**Mod List (WIP)**\n\nRealism Overhaul \u002B\n\nRealfuels (depending on compatibility)\n\nMechjeb 2\n\nFASA\n\nLaztek SpaceX\n\nCommunity ISS\n\nProbably Component Space Shuttle\n\nBobcats Mods (most)\n\nLionhead\u0027s ESA pack\n\nCommunity ISS\n\nScanSat\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-19T13:10:39Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2015 01:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by dbandy13**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T14:00:28Z","Content":"Mulbin did a stock one but didn\u0027t progress beyond 1959 if I\u0027m not mistaken- I\u0022d like to see this!"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T15:19:59Z","Content":"Looks interesting.
