After an uneventful trip to Mun orbit, the next step was to get the crew over to the lander. Again it was time for a little space walking, for the the intrepid pair of Jeb and Bob. With that done it was time to detach the lander and head for the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs this was the first attempt at this, it wasn\u0027t known how much fuel this was going to use, so the plan was head was a landing and if the descent stage ran out on the way down, to detach it and head back to orbit (hopefully) using the ascent stage. Fortunately this abort measure back to orbit wasn\u0027t necessary, although the descent stage only had about 5% fuel remaining on touchdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollowing the nerve wracking first landing on a body other than Kerbin, Jeb took to the ladder of the lander to descend to the surface, pausing momentarily at the foot of it, to think of something momentous to say when stepping onto the surface. However with nothing coming to mind (he\u0027s a do\u0027er rather than a talker) he leapt of the ladder and planted the first pair of Kerbal boots on the Mun. Shortly after Bob joined him on the surface and Jeb erected the flag, only to find that some idiot had packed the flag backwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter experimenting with moving around in the low gravity of the Mun (ok... havng fun jumping around) Jeb and Bob returned to the lander, Bob grabbing a few rocks to make a few bucks... er, for scientific study before he did so. With the pair safely inside, the ascent stage engine was fired to carry them back into orbit, for a rendezvous with Bill in the command module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith docking made, the lander\u0027s engine was fired up to start the burn back Kerbin and when the fuel in that was depleted, the docked vehicles were swung around to complete the burn with the command module engine. It was later noted that detaching the lander before firing up the command module engine would have been a lot more efficient, but the guys in mission control were too busy partying, so didn\u0027t get around to giving the crew the instruction to detach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally after many hours traveling back to Kerbin, the capsule was detached from the rest of the vehicle before re-entry was made, followed by a splash down in the seas of Kerbin, some distance east of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-12T18:40:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2017 06:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by purpleivan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ozymandias_the_Goat","CreatedById":159377,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T20:05:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Memories...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpleivan","CreatedById":120081,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-19T05:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027, courier, monospace;\u0022\u003E\u0022For a moment I thought he had bought it\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027, courier, monospace;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E- Bill Kerman - \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E04 A roving we will go\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther ipsEmbeddedOther_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://imgur.com/a/hRR3w\u0022 style=\u0022height:519px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving made a it successfully to the Mun and back on their first attempt, the KSP decided on an all round upgrade to the package that they would send to there next. The first change was to use a single vehicle to travel from Kerbin to the Mun and back, as Jeb had been complaining that docking was \u0022sooo booorrring\u0022. The seconds was to equip the it with a rover, so that the kerbonauts could travel further from their landing site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving made it to Mun orbit, the only thing left to do was to land. As Jeb had come close to depleting the descent stage of the lander on his previous trip to Mun, he decided to leave kill a lot of his speed very late in the descent, something which caused Bob to get more than a little anxious. However he needn\u0027t have worried, as Jeb brought the vehicle down to a smooth touchdown, not far from the 1st landing site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Jeb had encountered difficulties with the flag (he claimed it had been packed backwards) he decided not bother placing one this trip, also he was eager to get his hands on his new toy, the Mun rover. With the little four wheeled vehicle disconnected from their spacecraft, the two of them set out across the dusty surface, a big plume of which was kicked up as Jeb floored it pulling away from their landing site. Bob started to get the jitters and told Jeb that just because he was a pilot, didn\u0027t mean that he had to get airborne, something that was highly likely with the combination of rough terrain and low gravity. Jeb\u0027s response was to aim the rover for the nearest hump in the ground, to send it a good metre or so into the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a short but bumpy ride they arrived at Jeb\u0027s previous landing site. Bob had given Bill instructions to Bob to retrieve some parts from the descent stage that had been left there, to see how extended exposure to Mun conditions had affected them. While he did this, Jeb went over to the flag he had placed a few weeks earlier. To his suprise he found that the Kerbal Space Program logo was now the right way round. He then quickly darted his gaze from horizon to horizon, looking for someone how might have switched it round and muttered something about aliens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parts collected from the lander, the pair set off back to their own vehicle, with Jeb avoiding more of the bumps than on the outward leg of their journey, much to Bil\u0027s appreciation.

The first few visiting crews were launched with an obscene amount of monopropellant, due to the difficulties their pilots were having in docking with the station. This was later reduced, as the pilots became more experienced in art of docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOriginally the station was nothing more than a single habitation module, plus a small fairly small fuel storage tank, included as a precaution against visiting crews being stranded by using all their fuel on the way to it. Later the expansion of the station was mostly in the form of even more fuel, much more, several bright orange Rockomax Jumbo-64\u0027s being lofted to it over several flights. Some complaints were made in the press about all that fuel being hoisted up there and no use being made of it. The KSP did have plans for it, but was keeping its cards close to it\u0027s chest with these. So to assuage the press they sent up the new PPD-12 Cupola module, that gave a great view from the station, much more so than the little portholes on the habitation module. This allowed them to get some great photos to hand to the press as something shiny to splash on their front pages, although there was some embarrasment later, when it was found that some of the photos included post-it-notes that kerbonauts were in the habit of leaving in their modules, some of which didn\u0027t show the KSP and its crews, to be the slick organised outfit they presented themselves as.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E06 A trip to the big cheese\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther ipsEmbeddedOther_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://imgur.com/a/d6zlT\u0022 style=\u0022height:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving conquered the Mun (if two landings counts as conquering) the KSP set their sights on its little brother Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this trip a new vehicle configuration was put together, that made use of the trusty \u0022Terrier\u0022 engines attached to a vehicle that serve as both lander and a return vehicle to Kerbin. However instead of using these engines as the means to propel the spacecraft to Minmus, a large fuel stage with a suitable large \u0022Skipper\u0022 engine attached to it (previously only used in launcher stages to Kerbin orbit) was used instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the vehicle arrived in Minmus orbit with a large part of the transit stages\u0027 fuel remaining, it was decided to use that big engine for most of the descent to the surface, to preserve as much fuel as possible on the lander for the return to orbit and later back to Kerbin. Jeb, accompanied this time once more by Bob, used that big engine to ease the vehicle down towards the surface. With so much fuel thrust at his disposal, Jeb was tempted to \u0022gun it for the horizon and see what happened\u0022, but thankfully he decided to follow the mission plan and continue the descent towards the pale green surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith less than 100m to go before arriving on the surface, the Skipper stage was detached and the four engines of the lander brought to life, to slow the vehicles for the final part of the descent. The detached stage drifted down towards the surface, to be greeted not by firery explosive death, but a dull thud (if one could be heard) much to Jeb\u0027s annoyance, who had been looking forward to a good fireworks display.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith landing achieved, the only thing left to do was to head out the hatch and check out what this little green world had to offer. In short, it offered massive jumps. Both Jeb and Bill entertained themselves for far more time than the controllers back at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E were happy with, bouncing up and down in the very low gravity of the strange green moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven the low gravity that they encountered here, Jeb decided to use his jetpack to propel himself a couple of kilometres west to a large flat area of terrain that they had spotted on the way down to the surface, unfortunately for him, he uncharacteristically misjudged the speed he was moving at across the surface when he came back in contact with it, following his 2km hop. The result was a long and painfull roll across the green terrain, before coming to rest just before reaching the flat area that had been his goal.

After a journey of 270 days the Duna Explorer arrived at the red planet, only to discover that \u0022some bozo\u0022 (Bob\u0027s words) had only calculated the fuel required for the outward trip, so the pair arrived their with almost empty tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo fix this another transfer vehicle was dispatched to Duna, which would provide sufficient fuel for both the landing and the trip home.

As had become the norm, a by the numbers departure burn from Kerbin to (you name it) was immediately followed by the realisation that there was way too little fuel remaining for a landing and the trip home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis \u0022shocking\u0022 realisation was first made by the mission\u0027s pilot Yermin Kerman, after putting the Moho Express in a comfortable 20km orbit of their destination. Noticing that the fuel gauge looked to be showing an reading of nearly empty, he gave the gauge a quick flick with his stubby index finger, then when it didn\u0027t budge, a good whack with his fist.

This was done in short order, but on arrival at Moho, it was realised that although there was sufficient fuel to almost top up the tanks on the lander, there was nowhere near enough to bring them home again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce a third transfer vehicle arrived at the toasty little world, the lander was filled brim full of fuel and separated from its propellant filled benefactor and headed to the surface. Fortunately getting to the surface was a straightforward task, that had Yermin commenting that \u0022we\u0027re making this flying to other planets thing look easy\u0022. However this was a statement he would come to regret, when on his next mission, that would take him out to chilly Eeloo, a serious design flaw stranded the transfer vehicle in Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYermin and Rolley ventured out onto the surface of Moho, which Rolley described as being like chocolate syrup on an ice cream cone (a strange analogy given their proximity to the nuclear inferno that lit the system) they set to work collecting surface samples and making some observations of Kerbol, \u0022it\u0027s big and it\u0027s bright\u0022 was about the sum of their report.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust before returning to the lander, Yermin insisted on going through his entire repertoire of \u0022knock knock\u0022 jokes.

On entering the capsule, they found it to be 1/2 a metre deep in the stuff. The combination of the jokes and the several hours they had to spend cleaning up Yermin\u0027s favourite snack, set Rolley in a foul mood for the return trip, vowing never to join the \u0022that nutjob\u0022 on any future missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving waited for the desired launch window for the return to Kerbin, the transfer vehicles engines climbed out of the depths of Kerbols\u0027 gravity well, pushing their little lander along with it.

Transferring fuel manually to the small FL-T200 tanks, Yermin and Bob put the vehicle into a circular orbit of Kerbin and waited for the arrival of a replacement transfer vehicle. Once docked with their new ride to Eeloo, an improved model with more fuel, just in case it was required, they set off again for their icy destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a thankfully uneventful trip to Eeloo, Yermin and Bob detached their lander and descended to the surface, deciding not to test the vessels lights system, but instead to pick a nice safe daytime landing site, in case their lander\u0027s nickname decided to take a bite out of them again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce on the surface, even Yermin had to admit it was interesting to stand on the surface, look into the sky and know that all the other planets of their system were \u0022roughly that way\u0022. After a bit more of his bar room philosophising, Yermin joined Bob in collecting samples, before heading back into orbit for a rendezvous with the transfer vehicle. After the longest \u0022wait for the window\u0022 time in KSP history, the two travellers lit up the transfer vehicle\u0027s engines to begin their journey home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn arrival back in Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, one last snag was to hit their mission, when it was realised that even the additional fuel of their replacement transfer vehicle was not going to be enough to get them into low orbit. So the newly constructed orbital rescue vehicle was sent out to refuel their craft, allowing it to rendezvous with KOS. On disembarking to the station, one of it\u0027s crew decided to play a misguided prank on the much travelled Yermin and told him that he had to report immediately for a mission to Eve.

But it wasn\u0027t long before he yearned to get back at the pointy end of a series of slow explosions once more, so he was named as the commander of the KSP\u0027s first Munar base, that was due to blast off from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E a few days before New Year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was launched by the largest vehicle constructed by the engineers of the KSP to date and with Jeb at the controls, the huge vehicle (by the standards of the day) made a smooth landing in the equatorial region of the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPublicly the mission of the base was to further research into the origins of the Mun and to test new hardware, however it had another, far from public one, which was to investigate some anomalous readings that had been made by satellites in orbit. The base was to act as home for a wheeled lander vehicle that would in the coming weeks be sent to various locations on the Mun\u0027s surface to investigate these anomalies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShortly after the arrival of the base, a lander, that had secretly been waiting for it in Mun orbit, descended to meet with it on the surface. the main purpose of the base with respect to its clandestine mission, was to keep the lander supplied with fuel for the multiple trips it was due to take to disparate parts of the Mun, in its investigation of the anomalies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore the lander was due to depart, New Years Eve came round and in keeping with tradition, the crew of the base held a party to celebrate. With the party in full swing, it was discovered that one of the the fuel tanks had been \u0022accidentally\u0022 filled with alcohol, rather than regular propellant. With this discovery made, the contents of the tank was soon vented into the largest punch bowl shaped containers the crew could find (a row of helmets on the dining area table) to be joined by a large quantity of prune juice, to soften it up a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe end results were inevitable, with the entire crew waking after their sleep period, suffering from \u0022the sting of the Kraken\u0022 and finding evidence of the by now forgotten events of the celebrations. The entire base was leaning to one side, as one the the large wheels that supported it had been been broken as a result of the \u0022coming in hot\u0022 game, they\u0027d engaged in the night before, that had kerbal after kerbal, jamming on a prune punch filled helmet, then leaplng across the dining area table, sliding its length, and crashing into the opposite wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother sign of the revelry, was that the super secret lander, instead of being parked next to the base, was now in a small crater some 2km away surrounded by a set of complex geometric shapes carved in the munar dust, along with some string and a couple of planks of wood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the base leaning at an uncomfortable angle, the most junior of the crew, Pilby Kerman was given the job of going outside to fix the wheel and retrieving the lander. Of course that meant the unpleasant task of jamming on one of the sticky helmets that had been used as a punch bowl the night before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the wheel was fixed and the base righted, it was only a few hours until the arrival of the first tanker vehicle from Kerbin. These took the form of a Jumbo-64 with wheels attached at each end, to allow it to be driven across the surface to dock with the base to offload its supply of fuel. As its landing was handled remotely from Kerbin, the less than stellar state of the bases\u0027 crew wasn\u0027t an issue, but once on the surface, they had to take control for the delicate task of bringing it next to and docking with the base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite the (more than) slightly the worse for wear state of the crew, the tanker was brought in a nice straight line towards the docking port, but instead of slowing in the last few seconds before making contact, to give a nice soft dock, the tanker was given a sudden burst of speed, the docking ports slamming together, damaging that of the tanker beyond repair. To make matters worse there was a dull thud heard through the structure of the base, followed by a familiar leaning to one side, leaving Pilby to jam on that prune soaked helmet once more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb decided that as base commander it was his responsibility to explain the situation to the team at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and suffer the consequences, so without a moments hesitation, he flicked on the communication circuit to Kerbin and informed them that the tanker\u0027s docking port was irreparably damaged, probably due to vibration during launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith his record clean, if not his conscience, Jeb waited for the replacement tanker to arrive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-12T18:14:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2017 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by purpleivan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpleivan","CreatedById":120081,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T13:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 5\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027, courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EDue to this report containing highly classified images of a number of anomalies on the surface of the Mun, those without K12 clearance, or of a nervous disposition should leave the room now.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027, courier, monospace;\u0022\u003E- From recently declassified meeting minutes -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E13 Anomalous readings\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022eVxjXGz.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eVxjXGz.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal;\u0022\u003E\nWeeks before their munar base was launched, a scientific satellite in Mun orbit provided strange data at a number of locations on the surface.
