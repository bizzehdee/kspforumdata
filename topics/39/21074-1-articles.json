It was the main ascent stage separating. This did not startle Geofard Kerman, the pilot, because he had been on many spacecraft before. In fact, he was the first Kerbal to set foot on the Mun. The thing that startled him was the fact a strange; high- pitched sound followed the separation. It stopped shortly after and he decided to not tell Mission Control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When he had confirmation of reaching Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI, the sound appeared again. This time he couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t ignore it. He told Mission Control he was going outside the spacecraft to check on the solar panels because one of the gauges was low. It was low, but that was not the reason he went outside. When he was outside he looked at where the stage had separated and surely enough there was a decoupler still stuck on that should have decoupled. He had to manually separate it from the craft so when he reached Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI the engine would fire properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The first attempt was worthless, and the decoupler didn\u0027t even budge. The second one was different however. When he got it off there was a black blob on the engine, he suspected it shouldn\u0027t be there so he asked Mission Control what it was and they said they had no idea. He was told not to touch it. Geofard could not resist so he tried to take it off. That was his biggest mistake. All of a sudden the engine made a fizzing noise and disappeared. Then the other two did the same thing. The only engine left were the back-ups but that was barely enough to make it back home. Mission Control saw the engine failures and asked Geofard what had happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The signal with Geofard started weakening and they couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t understand what he was saying. They asked him to repeat what he said but they never got a response. They looked onto the main hull cam which was supposed to take pictures every five seconds and they saw Geofard spinning away from the craft and a scream was on his face. Then it went black.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A hero was lost that day, and he will forever be remembered. He is still with us, but in a way many wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t expect. Another craft was sent to Duna (Geo-Duna-2), the pilot being Jebidiah Kerman, a well-known Kerbal. The mission was successful and he returned safely. They celebrated his return, but one thing they never forgot was Geofard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the photos from the main hull cam:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.makeagif.com/rITanv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://makeagif.com/media/10-01-2012/rITanv.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022rITanv.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst writing I\u0027ve ever done for KSP!
