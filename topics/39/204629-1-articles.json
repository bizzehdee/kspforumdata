Also try filling the wings with fuel, push the utilisation up (it defaults to 1% but can go much higher) and you\u2019ll get a lot more burn time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jomica_YT","CreatedById":172571,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-16T15:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome, thanks for the tips!

It\u2019s also a good idea to add parachutes to your rocketplanes for landing,\u00A0including one on the back of the cockpit to act as an ejector system if everything goes wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-22T19:18:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this still going?
