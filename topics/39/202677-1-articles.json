I thought it turned out pretty well. Really shows how the landmass is actually connected as one big continent.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis map is mostly for things like showing territories on a map or feeding into\u00A0game map generators or maybe drawing movement of long journeys with a rover or whatnot. Sort of like an AuthaGraphic map although the projection is not the same as an AuthaGraphic map but is more like a close cousin of the Gall-Peterson projection. This does mean it\u0027s a bit more distorted than AuthaGraphic, especially at the top and bottom edge where the distortion of shape quickly approaches infinity, but it\u0027s also easier to understand where that distortion actually is.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022owCef08.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/owCef08.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-25T22:49:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2021 10:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
